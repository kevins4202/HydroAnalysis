15885,microplastics are the particulate plastic debris found almost everywhere as environmental contaminants they are not chemically stable persistent pollutants but reactive materials in fact synthetic polymers exposed to the environment undergo chemical and physical degradation processes which lead not only to mechanical but also molecular fragmentation releasing compounds that are potentially harmful for the environment and human health we carried out accelerated photo oxidative ageing of four reference microplastics low and high density polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene directly in artificial seawater we then made a characterization at the molecular level along with a quantification of the chemical species leached into water gas chromatography mass spectrometry analyses performed after selective extraction and derivatization enabled us to identify more than 60 different compounds analysis of the leachates from the three polyolefins revealed that the main degradation products were mono and dicarboxylic acids along with linear and branched hydroxy acids the highest amount of leached degradation species was observed for polystyrene with benzoic acid and phenol derivatives as the most abundant along with oligomeric styrene derivatives the results from reference microplastics were then compared with those obtained by analyzing leachates in artificial seawater from aged plastic debris collected in a natural environment the differences observed between the reference and the environmental plastic leachates mainly concerned the relative abundances of the chemical species detected with the environmental samples showing higher amounts of dicarboxylic acids and oxidized species graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

global environmental threat due to plastic pollution derraik 2002 geyer et al 2017 shahul hamid et al 2018 pollution by microplastics mps has been detected in all the main environmental compartments and the associated threats to the environment and human health have been the focus of intense social scientific and political debate betts 2008 derraik 2002 geyer et al 2017 shahul hamid et al 2018 most studies on microplastics have focused on the detection identification and quantification of these polymer particles and only recently have some authors started investigating such materials in terms of them being dynamic systems wang et al 2020 yu et al 2021 in fact synthetic polymers exposed to the environment undergo chemical and physical degradation processes these lead not only to mechanical but also molecular fragmentation and degradation into secondary microplastics with the generation of low molecular weight species that are either leached into the surrounding water capolupo et al 2020 luo et al 2022 sait et al 2021 wang et al 2020 or released as volatile degradation products la nasa et al 2021 lomonaco et al 2020 these low molecular weight species are typically oxidized such as mono and multifunctional carboxylic acids carbonyl aldehydes ketones and hydroxy derivatives alkenes heterocyclic and aromatic compounds depending on the polymer type from which they originate mps should thus not be considered simply as hazardous physical materials interacting with biota only as a result of ingestion and possibly internalization across the walls of the gastrointestinal tract in fact the potential toxicity of the reactive mp surface and of the low molecular species deriving from such degraded mps is still poorly understood most previous studies on the molecular species associated with mps have been limited to their leaching of plastic additives such as antioxidants flame retardants and plasticizers and to their role as concentrators and carriers of environmentally persistent organic pollutants cole et al 2011 yu et al 2021 there is an urgent need for studies on the potential harm of the oxidation degradation products that can leach out from plastic debris dispersed into the environment capolupo et al 2021 liu et al 2021 sait et al 2021 in this work we performed accelerated photo oxidative ageing on a set of reference mps in artificial seawater in order to carry out a semi quantitative analysis of the chemical species leached out as water soluble low molecular weight degradation products four different hydrocarbon polymers in the form of micronized powders were used as the reference mps low density polyethylene ldpe high density polyethylene hdpe polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps the oxidation products generated and leached out as a result of the ageing were sequentially extracted from the artificial seawater using two different organic solvents and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry the results obtained from the reference mps were then compared with those obtained from environmentally aged plastics for this purpose small plastic debris sampled from a beach were sieved down to 2 mm placed in artificial seawater treated in an ultrasonic bath to trigger the release of low molecular weight species then extracted from the artificial seawater and analyzed in the same way as the previous samples the products detected in the artificial seawater were then classified based on their toxicity according to the most recent literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reference

features and quality control semi quantitative analyses were performed using the calibration curves of palmitic acid for monocarboxylic acids azelaic acid for dicarboxylic acids and benzoic acid for the styrene oxidation products the procedural blank was obtained by loading a quartz tube with artificial seawater only and subjecting it to accelerated ageing the limits of quantitation loqs were calculated from triplicates of the areas integrated for the procedural blank and the slopes of the calibration curves according to the ich guidelines the lods were 0 031 ppm for palmitic acid 0 027 ppm for azelaic acid and 0 040 ppm for benzoic acid while the loqs were 0 09 ppm 0 085 ppm and 0 120 ppm respectively full details on the validation method are reported in table s 1 in the supporting information the concentrations ppm were calculated from the total amount of artificial seawater 5 ml in which the polymers were artificially aged lastly control water solutions were prepared by adding 5 ml of artificial seawater to vials containing 1 5 g of each reference polymer hdpe ldpe pp ps and storing the vials in the dark at room temperature for two weeks the solutions were then treated with the same extraction procedure used for the aged polymers and the extracts were analyzed the chemical species detected and identified were considered as procedural blanks for the subsequent qualitative analyses in order to pinpoint the chemical species specifically generated during the accelerated ageing quantitative analysis of plasticizers was also performed on the leachates of the environmental microplastics the lods and loqs of the method were evaluated for the same solution used for the evaluation of palmitic azelaic and benzoic acids the lods were lower than 0 031 ppm while the loqs were lower than 0 090 ppm full details are reported in table s 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of artificially aged microplastics the organic extracts of the water soluble fraction or seawater organic leachate hereafter sol from each of the four samples of micronized virgin hdpe ldpe pp and ps in artificial seawater plus a blank seawater sample all of which had been artificially aged for two weeks in a solarbox to induce accelerated photo oxidative degradation were analyzed by gc ms control solutions consisting of the same four micronized virgin polymers in artificial seawater aged two weeks in the dark were also analyzed as reference systems the chromatograms of the sol from the photo aged pp ldpe and ps are shown in fig 1 while the main oxidation products identified are listed in table 1 with their respective concentrations none of these substances were detected in the chromatograms of the sol from the control solutions indicating that these species were actually the products of photo oxidative degradation of the polymers the analysis of the sol from the three polyolefins showed the presence of mono and dicarboxylic acids along with linear and branched hydroxy acids as the main degradation products less diverse oxidation products were detected from pp fig 1a compared to the two polyethylenes namely dicarboxylic acids in the c4 c14 range and likely branched monocarboxylic acids up to c14 with 2 4 dimethyl hexanedioic acid as the most distinctive and abundant marker of pp degradation the longer mono and dicarboxylic acids could not be directly assigned to either linear or branched structures because of the lack of standard alkyl branched acids in the ms libraries however polymethylated mono and dicarboxylic acids e g with methyl branches every other main chain carbon are more likely structures for the molecular fragments derived from pp whereas linear ones are more likely products from ldpe or hdpe fig s 2 in the supporting information of the two polyethylenes hdpe gave a smaller variety of oxidation species compared to ldpe for hdpe only linear dicarboxylic acids in the c4 c9 range and linear dicarboxylic acids in the c9 c17 range were observed for ldpe as expected the higher reactivity of the tertiary c h bonds which are more sensitive to free radicals resulted in the generation of additional sol species linear and branched hydroxy acids in the c2 c12 range and a broader range of c8 c22 monocarboxylic and c3 c17 dicarboxylic acids fig 1b with 3 hydroxybutanoic acid and 3 methyl 2 hydroxypentanoic acid being quite distinctive markers of ldpe degradation from a quantitative point of view ldpe and pp were characterized by overall higher amounts of sol compared to hdpe in detail after the artificial ageing of the same amounts of virgin polymers the total sol mass from pp was 2 98 ppm compared with 7 46 ppm from ldpe and 1 01 ppm from hdpe the higher amounts of sol for pp and ldpe can be explained by the above mentioned and well known higher sensitivity to photo oxidation of branched hydrocarbon chains due to the presence of labile tertiary h atoms on the other hand the comparatively lower sol from pp compared to ldpe is likely the result of a more extensive fragmentation into lower molecular weight and highly oxidized species grause et al 2020 which are either lost as vocs or not extracted from the aqueous leaching medium by hexane and diethyl ether in fact the most abundant species detected for pp were the two unique markers 2 2 dimethyl butanedioic acid and 2 4 dimethyl hexanedioic acid observed in pp extracts only while monocarboxylic acids were the most abundant species detected for the two polyethylenes with higher concentrations compared to dicarboxylic and hydroxy acids the oxidative degradation of these polymers is thought to be triggered by internal structural defects such as carbonyls hydroperoxides scott 1992 and conjugated unsaturations typically resulting from thermomechanical stress on polymer chains during processing this degradation is also caused by photosensitizing impurities from environmental contamination e g metal ions or from within the plastic pieces such as polymerization catalyst residues processing and plastic formulation additives once oxidation has started with the generation of free radical and other reactive species its progress may be sustained by environmental factors such as heat thermal degradation the uv fraction of solar radiation photodegradation or more rarely the enzymatic action of fungi and bacteria biodegradation bolland and gee 1946 the triggering action by the defects and impurities mentioned above typically starts with the onset of free radical reactions that promote the homolytic cleavage of the most labile c h bonds in the presence of oxygen the resulting macroradicals are transformed into the corresponding peroxy radicals and then into hydroperoxides upon intra or intermolecular free radical transfer reactions although the subsequent homolytic heat and or uv light activated cleavage of hydroperoxides is considered as the slow step in the degradation kinetics of hydrocarbon polymers iring et al 1983 it eventually results in the cascade amplification of the concentration of free radical species followed by a series of degradation reactions of varying levels of complexity the overall process results in the formation of oxidized groups hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl alkene lactone etc along the macromolecular backbone and at the chain ends produced by main chain scission reactions these scission reactions are mainly responsible for the plastic embrittlement and fragmentation at the macro and microscopic level along with generation of low molecular weight degradation products that may be released as volatile organic compounds vocs or leached out in water such oxidation processes are strongly influenced by the structure of the polymer of those investigated in this work pp is the most vulnerable to photo oxidative degradation by the free radical mechanism since it has one labile h atom on a tertiary carbon in each repeating unit that is much more than the branched ldpe alkanes alkenes alcohols aldehydes carboxylic acids ketones esters lactones and peracids have been identified among the degradation products of pp ward et al 2019 the rapid fragmentation of pp into low molecular weight species including volatile compounds down to co2 fernando et al 2007 explains the parallel rapid reduction of the average molecular weight of the polymer low and medium molecular weight degradation products containing carbonyl and hydroxyl groups have also been identified in photo oxidized pe hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 alkanes alkenes ketones aldehydes alcohols mono and di carboxylic acids lactones keto acids and esters have been identified as semi volatile compounds along with a smaller fraction of highly volatile c2 c6 compounds of which acetaldehyde is the most abundant albertsson et al 1995 hakkarainen et al 1997 iring et al 1983 in the case of ps while tertiary radicals are generated just as easily as in pp the degradation pathways are modified due to the presence of the aromatic moiety indeed in our work the sol composition from ps fig 1c was very different from those obtained for the three polyolefins it was characterized by the presence of aromatic species with only traces of some of the c4 c18 mono and dicarboxylic acids leaching out of the oxidized polyolefins in detail benzoic acid phenylacetic acid 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 1 phenyl 1 2 ethanediol 3 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 hydroxyphenylacetic acid 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid were the main products along with several variously oxidized styrene dimers ms ions m z 91 105 129 and 207 and trimers ms ions m z 91 105 129 129 207 and 312 based on the semi quantitative analysis 35 65 ppm of leached oxidation products were calculated for ps which is by far the highest overall amount of the polymers analyzed the most abundant species were benzoic acid and phenol derivatives along with the oligomeric styrene derivatives with relative abundances that were up to a hundred times higher compared to all the other chemical species another characteristic of polystyrene is that the photodegradation reactions result in its rapid yellowing due to the formation of oxidized groups alkene carbonyl conjugated with the phenyl moiety some of them with not negligible absorption in the near uv and up to the shorter wavelength blue range of the visible spectrum these photo oxidation reactions proceed mainly within the surface layer 30 90 nm depth mejía torres et al 2018 while the polymeric bulk remains substantially unaltered until the surface layer is gradually removed arguably by chemical erosion and mechanical fragmentation promoted by environmental aging the photo oxidation reactions occurring within this layer result in the formation of low molecular weight products such as acetophenone benzaldehyde benzoic acid benzalacetophenone benzoic anhydride and various derivatives of styrene dimers and trimers gardette et al 1995 kruse et al 2001 all of which are potentially volatile and or leachable by aqueous solutions gewert et al 2018 3 2 analysis of environmental samples in order to reveal a possible correlation between the degradation behavior of the reference materials and that of analogous environmental mps five naturally aged samples each consisting of a pool of small 2 mm debris of the same polymer type collected on a sandy beach were tested and analyzed in the same way as the artificially aged reference samples the estimated concentrations of the chemical species detected in the extracts of the aqueous leachates of the environmental microplastics are reported in table 1 in detail two pp samples from the winter berm and the summer berm of sandy beach zones respectively two pe samples also from the winter and summer berm and one ps sample from the winter berm were subjected to extraction with artificial seawater in an ultrasonic bath and the sol extracts were analyzed by gc ms in the same way as the sol from the artificially aged reference polymers the chromatograms obtained from the summer berm pp and pe samples respectively are shown in fig 2 for those from the winter berm pp pe and ps see the supporting information fig s 3 the gc ms analysis of the sol from the environmental pp of both summer fig 2a and winter berm samples showed like the artificially aged reference pp the predominant presence of branched mono and dicarboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to c16 the main difference between the reference and the environmental pp was in the relative abundances of the detected chemical species with a prevalence of dicarboxylic acids and only traces of monocarboxylic acids detected in the case of the environmental pp this different composition of the leachates may be ascribed to a longer exposure to light and oxygen as well as unconfined leaching by environmental mps before sampling hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 both environmental pp extracts were characterized by the presence of chemical species not associated with the ageing of the polymer the most abundant compounds were benzoic acid phthalic acid terephthalic acid dibutyl phthalate butyl octyl phthalate butylated hydroxytoluene 4 ter butylphenol 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and adipic acid di 2 ethylhexyl ester all these chemical species can be associated although not exclusively with additives commonly used in plastics manufacturing plasticizers antioxidants uv stabilizers etc and their degradation products they may be present either as additives in the plastic items from which the environmental pp debris were generated or more likely the result of absorption from a polluted marine environment a quantitative analysis was performed for the two plasticizers dibutyl phthalate and butyl octyl phthalate and their total concentration was 2 65 ppm for the winter berm pp and 1 68 ppm for the pp from the summer berm the semi quantitative analysis performed on the environmental pp samples showed a significantly lower overall concentration of leached chemical species in the sol from the summer berm 1 57 ppm than in the sol from the winter berm 30 7 ppm the most abundant species in the winter berm pp sample were oxalic 1 28 ppm butanedioic 6 41 ppm and 2 2 dimethyl butandioic 7 61 ppm acids while the individual amounts of the other chemical species identified were in the 0 1 7 6 ppm range the compositions of the sols from the environmental pe of summer fig 2b and winter berm samples were similar to the sols from the environmental pp with mono and dicarboxylic acids in the c4 c18 range and several hydroxylated monocarboxylic acids in the c3 c14 range only trace amounts of dicarboxylic acids were detected in the artificially aged reference ldpe from a quantitative point of view the sols from the two pes had similar contents of leached oxidation products with an average total amount of around 22 ppm in detail carboxylic and hydroxycarboxylic acids were in the 0 1 0 70 ppm range and each dicarboxylic acid in the 0 2 1 6 ppm range as with the pp the sols from the environmental pe samples were characterized by dicarboxylic acids with the c3 c18 species being the most abundant in the chromatographic profile the gc ms results also highlighted the presence of diisobutyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate butyl octyl phthalate and di 2 nonyl phthalate with concentrations of 4 62 1 75 0 68 0 61 and 1 16 ppm respectively the analysis of the sol from the environmental ps fig s 3c showed the presence of only small amounts of benzoic hydroxy benzoic and dicarboxylic acids no traces of styrene dimers and trimers were detected possibly because these depolymerization by products had already leached into the environment before they were sampled finally diisobutyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate butyl octyl phthalate and di 2 nonyl phthalate either as ps additives or most likely as a result of absorption from polluted marine environments were also detected in the sol of the environmental ps the concentrations of all the plasticizers in the leached extracts were lower than the limit of quantification except for diisobutyl phthalate which had a concentration of 3 60 ppm note that the results of our analyses of the environmental mps are not fully representative of their natural degradation behavior since the oxidation products are likely to have continuously leached to different extents depending on their respective solubility during environmental ageing and before sampling in addition other chemical species may have been adsorbed onto the plastic debris nevertheless we believe that our results are a reliable snapshot of the soluble fraction of the polymers at the moment of the sampling 3 3 potential health effects of the chemical species detected some of the water soluble chemical species detected as degradation products of the reference and environmental polymer samples are toxic table 2 summarizes the main classes of chemical species detected for the different materials together with some studies reporting their toxicologic effects most of the chemicals detected as leachates in the artificial seawater are considered harmless for human health for instance all the polyolefins oxidation products mainly mono and dicarboxylic acids are biocompatible with a negligible health threat however there are currently no studies on branched species such as polymethylated mono and dicarboxylic acids the oxidation and degradation products identified for ps which mainly consist of benzoic acid and styrene derivatives are the most worrying from a toxicology point of view since not negligible levels of toxicity have already been reported for most of them with adverse neurobehavioral effects after inhalation cruzan et al 2002 jégaden et al 1993 morgan et al 1993 or impact on the reproductive system chamkhia et al 2006 tatarazako et al 2002 finally the presence of other chemical species in addition to the polymer degradation products such as phthalate plasticizers and uv stabilizers that are already known for their adverse effects on health joner 1977 staples et al 1997 suggests that the potential toxicity of mps is mainly for pe and pp mps or partly for ps ascribed to such chemical species in particular phthalates have been associated with various toxicological effects affecting the reproductive system causing chronic kidney disease or disrupting the endocrine hormonal balance karim et al 2022 prasad et al 2022 interest in the ecotoxicological effects of photodegraded microplastics is increasing as highlighted by recent studies on polystyrene wang et al 2020 car tire rubber capolupo et al 2020 various types of plastics jégaden et al 1993 and microfibers sait et al 2021 most of these studies focus on the direct effects of the microplastics while the characterization of the leached compounds and the investigation of their effects requires further investigation luo et al 2022 3 4 implications for the evaluation of the ecotoxicological risks of mps detailed knowledge of the types of degradation oxidation products leaching out from plastic debris in the environment would provide a solid basis for investigations into how mps interact with the biosphere and to understand whether these species are a higher risk for the environment than the mp particles themselves plastic debris is not a chemically stable persistent pollutant it is a reactive material in our pilot study we characterized the leached oxidation products that are definitely associated with the presence of microplastics in the environment but which are generally not revealed by the standard analytical approaches used to study microplastics our analysis on the environmental samples revealed the presence of other chemical species not directly related to the degradation processes of microplastics but more likely to the adsorption of compounds from the environment or to the leaching of additives uv stabilizers and phthalate plasticizers used in plastics manufacturing the way mps interact with other environmental pollutants has been widely discussed in the literature highlighting how these small plastic particles possibly act as concentrators and carriers of a broad range of toxic chemicals into the biota or across different environmental compartments antunes et al 2013 bakir et al 2014 rochman et al 2013 rodrigues et al 2019 we believe our work could be the basis for further research where the specific compounds are selected and tested in toxicology studies to achieve a more complete picture of the impact of microplastics the aim would be to define guidelines for manufacturing disposable plastic items that have less impact on the environment and to mitigate the side effects of microplastic pollution 4 conclusions in order to characterize and quantify the oxidation products of polymers leached into water we artificially aged microplastics in artificial seawater followed by solvent extraction and gc ms analysis in the soluble fractions of polyolefins we identified linear or branched monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids together with hydroxy acids with chain lengths up to 22 carbon atoms the semi quantitative analysis highlighted that ldpe and pp had richer water soluble fractions compared to hdpe the soluble fraction of ps contained several aromatic species with hydroxy benzoic acids together with styrene dimers and trimers being the most abundant species ps was characterized by the highest amounts of leached oxidation products up to five times higher than those of polyolefins we believe that our results reveal the true extent of the pool of organic molecules associated with mps i e not limited to additives and absorbed compounds but also including their degradation products the species that we identified as leachates from the degraded mps are only some of those released by degrading polymer particles in fact we did not investigate lower molecular weight species including aldehydes alkenes and other variously reactive ones since they are known to be released as volatile organic compounds castelvetro et al 2021 la nasa et al 2021 lomonaco et al 2020 nevertheless our results provide an initial accurate overview of the effectiveness and extent of macromolecular fragmentation into low medium molecular weight oxidation products upon photo oxidative aging and in particular of the broad range of chemical species that can be released by microplastics in the aqueous environment we correlated the various leaching species with the literature on their toxicity in conclusion most of the primary oxidation products derived from the degradation of ps together with the additives identified in the environmental samples are a potential threat for

15885,microplastics are the particulate plastic debris found almost everywhere as environmental contaminants they are not chemically stable persistent pollutants but reactive materials in fact synthetic polymers exposed to the environment undergo chemical and physical degradation processes which lead not only to mechanical but also molecular fragmentation releasing compounds that are potentially harmful for the environment and human health we carried out accelerated photo oxidative ageing of four reference microplastics low and high density polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene directly in artificial seawater we then made a characterization at the molecular level along with a quantification of the chemical species leached into water gas chromatography mass spectrometry analyses performed after selective extraction and derivatization enabled us to identify more than 60 different compounds analysis of the leachates from the three polyolefins revealed that the main degradation products were mono and dicarboxylic acids along with linear and branched hydroxy acids the highest amount of leached degradation species was observed for polystyrene with benzoic acid and phenol derivatives as the most abundant along with oligomeric styrene derivatives the results from reference microplastics were then compared with those obtained by analyzing leachates in artificial seawater from aged plastic debris collected in a natural environment the differences observed between the reference and the environmental plastic leachates mainly concerned the relative abundances of the chemical species detected with the environmental samples showing higher amounts of dicarboxylic acids and oxidized species graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics accelerated photo oxidative ageing marine water leachates polyolefins polystyrene 1 introduction the worldwide production of synthetic polymers which began in the 1950s has resulted in a global environmental threat due to plastic pollution derraik 2002 geyer et al 2017 shahul hamid et al 2018 pollution by microplastics mps has been detected in all the main environmental compartments and the associated threats to the environment and human health have been the focus of intense social scientific and political debate betts 2008 derraik 2002 geyer et al 2017 shahul hamid et al 2018 most studies on microplastics have focused on the detection identification and quantification of these polymer particles and only recently have some authors started investigating such materials in terms of them being dynamic systems wang et al 2020 yu et al 2021 in fact synthetic polymers exposed to the environment undergo chemical and physical degradation processes these lead not only to mechanical but also molecular fragmentation and degradation into secondary microplastics with the generation of low molecular weight species that are either leached into the surrounding water capolupo et al 2020 luo et al 2022 sait et al 2021 wang et al 2020 or released as volatile degradation products la nasa et al 2021 lomonaco et al 2020 these low molecular weight species are typically oxidized such as mono and multifunctional carboxylic acids carbonyl aldehydes ketones and hydroxy derivatives alkenes heterocyclic and aromatic compounds depending on the polymer type from which they originate mps should thus not be considered simply as hazardous physical materials interacting with biota only as a result of ingestion and possibly internalization across the walls of the gastrointestinal tract in fact the potential toxicity of the reactive mp surface and of the low molecular species deriving from such degraded mps is still poorly understood most previous studies on the molecular species associated with mps have been limited to their leaching of plastic additives such as antioxidants flame retardants and plasticizers and to their role as concentrators and carriers of environmentally persistent organic pollutants cole et al 2011 yu et al 2021 there is an urgent need for studies on the potential harm of the oxidation degradation products that can leach out from plastic debris dispersed into the environment capolupo et al 2021 liu et al 2021 sait et al 2021 in this work we performed accelerated photo oxidative ageing on a set of reference mps in artificial seawater in order to carry out a semi quantitative analysis of the chemical species leached out as water soluble low molecular weight degradation products four different hydrocarbon polymers in the form of micronized powders were used as the reference mps low density polyethylene ldpe high density polyethylene hdpe polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps the oxidation products generated and leached out as a result of the ageing were sequentially extracted from the artificial seawater using two different organic solvents and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry the results obtained from the reference mps were then compared with those obtained from environmentally aged plastics for this purpose small plastic debris sampled from a beach were sieved down to 2 mm placed in artificial seawater treated in an ultrasonic bath to trigger the release of low molecular weight species then extracted from the artificial seawater and analyzed in the same way as the previous

features and quality control semi quantitative analyses were performed using the calibration curves of palmitic acid for monocarboxylic acids azelaic acid for dicarboxylic acids and benzoic acid for the styrene oxidation products the procedural blank was obtained by loading a quartz tube with artificial seawater only and subjecting it to accelerated ageing the limits of quantitation loqs were calculated from triplicates of the areas integrated for the procedural blank and the slopes of the calibration curves according to the ich guidelines the lods were 0 031 ppm for palmitic acid 0 027 ppm for azelaic acid and 0 040 ppm for benzoic acid while the loqs were 0 09 ppm 0 085 ppm and 0 120 ppm respectively full details on the validation method are reported in table s 1 in the supporting information the concentrations ppm were calculated from the total amount of artificial seawater 5 ml in which the polymers were artificially aged lastly control water solutions were prepared by adding 5 ml of artificial seawater to vials containing 1 5 g of each reference polymer hdpe ldpe pp ps and storing the vials in the dark at room temperature for two weeks the solutions were then treated with the same extraction procedure used for the aged polymers and the extracts were analyzed the chemical species detected and identified were considered as procedural blanks for the subsequent qualitative analyses in order to pinpoint the chemical species specifically generated during the accelerated ageing quantitative analysis of plasticizers was also performed on the leachates of the environmental microplastics the lods and loqs of the method were evaluated for the same solution used for the evaluation of palmitic azelaic and benzoic acids the lods were lower than 0 031 ppm while the loqs were lower than 0 090 ppm full details are reported in table s 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of artificially aged microplastics the organic extracts of the water soluble fraction or seawater organic leachate hereafter sol from each of the four samples of micronized virgin hdpe ldpe pp and ps in artificial seawater plus a blank seawater sample all of which had been artificially aged for two weeks in a solarbox to induce accelerated photo oxidative degradation were analyzed by gc ms control solutions consisting of the same four micronized virgin polymers in artificial seawater aged two weeks in the dark were also analyzed as reference systems the chromatograms of the sol from the photo aged pp ldpe and ps are shown in fig 1 while the main oxidation products identified are listed in table 1 with their respective concentrations none of these substances were detected in the chromatograms of the sol from the control solutions indicating that these species were actually the products of photo oxidative degradation of the polymers the analysis of the sol from the three polyolefins showed the presence of mono and dicarboxylic acids along with linear and branched hydroxy acids as the main degradation products less diverse oxidation products were detected from pp fig 1a compared to the two polyethylenes namely dicarboxylic acids in the c4 c14 range and likely branched monocarboxylic acids up to c14 with 2 4 dimethyl hexanedioic acid as the most distinctive and abundant marker of pp degradation the longer mono and dicarboxylic acids could not be directly assigned to either linear or branched structures because of the lack of standard alkyl branched acids in the ms libraries however polymethylated mono and dicarboxylic acids e g with methyl branches every other main chain carbon are more likely structures for the molecular fragments derived from pp whereas linear ones are more likely products from ldpe or hdpe fig s 2 in the supporting information of the two polyethylenes hdpe gave a smaller variety of oxidation species compared to ldpe for hdpe only linear dicarboxylic acids in the c4 c9 range and linear dicarboxylic acids in the c9 c17 range were observed for ldpe as expected the higher reactivity of the tertiary c h bonds which are more sensitive to free radicals resulted in the generation of additional sol species linear and branched hydroxy acids in the c2 c12 range and a broader range of c8 c22 monocarboxylic and c3 c17 dicarboxylic acids fig 1b with 3 hydroxybutanoic acid and 3 methyl 2 hydroxypentanoic acid being quite distinctive markers of ldpe degradation from a quantitative point of view ldpe and pp were characterized by overall higher amounts of sol compared to hdpe in detail after the artificial ageing of the same amounts of virgin polymers the total sol mass from pp was 2 98 ppm compared with 7 46 ppm from ldpe and 1 01 ppm from hdpe the higher amounts of sol for pp and ldpe can be explained by the above mentioned and well known higher sensitivity to photo oxidation of branched hydrocarbon chains due to the presence of labile tertiary h atoms on the other hand the comparatively lower sol from pp compared to ldpe is likely the result of a more extensive fragmentation into lower molecular weight and highly oxidized species grause et al 2020 which are either lost as vocs or not extracted from the aqueous leaching medium by hexane and diethyl ether in fact the most abundant species detected for pp were the two unique markers 2 2 dimethyl butanedioic acid and 2 4 dimethyl hexanedioic acid observed in pp extracts only while monocarboxylic acids were the most abundant species detected for the two polyethylenes with higher concentrations compared to dicarboxylic and hydroxy acids the oxidative degradation of these polymers is thought to be triggered by internal structural defects such as carbonyls hydroperoxides scott 1992 and conjugated unsaturations typically resulting from thermomechanical stress on polymer chains during processing this degradation is also caused by photosensitizing impurities from environmental contamination e g metal ions or from within the plastic pieces such as polymerization catalyst residues processing and plastic formulation additives once oxidation has started with the generation of free radical and other reactive species its progress may be sustained by environmental factors such as heat thermal degradation the uv fraction of solar radiation photodegradation or more rarely the enzymatic action of fungi and bacteria biodegradation bolland and gee 1946 the triggering action by the defects and impurities mentioned above typically starts with the onset of free radical reactions that promote the homolytic cleavage of the most labile c h bonds in the presence of oxygen the resulting macroradicals are transformed into the corresponding peroxy radicals and then into hydroperoxides upon intra or intermolecular free radical transfer reactions although the subsequent homolytic heat and or uv light activated cleavage of hydroperoxides is considered as the slow step in the degradation kinetics of hydrocarbon polymers iring et al 1983 it eventually results in the cascade amplification of the concentration of free radical species followed by a series of degradation reactions of varying levels of complexity the overall process results in the formation of oxidized groups hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl alkene lactone etc along the macromolecular backbone and at the chain ends produced by main chain scission reactions these scission reactions are mainly responsible for the plastic embrittlement and fragmentation at the macro and microscopic level along with generation of low molecular weight degradation products that may be released as volatile organic compounds vocs or leached out in water such oxidation processes are strongly influenced by the structure of the polymer of those investigated in this work pp is the most vulnerable to photo oxidative degradation by the free radical mechanism since it has one labile h atom on a tertiary carbon in each repeating unit that is much more than the branched ldpe alkanes alkenes alcohols aldehydes carboxylic acids ketones esters lactones and peracids have been identified among the degradation products of pp ward et al 2019 the rapid fragmentation of pp into low molecular weight species including volatile compounds down to co2 fernando et al 2007 explains the parallel rapid reduction of the average molecular weight of the polymer low and medium molecular weight degradation products containing carbonyl and hydroxyl groups have also been identified in photo oxidized pe hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 alkanes alkenes ketones aldehydes alcohols mono and di carboxylic acids lactones keto acids and esters have been identified as semi volatile compounds along with a smaller fraction of highly volatile c2 c6 compounds of which acetaldehyde is the most abundant albertsson et al 1995 hakkarainen et al 1997 iring et al 1983 in the case of ps while tertiary radicals are generated just as easily as in pp the degradation pathways are modified due to the presence of the aromatic moiety indeed in our work the sol composition from ps fig 1c was very different from those obtained for the three polyolefins it was characterized by the presence of aromatic species with only traces of some of the c4 c18 mono and dicarboxylic acids leaching out of the oxidized polyolefins in detail benzoic acid phenylacetic acid 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 1 phenyl 1 2 ethanediol 3 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 hydroxyphenylacetic acid 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid were the main products along with several variously oxidized styrene dimers ms ions m z 91 105 129 and 207 and trimers ms ions m z 91 105 129 129 207 and 312 based on the semi quantitative analysis 35 65 ppm of leached oxidation products were calculated for ps which is by far the highest overall amount of the polymers analyzed the most abundant species were benzoic acid and phenol derivatives along with the oligomeric styrene derivatives with relative abundances that were up to a hundred times higher compared to all the other chemical species another characteristic of polystyrene is that the photodegradation reactions result in its rapid yellowing due to the formation of oxidized groups alkene carbonyl conjugated with the phenyl moiety some of them with not negligible absorption in the near uv and up to the shorter wavelength blue range of the visible spectrum these photo oxidation reactions proceed mainly within the surface layer 30 90 nm depth mejía torres et al 2018 while the polymeric bulk remains substantially unaltered until the surface layer is gradually removed arguably by chemical erosion and mechanical fragmentation promoted by environmental aging the photo oxidation reactions occurring within this layer result in the formation of low molecular weight products such as acetophenone benzaldehyde benzoic acid benzalacetophenone benzoic anhydride and various derivatives of styrene dimers and trimers gardette et al 1995 kruse et al 2001 all of which are potentially volatile and or leachable by aqueous solutions gewert et al 2018 3 2 analysis of environmental samples in order to reveal a possible correlation between the degradation behavior of the reference materials and that of analogous environmental mps five naturally aged samples each consisting of a pool of small 2 mm debris of the same polymer type collected on a sandy beach were tested and analyzed in the same way as the artificially aged reference samples the estimated concentrations of the chemical species detected in the extracts of the aqueous leachates of the environmental microplastics are reported in table 1 in detail two pp samples from the winter berm and the summer berm of sandy beach zones respectively two pe samples also from the winter and summer berm and one ps sample from the winter berm were subjected to extraction with artificial seawater in an ultrasonic bath and the sol extracts were analyzed by gc ms in the same way as the sol from the artificially aged reference polymers the chromatograms obtained from the summer berm pp and pe samples respectively are shown in fig 2 for those from the winter berm pp pe and ps see the supporting information fig s 3 the gc ms analysis of the sol from the environmental pp of both summer fig 2a and winter berm samples showed like the artificially aged reference pp the predominant presence of branched mono and dicarboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to c16 the main difference between the reference and the environmental pp was in the relative abundances of the detected chemical species with a prevalence of dicarboxylic acids and only traces of monocarboxylic acids detected in the case of the environmental pp this different composition of the leachates may be ascribed to a longer exposure to light and oxygen as well as unconfined leaching by environmental mps before sampling hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 both environmental pp extracts were characterized by the presence of chemical species not associated with the ageing of the polymer the most abundant compounds were benzoic acid phthalic acid terephthalic acid dibutyl phthalate butyl octyl phthalate butylated hydroxytoluene 4 ter butylphenol 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and adipic acid di 2 ethylhexyl ester all these chemical species can be associated although not exclusively with additives commonly used in plastics manufacturing plasticizers antioxidants uv stabilizers etc and their degradation products they may be present either as additives in the plastic items from which the environmental pp debris were generated or more likely the result of absorption from a polluted marine environment a quantitative analysis was performed for the two plasticizers dibutyl phthalate and butyl octyl phthalate and their total concentration was 2 65 ppm for the winter berm pp and 1 68 ppm for the pp from the summer berm the semi quantitative analysis performed on the environmental pp samples showed a significantly lower overall concentration of leached chemical species in the sol from the summer berm 1 57 ppm than in the sol from the winter berm 30 7 ppm the most abundant species in the winter berm pp sample were oxalic 1 28 ppm butanedioic 6 41 ppm and 2 2 dimethyl butandioic 7 61 ppm acids while the individual amounts of the other chemical species identified were in the 0 1 7 6 ppm range the compositions of the sols from the environmental pe of summer fig 2b and winter berm samples were similar to the sols from the environmental pp with mono and dicarboxylic acids in the c4 c18 range and several hydroxylated monocarboxylic acids in the c3 c14 range only trace amounts of dicarboxylic acids were detected in the artificially aged reference ldpe from a quantitative point of view the sols from the two pes had similar contents of leached oxidation products with an average total amount of around 22 ppm in detail carboxylic and hydroxycarboxylic acids were in the 0 1 0 70 ppm range and each dicarboxylic acid in the 0 2 1 6 ppm range as with the pp the sols from the environmental pe samples were characterized by dicarboxylic acids with the c3 c18 species being the most abundant in the chromatographic profile the gc ms results also highlighted the presence of diisobutyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate butyl octyl phthalate and di 2 nonyl phthalate with concentrations of 4 62 1 75 0 68 0 61 and 1 16 ppm respectively the analysis of the sol from the environmental ps fig s 3c showed the presence of only small amounts of benzoic hydroxy benzoic and dicarboxylic acids no traces of styrene dimers and trimers were detected possibly because these depolymerization by products had already leached into the environment before they were sampled finally diisobutyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate butyl octyl phthalate and di 2 nonyl phthalate either as ps additives or most likely as a result of absorption from polluted marine environments were also detected in the sol of the environmental ps the concentrations of all the plasticizers in the leached extracts were lower than the limit of quantification except for diisobutyl phthalate which had a concentration of 3 60 ppm note that the results of our analyses of the environmental mps are not fully representative of their natural degradation behavior since the oxidation products are likely to have continuously leached to different extents depending on their respective solubility during environmental ageing and before sampling in addition other chemical species may have been adsorbed onto the plastic debris nevertheless we believe that our results are a reliable snapshot of the soluble fraction of the polymers at the moment of the sampling 3 3 potential health effects of the chemical species detected some of the water soluble chemical species detected as degradation products of the reference and environmental polymer samples are toxic table 2 summarizes the main classes of chemical species detected for the different materials together with some studies reporting their toxicologic effects most of the chemicals detected as leachates in the artificial seawater are considered harmless for human health for instance all the polyolefins oxidation products mainly mono and dicarboxylic acids are biocompatible with a negligible health threat however there are currently no studies on branched species such as polymethylated mono and dicarboxylic acids the oxidation and degradation products identified for ps which mainly consist of benzoic acid and styrene derivatives are the most worrying from a toxicology point of view since not negligible levels of toxicity have already been reported for most of them with adverse neurobehavioral effects after inhalation cruzan et al 2002 jégaden et al 1993 morgan et al 1993 or impact on the reproductive system chamkhia et al 2006 tatarazako et al 2002 finally the presence of other chemical species in addition to the polymer degradation products such as phthalate plasticizers and uv stabilizers that are already known for their adverse effects on health joner 1977 staples et al 1997 suggests that the potential toxicity of mps is mainly for pe and pp mps or partly for ps ascribed to such chemical species in particular phthalates have been associated with various toxicological effects affecting the reproductive system causing chronic kidney disease or disrupting the endocrine hormonal balance karim et al 2022 prasad et al 2022 interest in the ecotoxicological effects of photodegraded microplastics is increasing as highlighted by recent studies on polystyrene wang et al 2020 car tire rubber capolupo et al 2020 various types of plastics jégaden et al 1993 and microfibers sait et al 2021 most of these studies focus on the direct effects of the microplastics while the characterization of the leached compounds and the investigation of their effects requires further investigation luo et al 2022 3 4 implications for the evaluation of the ecotoxicological risks of mps detailed knowledge of the types of degradation oxidation products leaching out from plastic debris in the environment would provide a solid basis for investigations into how mps interact with the biosphere and to understand whether these species are a higher risk for the environment than the mp particles themselves plastic debris is not a chemically stable persistent pollutant it is a reactive material in our pilot study we characterized the leached oxidation products that are definitely associated with the presence of microplastics in the environment but which are generally not revealed by the standard analytical approaches used to study microplastics our analysis on the environmental samples revealed the presence of other chemical species not directly related to the degradation processes of microplastics but more likely to the adsorption of compounds from the environment or to the leaching of additives uv stabilizers and phthalate plasticizers used in plastics manufacturing the way mps interact with other environmental pollutants has been widely discussed in the literature highlighting how these small plastic particles possibly act as concentrators and carriers of a broad range of toxic chemicals into the biota or across different environmental compartments antunes et al 2013 bakir et al 2014 rochman et al 2013 rodrigues et al 2019 we believe our work could be the basis for further research where the specific compounds are selected and tested in toxicology studies to achieve a more complete picture of the impact of microplastics the aim would be to define guidelines for manufacturing disposable plastic items that have less impact on the environment and to mitigate the side effects of microplastic pollution 4 conclusions in order to characterize and quantify the oxidation products of polymers leached into water we artificially aged microplastics in artificial seawater followed by solvent extraction and gc ms analysis in the soluble fractions of polyolefins we identified linear or branched monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids together with hydroxy acids with chain lengths up to 22 carbon atoms the semi quantitative analysis highlighted that ldpe and pp had richer water soluble fractions compared to hdpe the soluble fraction of ps contained several aromatic species with hydroxy benzoic acids together with styrene dimers and trimers being the most abundant species ps was characterized by the highest amounts of leached oxidation products up to five times higher than those of polyolefins we believe that our results reveal the true extent of the pool of organic molecules associated with mps i e not limited to additives and absorbed compounds but also including their degradation products the species that we identified as leachates from the degraded mps are only some of those released by degrading polymer particles in fact we did not investigate lower molecular weight species including aldehydes alkenes and other variously reactive ones since they are known to be released as volatile organic compounds castelvetro et al 2021 la nasa et al 2021 lomonaco et al 2020 nevertheless our results provide an initial accurate overview of the effectiveness and extent of macromolecular fragmentation into low medium molecular weight oxidation products upon photo oxidative aging and in particular of the broad range of chemical species that can be released by microplastics in the aqueous environment we correlated the various leaching species with the literature on their toxicity in conclusion most of the primary oxidation products derived from the degradation of ps together with the additives identified in the environmental samples are a potential threat for

al 2014 kang et al 2007 liu et al 2011 séon et al 2015 these antibacterial agents achieve microbial inactivation mainly through electrostatic action and possible penetration into the cell dizman et al 2006 but the presence of phospholipids provides a degree of protection to the microbial cell alkhalifa et al 2020 reducing the ability of antibacterial agents to puncture the cell and effectively kill the microorganisms blois and swarbrick 1972 this calls for a combination of antibacterial agent with other materials having strong cell puncturing capacity to obtain highly effective antibiofouling performance moreover the hydrophobic nature of some antibacterial agents e g qac may reduce the hydrophilicity of membrane meng et al 2015 which can result in a decreased water flux and even deteriorated anti organic fouling capacity therefore how to compensate the adverse impact of blended antibacterial agents on the membrane and further improve its antibiofouling ability remains a technical challenge two dimensional mgal layered double hydroxide mgal ldh may have the potential to overcome the possible negative impact of antibacterial agents and further enhance the antibiofouling performance of the membrane due to its unique properties of multilayered structure sharp edge and hydrophilicity abdollahi et al 2021 ma et al 2021 the multilayered mgal ldh has a positive surface charge and negative interlayer charge capable of intercalating positively charged antibacterial agent like qac into the interlayer spaces via facile self assembly kameda et al 2014 with the intercalation of an antibacterial agent the mgal ldh having a sharp edge can puncture the bacterial cell rasool et al 2016 and possibly allow intracellular release of antibacterial agent leading to an enhanced biocidal property additionally the hydrophilic nature of mgal ldh is capable of compensating the adverse impact of the hydrophobic antibacterial agent these potential advantages of mgal ldh promotes us to study whether blending of antibacterial agent intercalated mgal ldh can grant ultrafiltration membrane superior antibiofouling property on the other hand according to mean field theory rana et al 2000 the net exothermic mixing effect between pes and qac makes them easy to form homogeneous systems rana et al 1996b the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ldh can interact with the polymer chains to produce a mixing heat that promotes the formation of homogeneous systems of ldh and pes rana et al 1993 1996a moreover the synergistic heat mixing effect qac and pes ldh and pes can facilitate the homogeneous mixing of qac ldh and pes and consequently a more homogeneous mixed matrix membrane can be formed during the phase inversion

fabricate pes membranes with antibiofouling performance since both qac and ldh are quite cost effective the fabrication of qac ldh incorporated pes uf membrane can be easily upscaled the qac ldh and modified pes membranes were characterized to evaluate whether the materials were successfully synthesized the antifouling performance of qac ldh incorporated pes membrane was evaluated and the antifouling mechanisms were illustrated in terms of microbial adhesion and biocidal effect the stability of qac ldh incorporated pes membrane was also evaluated after several fouling cleaning cycles the main issues addressed in the study include i how does qac ldh improve the water flux and antifouling organic fouling properties of membranes ii what are the antibiofouling performance and antibacterial mechanisms of qac ldh incorporated uf membranes and iii whether the qac ldh incorporated uf membrane can maintain its antibiofouling performance after cleaning 2 materials and methods 2

jeol jem 2100 the behavior of mass loss for ldh qac and qac ldh was analyzed at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 in nitrogen atmosphere from 20 c to 800 c by a thermogravimetric analysis tga perkinelmer sta 8000 the zeta potentials of ldh qac and qac ldh powders were determined by a zetasizer analyzer nano zs90 malvern instruments crop uk after forming a well dispersed aqueous solution 2 3 membrane preparation the uf membranes used in this experimental procedure were obtained by the phase inversion method fig 1 abdi et al 2021 the detailed composition of the ultrafiltration membranes is shown in table 1 the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles has always been a difficult problem for mixed matrix membranes to alleviate this problem in this experiment the two step method was used to prepare the casting solution yu et al 2013 the commercial pes powder was first dried at 60 c for 24 h to remove moisture predetermined amounts of pes and pvp were then dissolved into nmp different ratios of qac ldh the ratios of ldh to qac were 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 were homogeneously dispersed in the other nmp solution the two solutions were finally mixed and stirred overnight at 60 c to form a homogeneous casting solution and degassed in an oven at 60 c for 12 h the casting solution was spread onto a non woven fabric shanghai tianlu textile co ltd using a casting knife with a height of 200 µm at a speed of 3 cm s 1 the non woven fabric containing the casting solution on the surface was immediately immersed in di water and the composite uf membrane was obtained after the phase conversion was completed these formed qac ldh blend pes membranes were denoted as pes qldh membranes meanwhile pristine pes membrane and pes membranes mixed with qac and ldh were also prepared according to the above method and denoted as pes pes q and pes ldh membranes respectively this two step method ensures that the nanoparticles can distribute uniformly in the membrane matrix and form a homogeneous structure

information 2 5 assessment of antibacterial behaviors the antibacterial performance of pristine pes and modified pes membranes was assessed using e coli and s aureus as model bacteria liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2018b the antibacterial activity of membranes was evaluated following published procedures liu et al 2017a briefly incubating the bacterial suspension in nutrient broth for 2 3 h obtain the strains in exponential phase excess macromolecules were then removed by centrifugation and the culture was carefully washed by sterile nacl 0 9 wt ultimately the bacteria were resuspended in saline solution to form a concentration of 107 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 the membrane active surface area 1 cm2 was washed three times with sterile pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 followed by uv sterilization for 30 min the active side of the membrane was exposed to the bacterial solution 1 ml at 37 c for 3 h after incubation the active side of the membrane was washed three times with saline solution then transferred into tubes containing 10 ml of saline solution and sonicated for 10 min to isolate the bacteria deposited on the membrane surface immediately afterward the serially diluted bacterial suspensions were plated on lb plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 c lastly the number of colonies was counted to assess the antibacterial properties of all membranes simultaneously the adhesion behaviors of e coli and s aureus on the surface of pristine membranes pes and modified membranes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes after 3 h of contact with the bacterial solution were also observed by sem to ensure the complete structure of the cells for sem observation the membrane was rinsed twice in pbs then fixed in 2 glutaraldehyde in 0 1 m sodium cacodylate buffer ph 7 4 for 5 min and dehydrated with different gradients of ethanol 70 80 90 and 100 and finally dried with tetramethylsilane 2 6 antibiofouling assay dynamic biofouling of membranes in a dead end cell with an effective membrane area of 12 6 cm2 was conducted municipal wastewater containing e coli at an original concentration of 107 cells ml 1 was synthesized according to the reported method as the feed solution ph 7 huang et al 2015 the system was operated at room temperature and operating pressure of 1 bar after completion of the biofouling experiments the membrane was collected for characterization a 1 cm2 of membrane coupon was obtained from the biofouled uf membrane and then stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits sypro orange and concavalin a to label viable dead cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps respectively and observed with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm nikon a1 japan the total biofilm thickness was calculated from the amounts of live cells dead cells and eps 2 7 evaluation of qac ldh stability in pes uf membrane the stability of qac ldh on the membrane surface was further evaluated by chemical cleaning in a typical manner qac ldh modified membranes pes qldh membrane active surface area 1 cm2 were placed in 24 well plates with each plate containing 1 ml of bacterial suspension e coli or s aureus 107 cells ml 1 and pre incubated for 3 h the membranes were cleaned by immersing in 0 05 vol solutions of naclo for 2 h after incubation and this cycle of biofouling cleaning was performed in triplicate the membrane was rinsed three times with sterile pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 after each biofouling experiment to ensure that the naclo was completely removed prior to the next biofouling the antibacterial activity of the membrane was evaluated by the plate counting method after three cycles of biofouling cleaning elemental content and surface morphology of biofouling and cleaned membranes were further determined by xps and sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of synthesized ldh and qac ldh the surface morphology and elemental distribution fig s1 fig s3 indicate that qac ldh and pes qldh membranes in different ratios were successfully prepared since the antibacterial efficiency was optimal for the pes membrane with qac to ldh ratio of 2 1 fig s4 the ratio of 2 1 for qac ldh was used for subsequent experiments properties of ldh and the antibacterial agents intercalated 2d composites qac ldh were analyzed by sem tem zeta potential and tga sem fig 2 a and tem fig 2 d images demonstrate that the synthesized ldh has a layered structure with sharp edges which allow the puncture of bacterial cell structures dong et al 2014 the xrd spectrum also proves that ldh fig s5 was successfully prepared yu et al 2012 moreover sem fig 2 b and tem fig 2 e images clearly show that qac ldh has the same layer structure as the pristine ldh and that the layer structure facilitates the penetration of qac ldh into the cell structure as expected characteristic elements fig 2 c derived from both ldh mg and al and qac c and n were detected indicating that the antibacterial agent qac has been successfully intercalated into ldh the ldh has a negatively charged interlayer which provides an appropriate space for intercalation of positively charged qac into it to form qac ldh furthermore the positive charge density fig 2 f of the obtained qac ldh 37 0 1 0 mv was significantly higher than that of both qac 27 1 1 1 mv and ldh 28 7 0 7 mv this is attributed to the fact that ldh has a structure with a positively charged surface and negatively charged interlayer lu et al 2016b thus the positive charge density increases significantly when the qac is intercalated into the nanoscale space of the interlayer the increased positive charge density of qac ldh contributes to enhanced electrostatic interaction with negatively charged microorganisms to further understand the properties of qac ldh its mass loss behavior under thermal condition were analyzed using tga fig 2 g which can help obtain the ratio of qac to ldh in qac ldh the tga results show that qac only has a mass loss stage between 200 c and 300 c whereas ldh includes three mass loss stages the loss of free water and interlayer water 40 c 180 c at the first stage the decomposition of internally bound water 180 c 400 c at the second stage and the internal dehydrogenation 400 c 500 c of the material at the third stage yang et al 2019 in contrast there are only two distinct stages of weight loss for qac ldh the first stage of about 58 less 260 c mass loss that corresponds to the pyrolysis of qac and the second stage of about 34 260 c 400 c mass loss that attributes to the decomposition of ldh the corresponding qac to ldh mass ratio of 1 7 was calculated from two stages of mass losses and derivative thermogravimetric curves fig 2 h which is in general consistent with the theoretical value of 2 during the material preparation meanwhile the tga results also confirm that the thermal stability of qac ldh is higher than that of qac thanks to the higher thermal stability of ldh 3 2 characterization of various uf membranes sem characterization fig 3 a d shows that the top surfaces of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were nearly identical cross sectional sem images of the membranes fig 3 e h also show that these membranes are all in typically asymmetric manners suggesting that the addition of qac ldh and qac ldh in this study did not change the inherent structure of the membrane moreover the surface of the pes qldh membrane presents the homogenous distribution of characteristic elements fig 3 i consistent with materials of pes c o and s qac n and ldh mg and al the pore size distribution fig s6 shows that the pores on the surface of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes are predominantly mesoporous with average surface pore sizes of 18 1 nm 27 4 nm 22 3 nm and 20 8 nm respectively table s1 surface pore density analysis shows that pes qldh 2 1 number cm2 membrane has a higher surface pore density compared to those of pes 0 8 number cm2 pes q 0 6 number cm2 and pes qldh 1 5 number cm2 membranes table s1 indicating that hydrophilic ldh not only increases the surface pore size of the membrane but also significantly increases surface pores density of the membrane the high surface pore density of the membrane potentially contributes to the increase in water flux suggesting that ldh can compensate the adverse effect of qac and increase the water flux of the membrane zeta potential measurement fig 3 j indicates significantly lower negative charge densities on the surface of pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membrane than pes membrane during the phase inversion process positively charged qac molecules fig 2 move towards the membrane surface and partially neutralize the negative charge of membrane surface resulting in a decrease in the net negative charge for the pes q membrane fig 3 j additionally the hydrophilicity of ldh increases the thermodynamic instability of the phase inversion process and facilitates the phase separation process mohsenpour et al 2022 this mechanism induced more ldh and qac ldh to move towards the membrane surface both ldh and qac ldh are positively charged fig 2 leading to a decrease in the net negative charge of membrane surface pes ldh and pes qldh membranes the functional groups and chemical composition of the membrane surfaces were determined using atr ftir and xps respectively compared to the pristine pes membrane fig 4 a the pes q membrane exhibits characteristic peaks at 1550 cm 1 and 2925 cm 1 for rn4 and ch2 the m o m m for al or mg peak from ldh pes ldh membrane can be detected at 430 cm 1 as expected the pes qldh membrane demonstrates the characteristic peaks from qac and ldh these results demonstrated successful preparation of pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes cao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 qualitative and quantitative analyses of the composition and content of the surface elements of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes by xps table s2 and fig s7 also confirm this result those membranes containing characteristic elements from qac and ldh the xps spectra of the surface of pes fig s8 a b pes q fig s8 c e pes ldh fig s8 f i and pes qldh fig 4 b f membrane were deconvoluted to obtain in depth information on the characteristics the c1s element on the surface of the membrane fig 4 b was divided into four peaks located at 284 2 ev 284 6 285 8 and 286 8 ev cc cn co and c s of which cc co and c s are chemical bonds for pes and cn is for qac liu et al 2016 the s o and c s peaks fig 4 c at 167 2 ev and 169 1 ev are typical chemical bonds of pes and the nh cn and c n fig 4 d at 398 7 ev 399 8 ev and 402 2 ev are the characteristic functional groups of qac sultana et al 2008 additionally the peaks of mg and al at 1303 9 ev and 73 9 ev fig 4 e f were also detected liu et al 2018 indicating that qac ldh was successfully incorporated into the polymer matrix of pes membrane which is expected to grant the membrane antibiofouling properties furthermore the tga curves fig s9 show that pes qldh membrane decomposes at higher temperatures than pes pes q and pes ldh membranes indicating that qac ldh increases the thermal stability of the membrane and contributes to improving its service life 3 3 performance evaluation on various uf membranes the flux hydrophilicity hydrophobicity average pore size and antifouling ability organic fouling of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were investigated to determine the physicochemical properties of the membrane surfaces compared to the pristine pes membrane 287 6 32 1l m 2 h 1 the water flux of the pes q membrane 210 4 10 5 l m 2 h 1 decreased fig 5 a probably attributed to the decrease in hydrophilicity of the pes q membrane 80 8 1 9 induced by the hydrophobicity of the qac conversely the water flux of the pes ldh 367 1 47 1 l m 2 h 1 and pes qldh 312 6 24 9 l m 2 h 1 membranes increased consistent with the increase in hydrophilicity of the pes ldh 52 1 1 4 and pes qldh 62 3 1 7 membranes this can be ascribed to the hydrophilicity of the ldh that compensates the adverse impacts of the hydrophobic qac fig 5 b the decrease in contact angle may also be associated with the change in membrane surface roughness fig s10 according to the wenzel equation cos θ 0 r cos θ where θ 0 and θ are the apparent measured and real contact angles of one surface respectively and r is the roughness factor drelich and chibowski 2010 an increase in the roughness r of one hydrophilic material θ 90 leads to a decrease in the measured contact angle θ 0 because the increased roughness of the surface promotes wetting process via capillary forces therefore the increase in surface hydrophilicity for pes qldh membrane may be caused by both the hydrophilicity of the qac ldh composite and the increase in membrane surface roughness the pore size and porosity also influence the water flux of the membrane compared to the pristine pes membrane the pes q membrane has a higher pore size fig 5 c but a lower porosity fig s11 a leading to a decrease in membrane water flux the low porosity of pes q membranes is attributed to the hydrophobicity of qac the high viscosity of the casting solution causing decreased solvent evaporation rates mohsenpour et al 2022 during phase conversion and delaying polymer coalescence in the presence of the qac the strong steric interaction between the oxygen containing functional groups oh on the surface of ldh and the polymer chains leads to an increase in the viscosity of the casting solution han and nam 2002 which hinders the exchange kinetics between solvent and non solvent however the relatively hydrophilic ldh and qac ldh reduces the mixing gap between solvent and non solvent and thereby increases the thermodynamic instability of the phase inversion process facilitating the phase separation process which compensates the adverse effect of hindered exchange kinetics the compensation effect was confirmed by the increased porosity fig s11 a for pes ldh and pes qldh membranes because the increase in thermodynamic instability contributes to the increase in membrane porosity mohsenpour et al 2022 moreover the pes ldh and pes qldh membranes have an increased pore size causing an increase in membrane water flux the pes q and pes ldh membranes exhibit larger pore sizes fig 5 c which may be attributed to the release of qac and ldh into the non solvent during phase inversion resulting in larger pores on the membrane surface and consequently lower rejection of bsa fig s11 b however the pore size of pes qldh membrane is smaller than those of pes q and pes ldh membranes the bsa rejection is higher than those of pes q and pes qldh membrane which may be attributed to the minimal release of qac ldh during the phase inversion demonstrating that qac ldh can be stably immobilized into the membrane structure hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity also impact the antifouling behaviors of the membrane the frr fig 5 d of pes ldh and pes qldh membranes was higher than those of pes and pes q membranes indicating the hydrophilicity of ldh increases the anti organic fouling ability of the membrane the above results show that qac ldh can well compensate the deficiencies of qac alone as an antibacterial agent and enhance the properties of the membranes 3 4 dynamic antibiofouling experiments the antibiofouling behaviors of pes pes q and pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were further investigated in a dead end cell using synthetic wastewater containing e coli initial concentration of 107 cells ml 1 as the feed solution normalized water fluxes during the filtration of 8 l permeate figs 6 a and s12 a indicate a declined tendency for both pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes resulting from biofilm deposition on membrane surfaces during the experimental process the presence of e coli in the feedstock solution reduced the water flux of pes pes q and pes ldh membranes by 65 38 and 35 figs 6 a and s12 a respectively conversely the pes qldh membrane had only a 15 in decline water flux fig 6 a suggesting that the pes qldh membrane exhibits superior antibiofouling performance than the pristine pes membrane biofilm layers formed on surfaces of fouled pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were visualized using clsm the relatively less quantity of viable cells on the surface of pes qldh membrane compared to the pes pes q and pes ldh membranes figs 6 b c and s12 b c indicates that pes qldh membrane exhibits a superior bacteria killing behavior thanks to the combined biocidal effects by sharp nano edge of ldh and hydrophobic action of qac liu et al 2020 ma et al 2019 quantitative analysis of the biofilm thickness on the fouled membrane surface revealed that the biofilm thickness of pes qldh 4 8 0 7 µm was significantly less than that of pes 16 4 1 4 µm pes q 11 5 1 1 µm and pes ldh 10 2 0 6 µm the decrease in biofilm accumulation is consistent with the lower biofouling propensity in figs 6 a and s12 a implying the highly active antibiofouling behavior for pes qldh membranes compared to the antibiofouling behaviors of different membrane materials in published works our pes qldh membrane possesses high water flux with excellent antibacterial activity and antibiofouling behaviors table 2 indicating that pes qldh membranes is promising in practical membrane based wastewater treatment applications 3 5 antibiofouling mechanisms to further explore the antibiofouling mechanism of pes qldh membrane the bacterial adhesion behavior e coli and s aureus of different membrane surface was first investigated using the static contact method the surfaces of pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes all show notable inhibition on adhesion behaviors of e coli and s aureus compared to the pristine pes membrane fig 7 and the pes qldh membrane presents highest anti adhesion ability against both e coli and s aureus the inhibited adhesion for pes q pes ldh and pes qldh is potentially attributed to the indirect bacterial killing mechanism jiang et al 2013 the initially killed bacteria can release sos signals e g necrosignal and avoidance signal bhattacharyya et al 2020 to warn the live bacteria to move away from the membrane surface which thus inhibits bacterial adhesion and growth on membrane surface zhang et al 2016 among these membranes the inhibition of bacterial adhesion by the pes qldh membrane was most prominent owing to the synergistic antibacterial mechanism of qac and ldh furthermore the increased hydrophilicity for pes qldh membrane thanks to the hydrophilicity of ldh is also a possible reason for its anti bacterial adhesion ability the antibacterial properties of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were evaluated as well the distribution of bacteria on agar plates fig s13 demonstrates that pes qldh membrane exhibits the strongest antibacterial activity e coli and s aureus compared to pes membrane pes q and pes ldh membranes the quantification of the antibacterial activity fig 8 a and g displays that pes qldh membrane exhibits significant inhibition efficiency of 97 3 and 97 2 to e coli and s aureus meanwhile the pes q membrane shows inhibition efficiencies of 67 9 and 76 6 to e coli and s aureus while pes ldh membrane correspondingly has the efficiencies of 65 6 and 88 3 compared to s aureus e coli has more abundant lipids which are protective of the bacteria alkhalifa et al 2020 rendering e coli less susceptible to damage by qac and ldh therefore pes q and pes ldh membranes show higher inhibition efficiency against s aureus however due to the synergistic antibacterial effect of qac and ldh pes qldh membranes can break this limitation thus maintaining high antibacterial activity against both e coli and s aureus the results suggest that the high antibacterial activity of pes qldh membrane is largely attributed to the synergistic antibacterial mechanism of qac and ldh the synergistic antibacterial behavior of qac and ldh was further investigated by using sem to observe the cell integrity of the membrane surface e coli fig 8 b e and s aureus fig 8 h k the cell integrity of the e coli and s aureus on the surface of pes q membrane was disrupted compared to the pristine pes membrane this is attributed to the replacement of mg2 and ca2 ions in the cytoplasmic membrane by qac which then binds to the cell membrane through hydrophobicity disrupting the bacterial cell structure and intracellular matrix asri et al 2014 in addition the structure of e coli and s aureus on the surface of pes ldh membrane was also destroyed which was attributed to the sharp nano edge of the ldh scratching the cell structure and disrupting the cell integrity ma et al 2019 the destruction of the bacterial integrity of the pes qldh membrane surface was inferred to be derived from the synergistic antibacterial mechanism of qac and ldh negatively charged bacteria are electrostatically interacted with the positively charged qac ldh on the surface of the pes qldh membrane and then directly killed by the combined bactericidal action of qac and ldh destroying the integrity of the cells the synergistic antibacterial behaviors of qac and ldh on the surface of the pes qldh membrane produce a superior bactericidal activity direct killing and release more sos signals indirect killing producing outstanding antibiofouling ability kolodkin gal et al 2007 a possible mechanism for the antibiofouling ability of pes qldh membranes is proposed fig 9 the bacteria migrate to the pes qldh membrane surface and interact with the qac ldh which then inhibits biofilm formation by killing the bacteria through the synergistic interaction of qac and ldh the sharp edge of ldh can scratches the bacterial cell enabling qac ldh to puncture into the bacterial cell structure and disrupt the cytoplasmic structure through the bactericidal behaviors of qac and ldh resulting in the efflux of intracellular substances and eventually bacterial death furthermore the positive charge on the surface of ldh disrupts the distribution of positive charges on the bacterial surface producing physical tension that tears the cell wall and destroys the integrity of the cell and leading to bacterial death peng et al 2018 simultaneously pes qldh membrane also produces quorum sensing and releases sos signals as bacteria are killed on the membrane surface resulting in other bacterial moving away from the membrane surface and thus inhibiting the microbial growth and delaying the formation of biofilms zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the high antibacterial activity of pes qldh membranes produces superior antibiofouling performance implying a huge potential for long term applications in water and wastewater treatment 3 5 stability of antibacterial performance of pes qldh membrane the stability of qac ldh on the surface of pes qldh membranes is essential for the long term antifouling performance of the membranes the modified pes qldh membranes were exposed to bacterial suspension for 3 h and then cleaned by immersing into an aqueous solution of 0 05 vol naclo for 2 h after three exposure cleaning cycles pes qldh membrane persistently shows high inhibition efficiencies of 94 8 and 93 8 against e coli and s aureus figs s14 and 10 a moreover the element content on pes qldh membrane surface kept constant during fouling cleaning cycles fig 10 b the surface morphology of the membrane was not significantly different from that of the pristine pes qldh membrane after three fouling cleaning cycles fig 10 c and d indicating the high stability of qac ldh embedded in pes matrix ldh with high stability can prevent the rapid loss of the qac anchored in the interlayer space after naclo cleaning the stability of pes qldh membrane further validates the possibility of its long term antibiofouling application 4 conclusions qac ldh composite was prepared by intercalating cationic qac into the negatively charged interlayer space of ldh and successfully incorporated into pes uf membrane the hydrophilic ldh compensated the adverse impact of hydrophobic qac on property of the membrane the ldh enhanced the hydrophilicity water flux and resistance to organic fouling for the pes qldh membrane the pes qldh membrane exhibited superior antibiofouling performance than the control pes membrane with deposition of a thinner biofilm layer consisted of almost dead cells the superior antibacterial activity inhibits the adhesion and growth of bacteria on the membrane surface effectively retarding the formation of biofilms importantly the synergistic effect of qac and ldh of the pes qldh membrane resulted in its high biocidal activity based on both direct and indirect killing mechanisms the pes qldh membrane maintained a stable and high antibacterial activity after several fouling cleaning cycles these results imply that the pes qldh membrane provides an effective and promising strategy for its long term application in wastewater

biofilm formation on the surface or inside the matrix of membrane often results in frequent cleaning or even replacement of membranes lu et al 2016a this not only substantially increases the overall

extensive efforts have been dedicated to mitigating biofouling of membrane surfaces including optimization of operating conditions e g operating the membrane under sub critical flux matin et al 2011 feed solution pretreatment e g pre chlorination treatment prihasto et al 2009 and membrane modification liu et al 2017a yang et al 2016 among them fabrication of membranes with excellent antibiofouling properties is quite attractive due to its effectiveness and low impact on the operation of membrane based processes mo et al 2012 blending antibacterial agent into membrane matrix is a popular strategy to grant membrane antibiofouling performance liu et al 2017a rho et al 2021 several studies have shown that blended antibacterial agents including antibacterial polymers silver nanoparticles graphene oxides carbon nanotubes and quaternary ammonium compound qac are capable of inhibiting bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation on uf membranes bai et al 2020 ben sasson et al 2014 kang et al 2007 liu et al 2011 séon et al 2015 these antibacterial agents achieve microbial inactivation mainly through electrostatic action and possible penetration into the cell dizman et al 2006 but the presence of phospholipids provides a degree of protection to the microbial cell alkhalifa et al 2020 reducing the ability of antibacterial agents to puncture the cell and effectively kill the microorganisms blois and swarbrick 1972 this calls for a combination of antibacterial agent with other materials having strong cell puncturing capacity to obtain highly effective antibiofouling performance moreover the hydrophobic nature of some antibacterial agents e g qac may reduce the hydrophilicity of membrane meng et al 2015 which can result in a decreased water flux and even deteriorated anti organic fouling capacity therefore how to compensate the adverse impact of blended antibacterial agents on the membrane and further improve its antibiofouling ability remains a technical challenge two dimensional mgal layered double hydroxide mgal ldh may have the potential to overcome the possible negative impact of antibacterial agents and further enhance the antibiofouling performance of the membrane due to its unique properties of multilayered structure sharp edge and hydrophilicity abdollahi et al 2021 ma et al 2021 the multilayered mgal ldh has a positive surface charge and negative interlayer charge capable of intercalating positively charged antibacterial agent like qac into the interlayer spaces via facile self assembly kameda et al 2014 with the intercalation of an antibacterial agent the mgal ldh having a sharp edge can puncture the bacterial cell rasool et al 2016 and possibly allow intracellular release of antibacterial agent leading to an enhanced biocidal property additionally the hydrophilic nature of mgal ldh is capable of compensating the adverse impact of the hydrophobic antibacterial agent these potential advantages of mgal ldh promotes us to study whether blending of antibacterial agent intercalated mgal ldh can grant ultrafiltration membrane superior antibiofouling property on the other hand according to mean field theory rana et al 2000 the net exothermic mixing effect between pes and qac makes them easy to form homogeneous systems rana et al 1996b the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ldh can interact with the polymer chains to produce a mixing heat that promotes the formation of homogeneous systems of ldh and pes rana et al 1993 1996a moreover the synergistic heat mixing effect qac and pes ldh and pes can facilitate the homogeneous mixing of qac ldh and pes and consequently a more homogeneous mixed matrix membrane can be formed during the phase inversion process herein cationic qac was used as a model antibacterial agent to be intercalated into the interlayer space of ldh the assembled qac ldh was embedded in the pes matrix by phase inversion to fabricate pes membranes with antibiofouling performance since both qac and ldh are quite cost effective the fabrication of qac ldh incorporated pes uf membrane can be easily upscaled the qac ldh and modified pes membranes were characterized to evaluate whether the materials were successfully synthesized the antifouling performance of qac ldh incorporated pes membrane was evaluated and the antifouling mechanisms were illustrated in terms of microbial adhesion and biocidal effect the stability of qac ldh incorporated pes membrane was also evaluated after several fouling cleaning cycles the main issues addressed in the study include i how does qac ldh improve the water flux and antifouling organic fouling properties of membranes ii what are the antibiofouling performance and antibacterial mechanisms of qac ldh incorporated uf membranes and iii whether the qac ldh incorporated uf membrane can maintain its antibiofouling performance after cleaning 2 materials and methods 2

mixture rapidly followed by ultrasonication for 30 min with vigorous stirring the reaction was then performed at 150 c for 6 h after the reaction ldh was obtained after centrifugation washing and drying to intercalate ldh with the biocidal agent of qac the dried hydrophilic ldh was mixed with qac mass ratio of 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 in di water and stirred for 12 h to form the qac ldh composite fig 1 to determine the optimum dosage of each component a relatively wide range of component proportions is typically chosen for composite materials in this experiment a wide ratio of ldh and qac was chosen to determine the optimum composition of qac ldh i e mass ratio of 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 based on our previous experimental experience and literature jana et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 the common time

table 1 the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles has always been a difficult problem for mixed matrix membranes to alleviate this problem in this experiment the two step method was used to prepare the casting solution yu et al 2013 the commercial pes powder was first dried at 60 c for 24 h to remove moisture predetermined amounts of pes and pvp were then dissolved into nmp different ratios of qac ldh the ratios of ldh to qac were 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 were homogeneously dispersed in the other nmp solution the two solutions were finally mixed and stirred overnight at 60 c to form a homogeneous casting solution and degassed in an oven at 60 c for 12 h the casting solution was spread onto a non woven fabric shanghai tianlu textile co ltd using a casting knife with a height of 200 µm at a speed of 3 cm s 1 the non woven fabric containing the casting solution on the surface was immediately immersed in di water and the composite uf membrane was obtained after the phase conversion was completed these formed qac ldh blend pes membranes were denoted as pes qldh membranes meanwhile pristine pes membrane and pes membranes mixed with qac and ldh were also prepared according to the above method and denoted as pes pes q and pes ldh membranes respectively this two step method ensures that the nanoparticles can distribute uniformly in the membrane matrix and form a homogeneous structure

information 2 5 assessment of antibacterial behaviors the antibacterial performance of pristine pes and modified pes membranes was assessed using e coli and s aureus as model bacteria liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2018b the antibacterial activity of membranes was evaluated following published procedures liu et al 2017a briefly incubating the bacterial suspension in nutrient broth for 2 3 h obtain the strains in exponential phase excess macromolecules were then removed by centrifugation and the culture was carefully washed by sterile nacl 0 9 wt ultimately the bacteria were resuspended in saline solution to form a concentration of 107 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 the membrane active surface area 1 cm2 was washed three times with sterile pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 followed by uv sterilization for 30 min the active side of the membrane was exposed to the bacterial solution 1 ml at 37 c for 3 h after incubation the active side of the membrane was washed three times with saline solution then transferred into tubes containing 10 ml of saline solution and sonicated for 10 min to isolate the bacteria deposited on the membrane surface immediately afterward the serially diluted bacterial suspensions were plated on lb plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 c lastly the number of colonies was counted to assess the antibacterial properties of all membranes simultaneously the adhesion behaviors of e coli and s aureus on the surface of pristine membranes pes and modified membranes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes after 3 h of contact with the bacterial solution were also observed by sem to ensure the complete structure of the cells for sem observation the membrane was rinsed twice in pbs then fixed in 2 glutaraldehyde in 0 1 m sodium cacodylate buffer ph 7 4 for 5 min and dehydrated with different gradients of ethanol 70 80 90 and 100 and finally dried with tetramethylsilane 2 6 antibiofouling assay dynamic biofouling of membranes in a dead end cell with an effective membrane area of 12 6 cm2 was conducted municipal wastewater containing e coli at an original concentration of 107 cells ml 1 was synthesized according to the reported method as the feed solution ph 7 huang et al 2015 the system was operated at room temperature and operating pressure of 1 bar after completion of the biofouling experiments the membrane was collected for characterization a 1 cm2 of membrane coupon was obtained from the biofouled uf membrane and then stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits sypro orange and concavalin a to label viable dead cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps respectively and observed with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm nikon a1 japan the total biofilm thickness was calculated from the amounts of live cells dead cells and eps 2 7 evaluation of qac ldh stability in pes uf membrane the stability of qac ldh on the membrane surface was further evaluated by chemical cleaning in a typical manner qac ldh modified membranes pes qldh membrane active surface area 1 cm2 were placed in 24 well plates with each plate containing 1 ml of bacterial suspension e coli or s aureus 107 cells ml 1 and pre incubated for 3 h the membranes were cleaned by immersing in 0 05 vol solutions of naclo for 2 h after incubation and this cycle of biofouling cleaning was performed in triplicate the membrane was rinsed three times with sterile pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 after each biofouling experiment to ensure that the naclo was completely removed prior to the next biofouling the antibacterial activity of the membrane was evaluated by the plate counting method after three cycles of biofouling cleaning elemental content and surface morphology of biofouling and cleaned membranes were further determined by xps and sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of synthesized ldh and qac ldh the surface morphology and elemental distribution fig s1 fig s3 indicate that qac ldh and pes qldh membranes in different ratios were successfully prepared since the antibacterial efficiency was optimal for the pes membrane with qac to ldh ratio of 2 1 fig s4 the ratio of 2 1 for qac ldh was used for subsequent experiments properties of ldh and the antibacterial agents intercalated 2d composites qac ldh were analyzed by sem tem zeta potential and tga sem fig 2 a and tem fig 2 d images demonstrate that the synthesized ldh has a layered structure with sharp edges which allow the puncture of bacterial cell structures dong et al 2014 the xrd spectrum also proves that ldh fig s5 was successfully prepared yu et al 2012 moreover sem fig 2 b and tem fig 2 e images clearly show that qac ldh has the same layer structure as the pristine ldh and that the layer structure facilitates the penetration of qac ldh into the cell structure as expected characteristic elements fig 2 c derived from both ldh mg and al and qac c and n were detected indicating that the antibacterial agent qac has been successfully intercalated into ldh the ldh has a negatively charged interlayer which provides an appropriate space for intercalation of positively charged qac into it to form qac ldh furthermore the positive charge density fig 2 f of the obtained qac ldh 37 0 1 0 mv was significantly higher than that of both qac 27 1 1 1 mv and ldh 28 7 0 7 mv this is attributed to the fact that ldh has a structure with a positively charged surface and negatively charged interlayer lu et al 2016b thus the positive charge density increases significantly when the qac is intercalated into the nanoscale space of the interlayer the increased positive charge density of qac ldh contributes to enhanced electrostatic interaction with negatively charged microorganisms to further understand the properties of qac ldh its mass loss behavior under thermal condition were analyzed using tga fig 2 g which can help obtain the ratio of qac to ldh in qac ldh the tga results show that qac only has a mass loss stage between 200 c and 300 c whereas ldh includes three mass loss stages the loss of free water and interlayer water 40 c 180 c at the first stage the decomposition of internally bound water 180 c 400 c at the second stage and the internal dehydrogenation 400 c 500 c of the material at the third stage yang et al 2019 in contrast there are only two distinct stages of weight loss for qac ldh the first stage of about 58 less 260 c mass loss that corresponds to the pyrolysis of qac and the second stage of about 34 260 c 400 c mass loss that attributes to the decomposition of ldh the corresponding qac to ldh mass ratio of 1 7 was calculated from two stages of mass losses and derivative thermogravimetric curves fig 2 h which is in general consistent with the theoretical value of 2 during the material preparation meanwhile the tga results also confirm that the thermal stability of qac ldh is higher than that of qac thanks to the higher thermal stability of ldh 3 2 characterization of various uf membranes sem characterization fig 3 a d shows that the top surfaces of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were nearly identical cross sectional sem images of the membranes fig 3 e h also show that these membranes are all in typically asymmetric manners suggesting that the addition of qac ldh and qac ldh in this study did not change the inherent structure of the membrane moreover the surface of the pes qldh membrane presents the homogenous distribution of characteristic elements fig 3 i consistent with materials of pes c o and s qac n and ldh mg and al the pore size distribution fig s6 shows that the pores on the surface of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes are predominantly mesoporous with average surface pore sizes of 18 1 nm 27 4 nm 22 3 nm and 20 8 nm respectively table s1 surface pore density analysis shows that pes qldh 2 1 number cm2 membrane has a higher surface pore density compared to those of pes 0 8 number cm2 pes q 0 6 number cm2 and pes qldh 1 5 number cm2 membranes table s1 indicating that hydrophilic ldh not only increases the surface pore size of the membrane but also significantly increases surface pores density of the membrane the high surface pore density of the membrane potentially contributes to the increase in water flux suggesting that ldh can compensate the adverse effect of qac and increase the water flux of the membrane zeta potential measurement fig 3 j indicates significantly lower negative charge densities on the surface of pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membrane than pes membrane during the phase inversion process positively charged qac molecules fig 2 move towards the membrane surface and partially neutralize the negative charge of membrane surface resulting in a decrease in the net negative charge for the pes q membrane fig 3 j additionally the hydrophilicity of ldh increases the thermodynamic instability of the phase inversion process and facilitates the phase separation process mohsenpour et al 2022 this mechanism induced more ldh and qac ldh to move towards the membrane surface both ldh and qac ldh are positively charged fig 2 leading to a decrease in the net negative charge of membrane surface pes ldh and pes qldh membranes the functional groups and chemical composition of the membrane surfaces were determined using atr ftir and xps respectively compared to the pristine pes membrane fig 4 a the pes q membrane exhibits characteristic peaks at 1550 cm 1 and 2925 cm 1 for rn4 and ch2 the m o m m for al or mg peak from ldh pes ldh membrane can be detected at 430 cm 1 as expected the pes qldh membrane demonstrates the characteristic peaks from qac and ldh these results demonstrated successful preparation of pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes cao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 qualitative and quantitative analyses of the composition and content of the surface elements of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes by xps table s2 and fig s7 also confirm this result those membranes containing characteristic elements from qac and ldh the xps spectra of the surface of pes fig s8 a b pes q fig s8 c e pes ldh fig s8 f i and pes qldh fig 4 b f membrane were deconvoluted to obtain in depth information on the characteristics the c1s element on the surface of the membrane fig 4 b was divided into four peaks located at 284 2 ev 284 6 285 8 and 286 8 ev cc cn co and c s of which cc co and c s are chemical bonds for pes and cn is for qac liu et al 2016 the s o and c s peaks fig 4 c at 167 2 ev and 169 1 ev are typical chemical bonds of pes and the nh cn and c n fig 4 d at 398 7 ev 399 8 ev and 402 2 ev are the characteristic functional groups of qac sultana et al 2008 additionally the peaks of mg and al at 1303 9 ev and 73 9 ev fig 4 e f were also detected liu et al 2018 indicating that qac ldh was successfully incorporated into the polymer matrix of pes membrane which is expected to grant the membrane antibiofouling properties furthermore the tga curves fig s9 show that pes qldh membrane decomposes at higher temperatures than pes pes q and pes ldh membranes indicating that qac ldh increases the thermal stability of the membrane and contributes to improving its service life 3 3 performance evaluation on various uf membranes the flux hydrophilicity hydrophobicity average pore size and antifouling ability organic fouling of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were investigated to determine the physicochemical properties of the membrane surfaces compared to the pristine pes membrane 287 6 32 1l m 2 h 1 the water flux of the pes q membrane 210 4 10 5 l m 2 h 1 decreased fig 5 a probably attributed to the decrease in hydrophilicity of the pes q membrane 80 8 1 9 induced by the hydrophobicity of the qac conversely the water flux of the pes ldh 367 1 47 1 l m 2 h 1 and pes qldh 312 6 24 9 l m 2 h 1 membranes increased consistent with the increase in hydrophilicity of the pes ldh 52 1 1 4 and pes qldh 62 3 1 7 membranes this can be ascribed to the hydrophilicity of the ldh that compensates the adverse impacts of the hydrophobic qac fig 5 b the decrease in contact angle may also be associated with the change in membrane surface roughness fig s10 according to the wenzel equation cos θ 0 r cos θ where θ 0 and θ are the apparent measured and real contact angles of one surface respectively and r is the roughness factor drelich and chibowski 2010 an increase in the roughness r of one hydrophilic material θ 90 leads to a decrease in the measured contact angle θ 0 because the increased roughness of the surface promotes wetting process via capillary forces therefore the increase in surface hydrophilicity for pes qldh membrane may be caused by both the hydrophilicity of the qac ldh composite and the increase in membrane surface roughness the pore size and porosity also influence the water flux of the membrane compared to the pristine pes membrane the pes q membrane has a higher pore size fig 5 c but a lower porosity fig s11 a leading to a decrease in membrane water flux the low porosity of pes q membranes is attributed to the hydrophobicity of qac the high viscosity of the casting solution causing decreased solvent evaporation rates mohsenpour et al 2022 during phase conversion and delaying polymer coalescence in the presence of the qac the strong steric interaction between the oxygen containing functional groups oh on the surface of ldh and the polymer chains leads to an increase in the viscosity of the casting solution han and nam 2002 which hinders the exchange kinetics between solvent and non solvent however the relatively hydrophilic ldh and qac ldh reduces the mixing gap between solvent and non solvent and thereby increases the thermodynamic instability of the phase inversion process facilitating the phase separation process which compensates the adverse effect of hindered exchange kinetics the compensation effect was confirmed by the increased porosity fig s11 a for pes ldh and pes qldh membranes because the increase in thermodynamic instability contributes to the increase in membrane porosity mohsenpour et al 2022 moreover the pes ldh and pes qldh membranes have an increased pore size causing an increase in membrane water flux the pes q and pes ldh membranes exhibit larger pore sizes fig 5 c which may be attributed to the release of qac and ldh into the non solvent during phase inversion resulting in larger pores on the membrane surface and consequently lower rejection of bsa fig s11 b however the pore size of pes qldh membrane is smaller than those of pes q and pes ldh membranes the bsa rejection is higher than those of pes q and pes qldh membrane which may be attributed to the minimal release of qac ldh during the phase inversion demonstrating that qac ldh can be stably immobilized into the membrane structure hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity also impact the antifouling behaviors of the membrane the frr fig 5 d of pes ldh and pes qldh membranes was higher than those of pes and pes q membranes indicating the hydrophilicity of ldh increases the anti organic fouling ability of the membrane the above results show that qac ldh can well compensate the deficiencies of qac alone as an antibacterial agent and enhance the properties of the membranes 3 4 dynamic antibiofouling experiments the antibiofouling behaviors of pes pes q and pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were further investigated in a dead end cell using synthetic wastewater containing e coli initial concentration of 107 cells ml 1 as the feed solution normalized water fluxes during the filtration of 8 l permeate figs 6 a and s12 a indicate a declined tendency for both pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes resulting from biofilm deposition on membrane surfaces during the experimental process the presence of e coli in the feedstock solution reduced the water flux of pes pes q and pes ldh membranes by 65 38 and 35 figs 6 a and s12 a respectively conversely the pes qldh membrane had only a 15 in decline water flux fig 6 a suggesting that the pes qldh membrane exhibits superior antibiofouling performance than the pristine pes membrane biofilm layers formed on surfaces of fouled pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were visualized using clsm the relatively less quantity of viable cells on the surface of pes qldh membrane compared to the pes pes q and pes ldh membranes figs 6 b c and s12 b c indicates that pes qldh membrane exhibits a superior bacteria killing behavior thanks to the combined biocidal effects by sharp nano edge of ldh and hydrophobic action of qac liu et al 2020 ma et al 2019 quantitative analysis of the biofilm thickness on the fouled membrane surface revealed that the biofilm thickness of pes qldh 4 8 0 7 µm was significantly less than that of pes 16 4 1 4 µm pes q 11 5 1 1 µm and pes ldh 10 2 0 6 µm the decrease in biofilm accumulation is consistent with the lower biofouling propensity in figs 6 a and s12 a implying the highly active antibiofouling behavior for pes qldh membranes compared to the antibiofouling behaviors of different membrane materials in published works our pes qldh membrane possesses high water flux with excellent antibacterial activity and antibiofouling behaviors table 2 indicating that pes qldh membranes is promising in practical membrane based wastewater treatment applications 3 5 antibiofouling mechanisms to further explore the antibiofouling mechanism of pes qldh membrane the bacterial adhesion behavior e coli and s aureus of different membrane surface was first investigated using the static contact method the surfaces of pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes all show notable inhibition on adhesion behaviors of e coli and s aureus compared to the pristine pes membrane fig 7 and the pes qldh membrane presents highest anti adhesion ability against both e coli and s aureus the inhibited adhesion for pes q pes ldh and pes qldh is potentially attributed to the indirect bacterial killing mechanism jiang et al 2013 the initially killed bacteria can release sos signals e g necrosignal and avoidance signal bhattacharyya et al 2020 to warn the live bacteria to move away from the membrane surface which thus inhibits bacterial adhesion and growth on membrane surface zhang et al 2016 among these membranes the inhibition of bacterial adhesion by the pes qldh membrane was most prominent owing to the synergistic antibacterial mechanism of qac and ldh furthermore the increased hydrophilicity for pes qldh membrane thanks to the hydrophilicity of ldh is also a possible reason for its anti bacterial adhesion ability the antibacterial properties of pes pes q pes ldh and pes qldh membranes were evaluated as well the distribution of bacteria on agar plates fig s13 demonstrates that pes qldh membrane exhibits the strongest antibacterial activity e coli and s aureus compared to pes membrane pes q and pes ldh membranes the quantification of the antibacterial activity fig 8 a and g displays that pes qldh membrane exhibits significant inhibition efficiency of 97 3 and 97 2 to e coli and s aureus meanwhile the pes q membrane shows inhibition efficiencies of 67 9 and 76 6 to e coli and s aureus while pes ldh membrane correspondingly has the efficiencies of 65 6 and 88 3 compared to s aureus e coli has more abundant lipids which are protective of the bacteria alkhalifa et al 2020 rendering e coli less susceptible to damage by qac and ldh therefore pes q and pes ldh membranes show higher inhibition efficiency against s aureus however due to the synergistic antibacterial effect of qac and ldh pes qldh membranes can break this limitation thus maintaining high antibacterial activity against both e coli and s aureus the results suggest that the high antibacterial activity of pes qldh membrane is largely attributed to the synergistic antibacterial mechanism of qac and ldh the synergistic antibacterial behavior of qac and ldh was further investigated by using sem to observe the cell integrity of the membrane surface e coli fig 8 b e and s aureus fig 8 h k the cell integrity of the e coli and s aureus on the surface of pes q membrane was disrupted compared to the pristine pes membrane this is attributed to the replacement of mg2 and ca2 ions in the cytoplasmic membrane by qac which then binds to the cell membrane through hydrophobicity disrupting the bacterial cell structure and intracellular matrix asri et al 2014 in addition the structure of e coli and s aureus on the surface of pes ldh membrane was also destroyed which was attributed to the sharp nano edge of the ldh scratching the cell structure and disrupting the cell integrity ma et al 2019 the destruction of the bacterial integrity of the pes qldh membrane surface was inferred to be derived from the synergistic antibacterial mechanism of qac and ldh negatively charged bacteria are electrostatically interacted with the positively charged qac ldh on the surface of the pes qldh membrane and then directly killed by the combined bactericidal action of qac and ldh destroying the integrity of the cells the synergistic antibacterial behaviors of qac and ldh on the surface of the pes qldh membrane produce a superior bactericidal activity direct killing and release more sos signals indirect killing producing outstanding antibiofouling ability kolodkin gal et al 2007 a possible mechanism for the antibiofouling ability of pes qldh membranes is proposed fig 9 the bacteria migrate to the pes qldh membrane surface and interact with the qac ldh which then inhibits biofilm formation by killing the bacteria through the synergistic interaction of qac and ldh the sharp edge of ldh can scratches the bacterial cell enabling qac ldh to puncture into the bacterial cell structure and disrupt the cytoplasmic structure through the bactericidal behaviors of qac and ldh resulting in the efflux of intracellular substances and eventually bacterial death furthermore the positive charge on the surface of ldh disrupts the distribution of positive charges on the bacterial surface producing physical tension that tears the cell wall and destroys the integrity of the cell and leading to bacterial death peng et al 2018 simultaneously pes qldh membrane also produces quorum sensing and releases sos signals as bacteria are killed on the membrane surface resulting in other bacterial moving away from the membrane surface and thus inhibiting the microbial growth and delaying the formation of biofilms zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the high antibacterial activity of pes qldh membranes produces superior antibiofouling performance implying a huge potential for long term applications in water and wastewater treatment 3 5 stability of antibacterial performance of pes qldh membrane the stability of qac ldh on the surface of pes qldh membranes is essential for the long term antifouling performance of the membranes the modified pes qldh membranes were exposed to bacterial suspension for 3 h and then cleaned by immersing into an aqueous solution of 0 05 vol naclo for 2 h after three exposure cleaning cycles pes qldh membrane persistently shows high inhibition efficiencies of 94 8 and 93 8 against e coli and s aureus figs s14 and 10 a moreover the element content on pes qldh membrane surface kept constant during fouling cleaning cycles fig 10 b the surface morphology of the membrane was not significantly different from that of the pristine pes qldh membrane after three fouling cleaning cycles fig 10 c and d indicating the high stability of qac ldh embedded in pes matrix ldh with high stability can prevent the rapid loss of the qac anchored in the interlayer space after naclo cleaning the stability of pes qldh membrane further validates the possibility of its long term antibiofouling application 4 conclusions qac ldh composite was prepared by intercalating cationic qac into the negatively charged interlayer space of ldh and successfully incorporated into pes uf membrane the hydrophilic ldh compensated the adverse impact of hydrophobic qac on property of the membrane the ldh enhanced the hydrophilicity water flux and resistance to organic fouling for the pes qldh membrane the pes qldh membrane exhibited superior antibiofouling performance than the control pes membrane with deposition of a thinner biofilm layer consisted of almost dead cells the superior antibacterial activity inhibits the adhesion and growth of bacteria on the membrane surface effectively retarding the formation of biofilms importantly the synergistic effect of qac and ldh of the pes qldh membrane resulted in its high biocidal activity based on both direct and indirect killing mechanisms the pes qldh membrane maintained a stable and high antibacterial activity after several fouling cleaning cycles these results imply that the pes qldh membrane provides an effective and promising strategy for its long term application in wastewater

spring and summer among the fishing harbours the highest detection rate of advs was observed in yenpudongang in all seasons however puoziliao was the only site at which advs were not detected during the study period adv detection at sampling sites may be correlated with sewage and livestock wastewater discharge via outflow of nearby rivers to fishing ports statistical analysis mann whitney u test based on data from water quality indicators revealed that the presence of advs was significantly associated with the heterotrophic plate count ph and salinity human and swine population data from

anthropogenic activities including sewage leaking outfalls and urban runoff eifan 2013 faecal contamination may play an important role in the occurrence and epidemiology of enteric viruses sdiri loulizi et al 2010 among them adenoviruses advs have been identified as one of the dominant enteric virus groups in contaminated water jiang 2006 advs are non enveloped double stranded dna viruses

particularly human adenoviruses hadvs are highly resistant to the conventional sewage treatment system and can survive critical environments to have better survival efficiency haramoto et al 2007 moreover because of hadvs lack a viral envelope they are resistant to environmental degradation and can remain infectious for an extended time carducci et al 2009 notably hadvs have been proposed as indicators of human faecal contamination in aquatic systems rusinol et al 2014 coastal discharge of inadequately treated sewage water results in contamination of fishing harbours fhs and in the harvest of fish with hadvs poor hygiene and improper sanitation in fhs may also lead to contamination of seafood the consumption of which leads to transmission of hadvs bosch et al 2009 apart from

serotypes 1 75 in seven species hadv species a g and five padv serotypes padv serotypes 1 5 in three species padv species a c have been identified dhingra et al 2019 king et al 2012 particularly hadv serotypes 40 and 41 are associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in children gonçalves et al 2011 modarres and modarres 2006 padv 5 has been identified as the major serotype in water samples and causes subclinical infections in pigs hundesa et al 2006 our previous studies showed that padvs 5 and 41 are the dominant species in the aquatic environments of taiwan huang et al 2015 faecal contamination in rivers is mostly associated with wastewater from livestock or domestic discharge from nearby human townships furthermore porcine faeces belongs to the wet type which differs from that in other domestic animals such as cows and chickens direct discharge of wastewater from nearby piggery farms may lead to a higher risk of river contamination in taiwan 9 1 19 8 of infectious viral gastroenteritis cases are associated with adv chen et al 2007 lu et al 2009 monitoring of marine and river ecosystems is necessary to understand the occurrence of advs we investigated the occurrence

program the phylogenetic distances were calculated using the maximum composite likelihood model and were later analyzed by the neighbour joining method using mega software version 7 0 mega software north salt lake ut usa the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the neighbour joining method with 500 bootstrap simulations 2 6 statistical analyses the test of independence in chi square was used to evaluate whether the rank of detection rate was likely to be related to the seasons regions and fhs two groups were analyzed one with at least one adv present compared with the absence of advs in the fh of a season and a group showing a detection rate of 50 compared with 50 at the fh of a season the water quality parameters of samples from an fh in each season were considered as a clustered data set and referred to as the site the mann whitney u test was used to analyze the significance of differences in the dependent variable between the adv positive negative detection rate 50 and 50 sites and water quality indicators from each site the data for these parameters are presented as the mean values from each site spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the relationship between various parameters including the prevalence of advs hadvs and padvs in the fhs human and swine populations of the local township and river drainage basin and microbial water quality indicators such as heterotrophic bacteria total coliforms and e coli counts a 1 threshold was used for spearman s rank correlation analysis to overcome the inflation of type i errors given the number of tests performed all statistical analyzes were performed using r programming software version 3 6 0 the r group for statistical computing vienna austria 3 results 3 1 presence and seasonal occurrence rates of adenovirus the overall and seasonal detection rates of advs across the fhs are summarised in table 1 sixty six of the 177 water samples 37 1 were contaminated with advs during the study period specifically 24 7 44 177 and 12 4 22 177 of hadvs and padvs respectively were detected throughout the study period a higher rate of adv detection was recorded in fall 48 8 followed by in spring 35 6 and summer 35 6 however this ranking was not significant chi square test p 0 122 the lowest detection rate was observed in winter 28 5 and hadvs and padvs were detected in all seasons except for padvs in fall 0 however hadvs were dominant in fall 48 8 followed by spring 20 summer 15 6 and winter 14 3 this ranking was statistically significant chi square test p 10 4 the prevalence of padvs was highest in summer 20 followed by in spring 15 6 and winter 14 3 this ranking was significant chi square test p 0 0004 the detection rates of advs in four regions of fhs are listed in table 2 among these regions the southern fhs had the highest detection rate of advs 56 7 followed by the northern 38 9 central 23 3 and eastern 19 fhs respectively moreover hadvs were detected at a higher rate in the northern fhs 36 1 followed by the rates in the southern 33 3 eastern 19 and central 11 7 fhs padv were detected at a higher rate in the southern 23 3 followed by the rates in the central 11 7 and northern 2 8 fhs the detection rate rankings of advs hadvs and padvs by region were significant chi square test p 10 4 p 0 0024 p 10 4 respectively but were not statistically significant for fh sites however padvs were not detected in any sample from the eastern fh tx fh exhibited the highest prevalence 91 7 followed by ypdg 87 5 and ya 58 3 the lowest detection rates of advs were recorded for fj 8 3 wtstl 8 3 and wc 8 3 fh similarly none of the water samples contained advs in the pzl fh in the central region however the prevalence of hadvs and padvs was 0 50 and 0 58 4 respectively hadvs showed a high prevalence in ya 50 nl 50 and ypdg 45 8 fh consistently a high prevalence of padvs was observed in tx 58 4 and ypdg 41 7 fh none of the water samples collected from the pzl fh in the central region contained hadvs or padvs 3 2 distribution of advs hotspots in the fishing harbours the geographical distribution of the adv sampling sites and their detection results in various seasons across the experimental fhs in taiwan are illustrated in fig 1 pzl fh was the only sampling location at which advs were not detected in any of the four seasons according to the surrounding environment there are few human activities and no rivers or large drainage systems near the pzl fh similarly the fj wc and hl fhs only showed advs in the fall season 3 3 genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of adv sixty six adv positive samples were subjected to nucleic acid sequencing among the fhs advs were detected in samples from ya nl tx and ypdg in all four seasons table 3 in contrast the pzl fh contained no adv load throughout the study period however advs were detected at other fhs in the fall the remaining fhs contained advs in at least one season fj wc wtstl and hl or two seasons bd xd and fg during the study period the two major genotypes human and porcine advs were the dominant species in the samples obtained from all fhs among them four serotypes a species hadv serotype 12 f species hadv serotypes 40 and 41 and c species padv serotype 5 were detected in a higher proportion compared to those of other serotypes fig s1 the dominant serotypes in the seawater of fhs were hadv serotype 41 63 6 42 66 and padv serotype 5 33 3 22 66 the genotypic distribution of adv serotypes across fhs in taiwan is summarised in table s2 ypdg fh was the only port at which all hadv serotypes 12 40 and 41 and padv serotype 5 were detected 3 4 relationship between advs water quality parameters and human swine population nonparametric statistical tests were performed to determine the relationship between the presence or absence of advs in seawater and water quality indicators we analyzed two instances of the presence or absence of advs using the mann whitney u test the results are shown in tables 4 and s3 a significant difference was observed between adv positive and adv negative samples with respect to the heterotrophic plate count ph and salinity mann whitney u test p 0 05 the presence of advs was associated with a higher heterotrophic plate count and lower ph and conductivity than those of adv negative samples the results of spearman s rank correlation analysis of various parameters including the human and swine populations of the local township and river drainage basin prevalence of advs hadvs and padvs in the fhs and water quality microbial indicators are illustrated in table 5 a significant positive correlation p 0 01 was observed between the swine population in the river drainage basin and detection rates of padv r 0 692 and total coliform count r 0 736 we also analysed the correlation between the detection of advs hadvs and padvs and microbial indicators of water quality such as the heterotrophic plate count total coliform count and e coli count using spearman s rank correlation coefficient the detection rates of advs and padvs were significantly correlated with the e coli count r 0 683 p 0 01 and r 0 792 p 0 001 respectively however the adv hadv and padv detection rates and heterotrophic plate counts were not significantly correlated p 0 30 the ranking of padv occurrence was significantly correlated with the river drainage basin swine and e coli populations 4 discussion we characterised the presence distribution and quantification of advs in seawater samples collected from the main fhs in taiwan our results provide an overview of adv contamination levels and their seasonal variations in the water of fhs adv is detected year round in taiwan and several communal outbreaks have been reported chang et al 2008 cheng et al 2008 ho et al 1999 lin et al 2004 hence it is necessary to identify the sources of viral spread to plan remedial action the overall detection rate of advs in seawater of the fh was 37 1 previous studies conducted in australia spain georgia sweden greece and taiwan showed that advs are abundant in sewage contaminated coastal and river waters with detection rates of 24 77 36 6 32 3 36 5 and 34 3 respectively fong and lipp 2005 grohmann et al 1993 pina et al 1998 rusinol et al 2014 tao et al 2016 in this study the southern fh showed the highest levels 56 7 of advs during the study period our previous study of the puzi river in southern taiwan revealed the presence of hadvs in river water 34 3 which have been associated with domestic and livestock wastewater contamination due to anthropogenic activities tao et al 2016 moreover many possible pollution sources such as pig farms puzi hospital and chiayi city wastewater discharge units are located near the upper reaches of the puzi river the outflow of the puzi river and its tributaries may have resulted in water contamination in the fhs in southern taiwan the tx fh in central taiwan exhibited the highest prevalence 91 7 and large numbers of adv positive samples for both human and animal genotypes throughout the study period reflecting urban discharge into the fh padvs have been detected in the zhuoshui river in central taiwan suggesting faecal contamination huang et al 2015 runoff from the zhuoshi river may have resulted in adv contamination of the tx fh and nearby harbours the highest rate of adv hadv padv detection was recorded in fall followed by in spring and summer compared to other enteric viruses the detection rate of advs significantly differs by season water type and sampling extent félix et al 2010 huang et al 2015 a previous study conducted on five rivers in europe and south america reported that hadv prevalence was with the lowest numbers in fall rainy season in mediterranean areas and that padvs occurrences were associated with intensive livestock farming around river basins rusinol et al 2014 in taiwan frequent heavy rainfall and thunderstorms occur mainly during the spring and summer therefore the higher drainage or river water flow due to the rainy season may dilute contaminated waters leading to lower adv detection rates although the dry fall season receives less rainfall than other seasons in taiwan pollution sources are becoming concentrated resulting in a higher prevalence of advs moreover the reduction in river flow levels during the fall season results in lower dilution of the virus load and therefore increased viral contamination when discharged into the sea this finding agrees with the results of a previous study conducted in taiwan in which higher rates of adv detection were observed in fall 37 5 than in spring 13 9 and summer 9 7 tao et al 2016 large numbers of clinical cases of hadv infections occurred mostly in the fall 35 in taiwan tao et al 2016 genotyping analysis showed that hadvs were the most prevalent genotype detected in all fhs this finding is similar to that of other studies showing that hadvs are the common adv genotype found in surface waters vieira et al 2016 the diversity of the detected advs in the aquatic environment may reflect the specific viruses that were actively circulating within the population at different time points prevost et al 2015 higher detection rates of hadvs were observed at the sampling site because of the stability and intermittent shedding of this virus via human faeces wyn jones et al 2011 particularly the hadvs f species serotype 41 was the dominant serotype in our study followed by the f species serotype 40 and a species 12 a previous study conducted in europe revealed the predominant hadv serotypes in seawater such as hadv serotypes 1 2 3 12 31 40 and 41 among these hadv serotype 41 showed a high detection rate of 41 5 22 53 wyn jones et al 2011 similarly most serotypes detected in various environmental water bodies and effluent wastewater samples were hadv serotype 41 hewitt et al 2011 huang et al 2015 van heerden et al 2005 vergara et al 2016 which causes gastroenteritis in children under four years of age allard et al 2001 however hadv serotype 12 which may cause acute haemorrhagic cystitis in children formiga cruz et al 2002 was detected in only a single sample in this study padvs were detected at a very low rate at most sampling sites padvs are endemic in most conventional swine herds worldwide and are prevalent in piggery units and slaughterhouse wastewater which may in turn be associated with subclinical infection hundesa et al 2006 padv serotype 5 was the predominant genotype detected in river water in new zealand and spain and generally causes gastrointestinal disease and diarrhoea in swine fongaro et al 2015 hundesa et al 2006 wolf et al 2010 the tx and ypdg fhs were the only sites showing a high rate of padv detection resulting from nonhuman contamination during the study period the above mentioned areas in taiwan are populated with a greater number of piggery farms and comparatively higher swine population of 428 860 and 794 634 respectively compared to others table s2 specifically the river near the ypdg fh donggang river is a top ranked animal faeces polluted river in taiwan a previous study of the zhuoshui river in central taiwan supports our findings and the river was found to be contaminated with padv serotype 5 possibly via discharge of livestock farm wastewater into the river huang et al 2015 we hypothesised that padvs detected at a lower rate in the remaining fhs are associated with higher dilution of wastewater flow out drainage from piggery farms in those areas we found that the presence or absence table 4 or detection rates of 50 or 50 table s3 of advs were correlated with water quality indicators heterotrophic plate count ph and salinity a comparison of the data shown in tables 4 and s3 revealed a similar result in the presence or absence of advs regarding the correlation with the water quality parameters the p values associated with total coliforms and e coli shown in table s3 were smaller than those shown in table 4 implying that adv rich sites have a stronger association with faecal contamination indicators a previous study reported a significant association between the presence of hadvs and various physicochemical parameters silva et al 2011 advs have been proposed as water quality indicators for human and animal faecal pollution rames et al 2016 in our study the predominance of advs in seawater may have resulted from direct discharge of non disinfected wastewater from nearby townships or livestock farms via nearby rivers similarly the detection of advs and padvs in seawater samples was positively correlated with the e coli count indicating a relationship between the presence of advs and padvs and the bacteriological indicators present in seawater samples moreover the prolonged occurrence of bacteria in seawater may lead to the accumulation of coliforms in fish harvested from harbours during periods of high faecal and sewage discharge by the human population and untreated wastewater leakage into the coastal ecosystem the prevalence of hadvs increases miagostovich et al 2008 this indicates an actual risk of hadv transmission through seawater and contaminated waters in fhs may increase the risk of waterborne infections in humans the prevalence of advs in large townships may be more consistent over time because of the relative homogeneity of wastewater discharge from nearby infrastructures similarly a significant positive correlation was found between padv detection in the swine population in the samples obtained from the river drainage basin and e coli and total coliform parameters padvs were suitable for monitoring wastewater discharge from nearby livestock farms in fhs the fhs considered in our study may be impacted by wastewater release urban runoff and livestock farm discharge via outflow of nearby rivers therefore the detection frequency of advs was also high hence identifying human and swine faecal sources would enable the identification of infrastructure upgrades for better targeting in addition the prevalence and seasonal detection of adv genotypes in seawater samples which are related to acute gastroenteritis and diarrhoea are a potential risk for populations in contact with contaminated seawater one limitation of this study is that we used a single method for evaluating the viral concentration additionally viral inhibition was not examined however the american public health association indicated that current viral concentration methods are still being researched modified and improved apha 2017 moreover nested pcr is highly sensitive and can be used to reduce the interference of inhibitors during qualitative detection of microorganisms in aquatic environments hsu et al 2021 jalal et al 2021 sharifdini et al 2015 a recent study provided environmental microbiology minimum information guidelines for assessing and standardising quantitative pcr qpcr and digital pcr dpcr quality for environmental microbiological research borchardt et al 2021 qpcr and dpcr provide information on disease risk thus qpcr or dpcr assays for quantitatively detecting advs are needed but must strictly follow environmental microbiology minimum information guidelines 5 conclusion we investigated the occurrence seasonal distribution and genotypes of advs in the main fhs in taiwan along with their correlation with water quality the presence or absence of advs in the fhs was mainly correlated with human and swine populations in the corresponding watersheds the high prevalence of hadvs and padvs in fhs poses health risks to humans and animals exposed to contaminated water the swine population in the river drainage basin showed a statistically significant and positive correlation with padv detection and microbial water quality indicators e coli and total coliforms advs cause serotype specific host responses thus padv contamination in water is associated with swine livestock these results suggest that the presence of padvs in fhs is a useful indicator of animal faecal contamination in nearby rivers or drainage thus adv detection in fish ports may represent the pollution levels in nearby rivers or drainage our preliminary results indicate the need for more rigid control of effluent discharge near townships and livestock farms further studies are required to evaluate adv contamination in seafood harvested from fhs funding this research was supported by the ministry of science and technology of taiwan most 109 2116 m 194 013 and taiwan centers for disease control

15887,adenoviruses advs are a major cause of clinical infections and have been proposed as indicators of water quality however quantitative data on the environmental prevalence of advs is lacking we investigated the prevalence distribution seasonal occurrence quantity and genotype of advs in 13 fishing harbours in taiwan advs in the water samples were isolated by membrane filtration and the adv dna was extracted next advs were detected using nested polymerase chain reaction genotyping and phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify various adv genotypes present in the water samples the f species human adv hadv serotype 41 63 6 and c species porcine adv padv serotype 5 33 3 were more prevalent than the other serotypes the prevalence of advs was highest in the fall followed by in the spring and summer among the fishing harbours the highest detection rate of advs was observed in yenpudongang in all seasons however puoziliao was the only site at which advs were not detected during the study period adv detection at sampling sites may be correlated with sewage and livestock wastewater discharge via outflow of nearby rivers to fishing ports statistical analysis mann whitney u test based on data from water quality indicators revealed that the presence of advs was significantly associated with the heterotrophic plate count ph and salinity human and swine population data from nearby local townships and river drainage basins were collected from the taiwan central government s website the data were analyzed using spearman s rank correlation coefficient to determine the relationship between the prevalence of advs hadvs and padvs in fishing harbours and microbial water quality indicators statistical evidence indicated that the detection levels of hadvs and padvs in fishing harbours were mainly associated with human and swine populations in the corresponding river drainage basin respectively additionally the swine population in the river drainage basin was positively correlated with microbial water quality indicators graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine ecosystem fishing harbours human and porcine adenoviruses nested pcr phylogenetic studies statistical analysis 1 introduction water quality may be strongly affected by the presence of enteric viruses which are commonly introduced into aquatic environments through anthropogenic activities including sewage leaking outfalls and urban runoff eifan 2013 faecal contamination may play an important role in the occurrence and epidemiology of enteric viruses sdiri loulizi et al 2010 among them adenoviruses advs have been identified as one of the dominant enteric virus groups in contaminated water jiang 2006 advs are non enveloped double stranded dna viruses with sizes of 70 90 nm they are persistent and ubiquitous and have been associated with a wide range of viral disease outbreaks in countries such as the united states europe china egypt and taiwan elmahdy et al 2019 kajon et al 2010 lu et al 2014 tsou et al 2012 wyn jones et al 2011 these important etiological viral agents of waterborne diseases cause respiratory illnesses acute conjunctivitis and gastroenteritis outbreaks in children and adults larrañaga et al 2000 zlateva et al 2005 advs have been reported as the most resistant enteric viruses to uv inactivation nwachuku et al 2005 particularly human adenoviruses hadvs are highly resistant to the conventional sewage treatment system and can survive critical environments to have better survival efficiency haramoto et al 2007 moreover because of hadvs lack a viral envelope they are resistant to environmental degradation and can remain infectious for an extended time carducci et al 2009 notably hadvs have been proposed as indicators of human faecal contamination in aquatic systems rusinol et al 2014 coastal discharge of inadequately treated sewage water results in contamination of fishing harbours fhs and in the harvest of fish with hadvs poor hygiene and improper sanitation in fhs may also lead to contamination of seafood the consumption of which leads to transmission of hadvs bosch et al 2009 apart from hadvs zoonotic advs can infect other mammalian hosts including swine bovines and canines and may cause asymptomatic or fatal diseases borkenhagen et al 2019 zoonotic transmission of advs between humans and nonhuman primates has been reported borkenhagen et al 2019 medkour et al 2020 among them padvs are effective markers of animal faecal contamination in the environment fongaro et al 2015 as they are commonly disseminated within the swine population as well as residual water from pig farms hundesa et al 2009 causing respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses in swine populations fongaro et al 2015 a molecular method nested polymerase chain reaction pcr enables the specific and rapid detection of advs present in water samples rigotto et al 2005 at present 75 hadv serotypes hadv serotypes 1 75 in seven species hadv species a g and five padv serotypes padv serotypes 1 5 in three species padv species a c have been identified dhingra et al 2019 king et al 2012 particularly hadv serotypes 40 and 41 are associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in children gonçalves et al 2011 modarres and modarres 2006 padv 5 has been identified as the major serotype in water samples and causes subclinical infections in pigs hundesa et al 2006 our previous studies showed that padvs 5 and 41 are the dominant species in the aquatic environments of taiwan huang et al 2015 faecal contamination in rivers is mostly associated with wastewater from livestock or domestic discharge from nearby human townships furthermore porcine faeces belongs to the wet type which differs from that in other domestic animals such as cows and chickens direct discharge of wastewater from nearby piggery farms may lead to a higher risk of river contamination in taiwan 9 1 19 8 of infectious viral gastroenteritis cases are associated with adv chen et al 2007 lu et al 2009 monitoring of marine and river ecosystems is necessary to understand the occurrence of advs we investigated the occurrence distribution and seasonal occurrence of advs in 13 fhs in taiwan these fhs are primarily used for distant water and as inshore fisheries furthermore adv genotypes were identified by sequencing and their phylogenetic distributions were analyzed hadvs and padvs were predominant in our samples to confirm the results we collected and evaluated human and swine samples and evaluated their potential as pollution sources near fhs in addition the relationships between the human and swine populations of the local township and river drainage basin and prevalence of advs hadvs and padvs in the fhs and water quality indicators were statistically analyzed moreover we analyzed the differences between two independent groups such as adv positive negative samples and various water quality indicators 2

program the phylogenetic distances were calculated using the maximum composite likelihood model and were later analyzed by the neighbour joining method using mega software version 7 0 mega software north salt lake ut usa the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the neighbour joining method with 500 bootstrap simulations 2 6 statistical analyses the test of independence in chi square was used to evaluate whether the rank of detection rate was likely to be related to the seasons regions and fhs two groups were analyzed one with at least one adv present compared with the absence of advs in the fh of a season and a group showing a detection rate of 50 compared with 50 at the fh of a season the water quality parameters of samples from an fh in each season were considered as a clustered data set and referred to as the site the mann whitney u test was used to analyze the significance of differences in the dependent variable between the adv positive negative detection rate 50 and 50 sites and water quality indicators from each site the data for these parameters are presented as the mean values from each site spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the relationship between various parameters including the prevalence of advs hadvs and padvs in the fhs human and swine populations of the local township and river drainage basin and microbial water quality indicators such as heterotrophic bacteria total coliforms and e coli counts a 1 threshold was used for spearman s rank correlation analysis to overcome the inflation of type i errors given the number of tests performed all statistical analyzes were performed using r programming software version 3 6 0 the r group for statistical computing vienna austria 3 results 3 1 presence and seasonal occurrence rates of adenovirus the overall and seasonal detection rates of advs across the fhs are summarised in table 1 sixty six of the 177 water samples 37 1 were contaminated with advs during the study period specifically 24 7 44 177 and 12 4 22 177 of hadvs and padvs respectively were detected throughout the study period a higher rate of adv detection was recorded in fall 48 8 followed by in spring 35 6 and summer 35 6 however this ranking was not significant chi square test p 0 122 the lowest detection rate was observed in winter 28 5 and hadvs and padvs were detected in all seasons except for padvs in fall 0 however hadvs were dominant in fall 48 8 followed by spring 20 summer 15 6 and winter 14 3 this ranking was statistically significant chi square test p 10 4 the prevalence of padvs was highest in summer 20 followed by in spring 15 6 and winter 14 3 this ranking was significant chi square test p 0 0004 the detection rates of advs in four regions of fhs are listed in table 2 among these regions the southern fhs had the highest detection rate of advs 56 7 followed by the northern 38 9 central 23 3 and eastern 19 fhs respectively moreover hadvs were detected at a higher rate in the northern fhs 36 1 followed by the rates in the southern 33 3 eastern 19 and central 11 7 fhs padv were detected at a higher rate in the southern 23 3 followed by the rates in the central 11 7 and northern 2 8 fhs the detection rate rankings of advs hadvs and padvs by region were significant chi square test p 10 4 p 0 0024 p 10 4 respectively but were not statistically significant for fh sites however padvs were not detected in any sample from the eastern fh tx fh exhibited the highest prevalence 91 7 followed by ypdg 87 5 and ya 58 3 the lowest detection rates of advs were recorded for fj 8 3 wtstl 8 3 and wc 8 3 fh similarly none of the water samples contained advs in the pzl fh in the central region however the prevalence of hadvs and padvs was 0 50 and 0 58 4 respectively hadvs showed a high prevalence in ya 50 nl 50 and ypdg 45 8 fh consistently a high prevalence of padvs was observed in tx 58 4 and ypdg 41 7 fh none of the water samples collected from the pzl fh in the central region contained hadvs or padvs 3 2 distribution of advs hotspots in the fishing harbours the geographical distribution of the adv sampling sites and their detection results in various seasons across the experimental fhs in taiwan are illustrated in fig 1 pzl fh was the only sampling location at which advs were not detected in any of the four seasons according to the surrounding environment there are few human activities and no rivers or large drainage systems near the pzl fh similarly the fj wc and hl fhs only showed advs in the fall season 3 3 genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of adv sixty six adv positive samples were subjected to nucleic acid sequencing among the fhs advs were detected in samples from ya nl tx and ypdg in all four seasons table 3 in contrast the pzl fh contained no adv load throughout the study period however advs were detected at other fhs in the fall the remaining fhs contained advs in at least one season fj wc wtstl and hl or two seasons bd xd and fg during the study period the two major genotypes human and porcine advs were the dominant species in the samples obtained from all fhs among them four serotypes a species hadv serotype 12 f species hadv serotypes 40 and 41 and c species padv serotype 5 were detected in a higher proportion compared to those of other serotypes fig s1 the dominant serotypes in the seawater of fhs were hadv serotype 41 63 6 42 66 and padv serotype 5 33 3 22 66 the genotypic distribution of adv serotypes across fhs in taiwan is summarised in table s2 ypdg fh was the only port at which all hadv serotypes 12 40 and 41 and padv serotype 5 were detected 3 4 relationship between advs water quality parameters and human swine population nonparametric statistical tests were performed to determine the relationship between the presence or absence of advs in seawater and water quality indicators we analyzed two instances of the presence or absence of advs using the mann whitney u test the results are shown in tables 4 and s3 a significant difference was observed between adv positive and adv negative samples with respect to the heterotrophic plate count ph and salinity mann whitney u test p 0 05 the presence of advs was associated with a higher heterotrophic plate count and lower ph and conductivity than those of adv negative samples the results of spearman s rank correlation analysis of various parameters including the human and swine populations of the local township and river drainage basin prevalence of advs hadvs and padvs in the fhs and water quality microbial indicators are illustrated in table 5 a significant positive correlation p 0 01 was observed between the swine population in the river drainage basin and detection rates of padv r 0 692 and total coliform count r 0 736 we also analysed the correlation between the detection of advs hadvs and padvs and microbial indicators of water quality such as the heterotrophic plate count total coliform count and e coli count using spearman s rank correlation coefficient the detection rates of advs and padvs were significantly correlated with the e coli count r 0 683 p 0 01 and r 0 792 p 0 001 respectively however the adv hadv and padv detection rates and heterotrophic plate counts were not significantly correlated p 0 30 the ranking of padv occurrence was significantly correlated with the river drainage basin swine and e coli populations 4 discussion we characterised the presence distribution and quantification of advs in seawater samples collected from the main fhs in taiwan our results provide an overview of adv contamination levels and their seasonal variations in the water of fhs adv is detected year round in taiwan and several communal outbreaks have been reported chang et al 2008 cheng et al 2008 ho et al 1999 lin et al 2004 hence it is necessary to identify the sources of viral spread to plan remedial action the overall detection rate of advs in seawater of the fh was 37 1 previous studies conducted in australia spain georgia sweden greece and taiwan showed that advs are abundant in sewage contaminated coastal and river waters with detection rates of 24 77 36 6 32 3 36 5 and 34 3 respectively fong and lipp 2005 grohmann et al 1993 pina et al 1998 rusinol et al 2014 tao et al 2016 in this study the southern fh showed the highest levels 56 7 of advs during the study period our previous study of the puzi river in southern taiwan revealed the presence of hadvs in river water 34 3 which have been associated with domestic and livestock wastewater contamination due to anthropogenic activities tao et al 2016 moreover many possible pollution sources such as pig farms puzi hospital and chiayi city wastewater discharge units are located near the upper reaches of the puzi river the outflow of the puzi river and its tributaries may have resulted in water contamination in the fhs in southern taiwan the tx fh in central taiwan exhibited the highest prevalence 91 7 and large numbers of adv positive samples for both human and animal genotypes throughout the study period reflecting urban discharge into the fh padvs have been detected in the zhuoshui river in central taiwan suggesting faecal contamination huang et al 2015 runoff from the zhuoshi river may have resulted in adv contamination of the tx fh and nearby harbours the highest rate of adv hadv padv detection was recorded in fall followed by in spring and summer compared to other enteric viruses the detection rate of advs significantly differs by season water type and sampling extent félix et al 2010 huang et al 2015 a previous study conducted on five rivers in europe and south america reported that hadv prevalence was with the lowest numbers in fall rainy season in mediterranean areas and that padvs occurrences were associated with intensive livestock farming around river basins rusinol et al 2014 in taiwan frequent heavy rainfall and thunderstorms occur mainly during the spring and summer therefore the higher drainage or river water flow due to the rainy season may dilute contaminated waters leading to lower adv detection rates although the dry fall season receives less rainfall than other seasons in taiwan pollution sources are becoming concentrated resulting in a higher prevalence of advs moreover the reduction in river flow levels during the fall season results in lower dilution of the virus load and therefore increased viral contamination when discharged into the sea this finding agrees with the results of a previous study conducted in taiwan in which higher rates of adv detection were observed in fall 37 5 than in spring 13 9 and summer 9 7 tao et al 2016 large numbers of clinical cases of hadv infections occurred mostly in the fall 35 in taiwan tao et al 2016 genotyping analysis showed that hadvs were the most prevalent genotype detected in all fhs this finding is similar to that of other studies showing that hadvs are the common adv genotype found in surface waters vieira et al 2016 the diversity of the detected advs in the aquatic environment may reflect the specific viruses that were actively circulating within the population at different time points prevost et al 2015 higher detection rates of hadvs were observed at the sampling site because of the stability and intermittent shedding of this virus via human faeces wyn jones et al 2011 particularly the hadvs f species serotype 41 was the dominant serotype in our study followed by the f species serotype 40 and a species 12 a previous study conducted in europe revealed the predominant hadv serotypes in seawater such as hadv serotypes 1 2 3 12 31 40 and 41 among these hadv serotype 41 showed a high detection rate of 41 5 22 53 wyn jones et al 2011 similarly most serotypes detected in various environmental water bodies and effluent wastewater samples were hadv serotype 41 hewitt et al 2011 huang et al 2015 van heerden et al 2005 vergara et al 2016 which causes gastroenteritis in children under four years of age allard et al 2001 however hadv serotype 12 which may cause acute haemorrhagic cystitis in children formiga cruz et al 2002 was detected in only a single sample in this study padvs were detected at a very low rate at most sampling sites padvs are endemic in most conventional swine herds worldwide and are prevalent in piggery units and slaughterhouse wastewater which may in turn be associated with subclinical infection hundesa et al 2006 padv serotype 5 was the predominant genotype detected in river water in new zealand and spain and generally causes gastrointestinal disease and diarrhoea in swine fongaro et al 2015 hundesa et al 2006 wolf et al 2010 the tx and ypdg fhs were the only sites showing a high rate of padv detection resulting from nonhuman contamination during the study period the above mentioned areas in taiwan are populated with a greater number of piggery farms and comparatively higher swine population of 428 860 and 794 634 respectively compared to others table s2 specifically the river near the ypdg fh donggang river is a top ranked animal faeces polluted river in taiwan a previous study of the zhuoshui river in central taiwan supports our findings and the river was found to be contaminated with padv serotype 5 possibly via discharge of livestock farm wastewater into the river huang et al 2015 we hypothesised that padvs detected at a lower rate in the remaining fhs are associated with higher dilution of wastewater flow out drainage from piggery farms in those areas we found that the presence or absence table 4 or detection rates of 50 or 50 table s3 of advs were correlated with water quality indicators heterotrophic plate count ph and salinity a comparison of the data shown in tables 4 and s3 revealed a similar result in the presence or absence of advs regarding the correlation with the water quality parameters the p values associated with total coliforms and e coli shown in table s3 were smaller than those shown in table 4 implying that adv rich sites have a stronger association with faecal contamination indicators a previous study reported a significant association between the presence of hadvs and various physicochemical parameters silva et al 2011 advs have been proposed as water quality indicators for human and animal faecal pollution rames et al 2016 in our study the predominance of advs in seawater may have resulted from direct discharge of non disinfected wastewater from nearby townships or livestock farms via nearby rivers similarly the detection of advs and padvs in seawater samples was positively correlated with the e coli count indicating a relationship between the presence of advs and padvs and the bacteriological indicators present in seawater samples moreover the prolonged occurrence of bacteria in seawater may lead to the accumulation of coliforms in fish harvested from harbours during periods of high faecal and sewage discharge by the human population and untreated wastewater leakage into the coastal ecosystem the prevalence of hadvs increases miagostovich et al 2008 this indicates an actual risk of hadv transmission through seawater and contaminated waters in fhs may increase the risk of waterborne infections in humans the prevalence of advs in large townships may be more consistent over time because of the relative homogeneity of wastewater discharge from nearby infrastructures similarly a significant positive correlation was found between padv detection in the swine population in the samples obtained from the river drainage basin and e coli and total coliform parameters padvs were suitable for monitoring wastewater discharge from nearby livestock farms in fhs the fhs considered in our study may be impacted by wastewater release urban runoff and livestock farm discharge via outflow of nearby rivers therefore the detection frequency of advs was also high hence identifying human and swine faecal sources would enable the identification of infrastructure upgrades for better targeting in addition the prevalence and seasonal detection of adv genotypes in seawater samples which are related to acute gastroenteritis and diarrhoea are a potential risk for populations in contact with contaminated seawater one limitation of this study is that we used a single method for evaluating the viral concentration additionally viral inhibition was not examined however the american public health association indicated that current viral concentration methods are still being researched modified and improved apha 2017 moreover nested pcr is highly sensitive and can be used to reduce the interference of inhibitors during qualitative detection of microorganisms in aquatic environments hsu et al 2021 jalal et al 2021 sharifdini et al 2015 a recent study provided environmental microbiology minimum information guidelines for assessing and standardising quantitative pcr qpcr and digital pcr dpcr quality for environmental microbiological research borchardt et al 2021 qpcr and dpcr provide information on disease risk thus qpcr or dpcr assays for quantitatively detecting advs are needed but must strictly follow environmental microbiology minimum information guidelines 5 conclusion we investigated the occurrence seasonal distribution and genotypes of advs in the main fhs in taiwan along with their correlation with water quality the presence or absence of advs in the fhs was mainly correlated with human and swine populations in the corresponding watersheds the high prevalence of hadvs and padvs in fhs poses health risks to humans and animals exposed to contaminated water the swine population in the river drainage basin showed a statistically significant and positive correlation with padv detection and microbial water quality indicators e coli and total coliforms advs cause serotype specific host responses thus padv contamination in water is associated with swine livestock these results suggest that the presence of padvs in fhs is a useful indicator of animal faecal contamination in nearby rivers or drainage thus adv detection in fish ports may represent the pollution levels in nearby rivers or drainage our preliminary results indicate the need for more rigid control of effluent discharge near townships and livestock farms further studies are required to evaluate adv

15888,landfill leachates contain a heavy load of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din posing a threat to water resources therefore it is highly important to understand the processes that control its evolution speciation accumulation or attenuation during the percolation of leachates through the unsaturated zone finally affecting the groundwater however tracking din transformations in this complex and inaccessible environment is challenging and knowledge concerning this important topic under field conditions is scarce the presented study used a unique monitoring system that allows sampling of repetitive samples from within the waste and the unsaturated zone an array of 8 wells penetrating the underlying aquifer completed the spatial observation multiple n species isotopic approach was applied to discern the dominating n involving processes over the continuum from the waste mound through the unsaturated zone and the underlying aquifer despite the considerable heterogeneity observed throughout the profile the results provided a cohesive and valuable reflection of the evolution of the inorganic nitrogen pool in this highly contaminated environment leachates inside the waste had reducing characteristics with high accumulation of ammonium up to 360 mg l nh4 n and a distinct δ15n nh4 range 3 to 10 the upper layers of the unsaturated zone underneath the landfill margins found to be aerated promoting n oxidation which resulted in the accumulation of nitrate in the leachates up to 490 mg l no3 n exceptionally high concentrations of nitrite up to 126 mg l no2 n were found as oxygen levels decreased in deeper sections of the vadose zone enrichment of δ15n no2 compared to δ15n no3 indicated the significance of autotropic nitrite reduction controlling the din composition correlated with no2 accumulation and net din attenuation the δ15n δ18o ratio implied co occurrence of denitrification in the leachates even in the more oxidized sections further contributing to n attenuation in the unsaturated zone in the aquifer δ15n nh4 values and δ15n δ18o ratio linked n contamination to the leachates source the encounter with the oxidized groundwater promoted intensive nitrification δ15n no2 values in the groundwater were lighter than both δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 by 22 to 62 implying the co occurrence of nitrification denitrification processes the effect of denitrification grew with decreasing dissolved oxygen do levels below 0 5 mg l towards the center of the plume contributing to net din attenuation in the plume the findings are significant for any consideration of the risk posed by din as well as remediation measures in a landfill environment and other sites with a heavy load of degrading organic matter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landfill leachates vadose zone din nitrogen attenuation nitrogen isotopes nitrite reduction 1 introduction the pollution created by landfill leachates threatens groundwater resources in numerous sites worldwide the risk is especially high in uncontrolled landfills or when the lining infrastructure fails han et al 2016 the leachates created inside the waste body often percolate through the unsaturated zone also termed vadose zone toward the water table landfill leachates contamination is generally characterized by a heavy load of dissolved organic matter om inorganic macro components heavy metals and xenobiotic compounds christensen et al 2001 among those the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nh4 no3 no2 is of special importance because it poses a significant long lasting threat to groundwater quality din typically exists in the leachates at concentrations ranging from hundreds to thousands mg l 250 3600 mg l and remains high for years throughout the long lasting methanogenic landfill stabilization phase kjeldsen et al 2002 kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 excess din is currently one of the main reasons for groundwater pollution and the closing of freshwater wells around the world xin et al 2019 the source compound for din in the leachates is ammonium nh4 resulting from organic matter degradation in the waste through the process of ammonification appels et al 2008 ammonium is considered a major contamination concern related to landfill leachates since it poses a risk to groundwater quality at a concentration as low as 0 5 mg l buss et al 2004 pivato and raga 2006 w h o 2010 under strict anaerobic conditions ammonium tends to remain chemically stable buss et al 2004 however varying environmental conditions often induce nitrogen transformation processes producing different speciation of inorganic n forms fig 1 table 1 the primary biological transformation processes of ammonium in leachates contaminated soil and groundwater occur under aerobic conditions via nitrification nh4 no2 no3 resulting in the production of nitrite and nitrate in the leachates christensen et al 2001 vodyanitskii 2016 anaerobic ammonium oxidation is also viable with nitrite anammox nh4 no2 n2 mn or fe oxides as electron acceptors sri shalini and joseph 2012 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 yang et al 2012 alternatively ammonium attenuation may occur through sorption precipitation or volatilization of ammonia gas although the latter tend to be less significant in leachates contaminated environments under natural ph conditions böhlke et al 2006 buss et al 2004 following nitrate and nitrite production in the percolating leachates microbial reduction can proceed via heterotrophic denitrification no3 no2 n2o n2 vodyanitskii 2016 autotrophic nitrifier denitrification no2 n2o n2 or dnra no3 no2 nh4 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 wells et al 2018 xin et al 2019 net din attenuation occurs through anaerobic reduction of n species to n2o or n2 gases most studies refer to denitrification as the major n attenuation pathway in leachate plume under natural conditions xin et al 2019 however recent findings suggest that under heavy nitrogen load autotrophic nitrite reduction pathways anammox and nitrifier denitrification might add a significant contribution to the overall n attenuation jahangir et al 2020 su et al 2022 wells et al 2018 evaluating the din transformations in a landfill environment based solely on the change of n species concentrations is practically impossible multiple n sources produced by degrading organic matter of various origins and different concentrations create a highly heterogenic environment in which different transformation processes may proceed simultaneously leachates flow in the waste is known to be uneven and preferential causing mixing of streams with different chemical characteristics aharoni et al 2017 wells et al 2016 very little is known about n transformations and attenuation within the unsaturated section of a landfill or moreover about the general case of contaminated sites with heavy nitrogen load xin et al 2019 beyond heterogeneity the difficulty also stems from technical limitations on sampling from the waste body and the unsaturated zone beneath the landfill in a non destructive manner in addition low water content does not always facilitate the extraction of sufficient sample volume that will enable qualitative analysis due to the technical limitations most of the studies relating to din in landfills leachates examined the effluent that drains at the bottom of the waste body kapelewska et al 2019 laner et al 2012 vodyanitskii 2016 this sampling method reflects an integrated value for the entire waste profile but does not give expression to the various processes and streams which seep down at different points another type of study examined the distribution of din in the groundwater contaminated plume beneath landfills chen et al 2014 cossu et al 2018 han et al 2016 here the concentrations and conditions are different from those in the unsaturated zone and depend on the flow conditions in the aquifer to the best of our knowledge there is no previous study that has thoroughly investigated the din evolution throughout the waste body and in the unsaturated zone beneath the landfill in a continuance nondestructive manner stable isotopes analysis of din species can help to overcome some of the difficulties posed by the complexity of the system by saving the imprints of the n transformation mechanisms their use in environmental studies is based on the predictable fractionation factor α describing the shift in the isotopic composition during chemical or biological reactions e g for nitrogen α 15n 14n product 15n 14n substrate the isotopic fractionation effect ε can then be presented in per mill as ε α 1 1000 describing the difference in isotopic ratios between the substrate and the product of the reaction casciotti 2016 denk et al 2017 preference for light isotopes in most of the reactions is defined as a normal fractionation effect ε 0 in which the product is isotopically depleted and the residual substrate is being progressively enriched as the reaction proceeds an inverse isotopic effect ε 0 refers to a reaction in which the product is being isotopically enriched leaving the residual substrate progressively depleted the second step of nitrification no2 no3 nitox in table 1 is an important example of an inverse n fractionation effect producing no3 that is isotopically heavier than the substrate no2 casciotti 2009 nikolenko et al 2017 typical isotopic fractionation effect ε of the main reactions as previously reported in various studies are summarized in table 1 a basic approach for using isotopic tools in field studies involves the introduction of isotopically labeled 15n tracer tracking its presence and transformation processes in the studied system böhlke et al 2006 song et al 2016 xing and clark 2014 this approach is not valid for a landfill environment in which nitrogen contamination derives from degradation processes within the waste creating multiple sources and fluxes percolating at different spots into the unsaturated zone another common approach widely used in environmental studies is based on the patterns of progressive isotopic enrichment depletion of the din reactants described by the rayleigh equation casciotti 2016 denk et al 2017 however in studies of a landfill environment the isotopic ratios did not follow the rayleigh equation prediction likely indicating a mixture of multiple n sources chen et al 2014 heaton et al 2005 these approaches are constrained by the assumption of a distinct n source and a traceable flow path such assumptions are inapplicable in the complex environment of a landfill with multiple n sources and mixing of leachates percolation paths a different approach uses isotopic measurements of multiple din species δ15n of nh4 no3 no2 and δ18o no3 in each specific sample and the relations between them to detect the dominant n transformation processes the analyses rely on established scientific knowledge of the isotopic fractionation effect related to each process and are independent of the information on n sources and flow paths e g bourbonnais et al 2015 hu et al 2016 wells et al 2016 more information regarding this approach and detailed examples can be found in the methodology and discussion chapters of this manuscript to the best of our knowledge the few studies that implemented the multiple n species isotopic analysis in a landfill environment investigated the leachates effluent or the contaminated aquifers none however studied the spatial evolution within the waste body and the role of the unsaturated zone between the waste and the underlying aquifer in recent studies we demonstrated the capability of an advanced vadose zone monitoring system vms to characterize the leachate s chemical parameters and biochemical degradation processes as they flow through the waste body and unsaturated zone despite the inherent spatial heterogeneity it was found that depending on sites geomorphology environments with varying contamination load redox conditions and speciation were created in the waste in the unsaturated zone and in the groundwater below aharoni et al 2020 2017 due to the environmental importance of nitrogen contamination we thought this subject deserves further investigation and a deeper understanding of the processes involving din accumulation and attenuation in this type of contaminated sites in the present work we used the unique ability to continuously collect samples from inaccessible parts within the waste body and unsaturated zone combined with the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach together they provided a powerful tool to identify significant n transformation processes in the landfill s highly heterogeneous and mostly hidden contaminated environment furthermore we could track the fate of inorganic nitrogen throughout the continuum of a landfill the underlying vadose zone and groundwater the presented data and analysis approach demonstrated here can help with risk assessment as well as in the remediation efforts of similar sites with a heavy organic load 2 methodology the landfill site chosen for the study and the entire monitoring setup were presented in detail in a previous publication aharoni et al 2020 the site description and field monitoring methods are hereby briefly presented 2 1 site description the research site is an old uncontrolled and unlined msw landfill near the city hod hasharon in the coastal plain of israel imep 2013 the waste was disposed of in a mound like morphology reaching the height of 40 m above ground level fig 2 after closing the landfill in 1991 the mound was covered with 1m layer of clay soil to reduce rainwater infiltration the subsurface stratigraphy is a sandy loam soil of 1 3 m depth overlying a uniform sand formation to a depth of at least 60 m the water table of the phreatic coastal aquifer is at 12 m below land surface bls the general groundwater flow direction is west with a very mild gradient however the local flow regime is subjected to temporal variations due to pumping in nearby production wells iwa 2016 the climate is mediterranean with an average precipitation of 570 mm year 2 2 monitoring the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone at the site which includes the waste body and the underlying natural vadose zone was monitored using a vadose zone monitoring system vms fig 2 the vms is structured from a long flexible sleeve that incorporates monitoring units at specific depths installed in a slanted uncased borehole 45o inclination 150 mm diameter each monitoring unit contains a water content sensor using ftdr probe and a vadose zone sampling port vsp for frequent sampling of the sediment waste pore water and gas phase the units are facing upward each towards a separate undisturbed sediment column fig 2 a detailed description of the vms technical specifications installation procedure sampling mechanism and field research applications can be found in previous studies aharoni et al 2020 baram et al 2012 dahan et al 2007 rimon et al 2011 and in the supplementary material two vmss were installed on the site each containing 5 monitoring units vms a was installed in the sandy unsaturated zone starting underneath the landfill margins and descending at a slope towards the center of the landfill to a total depth of 10 m close to the water table vms b was installed inside the waste body on a flat bench elevated 11 m above the ground level with the rest of the waste mound rising 30 m above it the exact depth distribution of the monitoring units is presented throughout this work with respect to the level of the vms head however due to the waste mounds slope topography the actual vertical depth to the land surface is larger fig 2 table s1 in supplementary material water samples from the two vms stations were collected through 8 sampling campaigns from september 2016 to january 2019 the samples were

were filtrated 0 22 µ and stored in closed vials with minimum headspace prior to analysis 2 6 isotopic data analysis due to the extreme heterogeneity the multiplicity of n sources and variable flow paths in a landfill environment we could not use conventional models for isotopic analysis therefore we have adopted the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach that incorporates the values measured for each of the n species δ15n nh4 no3 no2 representing a status snapshot for the specific time and location in which the sample was taken and is independent of source or flow path based on existing knowledge regarding the isotopic effects of n involving biochemical processes and the ratio between the din species we could learn about the environmental conditions and the dominant transformation pathways affecting each sample typical ranges for isotopic fractionation of these processes are summarized in table 1 nitrite is highly reactive in microbial processes its isotopic value reflects the immediate n transformations in the sampled environment while that of ammonium and nitrate reflect more of a cumulative effect of processes along the flow path due to their longer residual time casciotti 2016 wells et al 2016 the isotopic relation expected for a full nitrification process is δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 δ15n no2 because of the normal fractionation effect during ammonium oxidation amox followed by inverse fractionation during nitrite oxidation nitox casciotti 2009 denk et al 2017 table 1 leaving the nitrite highly depleted in a nitrification dominated environment a good estimation for the differences δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 is up to 29 and δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 from 5 to 16 5 heaton et al 2005 wells et al 2018 thus when δ15n no3 values are equal or heavier than δ15n nh4 it signifies that nitrate reduction processes through denitrification denit or dnra are influencing the nitrate pool counteracting the isotopic fractionation created by nitrification denitrification will also further enrich δ15n no3 compared to δ15n no2 and can result in a high δ15n no3 δ15n no2 difference 30 50 since both nitrification and denitrification contribute to a progressive depletion of δ15n no2 a positive correlation between the differences δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 and δ15n no3 δ15n no2 is an isotopic pattern typical for a nitrification denitrification controlled environment wells et al 2016 in contrast the nitrite reduction process nitrd is the only mechanism that enriches δ15n no2 values of the residual nitrite specific relations between the isotopic values of n species are obtained during autotrophic nitrite reduction anammox or nitrifier denitrification which do not involve nitrate reduction and result in increased enrichment of δ15n no2 relative to δ15n no3 thus the difference δ15n no3 δ15n no2 helps to distinguish between nitrification denitrification processes to autotrophic nitrite reduction as only the latter will independently enrich the nitrite and decrease this difference to values below 10 wells et al 2016 the dual isotopic analysis of 15n and 18o in nitrate provides a powerful tool to evaluate the measure of denitrification and an established method to distinguish between nitrate sources coming from leachates or agricultural fertilizers cossu et al 2018 fenech et al 2012 xue et al 2009 the values of δ15n and δ18o in newly formed nitrate can be predicted by the isotopic fractionation caused by nitrification as a good estimation δ15n no3 will be lighter by 5 to 16 5 from the δ15n nh4 of the ammonium source the δ18o no3 values of the formed nitrate can be predicted as a 2 1 incorporation ratio of δ 18o in the water and the atmospheric o2 23 5 snider et al 2010 however empirically the δ18o no3 values tend to shift towards the δ18o of the water due to the high exchange rate of o atoms between dissolved nitrite and water during nitrification boshers et al 2019 kool et al 2011 during nitrate reduction both δ15n and δ18o are enriched in the residual nitrate a slope of 1 1 is generally suggested to represent the enrichment pattern expected by denitrification casciotti 2016 granger and wankel 2016 3 results and discussion the present study is focused on the speciation and transformations of nitrogen in a landfill environment as abovementioned landfill sites are characterized by waste heterogeneity a multiplicity of sources areas of preferential flow and sharp and unpredictable changes in environmental conditions inevitably affecting the nitrogenous species we therefore used an approach in which we characterized each n form compared to the other nitrogenous species in the same sample the relation between them concentrations and isotopic values is indicative of the environmental conditions and the main processes that took place at this point even when they cannot be measured directly due to water content limitations in this medium it was not always possible to extract sufficient sample volume for both the chemical and isotopic analysis when the ratio is discussed we presented only data of sampling points in which all the relevant parameters could be reliably measured the first part of the discussion section 3 1 follows din species along the percolation path from the leachate s origin in the waste body through the unsaturated zone below and down to the groundwater the second part section 3 2 will discuss din species in the aquifer beneath the landfill 3 1 din in the waste and the unsaturated zone the samples from the waste and the unsaturated zone were collected using the vmss sampling ports as described above a general characterization of the chemical environment leachates composition and flow dynamics in the research site was provided in our previous study aharoni et al 2020 in brief the two vmss installed in the landfill site reflected the chemical heterogeneity and the different environments created in each section the upper vms b was installed directly inside the waste body the chemical composition of water samples from vms b showed the characteristics of leachates as they are created and migrated through the waste body these samples contained high levels of organic matter doc 200 2000 mg l tn 20 360 mg l and salinity cl 50 2000 mg l the lower system vms a is positioned in the sandy unsaturated zone so that the upper units reflect the conditions underneath the landfill margins while the deepest reflect the conditions under the center and close to the water table samples from vms a provided evidence for the migration of leachates from the waste downwards through the unsaturated zone these samples contained doc 50 3000 mg l tn 15 530 mg l and cl 90 2330 mg l while the ranges of these major contaminants were similar between samples from the waste and the unsaturated zone the chemical nature of the leachates differ significantly specifically samples from the upper section of the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 3 9 m bls situated below the landfill margins showed more oxidized chemical characteristics whereas samples from inside the waste vms b and beneath the center of the mound lower cells of vms a indicated more anaerobic conditions the concentrations of din components in the samples extracted by each vsp 3b is largely related to the inherent spatial variability of leachates composition in the landfill environment aharoni et al 2017 2020 thus comparison of the concentrations of n species in different samples cannot serve as an indication for the transformations taking place in the unsaturated profile to describe the din speciation in a comparable and concise manner we have defined the n oxidation factor nof fig 3 c the nof presents the relation between reduced n nh4 to the oxidized n forms no3 no2 eqn 1 e q 1 n o x i d a t i o n f a c t o r n o f n o 3 n n o 2 n n h 4 n d i n nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations are in mg n l and din is the sum of all mineral n species concentrations in a specific sample a solution controlled by ammonium as the main mineral n form produced by organic matter degradation in the leachates will lead to nof 0 in the samples indicating a reduced environment a value of nof 0 signifies that most of the nitrogen in the sample had been transformed into oxidized forms no2 or no3 implying significant nitrification processes and an oxidized environment 3 1 1 the gaseous phase and n oxidation factor gas samples taken at the site in nov 2019 supported our previous observations fig 3a the samples from the two uppermost vsps inside the waste body contained low levels of oxygen 6 1 and 3 8 o2 for vms b 1 4 and 2 7 m bls respectively indicating some air diffusion into the waste near the surface indeed nof values showed strong variability ranging from completely reduced to partly oxidized conditions between sampling occasions fig 3c we presume that the limited levels of oxygen in these sections were rapidly consumed causing strong fluctuation in the redox conditions these changes in the upper vsps of the waste might be attributed to the entry of rainwater or changes in the structure of the decomposing waste nevertheless they did not follow any seasonal pattern in the deeper sections of the waste 4 3 8 1 m bls oxygen was completely exhausted indicating an anaerobic environment fig 3a nof values were consistently low nof 0 97 in these sampling points showing that most of the din was in reduced form fig 3b the elevated concentrations of methane and sulfide also indicated anaerobic methanogenesis and sulfate reduction metabolism the large peak in methane measured at 6 2 m bls reflects the existence of local hot spots of organic waste degradation within the heterogeneous waste body fig 3a such hot spot activity is often accompanied by elevated nh4 concentrations in the leachates as a byproduct aharoni et al 2017 which was indeed measured at the same sampling port fig 3b in contrast oxygen existed in gas samples from all the ports in the unsaturated zone beneath the landfill vms a from 16 8 o2 in the uppermost sampling port gradually decreasing to 5 4 o2 in the deepest one 9 9 m bls presumably due to air diffusion through the sandy unsaturated zone in accordance the highest nof values 0 79 1 were measured in the upper section of the unsaturated zone underneath the landfill margins vms a 0 8 3 9 m bls fig 3c implying a maximum n oxidation with almost complete consumption of ammonium in deeper sections although oxygen was relatively depleted it was not completely exhausted indeed methane and sulfide were both not detected even in the deep section of the unsaturated zone suggesting that the conditions did not turn completely anaerobic fig 3a a strong variation of nof values over time was observed in the deeper sampling point of the unsaturated zone vms a 9 9 m bls fig 3c these values represent significant changes in redox conditions which are probably related to the proximity and fluctuations of the more aerated water table below 3 1 2 ammonium in the waste and unsaturated zone ammonium is the primary din product of ammonification occurring during the degradation of organic matter in the waste its concentrations are the highest in the reduced sections of the profile and lowest under more oxidizing conditions presumably as a result of oxidation processes fig 3 and aharoni et al 2020 samples from the reduced sections of the waste body and the underlying unsaturated zone had a δ15n nh4 value range between 3 to 10 fig 4 we had no way to directly measure the isotopic values of organic nitrogen in the solid waste within the landfill however since the ammonification process creates low to non significant isotopic fractionation table 1 we consider the measured range to be a good representation for the δ15n of the organic nitrogen source material in the landfill environment ammonium in the unsaturated zone may also be prone to adsorption and precipitation but neither is expected to significantly affect its isotopic values nikolenko et al 2017 this range is compatible with previously reported δ15n nh4 values for landfill leachates bustos and aravena 2011 heaton et al 2005 3 1 3 nitrite accumulation in the waste and unsaturated zone in a landfill environment nitrite is primarily produced by the oxidation of ammonium during the first step of nitrification however it is a reactive intermediate compound in all major n transformation processes as illustrated in fig 1 therefore it is normally rapidly consumed under natural conditions interestingly we have found exceptionally high nitrite concentrations in samples from the unsaturated zone vms a 1 8 3 9 9 9 m bls reaching up to 126 mg l no2 n although the concentrations varied significantly between samples fig 3b some lower yet significant nitrite concentrations 7 23 mg l no2 n were also measured in the upper section of the waste body vms b 1 4 2 7 m bls the accumulation was observed in vsps with low yet not completely depleted o2 levels fig 3 nitrite was hardly accumulated in the relatively aerated uppermost section of the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 m bls o2 16 8 nor deep inside the waste body vms b 6 2 8 1 m bls where the environment was completely anaerobic certain environmental conditions have been suggested to impair several metabolic pathways that can induce substantial nitrite accumulation 1 partial nitrification due to free ammonia nh3 inhibition at concentrations as low as 0 1 1 mg l nh3 n ganigué et al 2007 venterea et al 2015 2 partial nitrification under low oxygen conditions do range of 0 5 to 2 mg l jianlong and ning 2004 ruiz et al 2003 3 partial nitrate reduction during denitrification dnra under unstable environmental conditions such as ph c n ratio do and no3 concentrations du et al 2016 ge et al 2012 glass and silverstein 1998 4 heavy metals toxicity might inhibit the microbial activity and affect n oxidation or reduction pathways gui et al 2017 liu et al 2019 we have calculated the free ammonia nh3 levels in the leachates samples based on the nh4 concentrations ph and temperature pka 9 25 anthonisen et al 1976 although they exceeded in some cases the threshold values suggested for nh3 inhibition there was no correlation r2 0 03 data not shown between the calculated nh3 levels to the measure of nitrite accumulation no2 n din in the samples no correlation was found with heavy metals concentrations either therefore we assume that the inhibitory effect of these factors as the major cause for nitrite accumulation can be ruled out hence low oxygen levels and unstable redox conditions are the most probable factors affecting nitrite extensive accumulation either by partial nitrification or by inhibition of nitrite reduction to better understand the main factors affecting nitrite fate in the waste and unsaturated zone we have used isotopic tools employing the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach the relations between the values found for the different species and the isotopic fractionation affecting them are detailed at length in the methodology chapter in the uppermost vsp of the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 m bls nitrite was isotopically depleted compared to nitrate so that the difference δ15n no3 δ15n no2 had positive values 15 40 fig 5 implying an aerobic nitrification controlled environment in vms b 2 7 m bls and vms a 6 8 to 9 9 m bls the difference δ15n no3 δ15n no2 was decreased and ranged between 0 to 1 5 revealing the growing effect of autotrophic nitrite reduction processes we found that as the effect of autotrophic nitrite reduction increases as demonstrated by lower δ15n no3 δ15n no2 difference the ratio of no2 n total din in the samples increased indicating no2 accumulation at these environments fig 5a 5c this observation has no simple explanation because nitrite reduction is a consumption process rather than an accumulation mechanism it appears that under the specific redox conditions created at these sections of the unsaturated zone inhibition of no2 oxidation was causing its accumulation thus making it available as a substrate for significant autotrophic nitrite reduction that enriched its isotopic values we further found that the autotrophic nitrite reduction was also associated with decreasing din br values serving as a measure for net n removal fig 5d more details in section 3 2 5 these results indicate an important contribution of autotrophic nitrite reduction pathways to promote effective nitrogen attenuation in the waste and the unsaturated zone below the landfill 3 1 4 nitrate in the waste and the unsaturated zone nitrate is formed in the leachates under aerobic conditions as the end product of nitrification unlike nitrite which is highly reactive nitrate is more stable and tends to leach down the profile and accumulate in the groundwater under low oxygen conditions nitrate might be reduced most commonly via denitrification in which nitrate transforms into n2o then n2 gases a process that will attenuate din concentrations in the leachates other processes like dnra might adversely transform the nitrate back to ammonium thus preventing net din attenuation xin et al 2019 the upper section of the unsaturated zone underlying the margins of the landfill vms a 0 8 1 8 m bls is aerated and most prone for nitrification o2 levels are the highest in this section and nof values show that over 89 of the din is oxidized fig 3 indeed the isotopic values found in this section fit the expected pattern for nitrification δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 by 5 5 and δ15n no3 δ15n no2 by 6 40 casciotti 2009 denk et al 2017 table 1 fig 4 in all other vsps inside the waste and in the deep vadose zone δ15n no3 was generally equal or heavier than δ15n nh4 fig 4 a pattern suggesting the contribution of significant nitrate reduction dual isotopic analysis of δ15n δ18o values in nitrate was used to determine the effect of additional processes other than nitrification on the dissolved nitrate pool in the waste and the unsaturated zone the expected isotopic range for newly formed nitrate in the leachates was calculated according to the considerations detailed in the data analysis section of the methodology chapter sec 2 1 if only nitrification was involved nitrate in the leachates would have a predictable range of δ15n no3 19 5 to 5 to estimate the oxygen isotopic values in newly formed nitrate we have measured water isotopes in the leachates samples and found a narrow range of δ18o h2o 4 6 1 4 n 16 accordingly the formed nitrate would have a predictable range of δ18o no3 4 6 to 4 7 ranging from a 2 1 incorporation ratio with atmospheric oxygen to a full exchange with water the range of δ15n δ18o values expected by nitrification is marked by the grey rectangle in fig 6 the dual isotopic compositions of nitrate δ18o δ15n in leachates samples both in the waste and in the unsaturated zone were all above the expected range for newly formed nitrate fig 6 indicating the influence of nitrate reduction most of these samples fell inside the boundaries of 1 1 slope trajectory lines representing the predicted enrichment effect expected by denitrification casciotti 2016 granger and wankel 2016 samples from the more oxidized areas the upper cells in the waste vms b 1 4 m bls and in the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 to 3 9 m bls had the lowest δ15n δ18o values therefore they had undergone the smallest measure of nitrate reduction nevertheless denitrification was effective to some extent even in these sections as their values spread along the denitrification slope fig 6 this co occurrence of oxidation reduction processes can be explained by the creation of micro zonation or temporal anaerobic conditions within a generally oxidized environment rivett et al 2008 another possible explanation might be the flow of leachates from upper layers in which they have already undergone partial oxidation reduction cycles inside the waste body vms b 6 2 m and 8 1 m bls and in the deep vadose zone vms a 6 8 m and 9 9 m bls the conditions turned to be anaerobic the enrichment in δ15n δ18o observed in these cells indicates intensified denitrification fig 6 and nitrate concentrations were accordingly very low no3 n 0 1 2 mg l fig 3 nitrate reduction to ammonium via dnra is also viable and may account for some of the detected nitrate reduction hardison et al 2015 few samples fell outside of the proposed denitrification slope lines such a diversion can be explained by the re oxidation of nitrite during denitrification casciotti 2016 granger and wankel 2016 in any case these enriched values seem to represent residual nitrate that has undergone significant reduction rather than freshly formed by in situ nitrification 3 1 5 evaluation of net nitrogen attenuation in the unsaturated zone the estimation of net variation in din concentrations in the landfill environment is highly complicated this is due to the inherent spatial variability of the medium the generation of new din substances following ongoing organic matter degradation and intercrossing of leachates flow paths through the profile thus in order to gain a better evaluation of net n attenuation along the percolation path we chose to normalize the total din concentration in the samples to the overall leachate strength for this purpose we used the ratio din br fig 5b since bromide br was found as an effective conservative tracer for leachates concentration aharoni et al 2020 woodman et al 2015 accordingly decreasing din br values along the profile would indicate net nitrogen attenuation din and br concentrations throughout the profile are presented in the supplementary material fig s2 the ratio din br was relatively high at the upper sections of the waste vms b 1 4 m bls and the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 m bls then gradually decreased with depth fig 5b the lowest values were found in the deep unsaturated zone vms a 9 9 m bls this observation indicates a net removal of din during the percolation through the unsaturated zone towards the groundwater these findings are well suited with the results described above demonstrating a significant impact of nitrate and nitrite reduction this way din components were transformed and emitted as gaseous n2o and n2 hence relieving the nitrogen contamination reaching the groundwater 3 2 din in groundwater the din concentrations in groundwater samples were significantly lower than those measured in the leachates from the waste and unsaturated zone fig 7 a the highest din levels were measured underneath the center of the waste mound well s2 30 56 mg l and the lowest in the up flow and deep wells wells uf d1 d2 din 6 14 mg l in a previous study we calculated that the major portion of din attenuation in the groundwater was attributed to dilution 70 99 mixing ratio based on br as a conservative tracer for leachates concentration as described above however nitrogen transformation processes were found to account for 10 50 attenuation of the dissolved nitrogen in the groundwater on top of the dilution effect aharoni et al 2020 the mixing of the leachate plume in the more aerated aquifer directly affected the nitrogen speciation nitrate was found to be the dominating species in most of the groundwater samples with nof 0 5 fig 7b indicating oxidizing conditions and implying a nitrification controlled environment the only well in which ammonium was the dominant species nof 0 84 is s2 located underneath the center of the waste mound signifying anaerobic reducing conditions in this section we found that by comparing nof vs do concentrations fig 7c a threshold of 0 5 mg l do may be defined below which sub oxic conditions seem to induce instability and co occurrence of both oxidized no3 and reduced nh4 species wells s1 s2 e1 e2 and above which aerobic nitrification transforms the major portion of din to nitrate this value is within the range suggested in previous studies nikolenko et al 2017 3 2 1 ammonium in groundwater the range of δ15n nh4 measured in groundwater samples 2 to 14 fig 8 resembled that of samples from inside the waste body relating to the ammonium source to the leachates that were percolated into the aquifer we found no correlation between nh4 n concentrations to δ15n nh4 values in the groundwater samples indicating that here as well there is no single and uniform source of ammonium in the aquifer rather it leaches into the aquifer at different points with different concentrations and fluxes 3 2 2 nitrite in groundwater in the groundwater we did not identify the high accumulation of nitrite as observed in the unsaturated zone apparently nitrite was quickly consumed and concentrations were low in all the groundwater samples 0 2 mg l no2 n nonetheless the nitrite isotopic composition provides additional information regarding the biochemical mechanisms controlling n transformations in the plume in all the groundwater samples δ15n no2 values were lighter than both δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 samples from wells distant from the center of the plume df d1 and d2 had δ15n no2 values in the range 14 to 24 while samples from wells most affected by the leachates s1 s2 e1 e1 had lighter values of 29 to 38 fig 8 the differences of δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 and δ15n no3 δ15n no2 across all wells were positively correlated p 0 05 fig 9 a this isotopic pattern is consistent with a nitrification denitrification controlled environment wells et al 2016 the samples from wells df d1 d2 had δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 difference mostly within the range expected by nitrification up to 29 table 1 and section 2 6 above instead in wells s1 s2 e1 e1 beneath the landfill boundaries this isotopic difference grew beyond the expected range and reached 32 to 51 fig 9 reflecting the cumulative effect of co occurring denitrification wells et al 2016 in addition we found a negative correlation of the difference δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 to do levels in the groundwater samples at do 0 5 mg l the isotopic difference increased to over 35 fig 9b indicating that under low oxygen conditions nitrate reduction contributes to additional isotopic depletion of the residual nitrite 3 2 3 nitrate in groundwater nitrate background concentrations in the aquifer surrounding the landfill vary from 0 4 2 7 mg l no3 n iwa 2009 therefore the elevated levels found in the groundwater samples in the landfill site up to 54 mg l no3 n indicate local leachates contribution when the reduced leachates percolate out of the anoxic conditions in the deep unsaturated zone and encounter the more aerated groundwater nitrate concentrations sharply increased indicating the effect of strong nitrification fig 7c in an oxidized nitrification dominated environment we expect an isotopic relation of δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 table 1 section 2 6 however in all the measured groundwater samples δ15n no3 values were enriched and resembled the range of δ15n nh4 fig 8 in well s2 the most anaerobic section of the plume nitrate was highly enriched δ15n no3 19 24 with δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 by 6 2 to 12 1 fig 8 corresponding to a reduction dominated environment izbicki 2014 nitrate dual isotopic analyses in groundwater samples provided further evidence for nitrate reduction processes all the samples fell roughly within the predicted δ15n δ18o no3 slope range indicating denitrification of nitrate in the leachates fig 10 section 2 6 none of the samples fitted the isotopic range of nitrate originated from synthetic fertilizers xue et al 2009 thus ruling out a significant contribution of agricultural sources it appears that the effect of nitrate reduction was observed not only in the anaerobic section of the plume well s2 but also in all other wells even where the chemical parameters were of an oxidized environment with nitrate as the dominating n species one possible explanation is that nitrate has undergone a reduction in the unsaturated zone and carries the isotopic enrichment effect as it flows to the more oxidized aquifer alternatively denitrification could be proceeding in micro environments in the aquifer even in a nitrification dominated environment the results of the multiple n species isotopic analysis support the latter the implied din attenuation mechanism in the groundwater is in line with our previous measurements of net n attenuation in the aquifer aharoni 2020 4 summary and conclusions din evolution in landfill leachates was studied to characterize n speciation and dominant biochemical processes affecting its fate in a highly contaminated environment the study used a unique monitoring system vms for repetitive sampling in the inaccessible sections of the waste and unsaturated zone beneath a landfill observation wells penetrating to the underlying groundwater completed the sampling setup the use of the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach enabled the decoding of biochemical processes involving nitrogen species within the waste unsaturated zone and groundwater even when sources and flow paths were unknown due to the heterogeneity of this medium the main findings were strictly reduced environment was found inside the waste body while upper layers were slightly aerated as shown by oxygen level and fluctuating oxidation state of n species the conditions in the deep sections revealed highly reduced traits characteristics were low n oxidation factor with very high concentrations of nh4 in the gaseous phase oxygen was completely depleted and elevated levels of methane and sulfide indicated anaerobic methanogenesis and sulfate reduction relatively aerated conditions were found in the upper layers of the vadose zone beneath the waste margins gradually becoming more reducing with depth as indicated by decreasing oxygen levels nevertheless the environment in the vadose zone has not turned completely anaerobic evident by the presence of oxygen and lack of methane and sulfide gases nitrate was accumulated in the upper oxidized layers up to 490 mg l no3 n due to intensive nitrification yet its isotopic values δ15n δ18o indicated co occurrence of denitrification even in the most aerated sections of the unsaturated zone contributing to din attenuation ammonium the source compound of din in the leachates up to 360 mg l nh4 n had a distinct range of isotopic values δ15n nh4 between 3 to 10 in all samples in areas where oxygen concentrations were limited significant fluctuation in nitrogen speciation was observed implying sharp changes in redox conditions exceptionally strong variation was observed in the proximity of groundwater probably due to changes in groundwater level unusually high accumulation of nitrite up to 126 mg l no2 n was found in profile sections in which oxygen was available yet limited isotopic analysis indicated that nitrite in these sections was becoming isotopically heavier relative to nitrate signifying the effect of autotrophic nitrite reduction this process was associated with net din attenuation revealing the importance of autotrophic nitrite reduction to the attenuation of din contamination in the unsaturated zone below landfills as the leachates emerged from the unsaturated zone and mixed with the more aerated groundwater rapid n oxidation occurred hence nitrate became the dominant species in all the wells except that found in the center of the plume nitrite was rapidly consumed in the groundwater and its concentrations were accordingly low yet nitrite isotopic values were found to be important for the understanding of the din transformations in the aquifer the correlated enrichment of δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 compared to δ15n no2 δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 vs δ15n no3 δ15n no2 indicated the existence of nitrification denitrification controlled environment this influence grew in wells close to the center of the plume where dissolved oxygen levels were below 0 5 mg liter denitrification was also indicated by the ratio of δ15n δ18o in groundwater as the values in all wells were above the expected range for nitrate newly formed by nitrification co existence of denitrification in all the wells even under the more aerated conditions contributes to the mitigation of the din load in the groundwater these results are consistent with our previous findings showing a net 10 50 din attenuation in the leachates

15888,landfill leachates contain a heavy load of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din posing a threat to water resources therefore it is highly important to understand the processes that control its evolution speciation accumulation or attenuation during the percolation of leachates through the unsaturated zone finally affecting the groundwater however tracking din transformations in this complex and inaccessible environment is challenging and knowledge concerning this important topic under field conditions is scarce the presented study used a unique monitoring system that allows sampling of repetitive samples from within the waste and the unsaturated zone an array of 8 wells penetrating the underlying aquifer completed the spatial observation multiple n species isotopic approach was applied to discern the dominating n involving processes over the continuum from the waste mound through the unsaturated zone and the underlying aquifer despite the considerable heterogeneity observed throughout the profile the results provided a cohesive and valuable reflection of the evolution of the inorganic nitrogen pool in this highly contaminated environment leachates inside the waste had reducing characteristics with high accumulation of ammonium up to 360 mg l nh4 n and a distinct δ15n nh4 range 3 to 10 the upper layers of the unsaturated zone underneath the landfill margins found to be aerated promoting n oxidation which resulted in the accumulation of nitrate in the leachates up to 490 mg l no3 n exceptionally high concentrations of nitrite up to 126 mg l no2 n were found as oxygen levels decreased in deeper sections of the vadose zone enrichment of δ15n no2 compared to δ15n no3 indicated the significance of autotropic nitrite reduction controlling the din composition correlated with no2 accumulation and net din attenuation the δ15n δ18o ratio implied co occurrence of denitrification in the leachates even in the more oxidized sections further contributing to n attenuation in the unsaturated zone in the aquifer δ15n nh4 values and δ15n δ18o ratio linked n contamination to the leachates source the encounter with the oxidized groundwater promoted intensive nitrification δ15n no2 values in the groundwater were lighter than both δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 by 22 to 62 implying the co occurrence of nitrification denitrification processes the effect of denitrification grew with decreasing dissolved oxygen do levels below 0 5 mg l towards the center of the plume contributing to net din attenuation in the plume the findings are significant for any consideration of the risk posed by din as well as remediation measures in a landfill environment and other sites with a heavy load of degrading organic matter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landfill leachates vadose zone din nitrogen attenuation nitrogen isotopes nitrite reduction 1 introduction the pollution created by landfill leachates threatens groundwater resources in numerous sites worldwide the risk is especially high in uncontrolled landfills or when the lining infrastructure fails han et al 2016 the leachates created inside the waste body often percolate through the unsaturated zone also termed vadose zone toward the water table landfill leachates contamination is generally characterized by a heavy load of dissolved organic matter om inorganic macro components heavy metals and xenobiotic compounds christensen et al 2001 among those the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nh4 no3 no2 is of special importance because it poses a significant long lasting threat to groundwater quality din typically exists in the leachates at concentrations ranging from hundreds to thousands mg l 250 3600 mg l and remains high for years throughout the long lasting methanogenic landfill stabilization phase kjeldsen et al 2002 kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 excess din is currently one of the main reasons for groundwater pollution and the closing of freshwater wells around the world xin et al 2019 the source compound for din in the leachates is ammonium nh4 resulting from organic matter degradation in the waste through the process of ammonification appels et al 2008 ammonium is considered a major contamination concern related to landfill leachates since it poses a risk to groundwater quality at a concentration as low as 0 5 mg l buss et al 2004 pivato and raga 2006 w h o 2010 under strict anaerobic conditions ammonium tends to remain chemically stable buss et al 2004 however varying environmental conditions often induce nitrogen transformation processes producing different speciation of inorganic n forms fig 1 table 1 the primary biological transformation processes of ammonium in leachates contaminated soil and groundwater occur under aerobic conditions via nitrification nh4 no2 no3 resulting in the production of nitrite and nitrate in the leachates christensen et al 2001 vodyanitskii 2016 anaerobic ammonium oxidation is also viable with nitrite anammox nh4 no2 n2 mn or fe oxides as electron acceptors sri shalini and joseph 2012 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 yang et al 2012 alternatively ammonium attenuation may occur through sorption precipitation or volatilization of ammonia gas although the latter tend to be less significant in leachates contaminated environments under natural ph conditions böhlke et al 2006 buss et al 2004 following nitrate and nitrite production in the percolating leachates microbial reduction can proceed via heterotrophic denitrification no3 no2 n2o n2 vodyanitskii 2016 autotrophic nitrifier denitrification no2 n2o n2 or dnra no3 no2 nh4 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 wells et al 2018 xin et al 2019 net din attenuation occurs through anaerobic reduction of n species to n2o or n2 gases most studies refer to denitrification as the major n attenuation pathway in leachate plume under natural conditions xin et al 2019 however recent findings suggest that under heavy nitrogen load autotrophic nitrite reduction pathways anammox and nitrifier denitrification might add a significant contribution to the overall n attenuation jahangir et al 2020 su et al 2022 wells et al 2018 evaluating the din transformations in a landfill environment based solely on the change of n species concentrations is practically impossible multiple n sources produced by degrading organic matter of various origins and different concentrations create a highly heterogenic environment in which different transformation processes may proceed simultaneously leachates flow in the waste is known to be uneven and preferential causing mixing of streams with different chemical characteristics aharoni et al 2017 wells et al 2016 very little is known about n transformations and attenuation within the unsaturated section of a landfill or moreover about the general case of contaminated sites with heavy nitrogen load xin et al 2019 beyond heterogeneity the difficulty also stems from technical limitations on sampling from the waste body and the unsaturated zone beneath the landfill in a non destructive manner in addition low water content does not always facilitate the extraction of sufficient sample volume that will enable qualitative analysis due to the technical limitations most of the studies relating to din in landfills leachates examined the effluent that drains at the bottom of the waste body kapelewska et al 2019 laner et al 2012 vodyanitskii 2016 this sampling method reflects an integrated value for the entire waste profile but does not give expression to the various processes and streams which seep down at different points another type of study examined the distribution of din in the groundwater contaminated plume beneath landfills chen et al 2014 cossu et al 2018 han et al 2016 here the concentrations and conditions are different from those in the unsaturated zone and depend on the flow conditions in the aquifer to the best of our knowledge there is no previous study that has thoroughly investigated the din evolution throughout the waste body and in the unsaturated zone beneath the landfill in a continuance nondestructive manner stable isotopes analysis of din species can help to overcome some of the difficulties posed by the complexity of the system by saving the imprints of the n transformation mechanisms their use in environmental studies is based on the predictable fractionation factor α describing the shift in the isotopic composition during chemical or biological reactions e g for nitrogen α 15n 14n product 15n 14n substrate the isotopic fractionation effect ε can then be presented in per mill as ε α 1 1000 describing the difference in isotopic ratios between the substrate and the product of the reaction casciotti 2016 denk et al 2017 preference for light isotopes in most of the reactions is defined as a normal fractionation effect ε 0 in which the product is isotopically depleted and the residual substrate is being progressively enriched as the reaction proceeds an inverse isotopic effect ε 0 refers to a reaction in which the product is being isotopically enriched leaving the residual substrate progressively depleted the second step of nitrification no2 no3 nitox in table 1 is an important example of an inverse n fractionation effect producing no3 that is isotopically heavier than the substrate no2 casciotti 2009 nikolenko et al 2017 typical isotopic fractionation effect ε of the main reactions as previously reported in various studies are summarized in table 1 a basic approach for using isotopic tools in field studies involves the introduction of isotopically labeled 15n tracer tracking its presence and transformation processes in the studied system böhlke et al 2006 song et al 2016 xing and clark 2014 this approach is not valid for a landfill environment in which nitrogen contamination derives from degradation processes within the waste creating multiple sources and fluxes percolating at different spots into the unsaturated zone another common approach widely used in environmental studies is based on the patterns of progressive isotopic enrichment depletion of the din reactants described by the rayleigh equation casciotti 2016 denk et al 2017 however in studies of a landfill environment the isotopic ratios did not follow the rayleigh equation prediction likely indicating a mixture of multiple n sources chen et al 2014 heaton et al 2005 these approaches are constrained by the assumption of a distinct n source and a traceable flow path such assumptions are inapplicable in the complex environment of a landfill with multiple n sources and mixing of leachates percolation paths a different approach uses isotopic measurements of multiple din species δ15n of nh4 no3 no2 and δ18o no3 in each specific sample and the relations between them to detect the dominant n transformation processes the analyses rely on established scientific knowledge of the isotopic fractionation effect related to each process and are independent of the information on n sources and flow paths e g bourbonnais et al 2015 hu et al 2016 wells et al 2016 more information regarding this approach and detailed examples can be found in the methodology and discussion chapters of this manuscript to the best of our knowledge the few studies that implemented the multiple n species isotopic analysis in a landfill environment investigated the leachates effluent or the contaminated aquifers none however studied the spatial evolution within the waste body and the role of the unsaturated zone between the waste and the underlying aquifer in recent studies we demonstrated the capability of an advanced vadose zone monitoring system vms to characterize the leachate s chemical parameters and biochemical degradation processes as they flow through the waste body and unsaturated zone despite the inherent spatial heterogeneity it was found that depending on sites geomorphology environments with varying contamination load redox conditions and speciation were created in the waste in the unsaturated zone and in the groundwater below aharoni et al 2020 2017 due to the environmental importance of nitrogen contamination we thought this subject deserves further investigation and a deeper understanding of the processes involving din accumulation and attenuation in this type of contaminated sites in the present work we used the unique ability to continuously collect samples from inaccessible parts within the waste body and unsaturated zone combined with the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach together they provided a powerful tool to identify significant n transformation processes in the landfill s highly heterogeneous and mostly hidden contaminated environment furthermore we could track the fate of inorganic nitrogen throughout the continuum of a landfill the underlying vadose zone and groundwater the presented data and analysis approach demonstrated here can help with risk assessment as well as in the remediation efforts of similar sites with a heavy organic load 2 methodology the landfill site chosen for the study and the entire monitoring setup were presented in detail in a previous publication aharoni et al 2020 the site description and field monitoring methods are hereby briefly presented 2 1 site description the research site is an old uncontrolled and unlined msw landfill near the city hod hasharon in the coastal plain of israel imep 2013 the waste was disposed of in a mound like morphology reaching the height of 40 m above ground level fig 2 after closing the landfill in 1991 the mound was covered with 1m layer of clay soil to reduce rainwater infiltration the subsurface stratigraphy is a sandy loam soil of 1 3 m depth overlying a uniform sand formation to a depth of at least 60 m the water table of the phreatic coastal aquifer is at 12 m below land surface bls the general groundwater flow direction is west with a very mild gradient however the local flow regime is subjected to temporal variations due to pumping in nearby production wells iwa 2016 the climate is mediterranean with an average precipitation of 570 mm year 2 2 monitoring the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone at the site which includes the waste body and the underlying natural vadose zone was monitored using a vadose zone monitoring system vms fig 2 the vms is structured from a long flexible sleeve that incorporates monitoring units at specific depths installed in a slanted uncased borehole 45o inclination 150 mm diameter each monitoring unit contains a water content sensor using ftdr probe and a vadose zone sampling port vsp for frequent sampling of the sediment waste pore water and gas phase the units are facing upward each towards a separate undisturbed sediment column fig 2 a detailed description of the vms technical specifications installation procedure sampling mechanism and field research applications can be found in previous studies aharoni et al 2020 baram et al 2012 dahan et al 2007 rimon et al 2011 and in the supplementary material two vmss were installed on the site each containing 5 monitoring units vms a was installed in the sandy unsaturated zone starting underneath the landfill margins and descending at a slope towards the center of the landfill to a total depth of 10 m close to the water table vms b was installed inside the waste body on a flat bench elevated 11 m above the ground level with the rest of the waste mound rising 30 m above it the exact depth distribution of the monitoring units is presented throughout this work with respect to the level of the vms head however due to the waste mounds slope topography the actual vertical depth to the land surface is larger fig 2 table s1 in supplementary material water samples from the two vms stations were collected through 8 sampling campaigns from september 2016 to january 2019 the samples were filtered 0 22 µm and stored in a cooler in the lab samples were stored frozen until analysis gas sampling was technically enabled in nov 2019 samples were pumped out to hedetech 1l sealed bag connected to a microtube that stretches from the vsp in the subsurface to the control panel the gas composition was directly analyzed for ch4 co2 o2 and h2s using a gas analyzer geotech biogas 5000 2 3 groundwater monitoring a setup of 8 observation wells was constructed at the landfill site four wells uf up flow e1 e2 edges df downflow are located on the south and west face of the landfill margin along the general groundwater flow gradient additional 4 wells are located on top of the waste mound wells s1 and s2 penetrate to the shallow section of the aquifer 5 10 m below the water table and wells d1 and d2 penetrate to a deeper section 35 46 m below the water table fig 2 table s1 groundwater samples were taken in five sampling campaigns from apr 2017 to jan 2019 the detailed sampling procedure is described in aharoni et al 2020 for each well 2 500 ml polyethylene bottles were filled with no headspace and stored in a cooler at 4 c for 15n and 18o analysis a portion of the sample 50 ml was filtered 0 22 µm and kept frozen for preservation prior to analysis 2 4 chemical analysis electric conductivity ec and ph of samples were measured on site upon sampling in groundwater samples

δ15n nh4 analysis was based on the principles of the ammonium distillation method buresh et al 1982 unkovich et al 1993 dissolved nh4 in the samples was separated using a steam distillation apparatus velp scientifica udk 149 connected to a trap of weak sulfuric acid then nh4 2so4 salt was precipitated by controlled drying at 110 c and analyzed for δ15n composition on an elemental analyzer ea thermo scientific flash 2000 ht coupled with irms thermo scientific delta v plus method precision was 0 3 for minimum concentrations of 1 mg l nh4 nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were measured according

scientific delta v advantage the method s precision was 0 5 for minimum concentrations of 0 05 mg l no3 or no2 all isotope values are reported in δ with respect to air 15n or vsmow 18o measurements

were filtrated 0 22 µ and stored in closed vials with minimum headspace prior to analysis 2 6 isotopic data analysis due to the extreme heterogeneity the multiplicity of n sources and variable flow paths in a landfill environment we could not use conventional models for isotopic analysis therefore we have adopted the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach that incorporates the values measured for each of the n species δ15n nh4 no3 no2 representing a status snapshot for the specific time and location in which the sample was taken and is independent of source or flow path based on existing knowledge regarding the isotopic effects of n involving biochemical processes and the ratio between the din species we could learn about the environmental conditions and the dominant transformation pathways affecting each sample typical ranges for isotopic fractionation of these processes are summarized in table 1 nitrite is highly reactive in microbial processes its isotopic value reflects the immediate n transformations in the sampled environment while that of ammonium and nitrate reflect more of a cumulative effect of processes along the flow path due to their longer residual time casciotti 2016 wells et al 2016 the isotopic relation expected for a full nitrification process is δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 δ15n no2 because of the normal fractionation effect during ammonium oxidation amox followed by inverse fractionation during nitrite oxidation nitox casciotti 2009 denk et al 2017 table 1 leaving the nitrite highly depleted in a nitrification dominated environment a good estimation for the differences δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 is up to 29 and δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 from 5 to 16 5 heaton et al 2005 wells et al 2018 thus when δ15n no3 values are equal or heavier than δ15n nh4 it signifies that nitrate reduction processes through denitrification denit or dnra are influencing the nitrate pool counteracting the isotopic fractionation created by nitrification denitrification will also further enrich δ15n no3 compared to δ15n no2 and can result in a high δ15n no3 δ15n no2 difference 30 50 since both nitrification and denitrification contribute to a progressive depletion of δ15n no2 a positive correlation between the differences δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 and δ15n no3 δ15n no2 is an isotopic pattern typical for a nitrification denitrification controlled environment wells et al 2016 in contrast the nitrite reduction process nitrd is the only mechanism that enriches δ15n no2 values of the residual nitrite specific relations between the isotopic values of n species are obtained during autotrophic nitrite reduction anammox or nitrifier denitrification which do not involve nitrate reduction and result in increased enrichment of δ15n no2 relative to δ15n no3 thus the difference δ15n no3 δ15n no2 helps to distinguish between nitrification denitrification processes to autotrophic nitrite reduction as only the latter will independently enrich the nitrite and decrease this difference to values below 10 wells et al 2016 the dual isotopic analysis of 15n and 18o in nitrate provides a powerful tool to evaluate the measure of denitrification and an established method to distinguish between nitrate sources coming from leachates or agricultural fertilizers cossu et al 2018 fenech et al 2012 xue et al 2009 the values of δ15n and δ18o in newly formed nitrate can be predicted by the isotopic fractionation caused by nitrification as a good estimation δ15n no3 will be lighter by 5 to 16 5 from the δ15n nh4 of the ammonium source the δ18o no3 values of the formed nitrate can be predicted as a 2 1 incorporation ratio of δ 18o in the water and the atmospheric o2 23 5 snider et al 2010 however empirically the δ18o no3 values tend to shift towards the δ18o of the water due to the high exchange rate of o atoms between dissolved nitrite and water during nitrification boshers et al 2019 kool et al 2011 during nitrate reduction both δ15n and δ18o are enriched in the residual nitrate a slope of 1 1 is generally suggested to represent the enrichment pattern expected by denitrification casciotti 2016 granger and wankel 2016 3 results and discussion the present study is focused on the speciation and transformations of nitrogen in a landfill environment as abovementioned landfill sites are characterized by waste heterogeneity a multiplicity of sources areas of preferential flow and sharp and unpredictable changes in environmental conditions inevitably affecting the nitrogenous species we therefore used an approach in which we characterized each n form compared to the other nitrogenous species in the same sample the relation between them concentrations and isotopic values is indicative of the environmental conditions and the main processes that took place at this point even when they cannot be measured directly due to water content limitations in this medium it was not always possible to extract sufficient sample volume for both the chemical and isotopic analysis when the ratio is discussed we presented only data of sampling points in which all the relevant parameters could be reliably measured the first part of the discussion section 3 1 follows din species along the percolation path from the leachate s origin in the waste body through the unsaturated zone below and down to the groundwater the second part section 3 2 will discuss din species in the aquifer beneath the landfill 3 1 din in the waste and the unsaturated zone the samples from the waste and the unsaturated zone were collected using the vmss sampling ports as described above a general characterization of the chemical environment leachates composition and flow dynamics in the research site was provided in our previous study aharoni et al 2020 in brief the two vmss installed in the landfill site reflected the chemical heterogeneity and the different environments created in each section the upper vms b was installed directly inside the waste body the chemical composition of water samples from vms b showed the characteristics of leachates as they are created and migrated through the waste body these samples contained high levels of organic matter doc 200 2000 mg l tn 20 360 mg l and salinity cl 50 2000 mg l the lower system vms a is positioned in the sandy unsaturated zone so that the upper units reflect the conditions underneath the landfill margins while the deepest reflect the conditions under the center and close to the water table samples from vms a provided evidence for the migration of leachates from the waste downwards through the unsaturated zone these samples contained doc 50 3000 mg l tn 15 530 mg l and cl 90 2330 mg l while the ranges of these major contaminants were similar between samples from the waste and the unsaturated zone the chemical nature of the leachates differ significantly specifically samples from the upper section of the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 3 9 m bls situated below the landfill margins showed more oxidized chemical characteristics whereas samples from inside the waste vms b and beneath the center of the mound lower cells of vms a indicated more anaerobic conditions the concentrations of din components in the samples extracted by each vsp 3b is largely related to the inherent spatial variability of leachates composition in the landfill environment aharoni et al 2017 2020 thus comparison of the concentrations of n species in different samples cannot serve as an indication for the transformations taking place in the unsaturated profile to describe the din speciation in a comparable and concise manner we have defined the n oxidation factor nof fig 3 c the nof presents the relation between reduced n nh4 to the oxidized n forms no3 no2 eqn 1 e q 1 n o x i d a t i o n f a c t o r n o f n o 3 n n o 2 n n h 4 n d i n nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations are in mg n l and din is the sum of all mineral n species concentrations in a specific sample a solution controlled by ammonium as the main mineral n form produced by organic matter degradation in the leachates will lead to nof 0 in the samples indicating a reduced environment a value of nof 0 signifies that most of the nitrogen in the sample had been transformed into oxidized forms no2 or no3 implying significant nitrification processes and an oxidized environment 3 1 1 the gaseous phase and n oxidation factor gas samples taken at the site in nov 2019 supported our previous observations fig 3a the samples from the two uppermost vsps inside the waste body contained low levels of oxygen 6 1 and 3 8 o2 for vms b 1 4 and 2 7 m bls respectively indicating some air diffusion into the waste near the surface indeed nof values showed strong variability ranging from completely reduced to partly oxidized conditions between sampling occasions fig 3c we presume that the limited levels of oxygen in these sections were rapidly consumed causing strong fluctuation in the redox conditions these changes in the upper vsps of the waste might be attributed to the entry of rainwater or changes in the structure of the decomposing waste nevertheless they did not follow any seasonal pattern in the deeper sections of the waste 4 3 8 1 m bls oxygen was completely exhausted indicating an anaerobic environment fig 3a nof values were consistently low nof 0 97 in these sampling points showing that most of the din was in reduced form fig 3b the elevated concentrations of methane and sulfide also indicated anaerobic methanogenesis and sulfate reduction metabolism the large peak in methane measured at 6 2 m bls reflects the existence of local hot spots of organic waste degradation within the heterogeneous waste body fig 3a such hot spot activity is often accompanied by elevated nh4 concentrations in the leachates as a byproduct aharoni et al 2017 which was indeed measured at the same sampling port fig 3b in contrast oxygen existed in gas samples from all the ports in the unsaturated zone beneath the landfill vms a from 16 8 o2 in the uppermost sampling port gradually decreasing to 5 4 o2 in the deepest one 9 9 m bls presumably due to air diffusion through the sandy unsaturated zone in accordance the highest nof values 0 79 1 were measured in the upper section of the unsaturated zone underneath the landfill margins vms a 0 8 3 9 m bls fig 3c implying a maximum n oxidation with almost complete consumption of ammonium in deeper sections although oxygen was relatively depleted it was not completely exhausted indeed methane and sulfide were both not detected even in the deep section of the unsaturated zone suggesting that the conditions did not turn completely anaerobic fig 3a a strong variation of nof values over time was observed in the deeper sampling point of the unsaturated zone vms a 9 9 m bls fig 3c these values represent significant changes in redox conditions which are probably related to the proximity and fluctuations of the more aerated water table below 3 1 2 ammonium in the waste and unsaturated zone ammonium is the primary din product of ammonification occurring during the degradation of organic matter in the waste its concentrations are the highest in the reduced sections of the profile and lowest under more oxidizing conditions presumably as a result of oxidation processes fig 3 and aharoni et al 2020 samples from the reduced sections of the waste body and the underlying unsaturated zone had a δ15n nh4 value range between 3 to 10 fig 4 we had no way to directly measure the isotopic values of organic nitrogen in the solid waste within the landfill however since the ammonification process creates low to non significant isotopic fractionation table 1 we consider the measured range to be a good representation for the δ15n of the organic nitrogen source material in the landfill environment ammonium in the unsaturated zone may also be prone to adsorption and precipitation but neither is expected to significantly affect its isotopic values nikolenko et al 2017 this range is compatible with previously reported δ15n nh4 values for landfill leachates bustos and aravena 2011 heaton et al 2005 3 1 3 nitrite accumulation in the waste and unsaturated zone in a landfill environment nitrite is primarily produced by the oxidation of ammonium during the first step of nitrification however it is a reactive intermediate compound in all major n transformation processes as illustrated in fig 1 therefore it is normally rapidly consumed under natural conditions interestingly we have found exceptionally high nitrite concentrations in samples from the unsaturated zone vms a 1 8 3 9 9 9 m bls reaching up to 126 mg l no2 n although the concentrations varied significantly between samples fig 3b some lower yet significant nitrite concentrations 7 23 mg l no2 n were also measured in the upper section of the waste body vms b 1 4 2 7 m bls the accumulation was observed in vsps with low yet not completely depleted o2 levels fig 3 nitrite was hardly accumulated in the relatively aerated uppermost section of the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 m bls o2 16 8 nor deep inside the waste body vms b 6 2 8 1 m bls where the environment was completely anaerobic certain environmental conditions have been suggested to impair several metabolic pathways that can induce substantial nitrite accumulation 1 partial nitrification due to free ammonia nh3 inhibition at concentrations as low as 0 1 1 mg l nh3 n ganigué et al 2007 venterea et al 2015 2 partial nitrification under low oxygen conditions do range of 0 5 to 2 mg l jianlong and ning 2004 ruiz et al 2003 3 partial nitrate reduction during denitrification dnra under unstable environmental conditions such as ph c n ratio do and no3 concentrations du et al 2016 ge et al 2012 glass and silverstein 1998 4 heavy metals toxicity might inhibit the microbial activity and affect n oxidation or reduction pathways gui et al 2017 liu et al 2019 we have calculated the free ammonia nh3 levels in the leachates samples based on the nh4 concentrations ph and temperature pka 9 25 anthonisen et al 1976 although they exceeded in some cases the threshold values suggested for nh3 inhibition there was no correlation r2 0 03 data not shown between the calculated nh3 levels to the measure of nitrite accumulation no2 n din in the samples no correlation was found with heavy metals concentrations either therefore we assume that the inhibitory effect of these factors as the major cause for nitrite accumulation can be ruled out hence low oxygen levels and unstable redox conditions are the most probable factors affecting nitrite extensive accumulation either by partial nitrification or by inhibition of nitrite reduction to better understand the main factors affecting nitrite fate in the waste and unsaturated zone we have used isotopic tools employing the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach the relations between the values found for the different species and the isotopic fractionation affecting them are detailed at length in the methodology chapter in the uppermost vsp of the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 m bls nitrite was isotopically depleted compared to nitrate so that the difference δ15n no3 δ15n no2 had positive values 15 40 fig 5 implying an aerobic nitrification controlled environment in vms b 2 7 m bls and vms a 6 8 to 9 9 m bls the difference δ15n no3 δ15n no2 was decreased and ranged between 0 to 1 5 revealing the growing effect of autotrophic nitrite reduction processes we found that as the effect of autotrophic nitrite reduction increases as demonstrated by lower δ15n no3 δ15n no2 difference the ratio of no2 n total din in the samples increased indicating no2 accumulation at these environments fig 5a 5c this observation has no simple explanation because nitrite reduction is a consumption process rather than an accumulation mechanism it appears that under the specific redox conditions created at these sections of the unsaturated zone inhibition of no2 oxidation was causing its accumulation thus making it available as a substrate for significant autotrophic nitrite reduction that enriched its isotopic values we further found that the autotrophic nitrite reduction was also associated with decreasing din br values serving as a measure for net n removal fig 5d more details in section 3 2 5 these results indicate an important contribution of autotrophic nitrite reduction pathways to promote effective nitrogen attenuation in the waste and the unsaturated zone below the landfill 3 1 4 nitrate in the waste and the unsaturated zone nitrate is formed in the leachates under aerobic conditions as the end product of nitrification unlike nitrite which is highly reactive nitrate is more stable and tends to leach down the profile and accumulate in the groundwater under low oxygen conditions nitrate might be reduced most commonly via denitrification in which nitrate transforms into n2o then n2 gases a process that will attenuate din concentrations in the leachates other processes like dnra might adversely transform the nitrate back to ammonium thus preventing net din attenuation xin et al 2019 the upper section of the unsaturated zone underlying the margins of the landfill vms a 0 8 1 8 m bls is aerated and most prone for nitrification o2 levels are the highest in this section and nof values show that over 89 of the din is oxidized fig 3 indeed the isotopic values found in this section fit the expected pattern for nitrification δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 by 5 5 and δ15n no3 δ15n no2 by 6 40 casciotti 2009 denk et al 2017 table 1 fig 4 in all other vsps inside the waste and in the deep vadose zone δ15n no3 was generally equal or heavier than δ15n nh4 fig 4 a pattern suggesting the contribution of significant nitrate reduction dual isotopic analysis of δ15n δ18o values in nitrate was used to determine the effect of additional processes other than nitrification on the dissolved nitrate pool in the waste and the unsaturated zone the expected isotopic range for newly formed nitrate in the leachates was calculated according to the considerations detailed in the data analysis section of the methodology chapter sec 2 1 if only nitrification was involved nitrate in the leachates would have a predictable range of δ15n no3 19 5 to 5 to estimate the oxygen isotopic values in newly formed nitrate we have measured water isotopes in the leachates samples and found a narrow range of δ18o h2o 4 6 1 4 n 16 accordingly the formed nitrate would have a predictable range of δ18o no3 4 6 to 4 7 ranging from a 2 1 incorporation ratio with atmospheric oxygen to a full exchange with water the range of δ15n δ18o values expected by nitrification is marked by the grey rectangle in fig 6 the dual isotopic compositions of nitrate δ18o δ15n in leachates samples both in the waste and in the unsaturated zone were all above the expected range for newly formed nitrate fig 6 indicating the influence of nitrate reduction most of these samples fell inside the boundaries of 1 1 slope trajectory lines representing the predicted enrichment effect expected by denitrification casciotti 2016 granger and wankel 2016 samples from the more oxidized areas the upper cells in the waste vms b 1 4 m bls and in the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 to 3 9 m bls had the lowest δ15n δ18o values therefore they had undergone the smallest measure of nitrate reduction nevertheless denitrification was effective to some extent even in these sections as their values spread along the denitrification slope fig 6 this co occurrence of oxidation reduction processes can be explained by the creation of micro zonation or temporal anaerobic conditions within a generally oxidized environment rivett et al 2008 another possible explanation might be the flow of leachates from upper layers in which they have already undergone partial oxidation reduction cycles inside the waste body vms b 6 2 m and 8 1 m bls and in the deep vadose zone vms a 6 8 m and 9 9 m bls the conditions turned to be anaerobic the enrichment in δ15n δ18o observed in these cells indicates intensified denitrification fig 6 and nitrate concentrations were accordingly very low no3 n 0 1 2 mg l fig 3 nitrate reduction to ammonium via dnra is also viable and may account for some of the detected nitrate reduction hardison et al 2015 few samples fell outside of the proposed denitrification slope lines such a diversion can be explained by the re oxidation of nitrite during denitrification casciotti 2016 granger and wankel 2016 in any case these enriched values seem to represent residual nitrate that has undergone significant reduction rather than freshly formed by in situ nitrification 3 1 5 evaluation of net nitrogen attenuation in the unsaturated zone the estimation of net variation in din concentrations in the landfill environment is highly complicated this is due to the inherent spatial variability of the medium the generation of new din substances following ongoing organic matter degradation and intercrossing of leachates flow paths through the profile thus in order to gain a better evaluation of net n attenuation along the percolation path we chose to normalize the total din concentration in the samples to the overall leachate strength for this purpose we used the ratio din br fig 5b since bromide br was found as an effective conservative tracer for leachates concentration aharoni et al 2020 woodman et al 2015 accordingly decreasing din br values along the profile would indicate net nitrogen attenuation din and br concentrations throughout the profile are presented in the supplementary material fig s2 the ratio din br was relatively high at the upper sections of the waste vms b 1 4 m bls and the unsaturated zone vms a 0 8 m bls then gradually decreased with depth fig 5b the lowest values were found in the deep unsaturated zone vms a 9 9 m bls this observation indicates a net removal of din during the percolation through the unsaturated zone towards the groundwater these findings are well suited with the results described above demonstrating a significant impact of nitrate and nitrite reduction this way din components were transformed and emitted as gaseous n2o and n2 hence relieving the nitrogen contamination reaching the groundwater 3 2 din in groundwater the din concentrations in groundwater samples were significantly lower than those measured in the leachates from the waste and unsaturated zone fig 7 a the highest din levels were measured underneath the center of the waste mound well s2 30 56 mg l and the lowest in the up flow and deep wells wells uf d1 d2 din 6 14 mg l in a previous study we calculated that the major portion of din attenuation in the groundwater was attributed to dilution 70 99 mixing ratio based on br as a conservative tracer for leachates concentration as described above however nitrogen transformation processes were found to account for 10 50 attenuation of the dissolved nitrogen in the groundwater on top of the dilution effect aharoni et al 2020 the mixing of the leachate plume in the more aerated aquifer directly affected the nitrogen speciation nitrate was found to be the dominating species in most of the groundwater samples with nof 0 5 fig 7b indicating oxidizing conditions and implying a nitrification controlled environment the only well in which ammonium was the dominant species nof 0 84 is s2 located underneath the center of the waste mound signifying anaerobic reducing conditions in this section we found that by comparing nof vs do concentrations fig 7c a threshold of 0 5 mg l do may be defined below which sub oxic conditions seem to induce instability and co occurrence of both oxidized no3 and reduced nh4 species wells s1 s2 e1 e2 and above which aerobic nitrification transforms the major portion of din to nitrate this value is within the range suggested in previous studies nikolenko et al 2017 3 2 1 ammonium in groundwater the range of δ15n nh4 measured in groundwater samples 2 to 14 fig 8 resembled that of samples from inside the waste body relating to the ammonium source to the leachates that were percolated into the aquifer we found no correlation between nh4 n concentrations to δ15n nh4 values in the groundwater samples indicating that here as well there is no single and uniform source of ammonium in the aquifer rather it leaches into the aquifer at different points with different concentrations and fluxes 3 2 2 nitrite in groundwater in the groundwater we did not identify the high accumulation of nitrite as observed in the unsaturated zone apparently nitrite was quickly consumed and concentrations were low in all the groundwater samples 0 2 mg l no2 n nonetheless the nitrite isotopic composition provides additional information regarding the biochemical mechanisms controlling n transformations in the plume in all the groundwater samples δ15n no2 values were lighter than both δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 samples from wells distant from the center of the plume df d1 and d2 had δ15n no2 values in the range 14 to 24 while samples from wells most affected by the leachates s1 s2 e1 e1 had lighter values of 29 to 38 fig 8 the differences of δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 and δ15n no3 δ15n no2 across all wells were positively correlated p 0 05 fig 9 a this isotopic pattern is consistent with a nitrification denitrification controlled environment wells et al 2016 the samples from wells df d1 d2 had δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 difference mostly within the range expected by nitrification up to 29 table 1 and section 2 6 above instead in wells s1 s2 e1 e1 beneath the landfill boundaries this isotopic difference grew beyond the expected range and reached 32 to 51 fig 9 reflecting the cumulative effect of co occurring denitrification wells et al 2016 in addition we found a negative correlation of the difference δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 to do levels in the groundwater samples at do 0 5 mg l the isotopic difference increased to over 35 fig 9b indicating that under low oxygen conditions nitrate reduction contributes to additional isotopic depletion of the residual nitrite 3 2 3 nitrate in groundwater nitrate background concentrations in the aquifer surrounding the landfill vary from 0 4 2 7 mg l no3 n iwa 2009 therefore the elevated levels found in the groundwater samples in the landfill site up to 54 mg l no3 n indicate local leachates contribution when the reduced leachates percolate out of the anoxic conditions in the deep unsaturated zone and encounter the more aerated groundwater nitrate concentrations sharply increased indicating the effect of strong nitrification fig 7c in an oxidized nitrification dominated environment we expect an isotopic relation of δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 table 1 section 2 6 however in all the measured groundwater samples δ15n no3 values were enriched and resembled the range of δ15n nh4 fig 8 in well s2 the most anaerobic section of the plume nitrate was highly enriched δ15n no3 19 24 with δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 by 6 2 to 12 1 fig 8 corresponding to a reduction dominated environment izbicki 2014 nitrate dual isotopic analyses in groundwater samples provided further evidence for nitrate reduction processes all the samples fell roughly within the predicted δ15n δ18o no3 slope range indicating denitrification of nitrate in the leachates fig 10 section 2 6 none of the samples fitted the isotopic range of nitrate originated from synthetic fertilizers xue et al 2009 thus ruling out a significant contribution of agricultural sources it appears that the effect of nitrate reduction was observed not only in the anaerobic section of the plume well s2 but also in all other wells even where the chemical parameters were of an oxidized environment with nitrate as the dominating n species one possible explanation is that nitrate has undergone a reduction in the unsaturated zone and carries the isotopic enrichment effect as it flows to the more oxidized aquifer alternatively denitrification could be proceeding in micro environments in the aquifer even in a nitrification dominated environment the results of the multiple n species isotopic analysis support the latter the implied din attenuation mechanism in the groundwater is in line with our previous measurements of net n attenuation in the aquifer aharoni 2020 4 summary and conclusions din evolution in landfill leachates was studied to characterize n speciation and dominant biochemical processes affecting its fate in a highly contaminated environment the study used a unique monitoring system vms for repetitive sampling in the inaccessible sections of the waste and unsaturated zone beneath a landfill observation wells penetrating to the underlying groundwater completed the sampling setup the use of the multiple n species isotopic analysis approach enabled the decoding of biochemical processes involving nitrogen species within the waste unsaturated zone and groundwater even when sources and flow paths were unknown due to the heterogeneity of this medium the main findings were strictly reduced environment was found inside the waste body while upper layers were slightly aerated as shown by oxygen level and fluctuating oxidation state of n species the conditions in the deep sections revealed highly reduced traits characteristics were low n oxidation factor with very high concentrations of nh4 in the gaseous phase oxygen was completely depleted and elevated levels of methane and sulfide indicated anaerobic methanogenesis and sulfate reduction relatively aerated conditions were found in the upper layers of the vadose zone beneath the waste margins gradually becoming more reducing with depth as indicated by decreasing oxygen levels nevertheless the environment in the vadose zone has not turned completely anaerobic evident by the presence of oxygen and lack of methane and sulfide gases nitrate was accumulated in the upper oxidized layers up to 490 mg l no3 n due to intensive nitrification yet its isotopic values δ15n δ18o indicated co occurrence of denitrification even in the most aerated sections of the unsaturated zone contributing to din attenuation ammonium the source compound of din in the leachates up to 360 mg l nh4 n had a distinct range of isotopic values δ15n nh4 between 3 to 10 in all samples in areas where oxygen concentrations were limited significant fluctuation in nitrogen speciation was observed implying sharp changes in redox conditions exceptionally strong variation was observed in the proximity of groundwater probably due to changes in groundwater level unusually high accumulation of nitrite up to 126 mg l no2 n was found in profile sections in which oxygen was available yet limited isotopic analysis indicated that nitrite in these sections was becoming isotopically heavier relative to nitrate signifying the effect of autotrophic nitrite reduction this process was associated with net din attenuation revealing the importance of autotrophic nitrite reduction to the attenuation of din contamination in the unsaturated zone below landfills as the leachates emerged from the unsaturated zone and mixed with the more aerated groundwater rapid n oxidation occurred hence nitrate became the dominant species in all the wells except that found in the center of the plume nitrite was rapidly consumed in the groundwater and its concentrations were accordingly low yet nitrite isotopic values were found to be important for the understanding of the din transformations in the aquifer the correlated enrichment of δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 compared to δ15n no2 δ15n nh4 δ15n no2 vs δ15n no3 δ15n no2 indicated the existence of nitrification denitrification controlled environment this influence grew in wells close to the center of the plume where dissolved oxygen levels were below 0 5 mg liter denitrification was also indicated by the ratio of δ15n δ18o in groundwater as the values in all wells were above the expected range for nitrate newly formed by nitrification co existence of denitrification in all the wells even under the more aerated conditions contributes to the mitigation of the din load in the groundwater these results are consistent with our previous findings showing a net 10 50 din attenuation in the leachates

15889,sub daily tracking of dynamic features and events using high spatial resolution satellite imagery has only recently become possible with advanced observational capabilities now available through tasking of satellite constellations here we provide a first of its kind demonstration of using sub daily 0 50 m resolution skysat imagery to track coastal water flows combining these data with object based detection and a machine learning approach to map the extent and concentration of two dye plumes coincident high frequency unmanned aerial vehicle uav imagery was also employed for quantitative modeling of dye concentration and evaluation of the sub daily satellite based dye tracking our results show that sub daily skysat imagery can track dye plume extent with low omission 8 73 16 05 and commission errors 0 32 2 77 and model dye concentration coefficient of determination 0 73 root mean square error 28 68 ppb with the assistance of high frequency uav data the results also demonstrate the capabilities of using uav imagery for scaling between field data and satellite imagery for tracking coastal water flow dynamics this research has implications for monitoring of water flows and nutrient or pollution exchange and it also demonstrates the capabilities of higher temporal resolution satellite data for delivering further insights into dynamic processes of coastal systems

dynamics is important for implementation of informed conservation strategies and management activities drainage from rivers and runoff can contribute to sedimentation nutrient inputs and pollution of coastal waters that can significantly affect aquatic ecosystems such as mangroves coral reefs seagrass habitats and marine life depending on such ecosystems for their survival carlson et al 2021 water circulation and flows between different habitats can be complex and vary in response to wind and tidal currents and are in many cases poorly understood due to the difficulty of monitoring water movement in coastal areas perera valderrama et al 2020 despite the capability to monitor water flows from in situ instrument installations such instruments are often costly to install and maintain and their use is spatially restrictive providing limited information for larger stretches of coastal areas mardani et al 2020 the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs combined with recent advances in miniaturized sensing technologies have revolutionized local area mapping and monitoring applications tmusic et al 2020 uav based data are ideally placed to track spatio temporally dynamic processes with a number of recent studies using these platforms to track fluorescent plumes in channels lakes and coastal areas e g baek et al 2019 johansen et al 2022 pinton et al 2020 powers et al 2018 larger scale and longer term monitoring of coastal waters through regular uav based dye tracer deployments can provide insights into the patterns and variability of coastal flow regimes such studies are needed to better understand the dynamic effects of tides currents and winds and their impact on the movement and dispersion of nutrients sediments and pollutants blumberg 1994 a better understanding of coastal water flows from tracking of fluorescent plumes may also facilitate more informed management intervention particularly in relation to application of aquatic herbicides fox et al 1993 treatment of harmful algal blooms park et al 2017 coral reef restoration fox et al 2019 and mangrove rehabilitation and reforestation ellison et al 2020 johansen et al 2022 used a hovering uav over a coastal area of the red sea to collect data every 10 s ensuring coincident uav and field data collection of dye plume concentration for tracing coastal water flows however even though uav based monitoring can obtain information at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than satellite image data uav based experiments cannot cover the large spatial extents achievable from satellite based imaging uav data may be integrated with satellite data for data comparison validation and multi scale explorations e g doughty et al 2021 gray et al 2018 revill et al 2020 as opposed to satellite image acquisitions the flexibility of uav sensing technologies and their capabilities to collect near continuous data over extended periods make them useful for a variety of earth observation purposes but especially for pseudo calibration of satellite data alvarez vanhard et al 2021 while a limited number of studies have used quantitative uav derived estimates to calibrate satellite based models e g for mapping seagrass cover carpenter et al 2022 there is no literature on uav based model calibration of satellite data for hydrologic monitoring applications such as coastal water flows the last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the availability of high spatial resolution space based imagery dial et al 2003 tanaka and sugimura 2001 gore et al 2017 however high spatial resolution satellite data acquisitions are typically restricted to set overpass times preventing sub daily monitoring of highly dynamic features mccabe et al 2017 while geostationary satellite sensors such as china s gaofen4 the us geostationary operational environmental satellite goes system and europe s meteosat satellites offer continuous coverage over large geographical areas they do not provide the spatial resolution needed for the identification of fine scale features wang et al 2017 in recent years we have witnessed a new epoch in earth observation where constellations of hundreds of cubesats e g planetscope provide near daily coverage for any place on earth essentially collapsing the spatio temporal divide houborg and mccabe 2016 such satellite constellations promise multiple same sensor type acquisitions at high spatial resolution within a single day allowing the monitoring of dynamic features over short time scales in the order of hours for example planet s skysat constellation consisting of 21 satellites provides taskable operation for provision of sub meter resolution data with up to 6 7 daily revisits bhushan et al 2021 esa 2022 while satellite based studies have been used to map water turbidity waste plumes and oil spills hafeez et al 2019 limited repeat coverage and spatial resolution generally preclude space based monitoring of highly dynamic features currently there is no published research demonstrating the utility of sub daily high spatial resolution skysat image data here we demonstrate the skysat image capabilities for sub daily monitoring of hydrodynamics in coastal areas supported by high spatio temporal uav based imaging the specific objectives were to 1 measure dye dispersion from sub daily skysat image data to exhibit current capabilities of high spatial resolution satellite constellations and 2 demonstrate how high frequency uav data may be employed together with field measurements for model calibration to map dye concentration from skysat image data our research represents a first of its kind example of using high spatial resolution satellite image data for sub daily tracking of dye plumes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the study area was located 80 km north of jeddah saudi arabia along the coast of the red sea fig 1 the intertidal zone is covered by mangroves leading out to shallow areas consisting of sandy substrates with coral rubble macroalgae reef and irregular patches of seagrass the water depth within the study area was generally 0 5 4 m to the south of the mangroves with the dominant substrate being sand a 200 m wide and up to 16 m deep natural channel was located on the western side of the study area twenty two ground control points were evenly distributed within the study area for geo referencing the uav data asd handheld 2 spectroradiometer measurements malvern panalytical malvern united kingdom were collected from six radiometric calibration panels that were placed within the imaged area to facilitate radiometric correction of the uav data to at surface reflectance at two locations in the water 300 ml of fluorescent rhodamine water tracing wt dye was released at 09 50 mangrove site and 10 07 seagrass site on march 18 2021 shortly after high tide 58 cm above lowest astronomical tide 09 42 the motivation for releasing the dye at high tide was to assess the influence of an ebbing tide on the offshore movement of dissolved or particulate nutrients from mangrove and seagrass habitats towards nearby coral reefs the initial concentration of the 300 ml of dye consisted of 20 rhodamine wt in water when released at the mangrove and seagrass sites the dye was mixed into the shallow approximately 1 m water column with a large paddle rhodamine wt is often used as a conservative tracer of water movement and decomposes slowly under natural uv light vasudevan et al 2001 so mass conservation of the dye was assumed over the time scale of our study water samples for dye concentration assessment were collected at 15 different locations within each of the two dye plumes i e 30 samples in total within 80 min of dye release johansen et al 2022 based on visual observations at each of the 30 locations the dye appeared to be well mixed in the shallow water possibly due to the wind and ebbing tides grab samples of surface water were collected in bottles by a researcher wading in the shallow water to minimize disturbance of the plumes areas with different dye concentrations based on visual observation were targeted during the collection of the grab samples these samples were subsequently stored in a dark cooler until laboratory analysis to determine dye concentration in parts per billion ppb for the analysis a calibration curve made by rhodamine wt standards with a range from 5 to 200 ppb was used 2 2 uav data collection processing and mapping of dye plume extent and concentration as the uav data collection processing and mapping components are described in johansen et al 2022 only a brief overview is provided here two dji mavic 2 pro quadcopters sz dji technology co ltd shenzhen china with a gimbal stabilized 20mp hasselblad l1d 20c camera victor hasselblad ab gothenburg sweden were initially used to collect photos every 10 s between 09 48 and 11 22 and from 10 06 to 11 14 for the mangrove and seagrass dye release sites respectively during in situ water sampling for dye concentration assessment while hovering at a height of 400 m subsequently nine pre planned uav flight surveys were undertaken at a height of 300 m a speed of 8 m s and with a forward overlap of 94 and a sidelap of 66 between 11 23 and 15 47 to expand the spatial coverage in response to dye plume dispersion the agisoft metashape software was used to produce geo referenced orthomosaics based on deployed ground control points with a pixel size of approximately 0 074 m as the ground control points in the water could not be accurately surveyed all orthomosaics and individual photos collected while hovering were geo referenced based on the uav based orthomosaic produced from the image data of the first flight survey 11 23 11 39 to ensure accurate spatial overlap between all uav data sets in this experiment only the relative geometric accuracy as opposed to absolute accuracy of the uav and skysat image data sets was important for data integration and comparison the digital numbers of the hovering photos and orthomosaics were converted to at surface reflectance using an empirical line correction method ahmed et al 2017 based on the radiometric calibration panels a geographic object based image analysis approach geobia blaschke 2010 johansen et al 2010 was applied to delineate the dye plume extent from the uav imagery dye concentration was mapped using a regression approach between the measured dye concentration of the 30 field derived water samples and an interaction term i e the multiplication of the red blue and red green band ratios r e d b l u e r e d g r e e n derived from hovering uav photos collected at the exact time of each water sample used to determine dye concentration see johansen et al 2022 for more detailed description 2 3 skysat data collection and processing the skysat constellation consists of 21 high spatial resolution satellites that are operated by planet labs inc esa 2022 the skysat satellites provide data covering the blue 450 515 nm green 515 595 nm red 605 695 nm near infrared nir 740 900 nm and panchromatic 450 900 nm spectral ranges skysat data used in this study were collected at 10 41 while hovering uav photos were collected every 10 s at an off nadir angle of 12 6 and at 13 50 within 10 min of uav flight survey 4 at an off nadir angle of 14 9 at the time of the skysat image collections the sun elevation and azimuth angles were 54 5 and 127 0 at 10 41 and 60 0 and 222 2 at 13 50 respectively both skysat images which were provided as orthorectified surface reflectance products at a spatial resolution of 0 50 m were geo referenced to the uav orthomosaic based on the first flight survey root mean square error rmse 0 11 m the radiometric consistency between the two skysat surface reflectance images was assessed using an empirical line method for each corresponding band of the two skysat images based on seven points of homogenous pseudo invariant features of different brightness levels karpouzli and malthus 2003 padro et al 2018 the seven features consisted of two areas of grass beach sand a dirt road deep water concrete and an artificial surface in a children s play area all four spectral band pairs of the two skysat images produced a near perfect 1 1 linear function with coefficient of determinations r2 0 99 hence no further pre processing was applied to the two skysat surface reflectance images 2 4 mapping dye plume extent from skysat image data the extent of the two dye plumes was mapped from the two skysat images using a geobia approach and the ecognition developer software trimble geospatial munich germany a geobia approach was deemed most suited for mapping the dye plumes due to the ability to assess object characteristics neighborhood relationships and contextual information johansen et al 2010 additional reasons for using a geobia approach included 1 the central parts of the plumes were simple to identify while the edges with lower dye concentration were more complicated to classify which made an object based region growing approach particularly suited 2 class related information was required to include small mangrove stands surrounded by dye and preclude the omission of small areas with wave action appearing bright instead of magenta within the plumes i e identifying small un classified objects fully enclosed by pixels classified as plumes 3 prevent non dye pixels from being classified as dye plumes based on object size and location and 4 repeatedly modify and refine the object boundary of the dye plumes based on an assessment of the blue green and red bands three indices were produced from the multispectral skysat data including the red blue and red green ratios and the product of those two ratios as areas with low dye concentration occurring in shallow areas 1 m depth with sandy substrates were difficult to discriminate from a single skysat image skysat image 2 acquired at 13 50 was subtracted from skysat image 1 acquired at 10 41 to produce change images using the individual bands as well as the derived indices using change images also ensured that influences from the substrate reflectance were canceled out i e there was no change in substrates between the two geo referenced skysat images and that changes in the dye plume extents were accentuated fig 2 a chessboard segmentation with a scale value of 1 was first used for initial pixel based classification for mapping of the dye plumes in skysat image 2 an empirical threshold of 0 20 was set for both the red blue and red green change ratios for initial detection of the pixels with high dye concentrations based on visual assessment of the dye plumes in the skysat imagery after merging neighboring pixels obeying the threshold the central part of the dye plumes could be mapped based on their object size then the central parts of the dye plumes were expanded into areas with lower dye concentrations using a pixel based object resizing algorithm johansen et al 2011 and more relaxed thresholds i e red blue change ratio 0 05 and red green change ratio 0 10 these thresholds were set empirically based on an evaluation of 50 locations using a stratified random selection of pixels mapped with dye concentrations 25 ppb in the coincident uav data collected at 10 41 johansen et al 2022 in the skysat derived ratio change maps in areas with low concentration unclassified objects enclosed by pixels classified as dye plume were incorporated as part of the dye plume with all classified pixels subsequently merged the same processing steps were used to map the dye plume extents in skysat image 1 but with the thresholds inverted for the change maps the processing workflow is presented in fig 3 while the above mentioned steps mapped the majority of the dye plume extents the change maps were not suited for mapping those parts of the dye plumes that were overlapping between the two skysat images furthermore the difference in water depth and substrate type between the locations of the two dye plumes required a separate classification step for each of the plumes to expand the mapped extent of the dye plume that was released over the seagrass the interaction term i e the multiplication of the red blue and red green ratios with a threshold of 0 36 was used for both skysat images the pixel based object resizing algorithm was iteratively cycled until no further changes occurred i e until the dye plume did not grow any further based on the 0 36 threshold of the interaction term for the dye plume released next to the mangroves the same approach was used but with a threshold of the interaction term set to 0 69 instead in addition a threshold of 0 07 for the nir band was required to prevent the dye plume from growing into the mangroves in both skysat images the thresholds were empirically set based on an assessment of the skysat pixel values of the interaction term both sites and nir band mangrove site only of 50 selected points at each dye release site both within and outside within 50 m of the dye plume boundaries the extent of the dye plumes delineated from the coincident uav images 10 41 johansen et al 2022 after these steps unclassified objects enclosed by pixels classified as dye plume were included as part of the dye plume extents an edge smoothing step was finally implemented using the growing and shrinking modes of the pixel based object resizing algorithm johansen et al 2011 and a majority filter with a 9 9 pixel kernel to smooth extruding and fill intruding edges 2 5 mapping dye concentration from skysat image data as reported in johansen et al 2022 a best fit equation was produced based on the 30 individual dye concentration measurements and the interaction term of the red blue and red green ratios from the corresponding geo referenced and radiometrically normalized uav images collected coincidently with the water samples as the skysat satellite images were acquired at single points in time 10 41 and 13 50 and the field derived water samples for dye concentration measurements were collected over an 80 min period after dye release 09 50 and 10 07 they were not directly suited for integration because of the dynamic movement of the two dye plumes however based on the developed best fit equation dye concentration could be modeled for all uav images including those collected coincidently with the first skysat image therefore the two hovering uav photos covering the two dye plumes collected within 10 s of the first skysat image 10 41 were used for quantitative model development based on the uav derived concentrations and the skysat spectral bands fig 3 in addition to the four multispectral skysat image bands blue green red and nir the red blue and red green ratios the product of those two ratios and a normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were also incorporated ndvi was added due to the inclusion of small mangrove trees within the dye plume near the mangrove site whereas the other band ratios were based on findings by clark 2014 and johansen et al 2022 mangrove trees were included if they were surrounded by the dye plume as the water beneath their canopy formed part of the dye plume a random forest approach was selected using the uav derived dye concentration measurements as the dependent variable and the skysat derived bands and indices as predictor variables while we recognize the large selection of available machine learning and deep learning approaches the focus of this study was not to evaluate the performance of multiple approaches but rather to demonstrate the capabilities of sub daily skysat imagery for measuring water movement in coastal areas facilitated with coincident uav data random forest is a decision tree based machine learning approach that is considered to prevent overfitting and enables modeling of complex variable interactions breiman 2001 johansen et al 2020 and it was selected for this study due to its ease of interpretation and provision of consistently good prediction results in coastal environments using remote sensing e g haro et al 2022 hussein and nadaoka 2017 liu et al 2015 each classification tree uses a random sample of data that is independent of other decision trees the dye concentration measurements from the two uav photos were resampled to the 0 50 m pixel size of the skysat image data using nearest neighbor resampling to preserve the original pixel values at this pixel size a total of 8320 pixels of dye concentration excluding those pixels used for the object based threshold selection when mapping the extent of the dye plumes from within the uav based mapped extents of the two dye plumes were related to the eight skysat derived bands and indices the value of mtry number of variables randomly sampled at each split was selected based on an iterative evaluation of values ranging from 1 to 8 randomly selected predictor variables and it was found that the optimal split at each node was achieved when using a subset of four mtry 4 predictor variables one thousand decision trees ntree were applied to ensure stable predictions based on the whole dataset every training set was randomly sampled with replacement to allow multiple uses of the same observation a bootstrap sample containing 63 2 of the data was used in each decision tree for training with the remaining 36 8 of the data used as the test set for independent assessment of the prediction accuracy braga neto and dougherty 2004 ghosh et al 2014 in this case in the form of the percentage explained variance r2 and the rmse each of the fully grown decision trees was used to predict the accuracy of the bootstrap sample based on all 1000 decision trees the random forest modeling was undertaken with the r package randomforest https cran r project org web packages randomforest index html liaw and wiener 2002 the random forest model based on the coincident uav and skysat image data acquired at 10 41 was also applied to the skysat image acquired at 13 50 fig 3 although no coincident uav data were collected for evaluation at that exact time uav data were available within 4 11 min of the skysat image acquisition for comparison 2 6 evaluation of skysat based dye plume extent maps the dye plume extent in the uav photos collected at 10 41 was manually delineated and subsequently used for evaluating the mapping results of the first skysat image acquired coincidently the manually delineated dye plume extent based on the uav photos was applied as reference data to evaluate the skysat based maps and derive a measure of commission and omission errors commission error characterized the percentage extent that was incorrectly included i e false positives in the skysat based mapping results of dye plume extent whereas the omission error represented the percentage extent that was incorrectly omitted i e false negatives in the skysat mapping results the percentage of the committed dye plume extent was calculated with respect to the entire mapped extent while the percentage of the omitted dye plume extent was calculated in relation to the entire extent of the uav based manual delineation of the dye plumes 3 results 3 1 tracking dye plumes with skysat image data manual delineation of the dye plume extents in the uav photos collected coincident with the first skysat image at 10 41 was used to determine mapping accuracies the dye plume extent at the seagrass site as mapped from the skysat image had commission and omission errors of 2 77 and 8 73 respectively when assessed against the manually delineated dye plume extent when assessed against the manual delineation of the uav based dye plume extent at the mangrove site the skysat derived dye plume extent had commission and omission errors of 0 32 and 16 05 respectively fig 4 these findings emphasize that the area mapped from the skysat image accurately formed a large part of the dye plume with only minor under and over estimation identified along the perimeter of the dye plumes where the concentration levels were low it is expected that the larger pixel size of the skysat image 0 50 m relative to the uav data 0 074 m may have caused object edges to be smoothed and concentration values to be lowered per pixel precluding accurate perimeter delineation based on the skysat image acquired at 10 41 the dye plume extents were 842 m2 seagrass and 1201 m2 mangrove while the extents increased to 2694 m2 seagrass and 5784 m2 mangrove based on the skysat image acquired at 13 50 the mapped plume extents had an area of 78 43 m2 seagrass and 230 08 m2 mangrove intersecting between the two skysat image acquisitions while it is acknowledged that lower concentration perimeters of dye plumes mapped from skysat image data may not be detectable fig 4 clearly demonstrates the capability to use sub daily skysat data to trace the movement of dye plumes in coastal areas 3 2 predicting dye concentration from skysat image data the uav data collected coincidently with the skysat image at 10 41 allowed the use of a random forest machine learning approach to develop relations between the uav derived dye concentration and the skysat based spectral bands and indices of the corresponding mapped extent of the two dye plumes 8320 skysat pixels the random forest machine learning model explained 73 04 of the variance of the uav derived concentration measurements with a rmse of 28 68 ppb based on the data withheld for independent assessment of the prediction accuracy based on the percentage mean decrease accuracy incmse of the random forest prediction the interaction term and the red blue ratio were identified as the input variables with the highest importance while ndvi and the nir band had the lowest importance when omitting the nir band the random forest model explained 72 72 of the variance rmse 28 85 ppb further indicating the low importance of the nir band fig 5 shows the predicted dye concentration from the skysat image displaying a strong resemblance with the spatial distribution of concentration categories predicted from the uav data while the dye plume released over the patch of seagrass showed a continuous wind dominated movement towards the southeast the dye plume released near the mangroves was relatively stationary for the first hour fig 5 which was attributed to the westward moving tides counteracting the limited wind effects wind from west northwest reduced by the mangroves at the dye release site to further understand the ability to map dye plume extent from the skysat image data the extent was evaluated against concentration levels when excluding uav predicted dye concentration levels 5 ppb the commission error of the skysat based dye plume extent for the seagrass site increased from 2 77 to 19 64 while the omission was reduced from 8 73 to 0 99 of the remaining omitted area 0 99 99 24 belonged to the 5 25 ppb category excluding the uav based dye concentration levels 5ppb for the mangrove site before comparing the observations to the skysat based dye extent increased the commission from 0 32 to 3 07 and decreased the omission error from 16 05 to 9 05 of the skysat based dye plume extent based on the remaining extent that was omitted by the skysat imagery 95 57 belonged to the 5 25 ppb category while the last 4 43 represented other categories with higher dye concentrations these results and especially those for the seagrass site highlight that large parts of the areas with concentration levels 5 ppb were in fact mapped using the skysat imagery but the majority of those parts of the dye plume extent that were omitted from the skysat based maps were areas of low dye concentrations the dye plume extent and concentration mapped from the skysat image acquired at 13 50 could not be quantitatively compared with the orthomosaic based on the uav flight survey carried out between 13 37 13 53 as the small time gap in data acquisition was significant enough to cause differences however a visual comparison was still warranted irrespective of the small 4 8 min and 9 11 min differences in data collection time for the seagrass and mangrove originated dye plumes respectively fig 6 using the random forest model produced between the uav based dye concentration levels and skysat image bands and indices at 10 41 the dye concentration of the skysat image acquired at 13 50 could be predicted while the spatial distribution of the dye concentration levels was similar between the uav and skysat based predictions the predicted dye concentration levels appeared slightly lower in the skysat image than those from the uav based map however fig 6 shows that both dye plumes had already moved further to the east at the time of the skysat image acquisition which may have resulted in further dispersion after the uav data collection potentially contributing to the lowering of the concentration levels observed in the skysat image 4 discussion 4 1 sub daily high spatial resolution satellite imaging new satellite technologies and capabilities are rapidly advancing ustin and middleton 2021 particularly with the increasing launch frequency of cubesats houborg and mccabe 2018a while large numbers of cubesats can improve monitoring of dynamic phenomena through increased temporal resolution sandau et al 2010 there is still a gap in the provision of sub daily revisits from available high spatial resolution optical passive sensors here we demonstrated how skysat image data with a spatial resolution of 0 50 m can be successfully applied for monitoring water flow dynamics by tracing dye plumes from images collected on the same day the launches of hundreds of planetscope cubesats have enabled near daily collection of imagery at a spatial resolution of 3 4 m houborg and mccabe 2016 while near daily high resolution imagery is a major advance in earth observation capabilities for many applications such as precision agriculture johansen et al 2021 oil spill detection park et al 2019 and near real time forest change detection francini et al 2020 it does not allow suitable monitoring of time sensitive events and fast changing features e g coastal water flows natural disasters such as wildfires oil spills flood events and human activities such as construction mining and movement of people at demonstrations or other large gatherings at fine spatial resolution throughout the day with up to 6 7 daily revisits possible under the best case scenario skysat imagery fundamentally alleviates multi temporal constraints of other satellite constellations bhushan et al 2021 a repeat sun synchronous orbit is commonly used for remote sensing satellites to achieve illumination consistency and constant spatial resolution luo et al 2017 to reduce the revisit time of satellites within a constellation the satellites can be arranged into different orbital planes santilli et al 2018 for instance skysat satellites 1 15 are arranged in a sun synchronous orbit with eight of these having an equatorial crossing time at approximately 10 30 am and the other seven at around 1 pm satellites 16 21 were launched into non sun synchronous orbits providing further flexibility of acquisition timing within a single day esa 2022 off nadir viewing geometries of satellite sensors can further assist in shortening revisit times hodgson and kar 2008 differing illumination conditions exist for images collected from satellites arranged in different orbital planes which will generally require additional image pre processing to increase radiometric image consistency santilli et al 2018 further cubesat image data typically have low radiometric resolution low signal to noise ratios and between sensor radiometric inconsistencies within a satellite constellation houborg and mccabe 2018a nagel et al 2020 despite these limitations new data fusion and harmonization approaches are being developed to improve the interoperability of sensors within a constellation houborg and mccabe 2018a 2018b governments and private companies are exploring emerging capabilities of launching new cubesat constellations with similar or even shorter revisit times than the skysat constellation for instance satrevolution founded in 2016 aims to launch a constellation of 1500 high spatial resolution 0 50 m 6 u cubesats named scopesats by 2028 to achieve a 30 min revisit time nagel et al 2020 satrevolution 2021 such a constellation and associated availability of temporally dense high spatial resolution image time series will have major implications on future monitoring applications as it will facilitate new information extraction and deliver environmental insights yet to be realized 4 2 scaling between uav and satellite image data subtracting one skysat image from the other for detection of the dye plume extents significantly reduced the effects of differences in water depths and substrate types within the study area as detected changes between the two geo referenced and radiometrically corrected skysat images were mainly due to changes in the location of the dye plumes the impact of tides was considered negligible due to a tidal height difference of only 11 cm between the acquisitions of the two skysat images however the geobia approach used herein was dependent on the water depth and substrate type for setting the thresholds of band indices within the parts of the dye plumes that overlapped between the two skysat images it is likely that a more automated routine for selecting thresholds can be achieved by applying existing approaches for tide correction of water depth deriving bathymetry information and mapping geomorphic zonation and benthic cover types roelfsema et al 2020 alternatively an additional radiometrically corrected and geo referenced skysat image acquired either prior to dye release or after complete dissolution of the dye plumes may be applied to preclude overlaps between dye plumes subtracting a time adjacent skysat image with no dye plumes from a skysat image with dye plumes would remove the need for setting those image based thresholds required to map dye plume extent within the otherwise overlapping portions of the plumes herein band and ratio thresholds of the skysat imagery were set empirically with the assistance of uav derived information johansen et al 2022 acquired coincidently with the skysat imagery future work should aim at incorporating pre existing information on substrates and water depth variation into the mapping routine for automated threshold optimization or acquire skysat imagery with no dye plumes present within the focus area to increase the transferability of the developed approach our approach demonstrated the potential to track water movement in coastal areas which may benefit applications seeking to understand transportation of river runoff sediments sewage and oil spills predict movement of larvae and small aquatic animals carried by water currents hays 2017 and identify dangerous currents e g rip currents that should be avoided by swimmers and small boats hydrodynamic modeling based on acoustic doppler current profiler measurements and deployment of other instrumentation in the water column can be both costly and time consuming and lack the capacity to obtain spatially extensive measurements pinton et al 2020 the use of sub daily satellite imagery of high spatial resolution combined with suitable training data e g derived from uav data and monitoring approaches represent a novel approach for studying water movement of much larger areas than previously possible most research studies using uav data for bridging field and satellite image data do so because of the disconnect in spatial resolution alvarez vanhard et al 2021 the uav data used herein were also employed to demonstrate the capability of spatial scaling between field and satellite image data equally important was the ability to bridge the disconnect in temporal resolution between the field measurements of dye concentration and the image acquisition time as there were approximately 2 3 min in between each of the 30 collected water samples the field measurements could not be directly related to the skysat imagery due to the dye plume s dynamic movement by first developing a relationship between the 30 field measurements of dye concentration and coincident uav photos the relationship could be applied to the uav data collected coincidently with the skysat image the numerical values representing dye concentration from the uav data could then be used to calibrate a satellite based machine learning model to predict dye concentration from not just the coincident skysat image based on the blue green red nir red blue red green interaction term ndvi bands but also the image collected approximately 3 h later while borges et al 2021 classified an intertidal reef and achieved higher classification accuracies when using multispectral uav data including a nir band as opposed to blue green and red bands our random forest model for predicting dye concentration only benefitted very marginally from the inclusion of the skysat nir band our approach clearly demonstrates the major advantages of using uav data as a steppingstone for linking field and satellite image data while other studies have used this 2 step approach to first scale between field and uav data and then between uav and satellite data to increase the sampling size and account for the spatial resolution gap between field and satellite data e g thomson et al 2021 revill et al 2020 our 2 step approach also overcame the gap in the temporal resolution between the field and satellite data collection with the help of the high frequency uav data time series one disadvantage of the 2 step approach between field uav and satellite data is the potential for error propagation to minimize error propagation it is essential that the uav derived outputs of dye concentration are as accurate as possible to reduce uncertainty in the training of the skysat imagery carpenter et al 2022 as johansen et al 2022 reported a high r2 value of 0 96 between the applied uav band ratio and the field measurements of dye concentration the uav derived maps of dye concentration collected coincidently with the skysat imagery was considered to be suitable for model calibration of the machine learning approach future studies should develop an approach for assessing error propagation when integrating multiple data sets in a stepwise manner without the availability of coincident uav data it would be difficult to accurately evaluate the extent of the dye plumes from the skysat data however while the perimeter of the dye plumes with low concentrations was difficult to identify in the skysat images the majority of the plume extents was still visually identifiable fig 4 indicating the ability to derive both training and evaluation data from the skyskat images without the reliance on uav data while the coincident collection of field measured dye concentration and uav data was needed to map dye concentration from the first skysat image the mapping results in fig 6 clearly demonstrated the prospects for applying existing machine learning models to skysat image data without coincident uav data collection 5 conclusions in this research we present an approach for measuring dye plume dispersion and concentration from sub daily skysat image data facilitated by coincident uav data and field based water samples to measure dye concentration the research provided a first of its kind demonstration of how high spatio temporal skysat data can be used for tracking the movement of dye plumes in coastal waters we also showcased how high frequency uav data can be applied as an intermediary data source to bridge not only the spatial but also the temporal gap between collected field and high spatial resolution satellite image data to facilitate machine learning based model calibration for dye concentration assessment while our research has direct implications for monitoring applications of water flows and nutrient or pollution exchange in coastal waters it also demonstrates the benefits of currently available sub daily high spatial resolution satellite data future work should focus on the incorporation of bathymetry information in relation to substrate reflectance variation to automate threshold optimization and also test the inclusion of an additional time adjacent skysat image without dye plumes to increase transferability of the satellite image based mapping approach in addition further exploration and quantification of error propagation when scaling between field uav and satellite image data will facilitate identification of confidence levels of mapping accuracies as new higher temporal resolution satellite based capabilities become available combined with the flexibility enabled by user based tasking of image captures dynamic coastal features and events will become routinely traceable at sub daily intervals and over large areas with these developments there is clear potential to leverage sub daily satellite data to deliver improved monitoring and

15889,sub daily tracking of dynamic features and events using high spatial resolution satellite imagery has only recently become possible with advanced observational capabilities now available through tasking of satellite constellations here we provide a first of its kind demonstration of using sub daily 0 50 m resolution skysat imagery to track coastal water flows combining these data with object based detection and a machine learning approach to map the extent and concentration of two dye plumes coincident high frequency unmanned aerial vehicle uav imagery was also employed for quantitative modeling of dye concentration and evaluation of the sub daily satellite based dye tracking our results show that sub daily skysat imagery can track dye plume extent with low omission 8 73 16 05 and commission errors 0 32 2 77 and model dye concentration coefficient of determination 0 73 root mean square error 28 68 ppb with the assistance of high frequency uav data the results also demonstrate the capabilities of using uav imagery for scaling between field data and satellite imagery for tracking coastal water flow dynamics this research has implications for monitoring of water flows and nutrient or pollution exchange and it also demonstrates the capabilities of higher temporal resolution satellite data for delivering further insights into dynamic processes of coastal systems

dynamics is important for implementation of informed conservation strategies and management activities drainage from rivers and runoff can contribute to sedimentation nutrient inputs and pollution of coastal waters that can significantly affect aquatic ecosystems such as mangroves coral reefs seagrass habitats and marine life depending on such ecosystems for their survival carlson et al 2021 water circulation and flows between different habitats can be complex and vary in response to wind and tidal currents and are in many cases poorly understood due to the difficulty of monitoring water movement in coastal areas perera valderrama et al 2020 despite the capability to monitor water flows from in situ instrument installations such instruments are often costly to install and maintain and their use is spatially restrictive providing limited information for larger stretches of coastal areas mardani et al 2020 the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs combined with recent advances in miniaturized sensing technologies have revolutionized local area mapping and monitoring applications tmusic et al 2020 uav based data are ideally placed to track spatio temporally dynamic processes with a number of recent studies using these platforms to track fluorescent plumes in channels lakes and coastal areas e g baek et al 2019 johansen et al 2022 pinton et al 2020 powers et al 2018 larger scale and longer term monitoring of coastal waters through regular uav based dye tracer deployments can provide insights into the patterns and variability of coastal flow regimes such studies are needed to better understand the dynamic effects of tides currents and winds and their impact on the movement and dispersion of nutrients sediments and pollutants blumberg 1994 a better understanding of coastal water flows from tracking of fluorescent plumes may also facilitate more informed management intervention particularly in relation to application of aquatic herbicides fox et al 1993 treatment of harmful algal blooms park et al 2017 coral reef restoration fox et al 2019 and mangrove rehabilitation and reforestation ellison et al 2020 johansen et al 2022 used a hovering uav over a coastal area of the red sea to collect data every 10 s ensuring coincident uav and field data collection of dye plume concentration for tracing coastal water flows however even though uav based monitoring can obtain information at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than satellite image data uav based experiments cannot cover the large spatial extents achievable from satellite based imaging uav data may be integrated with satellite data for data comparison validation and multi scale explorations e g doughty et al 2021 gray et al 2018 revill et al 2020 as opposed to satellite image acquisitions the flexibility of uav sensing technologies and their capabilities to collect near continuous data over extended periods make them useful for a variety of earth observation purposes but especially for pseudo calibration of satellite data alvarez vanhard et al 2021 while a limited number of studies have used quantitative uav derived estimates to calibrate satellite based models e g for mapping seagrass cover carpenter et al 2022 there is no literature on uav based model calibration of satellite data for hydrologic monitoring applications such as coastal water flows the last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the availability of high spatial resolution space based imagery dial et al 2003 tanaka and sugimura 2001 gore et al 2017 however high spatial resolution satellite data acquisitions are typically restricted to set overpass times preventing sub daily monitoring of highly dynamic features mccabe et al 2017 while geostationary satellite sensors such as china s gaofen4 the us geostationary operational environmental satellite goes system and europe s meteosat satellites offer continuous coverage over large geographical areas they do not provide the spatial resolution needed for the identification of fine scale features wang et al 2017 in recent years we have witnessed a new epoch in earth observation where constellations of hundreds of cubesats e g planetscope provide near daily coverage for any place on earth essentially collapsing the spatio temporal divide houborg and mccabe 2016 such satellite constellations promise multiple same sensor type acquisitions at high spatial resolution within a single day allowing the monitoring of dynamic features over short time scales in the order of hours for example planet s skysat constellation consisting of 21 satellites provides taskable operation for provision of sub meter resolution data with up to 6 7 daily revisits bhushan et al 2021 esa 2022 while satellite based studies have been used to map water turbidity waste plumes and oil spills hafeez et al 2019 limited repeat coverage and spatial resolution generally preclude space based monitoring of highly dynamic features currently there is no published research demonstrating the utility of sub daily high spatial resolution skysat image data here we demonstrate the skysat image capabilities for sub daily monitoring of hydrodynamics in coastal areas supported by high spatio temporal uav based imaging the specific objectives were to 1 measure dye dispersion from sub daily skysat image data to exhibit current capabilities of high spatial resolution satellite constellations and 2 demonstrate how high frequency uav data may be employed together with field measurements for model calibration to map dye concentration from skysat image data our research represents a first of its kind example of using high spatial resolution satellite image data for sub daily tracking of dye plumes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the study area was located 80 km north of jeddah saudi arabia along the coast of the red sea fig 1 the intertidal zone is covered by mangroves leading out to shallow areas consisting of sandy substrates with coral rubble macroalgae reef and irregular patches of seagrass the water depth within the study area was generally 0 5 4 m to the south of the mangroves with the dominant substrate being sand a 200 m wide and up to 16 m deep natural channel was located on the western side of the study area twenty two ground control points were evenly distributed within the study area for geo referencing the uav data asd handheld 2 spectroradiometer measurements malvern panalytical malvern united kingdom were collected from six radiometric calibration panels that were placed within the imaged area to facilitate radiometric correction of the uav data to at surface reflectance at two locations in the water 300 ml of fluorescent rhodamine water tracing wt dye was released at 09 50 mangrove site and 10 07 seagrass site on march 18 2021 shortly after high tide 58 cm above lowest astronomical tide 09 42 the motivation for releasing the dye at high tide was to assess the influence of an ebbing tide on the offshore movement of dissolved or particulate nutrients from mangrove and seagrass habitats towards nearby coral reefs the initial concentration of the 300 ml of dye consisted of 20 rhodamine wt in water when released at the mangrove and seagrass sites the dye was mixed into the shallow approximately 1 m water column with a large paddle rhodamine wt is often used as a conservative tracer of water movement and decomposes slowly under natural uv light vasudevan et al 2001 so mass conservation of the dye was assumed over the time scale of our study water samples for dye concentration assessment were collected at 15 different locations within each of the two dye plumes i e 30 samples in total within 80 min of dye release johansen et al 2022 based on visual observations at each of the 30 locations the dye appeared to be well mixed in the shallow water possibly due to the wind and ebbing tides grab samples of surface water were collected in bottles by a researcher wading in the shallow water to minimize disturbance of the plumes areas with different dye concentrations based on visual observation were targeted during the collection of the grab samples these samples were subsequently stored in a dark cooler until laboratory analysis to determine dye concentration in parts per billion ppb for the analysis a calibration curve made by rhodamine wt standards with a range from 5 to 200 ppb was used 2 2 uav data collection processing and mapping of dye plume extent and concentration as the uav data collection processing and mapping components are described in johansen et al 2022 only a brief overview is provided here two dji mavic 2 pro quadcopters sz dji technology co ltd shenzhen china with a gimbal stabilized 20mp hasselblad l1d 20c camera victor hasselblad ab gothenburg sweden were initially used to collect photos every 10 s between 09 48 and 11 22 and from 10 06 to 11 14 for the mangrove and seagrass dye release sites respectively during in situ water sampling for dye concentration assessment while hovering at a height of 400 m subsequently nine pre planned uav flight surveys were undertaken at a height of 300 m a speed of 8 m s and with a forward overlap of 94 and a sidelap of 66 between 11 23 and 15 47 to expand the spatial coverage in response to dye plume dispersion the agisoft metashape software was used to produce geo referenced orthomosaics based on deployed ground control points with a pixel size of approximately 0 074 m as the ground control points in the water could not be accurately surveyed all orthomosaics and individual photos collected while hovering were geo referenced based on the uav based orthomosaic produced from the image data of the first flight survey 11 23 11 39 to ensure accurate spatial overlap between all uav data sets in this experiment only the relative geometric accuracy as opposed to absolute accuracy of the uav and skysat image data sets was important for data integration and comparison the digital numbers of the hovering photos and orthomosaics were converted to at surface reflectance using an empirical line correction method ahmed et al 2017 based on the radiometric calibration panels a geographic object based image analysis approach geobia blaschke 2010 johansen et al 2010 was applied to delineate the dye plume extent from the uav imagery dye concentration was mapped using a regression approach between the measured dye concentration of the 30 field derived water samples and an interaction term i e the multiplication of the red blue and red green band ratios r e d b l u e r e d g r e e n derived from hovering uav photos collected at the exact time of each water sample used to determine dye concentration see johansen et al 2022 for more detailed description 2 3 skysat data collection and processing the skysat constellation consists of 21 high spatial resolution satellites that are operated by planet labs inc esa 2022 the skysat satellites provide data covering the blue 450 515 nm green 515 595 nm red 605 695 nm near infrared nir 740 900 nm and panchromatic 450 900 nm spectral ranges skysat data used in this study were collected at 10 41 while hovering uav photos were collected every 10 s at an off nadir angle of 12 6 and at 13 50 within 10 min of uav flight survey 4 at an off nadir angle of 14 9 at the time of the skysat image collections the sun elevation and azimuth angles were 54 5 and 127 0 at 10 41 and 60 0 and 222 2 at 13 50 respectively both skysat images which were provided as orthorectified surface reflectance products at a spatial resolution of 0 50 m were geo referenced to the uav orthomosaic based on the first flight survey root mean square error rmse 0 11 m the radiometric consistency between the two skysat surface reflectance images was assessed using an empirical line method for each corresponding band of the two skysat images based on seven points of homogenous pseudo invariant features of different brightness levels karpouzli and malthus 2003 padro et al 2018 the seven features consisted of two areas of grass beach sand a dirt road deep water concrete and an artificial surface in a children s play area all four spectral band pairs of the two skysat images produced a near perfect 1 1 linear function with coefficient of determinations r2 0 99 hence no further pre processing was applied to the two skysat surface reflectance images 2 4 mapping dye plume extent from skysat image data the extent of the two dye plumes was mapped from the two skysat images using a geobia approach and the ecognition developer software trimble geospatial munich germany a geobia approach was deemed most suited for mapping the dye plumes due to the ability to assess object characteristics neighborhood relationships and contextual information johansen et al 2010 additional reasons for using a geobia approach included 1 the central parts of the plumes were simple to identify while the edges with lower dye concentration were more complicated to classify which made an object based region growing approach particularly suited 2 class related information was required to include small mangrove stands surrounded by dye and preclude the omission of small areas with wave action appearing bright instead of magenta within the plumes i e identifying small un classified objects fully enclosed by pixels classified as plumes 3 prevent non dye pixels from being classified as dye plumes based on object size and location and 4 repeatedly modify and refine the object boundary of the dye plumes based on an assessment of the blue green and red bands three indices were produced from the multispectral skysat data including the red blue and red green ratios and the product of those two ratios as areas with low dye concentration occurring in shallow areas 1 m depth with sandy substrates were difficult to discriminate from a single skysat image skysat image 2 acquired at 13 50 was subtracted from skysat image 1 acquired at 10 41 to produce change images using the individual bands as well as the derived indices using change images also ensured that influences from the substrate reflectance were canceled out i e there was no change in substrates between the two geo referenced skysat images and that changes in the dye plume extents were accentuated fig 2 a chessboard segmentation with a scale value of 1 was first used for initial pixel based classification for mapping of the dye plumes in skysat image 2 an empirical threshold of 0 20 was set for both the red blue and red green change ratios for initial detection of the pixels with high dye concentrations based on visual assessment of the dye plumes in the skysat imagery after merging neighboring pixels obeying the threshold the central part of the dye plumes could be mapped based on their object size then the central parts of the dye plumes were expanded into areas with lower dye concentrations using a pixel based object resizing algorithm johansen et al 2011 and more relaxed thresholds i e red blue change ratio 0 05 and red green change ratio 0 10 these thresholds were set empirically based on an evaluation of 50 locations using a stratified random selection of pixels mapped with dye concentrations 25 ppb in the coincident uav data collected at 10 41 johansen et al 2022 in the skysat derived ratio change maps in areas with low concentration unclassified objects enclosed by pixels classified as dye plume were incorporated as part of the dye plume with all classified pixels subsequently merged the same processing steps were used to map the dye plume extents in skysat image 1 but with the thresholds inverted for the change maps the processing workflow is presented in fig 3 while the above mentioned steps mapped the majority of the dye plume extents the change maps were not suited for mapping those parts of the dye plumes that were overlapping between the two skysat images furthermore the difference in water depth and substrate type between the locations of the two dye plumes required a separate classification step for each of the plumes to expand the mapped extent of the dye plume that was released over the seagrass the interaction term i e the multiplication of the red blue and red green ratios with a threshold of 0 36 was used for both skysat images the pixel based object resizing algorithm was iteratively cycled until no further changes occurred i e until the dye plume did not grow any further based on the 0 36 threshold of the interaction term for the dye plume released next to the mangroves the same approach was used but with a threshold of the interaction term set to 0 69 instead in addition a threshold of 0 07 for the nir band was required to prevent the dye plume from growing into the mangroves in both skysat images the thresholds were empirically set based on an assessment of the skysat pixel values of the interaction term both sites and nir band mangrove site only of 50 selected points at each dye release site both within and outside within 50 m of the dye plume boundaries the extent of the dye plumes delineated from the coincident uav images 10 41 johansen et al 2022 after these steps unclassified objects enclosed by pixels classified as dye plume were included as part of the dye plume extents an edge smoothing step was finally implemented using the growing and shrinking modes of the pixel based object resizing algorithm johansen et al 2011 and a majority filter with a 9 9 pixel kernel to smooth extruding and fill intruding edges 2 5 mapping dye concentration from skysat image data as reported in johansen et al 2022 a best fit equation was produced based on the 30 individual dye concentration measurements and the interaction term of the red blue and red green ratios from the corresponding geo referenced and radiometrically normalized uav images collected coincidently with the water samples as the skysat satellite images were acquired at single points in time 10 41 and 13 50 and the field derived water samples for dye concentration measurements were collected over an 80 min period after dye release 09 50 and 10 07 they were not directly suited for integration because of the dynamic movement of the two dye plumes however based on the developed best fit equation dye concentration could be modeled for all uav images including those collected coincidently with the first skysat image therefore the two hovering uav photos covering the two dye plumes collected within 10 s of the first skysat image 10 41 were used for quantitative model development based on the uav derived concentrations and the skysat spectral bands fig 3 in addition to the four multispectral skysat image bands blue green red and nir the red blue and red green ratios the product of those two ratios and a normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were also incorporated ndvi was added due to the inclusion of small mangrove trees within the dye plume near the mangrove site whereas the other band ratios were based on findings by clark 2014 and johansen et al 2022 mangrove trees were included if they were surrounded by the dye plume as the water beneath their canopy formed part of the dye plume a random forest approach was selected using the uav derived dye concentration measurements as the dependent variable and the skysat derived bands and indices as predictor variables while we recognize the large selection of available machine learning and deep learning approaches the focus of this study was not to evaluate the performance of multiple approaches but rather to demonstrate the capabilities of sub daily skysat imagery for measuring water movement in coastal areas facilitated with coincident uav data random forest is a decision tree based machine learning approach that is considered to prevent overfitting and enables modeling of complex variable interactions breiman 2001 johansen et al 2020 and it was selected for this study due to its ease of interpretation and provision of consistently good prediction results in coastal environments using remote sensing e g haro et al 2022 hussein and nadaoka 2017 liu et al 2015 each classification tree uses a random sample of data that is independent of other decision trees the dye concentration measurements from the two uav photos were resampled to the 0 50 m pixel size of the skysat image data using nearest neighbor resampling to preserve the original pixel values at this pixel size a total of 8320 pixels of dye concentration excluding those pixels used for the object based threshold selection when mapping the extent of the dye plumes from within the uav based mapped extents of the two dye plumes were related to the eight skysat derived bands and indices the value of mtry number of variables randomly sampled at each split was selected based on an iterative evaluation of values ranging from 1 to 8 randomly selected predictor variables and it was found that the optimal split at each node was achieved when using a subset of four mtry 4 predictor variables one thousand decision trees ntree were applied to ensure stable predictions based on the whole dataset every training set was randomly sampled with replacement to allow multiple uses of the same observation a bootstrap sample containing 63 2 of the data was used in each decision tree for training with the remaining 36 8 of the data used as the test set for independent assessment of the prediction accuracy braga neto and dougherty 2004 ghosh et al 2014 in this case in the form of the percentage explained variance r2 and the rmse each of the fully grown decision trees was used to predict the accuracy of the bootstrap sample based on all 1000 decision trees the random forest modeling was undertaken with the r package randomforest https cran r project org web packages randomforest index html liaw and wiener 2002 the random forest model based on the coincident uav and skysat image data acquired at 10 41 was also applied to the skysat image acquired at 13 50 fig 3 although no coincident uav data were collected for evaluation at that exact time uav data were available within 4 11 min of the skysat image acquisition for comparison 2 6 evaluation of skysat based dye plume extent maps the dye plume extent in the uav photos collected at 10 41 was manually delineated and subsequently used for evaluating the mapping results of the first skysat image acquired coincidently the manually delineated dye plume extent based on the uav photos was applied as reference data to evaluate the skysat based maps and derive a measure of commission and omission errors commission error characterized the percentage extent that was incorrectly included i e false positives in the skysat based mapping results of dye plume extent whereas the omission error represented the percentage extent that was incorrectly omitted i e false negatives in the skysat mapping results the percentage of the committed dye plume extent was calculated with respect to the entire mapped extent while the percentage of the omitted dye plume extent was calculated in relation to the entire extent of the uav based manual delineation of the dye plumes 3 results 3 1 tracking dye plumes with skysat image data manual delineation of the dye plume extents in the uav photos collected coincident with the first skysat image at 10 41 was used to determine mapping accuracies the dye plume extent at the seagrass site as mapped from the skysat image had commission and omission errors of 2 77 and 8 73 respectively when assessed against the manually delineated dye plume extent when assessed against the manual delineation of the uav based dye plume extent at the mangrove site the skysat derived dye plume extent had commission and omission errors of 0 32 and 16 05 respectively fig 4 these findings emphasize that the area mapped from the skysat image accurately formed a large part of the dye plume with only minor under and over estimation identified along the perimeter of the dye plumes where the concentration levels were low it is expected that the larger pixel size of the skysat image 0 50 m relative to the uav data 0 074 m may have caused object edges to be smoothed and concentration values to be lowered per pixel precluding accurate perimeter delineation based on the skysat image acquired at 10 41 the dye plume extents were 842 m2 seagrass and 1201 m2 mangrove while the extents increased to 2694 m2 seagrass and 5784 m2 mangrove based on the skysat image acquired at 13 50 the mapped plume extents had an area of 78 43 m2 seagrass and 230 08 m2 mangrove intersecting between the two skysat image acquisitions while it is acknowledged that lower concentration perimeters of dye plumes mapped from skysat image data may not be detectable fig 4 clearly demonstrates the capability to use sub daily skysat data to trace the movement of dye plumes in coastal areas 3 2 predicting dye concentration from skysat image data the uav data collected coincidently with the skysat image at 10 41 allowed the use of a random forest machine learning approach to develop relations between the uav derived dye concentration and the skysat based spectral bands and indices of the corresponding mapped extent of the two dye plumes 8320 skysat pixels the random forest machine learning model explained 73 04 of the variance of the uav derived concentration measurements with a rmse of 28 68 ppb based on the data withheld for independent assessment of the prediction accuracy based on the percentage mean decrease accuracy incmse of the random forest prediction the interaction term and the red blue ratio were identified as the input variables with the highest importance while ndvi and the nir band had the lowest importance when omitting the nir band the random forest model explained 72 72 of the variance rmse 28 85 ppb further indicating the low importance of the nir band fig 5 shows the predicted dye concentration from the skysat image displaying a strong resemblance with the spatial distribution of concentration categories predicted from the uav data while the dye plume released over the patch of seagrass showed a continuous wind dominated movement towards the southeast the dye plume released near the mangroves was relatively stationary for the first hour fig 5 which was attributed to the westward moving tides counteracting the limited wind effects wind from west northwest reduced by the mangroves at the dye release site to further understand the ability to map dye plume extent from the skysat image data the extent was evaluated against concentration levels when excluding uav predicted dye concentration levels 5 ppb the commission error of the skysat based dye plume extent for the seagrass site increased from 2 77 to 19 64 while the omission was reduced from 8 73 to 0 99 of the remaining omitted area 0 99 99 24 belonged to the 5 25 ppb category excluding the uav based dye concentration levels 5ppb for the mangrove site before comparing the observations to the skysat based dye extent increased the commission from 0 32 to 3 07 and decreased the omission error from 16 05 to 9 05 of the skysat based dye plume extent based on the remaining extent that was omitted by the skysat imagery 95 57 belonged to the 5 25 ppb category while the last 4 43 represented other categories with higher dye concentrations these results and especially those for the seagrass site highlight that large parts of the areas with concentration levels 5 ppb were in fact mapped using the skysat imagery but the majority of those parts of the dye plume extent that were omitted from the skysat based maps were areas of low dye concentrations the dye plume extent and concentration mapped from the skysat image acquired at 13 50 could not be quantitatively compared with the orthomosaic based on the uav flight survey carried out between 13 37 13 53 as the small time gap in data acquisition was significant enough to cause differences however a visual comparison was still warranted irrespective of the small 4 8 min and 9 11 min differences in data collection time for the seagrass and mangrove originated dye plumes respectively fig 6 using the random forest model produced between the uav based dye concentration levels and skysat image bands and indices at 10 41 the dye concentration of the skysat image acquired at 13 50 could be predicted while the spatial distribution of the dye concentration levels was similar between the uav and skysat based predictions the predicted dye concentration levels appeared slightly lower in the skysat image than those from the uav based map however fig 6 shows that both dye plumes had already moved further to the east at the time of the skysat image acquisition which may have resulted in further dispersion after the uav data collection potentially contributing to the lowering of the concentration levels observed in the skysat image 4 discussion 4 1 sub daily high spatial resolution satellite imaging new satellite technologies and capabilities are rapidly advancing ustin and middleton 2021 particularly with the increasing launch frequency of cubesats houborg and mccabe 2018a while large numbers of cubesats can improve monitoring of dynamic phenomena through increased temporal resolution sandau et al 2010 there is still a gap in the provision of sub daily revisits from available high spatial resolution optical passive sensors here we demonstrated how skysat image data with a spatial resolution of 0 50 m can be successfully applied for monitoring water flow dynamics by tracing dye plumes from images collected on the same day the launches of hundreds of planetscope cubesats have enabled near daily collection of imagery at a spatial resolution of 3 4 m houborg and mccabe 2016 while near daily high resolution imagery is a major advance in earth observation capabilities for many applications such as precision agriculture johansen et al 2021 oil spill detection park et al 2019 and near real time forest change detection francini et al 2020 it does not allow suitable monitoring of time sensitive events and fast changing features e g coastal water flows natural disasters such as wildfires oil spills flood events and human activities such as construction mining and movement of people at demonstrations or other large gatherings at fine spatial resolution throughout the day with up to 6 7 daily revisits possible under the best case scenario skysat imagery fundamentally alleviates multi temporal constraints of other satellite constellations bhushan et al 2021 a repeat sun synchronous orbit is commonly used for remote sensing satellites to achieve illumination consistency and constant spatial resolution luo et al 2017 to reduce the revisit time of satellites within a constellation the satellites can be arranged into different orbital planes santilli et al 2018 for instance skysat satellites 1 15 are arranged in a sun synchronous orbit with eight of these having an equatorial crossing time at approximately 10 30 am and the other seven at around 1 pm satellites 16 21 were launched into non sun synchronous orbits providing further flexibility of acquisition timing within a single day esa 2022 off nadir viewing geometries of satellite sensors can further assist in shortening revisit times hodgson and kar 2008 differing illumination conditions exist for images collected from satellites arranged in different orbital planes which will generally require additional image pre processing to increase radiometric image consistency santilli et al 2018 further cubesat image data typically have low radiometric resolution low signal to noise ratios and between sensor radiometric inconsistencies within a satellite constellation houborg and mccabe 2018a nagel et al 2020 despite these limitations new data fusion and harmonization approaches are being developed to improve the interoperability of sensors within a constellation houborg and mccabe 2018a 2018b governments and private companies are exploring emerging capabilities of launching new cubesat constellations with similar or even shorter revisit times than the skysat constellation for instance satrevolution founded in 2016 aims to launch a constellation of 1500 high spatial resolution 0 50 m 6 u cubesats named scopesats by 2028 to achieve a 30 min revisit time nagel et al 2020 satrevolution 2021 such a constellation and associated availability of temporally dense high spatial resolution image time series will have major implications on future monitoring applications as it will facilitate new information extraction and deliver environmental insights yet to be realized 4 2 scaling between uav and satellite image data subtracting one skysat image from the other for detection of the dye plume extents significantly reduced the effects of differences in water depths and substrate types within the study area as detected changes between the two geo referenced and radiometrically corrected skysat images were mainly due to changes in the location of the dye plumes the impact of tides was considered negligible due to a tidal height difference of only 11 cm between the acquisitions of the two skysat images however the geobia approach used herein was dependent on the water depth and substrate type for setting the thresholds of band indices within the parts of the dye plumes that overlapped between the two skysat images it is likely that a more automated routine for selecting thresholds can be achieved by applying existing approaches for tide correction of water depth deriving bathymetry information and mapping geomorphic zonation and benthic cover types roelfsema et al 2020 alternatively an additional radiometrically corrected and geo referenced skysat image acquired either prior to dye release or after complete dissolution of the dye plumes may be applied to preclude overlaps between dye plumes subtracting a time adjacent skysat image with no dye plumes from a skysat image with dye plumes would remove the need for setting those image based thresholds required to map dye plume extent within the otherwise overlapping portions of the plumes herein band and ratio thresholds of the skysat imagery were set empirically with the assistance of uav derived information johansen et al 2022 acquired coincidently with the skysat imagery future work should aim at incorporating pre existing information on substrates and water depth variation into the mapping routine for automated threshold optimization or acquire skysat imagery with no dye plumes present within the focus area to increase the transferability of the developed approach our approach demonstrated the potential to track water movement in coastal areas which may benefit applications seeking to understand transportation of river runoff sediments sewage and oil spills predict movement of larvae and small aquatic animals carried by water currents hays 2017 and identify dangerous currents e g rip currents that should be avoided by swimmers and small boats hydrodynamic modeling based on acoustic doppler current profiler measurements and deployment of other instrumentation in the water column can be both costly and time consuming and lack the capacity to obtain spatially extensive measurements pinton et al 2020 the use of sub daily satellite imagery of high spatial resolution combined with suitable training data e g derived from uav data and monitoring approaches represent a novel approach for studying water movement of much larger areas than previously possible most research studies using uav data for bridging field and satellite image data do so because of the disconnect in spatial resolution alvarez vanhard et al 2021 the uav data used herein were also employed to demonstrate the capability of spatial scaling between field and satellite image data equally important was the ability to bridge the disconnect in temporal resolution between the field measurements of dye concentration and the image acquisition time as there were approximately 2 3 min in between each of the 30 collected water samples the field measurements could not be directly related to the skysat imagery due to the dye plume s dynamic movement by first developing a relationship between the 30 field measurements of dye concentration and coincident uav photos the relationship could be applied to the uav data collected coincidently with the skysat image the numerical values representing dye concentration from the uav data could then be used to calibrate a satellite based machine learning model to predict dye concentration from not just the coincident skysat image based on the blue green red nir red blue red green interaction term ndvi bands but also the image collected approximately 3 h later while borges et al 2021 classified an intertidal reef and achieved higher classification accuracies when using multispectral uav data including a nir band as opposed to blue green and red bands our random forest model for predicting dye concentration only benefitted very marginally from the inclusion of the skysat nir band our approach clearly demonstrates the major advantages of using uav data as a steppingstone for linking field and satellite image data while other studies have used this 2 step approach to first scale between field and uav data and then between uav and satellite data to increase the sampling size and account for the spatial resolution gap between field and satellite data e g thomson et al 2021 revill et al 2020 our 2 step approach also overcame the gap in the temporal resolution between the field and satellite data collection with the help of the high frequency uav data time series one disadvantage of the 2 step approach between field uav and satellite data is the potential for error propagation to minimize error propagation it is essential that the uav derived outputs of dye concentration are as accurate as possible to reduce uncertainty in the training of the skysat imagery carpenter et al 2022 as johansen et al 2022 reported a high r2 value of 0 96 between the applied uav band ratio and the field measurements of dye concentration the uav derived maps of dye concentration collected coincidently with the skysat imagery was considered to be suitable for model calibration of the machine learning approach future studies should develop an approach for assessing error propagation when integrating multiple data sets in a stepwise manner without the availability of coincident uav data it would be difficult to accurately evaluate the extent of the dye plumes from the skysat data however while the perimeter of the dye plumes with low concentrations was difficult to identify in the skysat images the majority of the plume extents was still visually identifiable fig 4 indicating the ability to derive both training and evaluation data from the skyskat images without the reliance on uav data while the coincident collection of field measured dye concentration and uav data was needed to map dye concentration from the first skysat image the mapping results in fig 6 clearly demonstrated the prospects for applying existing machine learning models to skysat image data without coincident uav data collection 5 conclusions in this research we present an approach for measuring dye plume dispersion and concentration from sub daily skysat image data facilitated by coincident uav data and field based water samples to measure dye concentration the research provided a first of its kind demonstration of how high spatio temporal skysat data can be used for tracking the movement of dye plumes in coastal waters we also showcased how high frequency uav data can be applied as an intermediary data source to bridge not only the spatial but also the temporal gap between collected field and high spatial resolution satellite image data to facilitate machine learning based model calibration for dye concentration assessment while our research has direct implications for monitoring applications of water flows and nutrient or pollution exchange in coastal waters it also demonstrates the benefits of currently available sub daily high spatial resolution satellite data future work should focus on the incorporation of bathymetry information in relation to substrate reflectance variation to automate threshold optimization and also test the inclusion of an additional time adjacent skysat image without dye plumes to increase transferability of the satellite image based mapping approach in addition further exploration and quantification of error propagation when scaling between field uav and satellite image data will facilitate identification of confidence levels of mapping accuracies as new higher temporal resolution satellite based capabilities become available combined with the flexibility enabled by user based tasking of image captures dynamic coastal features and events will become routinely traceable at sub daily intervals and over large areas with these developments there is clear potential to leverage sub daily satellite data to deliver improved monitoring and characterization of coastal system processes and drive further insights into dynamic patterns and behaviors in coastal waters credit authorship contribution statement kasper johansen conceptualization
