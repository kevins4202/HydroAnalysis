23395,scour induces the loss of soil support around the pile foundations for the offshore and coastal structures and thus increases their bending moments and lateral deflections which may change the vertical loads effect on the lateral response of piles applied in such cases in this paper the stress changes of the remaining soils at the corresponding pile location due to the three dimensional scour hole formation are first determined based on the mindlin s elastic solutions then the calculated new soil stresses are adopted to re examine the young s modulus of the remaining soils undergoing a stress history due to scour with this key soil parameter that have been modified appropriately to reasonably reflect the effects of three dimensional scour hole geometry and the stress history of the soils simultaneously an analytical model based on the principle of minimum potential energy is further developed to investigate the influence of vertical loads on the lateral responses of offshore piles in marine clay under scour conditions the influence of related parameters including the lateral displacement level and the vertical load level with different scour hole dimensions i e scour depth scour width and scour hole slope angle considering or ignoring stress history effect have also been analyzed based on a case study the results show that scour depth plays the most important role among the various scour hole dimensions in influencing the responses of scoured piles under combined vertical and lateral loading although still possessing some limitations e g the simplistic assumption of linear elastic behavior for the soil and the approximate allowance made to account for the gapping effect the simplicity and relative ease of utilization offered by this proposed analytical model make it a good alternative approach for estimating the deflection and moment responses of the scoured pile foundations subjected to combined lateral and vertical loading keywords vertical load lateral response offshore piles scour hole geometry stress history 1 introduction pile foundations supporting the offshore and coastal structures are not only subjected to vertical loads from the superstructures but also lateral loads due to wind or wave actions in such cases the effect of vertical loads on the pile s lateral responses i e bending moments and lateral deflections is to be expected in addition scouring of soil around pile foundations of offshore structures can significantly increase their bending moments and lateral deflections and sometimes pose a risk to structural stability briaud et al 1999 richardson and davis 2001 wardhana and hadipriono 2003 which may change the influence of vertical loads on the lateral responses of pile foundations yet the literature available on this topic is scanty and the results available in the limited literature are somewhat inconsistent with respect to the effect of vertical loads on the lateral responses of piles hussien et al 2014 for the pile embedded in sand some experimental jain et al 1987 lee et al 2011 2013 and analytical goryunov 1973 levy et al 2005 studies indicated that the presence of a vertical load increases the lateral deflection while other experimental pise 1975 karasev et al 1977 zhang et al 2002 and numerical karthigeyan et al 2006 achmus and thieken 2010a 2010b achmus et al 2009 investigations suggested a decrease in lateral deflection with the combination of vertical loads similarly model anagnostopoulos and georgiadis 1993 and field zhukov and balov 1978 sorochan and bykov 1976 tests as well as theoretical studies liang et al 2012 karthigeyan et al 2007 madhav and sarma 1982 reached opposite conclusions for the pile embedded in clay the contradiction regarding the effect of vertical loads on the lateral responses of piles found in the experimental results was considered to stem from the restraint condition of the pile head during loading lee et al 2011 2013 and other possible reasons for this contradiction such as the soil properties i e for the pile embedded in sand the confining stress increases with vertical loads while the interface between the pile and the surrounding clayey soils fails early in the presence of vertical loads and the lateral load level i e for higher load levels and thus larger lateral displacements the importance of the favorable influence of the vertical load on the pile s lateral response decreases due to geometrical non linearity were given by karthigeyan et al 2007 achmus and thieken 2010b and liang et al 2015a in theoretical studies moreover when studying the vertical loads effect on the lateral responses of pile foundations under scour conditions another significant difficulty is that scour holes formed around the piles usually involve certain shapes and sizes and meanwhile the remaining soils have undergone an unloading process associated with new stress states the latter of unloading produces the changes of stress history of the remaining soils and hence their resistances provided to the pile foundations as well although limited number of studies have been conducted to investigate the behavior of laterally loaded piles under scour conditions daniels et al 2007 bennett et al 2009 lin et al 2010b 2014a 2014b 2016 li et al 2013 however most of them have been largely limited to ignoring either the effect of scour hole geometry or that of the stress history characterized by the over consolidation ratio ocr the objective of this paper is to present a simplified analysis procedure to investigate the influence of vertical load on the lateral responses of offshore piles considering scour hole geometry and stress history of marine clay the major contribution to this procedure included 1 the application of a variational approach proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a for the analysis of vertical loads effect on the lateral response of fully embedded piles to further consider the exposure of the pile due to scour in which the combined effect of the lateral reaction pressure the vertical shear stress along the pile shaft and the normal stress at the pile base are accounted for and 2 the modification of the key soil parameter given in the proposed model i e the young s modulus of marine clay to account properly for the effects of the three dimensional scour hole geometry as well as of the stress history of the soils whose procedures are similar to those presented by the authors in zhang et al 2017 with the simplified procedure a case study is subsequently used to analyze the scour affected behavior of laterally loaded piles in marine clay with the combination of vertical load 2 analysis procedure a pile having length l and diameter d subjected to lateral load h t bending moment m t and vertical load p t at the head simultaneously is assumed to be embedded in a normally consolidated homogenous marine clay before the scour event as shown in fig 1 in this figure a typical scour hole with the dimensions defined by the scour depth s d width s w and slope angle α which has been successfully used by zhang et al 2017 for a laterally loaded single pile under scour condition is assumed to be formed around the pile for the demonstration purposes and the center of the scour hole at the ground surface is set to be the origin of the axisymmetrical cylindrical coordinate system r θ z the effect of vertical load on the lateral response of pile foundation under scour conditions which has not been studied before is analyzed by means of the analytical model proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a further in the analysis procedure to satisfy the scour conditions including scour hole dimensions and stress history effect the embedded length of the pile is altered and the key soil parameter of the analytical model and other corresponding soil properties are modified appropriately based on the framework developed by the authors in zhang et al 2017 the main analysis procedures are outlined briefly for completeness in the following 2 1 description of the analytical model proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a the analytical model summarized herein was proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a for the analysis of vertical loads effect on the lateral response of offshore pile without any scour s d 0 for a single pile subjected to both the lateral and vertical loads the total potential energy π p can be written as 1 π p u p 1 2 s τ z w z d s 1 2 l p z ρ z d d z 1 2 a σ b w b d a p t w t h t ρ t ρ t z m t in eq 1 the first term u p equals elastic strain energy of the pile see liang et al 2015a the second and third terms are respectively the work done by the vertical shear stress τ z and the lateral reaction pressures p z along the pile shaft where w z and ρ z are respectively the vertical and the lateral displacements of the pile at depth z and s is the surface area of the pile the fourth term is the work done by the normal stresses σ b at the pile base where w b is the vertical displacement at the pile base and a denotes the cross sectional area of the pile the last three terms are the works done by the vertical load p t by the lateral load h t and by the applied moment m t at the pile head where w t and ρ t are respectively the vertical and lateral displacements of the pile at the pile head by using gauss integration and assuming uniform σ b and w b at the pile base eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 π p u p 1 2 ρ w t k s ρ w p t w t h t ρ t ρ t z m t where ρ w is the vector that include the lateral displacements ρ qi and the vertical displacements w gi of the pile at the gauss points as well as the vertical displacement w b at the pile base here ng and nq are the number of gauss points chosen for the pile along its shaft k s denotes the soil stiffness matrix which is described in a subsequent section the lateral and the vertical displacements of the pile which can be represented by finite series as given by liang et al 2015a can be written as 3 ρ z z h m t β h m w z z v t β v where z h m and z v are the vectors related to only the depth coordinate z β h m and β v containing undermined constants thus with the application of the principle of minimum potential energy eq 2 can be reduced as 4 u p δ j ρ w δ j t k s ρ w w t δ j t p t ρ t δ j t h t ρ t z δ j t m t where δ j are the coefficients in the vectors β h m and β v the soil load deformation relationship i e the soil stiffness matrix k s described in eq 2 can be determined based on the point load solution by mindlin 1936 specifically the lateral reaction pressures and the vertical shear stresses at depth z are first approximated by the following two finite series see liang et al 2015a 5 p z z p t α p τ z z τ t α τ where z p and z τ are the vectors related to only the depth coordinate z α p and α τ containing undermined constants then the vector ρ w in eq 2 which represent the displacement of the pile can be rewritten as 6 ρ w f α where α containing the coefficients in the vectors α p and α τ as well as the normal stresses σ b at the pile base and f can be expressed as 7 f f ρ l f ρ v f w l f w v the coefficients in the sub matrix f ρ l f ρ v f w l and f w v are given in appendix a and the soil stiffness matrix k s is therefore obtained 8 k s t f 1 in which 9 t t l t v and the coefficients in sub matrix t l and t v are given by eq b8 b9 in appendix b after some mathematic manipulations eq 4 can be rewritten as 10 k β p l a where β containing the undermined constants in the vectors β h m and β v k is the pile soil stiffness matrix which is given in appendix b and p l a is the vector reflecting the lateral load bending moment and the vertical load acting at the pile head for a pile with a free head boundary condition the vector β in eq 10 can be solved under known lateral load bending moment and vertical load at the pile head accordingly the lateral displacements ρ z rotations θ z and bending moments m z of the pile at any depth can be obtained furthermore an iterative procedure is required to consider the additional bending moment in the pile due to the moment arm of the vertical load i e geometrical non linearity achmus and thieken 2010a 2010b liang et al 2012 in this procedure the initial rotation θ 0 at the pile head can be obtained using the above calculations at first then the updated lateral load h t and vertical load p t at the pile head can be determined by 11 h t h t cos θ 0 p t sin θ 0 p t p t cos θ 0 h t sin θ 0 the updated values of h t and p t will be used in eq 10 to solve new rotation θ 0 at the pile head this iterative procedure will be repeated until the difference of the rotation at the pile head obtained between two successive iterations is within 5 2 2 key soil parameter of the analytical model the analytical model described in the previous section indicates that its key soil parameter is limited to the young s modulus of the soil e s as a constant poisson s ratio of 0 3 is often considered for the analysis of pile foundations in marine clay kim et al 2009 2011 jeong et al 2011 more specifically the young s modulus of the shallow soil layer is of great interest for this study because laterally loaded piles typically receive most of their support from the soil in the upper 7 10 pile diameters briaud 1997 kim and jeong 2011 kim et al 2011 therefore the young s modulus of the soil at the depth of 2 pile diameter below the mudline before after scour is used in this study for the demonstration purposes which can be further determined based on the empirical correlations with other soil properties for example from a number of published load deflection measurements on full scale piles poulos 1971 back figured the secant values of e s at working load levels on the assumption that e s is constant with depth and recommended the values of e s ranged between 15c u and 95c u for clays where c u is the undrained shear strength of clay banerjee and davies 1978 back figured values of e s ranged between 100c u and 180c u for cohesive soils the scatter of the back figured results reflects the effects of local yielding since more local yield may have occurred in the softer soils at working loads than in stiffer clays in other words the lower values tend to be associated with very soft clays and the higher values with stiff clays moreover poulos 1995 chen and poulos 1997 and comodromos and papadopoulou 2012 recommended that the tangent values of e s of 150c u to 400c u could also be used for laterally loaded piles in clay and the effect of pile soil separation under elastic conditions may be considered as approximately equivalent to reducing the soil modulus by a factor of about 2 for practical purposes poulos and davis 1980 altogether the young s modulus e s of 120c u which has been successfully used by li et al 2013 to investigate the scour effect on the behavior of laterally loaded piles in marine clay is adopted in this study for the scour affected piles embedded in marine clay to address the effect of scour on the key soil parameter e s of the analytical model the soil properties including the undrained shear strength of clay after scour should be examined based on the framework developed by the authors in zhang et al 2017 2 3 modified key soil parameter considering scour effect zhang et al 2017 consider the scour hole geometry and its symmetry as shown in fig 1 the circular uniform loads p v b o t t o m which can be calculated by γ s d γ is the effective unit weight of soil before scour act vertically on the scour hole bottom before the scour is underway simultaneously based on mohr s stress circle the triangle distributed loads p n s i d e w a l l and p p s i d e w a l l that act normal and parallel to the surrounding sidewalls of the scour hole respectively can be expressed as 12 p n s i d e w a l l 1 k 0 2 γ z p 1 k 0 2 γ z p cos 2 α p p s i d e w a l l 1 k 0 2 γ z p sin 2 α in eq 12 z p is the depth coordinate of loading action point ranging from 0 to s d and k 0 refers to the earth pressure coefficient at rest in the absence of test data the empirical formula mayne and kulhawy 1982 can be used as shown in eq 13 13 k 0 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ where φ is the effective internal friction angle of soil ocr denotes the over consolidation ratio and particularly for the normally consolidated homogenous clay before scour the earth pressure coefficient at rest is given by 14 k 0 1 sin ϕ when the scour hole is formed equivalent values of p v b o t t o m p n s i d e w a l l and p p s i d e w a l l which have been changed into opposite direction are applied to the bottom and surrounding sidewalls to simulate the scour induced unloading effects then mindlin 1936 green s function for vertical and lateral loads in a semi infinite half space can be thus used to calculate the scour induced soil unloading stress to facilitate the use of the green s function the triangle distributed loads p n s i d e w a l l and p p s i d e w a l l need to be rewritten as the corresponding triangle distributed vertical loads p v s i d e w a l l and lateral loads p h s i d e w a l l in eq 15 which are also acted reversely on the surrounding sidewalls of the scour hole to simulate the unloading effects 15 p v s i d e w a l l p n s i d e w a l l cos α p p s i d e w a l l sin α p h s i d e w a l l p n s i d e w a l l sin α p p s i d e w a l l cos α accordingly considering the loads are symmetrical about the z axis pile axis the scour induced soil unloading stress σ z u l at the point of pile axis 0 0 z can be obtained by considering the unloading effects for the bottom and sidewall of scour hole 16 σ z u l σ z b o t t o m σ z s i d e w a l l v σ z s i d e w a l l h where σ z b o t t o m σ z s i d e w a l l v and σ z s i d e w a l l h are the vertical unloading stress at the point of pile axis 0 0 z due to the unit vertical loading p v b o t t o m r d r d θ acting at the point r θ s d of scour hole bottom that due to the unit vertical loading p v s i d e w a l l r 1 d r d z p 2 d z p d θ acting at the point r θ z p of scour hole sidewall and that due to the unit lateral loading p h s i d e w a l l r 1 d r d z p 2 d z p d θ acting at the point r θ z p of scour hole sidewall respectively which are given in appendix c after scour according to the first step analysis the present stress σ z s c of the remaining soil at the point of pile axis 0 0 z which can consider the effect of three dimensional scour hole geometry is thus given by 17 σ z s c σ z int σ z u l where σ z int is the soil stress at the point of pile axis 0 0 z before scour which can be calculated by γ z in the second step to further consider the stress history effect soil properties including the undrained shear strength after scour should be re examined by using the present stress σ z s c of the remaining soil calculated by eq 17 the procedures are described as below before scour the major effective stress σ 1 and the minor effective stress σ 3 at the point of pile axis 0 0 z are respectively shown in 18 σ 1 σ z int γ z σ 3 k 0 σ z int k 0 γ z where k 0 refers to the earth pressure coefficient at rest before scour which is previously given by eq 14 thus the mean effective stress is determined 19 p int σ 1 2 σ 3 3 γ z 3 2 sin ϕ 3 after scour the major effective stress σ 1 and the minor effective stress σ 3 at the point of pile axis 0 0 z are respectively computed 20 σ 1 σ z s c σ z int σ z u l σ 3 k 0 σ z s c k 0 σ z int σ z u l where k 0 is the earth pressure coefficient at rest after scour which can be determined by using eq 13 accordingly the mean effective stress is calculated as shown 21 p s c σ 1 2 σ 3 3 σ z s c 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ 3 where the over consolidation ratio ocr is defined as 22 ocr σ z int σ z s c γ z σ z s c by using eqs 19 21 and 22 the specific volume after scour v sc can be expressed by eq 23 based on the compression and swelling curve 23 v s c v int κ ln p int p s c v int κ ln γ z 3 2 sin ϕ σ z s c 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ where κ is the swelling index from isotropic consolidation tests and v int is the specific volume before scour which can be determined by using eq 24 if the soil is saturated 24 v int γ w γ w w γ w γ w where γ w is the unit weight of water and w refers to the soil moisture content then the soil effective unit weight after scour can be obtained by 25 γ s c v int γ v s c v int γ v int κ ln 3 2 sin ϕ ocr 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ in addition as the normally consolidated soil after scour becomes over consolidated and the earth pressure coefficient at rest increases during the unloading process see eq 13 the relationship of the undrained shear strengths before and after scour can be established in terms of the mean effective stress by using eqs 26a and 26b which were derived based on the modified cam clay model muir wood 1990 26a c u s c p s c c u int p int c u p o c c u p n c p

consolidation tests c c and c ur are compression and swelling indexes obtained from the oedometer tests respectively hence by combining eqs 19 21 22 and 26 the undrained shear strength after scour can be finally determined by eq 27 27 c u s c c u int 3 2 sin ϕ ocr 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ λ 1 by substituting eq 27 into the empirical correlations i e e s 120c u li et al 2013 the young s modulus of the marine clay after scour e s s c can be rewritten as 28 e s s c 120 c u int 3 2 sin ϕ ocr 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ λ 1 where ocr can be obtained by solving eqs 17 and 22 2 4 lateral response of scoured piles subjected to both vertical and lateral loads once the soil parameters before scour e g effective unit weight γ poisson s ratio ν soil effective internal friction angle φ moisture content w and undrained shear strength c u and the scour dimensions e g scour depth s d scour width s w and scour hole slope angle α are known the key soil parameter of the analytical model i e young s modulus e s of the soil and other corresponding soil properties e g effective unit weight over consolidation ratio and undrained shear strength can be modified by applying eqs 22 24 25 27 and 28 to consider the effect of scour hole geometry and soil stress history simultaneously then the modified young s modulus e s s c of the remaining soil after scour is further exported into the analytical model in which the embedded length of the pile is changed from l to l s d to determine the lateral response of scour affected piles subjected to both vertical and lateral loads 3 case study a thorough review of the literature available in this field indicated that there is no literature pertaining to numerical investigations or experimental tests on scour affected pile foundation subjected to both lateral and vertical loads nevertheless the above solution procedure has been coded into matlab and preliminarily validated by comparing the results with those of field load tests and laboratory load tests under the pre scour conditions liang et al 2015a the accuracy of the model makes it a powerful tool to analyze the influence of vertical load on the lateral response of scoured piles in marine clay then floating cylindrical piles with two flexibility factors k r e p i p e s l 4 10 4 10 3 and different slenderness ratios l d 15 20 25 which are fully embedded in a homogeneous soil deposit having the same properties as that of the upper marine clay at the incheon bridge site in south korea kim et al 2009 2011 are selected as an initial condition before scour for the case study here lateral loads h con where h con are the lateral loads developed at various lateral displacement levels lower than 0 12d bending moments m con h con d and vertical loads 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult where p ult is the ultimate vertical load capacity evaluated a priori by a separate analysis based on a general expression for the ultimate load capacity of a single pile in clay poulos and davis 1980 are applied at the pile head simultaneously and thus their synergistic effects on the lateral responses of the scour affected pile are subsequently investigated by analyzing the key influence factors including the lateral displacement level and the vertical load level for different scour hole dimensions various scour depth scour width and scour hole slope angle considering or ignoring stress history effect note that the number of gauss points used in eq 2 and that of terms used in eqs 3 and 5 are the same with that given by liang et al 2015a the details of this case study are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 site conditions the properties of the upper marine clay at the incheon bridge site in south korea reported by kim et al 2009 2011 are used in this analysis as described earlier see table 1 some of these properties are estimated based on empirical relationships for demonstration purposes they can be more accurately determined by laboratory or in situ tests the compression index c c is estimated based on the moisture content azzouz et al 1976 and the swelling index c ur is taken as 1 5 c c kulhawy and mayne 1990 note that usually λ and κ are assumed approximately equal to c c 2 3 and c ur 2 3 respectively as no value for the effective friction angle was provided from the field test performed by kim et al 2009 a typical friction angle ϕ 20 of marine clay is assumed for this case study the soil specific volume before scour is estimated to be 1 81 in eq 24 the water table is kept above the ground surface a pile having the diameter of 1 m was driven and the lateral load bending moment as well as the vertical load was assumed to be applied at the pile head 3 2 vertical load effect on the lateral response of the pile before scour in this section the lateral load displacement curves of a laterally loaded pile without vertical load p t 0 and one with vertical load p t 0 9p ult are compared for the pre scour condition in fig 2 it can be seen that piles with a small length to diameter ratio and flexible behavior small k r value show particularly strong interaction effects specifically the lateral load capacity is slightly increased by the presence of the vertical load when the lateral displacement level is not high which may be caused by the interactions among the lateral reaction pressures the vertical shear stress and the normal stress based on linearly elastic model for the soil liang et al 2015a with the increase of the lateral displacement level the increasing effect induced by the vertical force is diminishing which can be explained by the geometrical non linearity achmus and thieken 2010b as described in section 2 1 beyond a certain point the lateral capacity starts to decrease significantly with the vertical load and the similar result was also obtained by karthigeyan et al 2007 for piles in clay under combined vertical and lateral loading therefore we can define this point as the critical lateral displacement d cr below which the presence of the vertical load increases the lateral load capacity of the pile and beyond which the presence of the vertical load decreases the lateral capacity of the pile accordingly the variation in lateral deflection along the pile depth and the bending moments developed in the pile section at low lateral displacement level the lateral load developed at a deflection that below the critical value under pure lateral loading e g 0 5d cr and high lateral displacement level the lateral load developed at a deflection that beyond the critical value under pure lateral loading e g 3d cr are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 respectively for the pile subjected to lateral force and vertical load simultaneously two different ratios of p t p ult 0 and 0 9 are considered in these figures the pile flexibility factor k r and the pile slenderness ratio l d are chosen as 10 4 and 15 respectively for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects the effect of the vertical load on the lateral responses of the pile can be seen clearly from figs 3 and 4 specifically fig 3 shows a decrease of the lateral displacement and the bending moment of the pile with the vertical load however an opposite trend is observed in fig 4 i e both the lateral displacement and the bending moment of the pile particularly within its upper part increase with the vertical load 3 3 modified properties of the remaining soil after scour based on the procedures discussed earlier the properties of the remaining clay after scour i e the modified young s modulus of the soil li et al 2013 and other corresponding soil properties at the depth of 2 pile diameter below the present mudline are determined with different scour hole dimensions as presented in tables 2 4 the results show that the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil after scour decrease significantly when compared with those before scour while a minor decrease in the effective unit weight are observed more specifically table 2 illustrates a decrease of the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil and an increase of the ocr with an increasing of the scour depth furthermore table 3 indicates that the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil decrease as the scour width increases from zero considering the scour hole dimensions to infinite ignoring the scour hole dimensions while the ocr increases with increasing scour width finally it is found from table 4 that with the increase of the scour hole slope angle the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil gradually increase while the ocr decreases with increasing scour hole slope angle it is worth noting that the remaining soils undergo an unloading process due to scour and thus high ocr can be obtained near the soil surface to avoid a passive earth failure however a limited ocr of 27 can be determined for this study ϕ 20 by using eq 29 mayne and kulhawy 1982 which is based on the k o ocr relationship in soils 29 ocr limit 1 sin ϕ 1 sin ϕ 2 1 sin ϕ therefore the ocrlimit in eq 29 aids in determination of soil depth below which the young s modulus of the marine clay derived from eq 28 is valid 3 4 influence of the lateral displacement level under scour condition to examine the influence of the lateral displacement level on the synergistic effects of a lateral force including bending moment and a vertical load on the lateral responses of the scoured pile the critical lateral displacements at various scour depth see table 2 and the loading ratio of p t p ult 0 9 are calculated considering or ignoring the stress history effect in fig 5 also the pile flexibility factor k r of 10 4 and the pile slenderness ratio l d of 15 are selected in this figure for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects it is found that the critical lateral displacement is at a low level and decreases significantly as scour depth increases under the scour condition considering the stress history effect results in a little higher critical lateral displacements when compared with the case in which stress history effect is neglected which also indicates that the influence of the scour width and the slope angle on the critical lateral displacement that characterized by the effect of the modified young s modulus of the remaining soil may potentially be minor altogether the reduction effect of the vertical load on the lateral capacity of the offshore pile embedded in marine clay considering the lateral load level and thus the lateral displacement level are relatively high in such cases karthigeyan et al 2006 should be mainly analyzed during scour 3 5 influence of the vertical load level under scour condition to further study the influence of vertical load level on the combined effects of a lateral force including bending moment and a vertical load on the pile s lateral responses under scour condition the pvc of a pile at a deflection of 0 12d beyond the critical value with three typical vertical loads 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult are first calculated at various scour depth see table 2 considering or ignoring the stress history effect as shown in fig 6 in this figure the pile flexibility factor k r and the pile slenderness ratio l d are chosen as 10 4 and 15 respectively for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects the pvc is defined as follows in terms of the lateral load capacity with vertical load lcwv and the lateral load capacity under pure lateral loading lcpl 30 pvc lcwv lcpl lcpl 100 it can be seen from fig 6 that the influence of vertical load increases significantly with an increase in vertical load at various scour depth furthermore fig 6 shows that the vertical load effect increases significantly with an increasing of scour depth at all typical vertical load levels and particularly the pvc for the three typical vertical load levels decreases with scour depth in a nonlinear manner at an accelerating rate meanwhile fig 6 also indicates that considering the stress history effect results in significantly higher pvc at all typical loading ratios when compared with the case in which stress history effect is neglected and this difference becomes increasingly evident as the scour depth increases then fig 7 shows the pvc versus scour width curves obtained with the corresponding modified young s modulus of the remaining soil see table 3 at three typical vertical loads p t 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult and a pile head deflection of 0 12d beyond the critical value the pile flexibility factor k r of 10 4 and the pile slenderness ratio l d of 15 are also selected in this figure the results show that an increase of the vertical load significantly increases the influence of vertical load at various scour width moreover it is found from fig 7 that as the scour width increases the vertical load effect decreases slightly at all typical vertical load levels also considering the three typical vertical loads p t 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult and a pile head deflection of 0 12d fig 8 presents the pvc computed with the modified young s modulus of the remaining soil at various scour hole slope angles see table 4 it can be noted that the influence of vertical load increases significantly as the vertical load increases at different scour hole slope angles additionally with the increase of the scour hole slope angle a slight increasing trend of the vertical load effect can be observed in fig 8 at all typical vertical load levels furthermore fig 9 shows the influence of vertical load on the bending moments developed in the pile section the lateral load developed at a deflection of 0 12d that beyond the critical value under pure lateral loading for different vertical load levels and typical scour hole dimension i e s d 4d s w 0 α 40 for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects it can be seen that the maximum bending moment developed in the pile section is observed to increase significantly with the vertical load under scour condition while the depth at which the maximum bending moment occurred is influenced very little by the presence of vertical loads under scour condition the result shows that the design bending moment in the scour affected pile is higher under combined loading as compared to the scoured pile under pure lateral loading 3 6 remarks on the buckling of the pile foundation the critical buckling load p cr of a pile under scour conditions can be evaluated in an approximate manner by adopting the widely accepted analysis procedure developed by davisson and robinson 1965 see aashto 2007 liang et al 2009 and lin et al 2010a b in this procedure a partially embedded pile due to scour is treated as a pile having a fixed base of an equivalent depth below the ground note that the modified elastic modulus of the remaining clay after scour is also used to determine the equivalent depth to fixity while the boundary conditions at the pile head is assumed to be the same as that of the actual pile the buckling load thus may be calculated following the well known euler s formula with the total pile length equal to the equivalent embedment length plus the freestanding length of the pile davisson and robinson 1965 liang et al 2009 lin et al 2010a poulos and davis 1980 for the extreme scour conditions of s d 4d s w and α 40 the calculated critical buckling load of the pile is around 0 97 p ult which is quite comparable with the maximum vertical load of 0 9 p ult applied at the pile head this indicates that although the buckling of pile is a very important issue when considering the bearing capacity of scour damaged pile foundations it appears not to be a dominant factor controlling the ultimate capacity of the pile for the specific parameters involved in the present numerical analyses especially on account of the general lateral movement limitation of 0 12 d for the pile foundation under most scour conditions nevertheless in the future research the buckling stability of the scoured piles subjected to combined loading should be studied more systematically by using more rigorous models for example the integrated analysis procedure developed from the potential work by zhang et al 2017 and liang et al 2015a 2015b 4 limitations there are two major limitations that need to be addressed regarding the present analytical model proposed for evaluating the performance of scoured pile foundation under combined lateral and vertical loading first the proposed model is based on the assumption that the soil behaves in a simple linear elastic manner and that no slip is allowed to occur at the soil pile interface at all times the second limitation is pertaining to the soil pile separation effect on the lateral behavior of piles for which an approximate allowance has been made for this important gaping effect through the reduction of the soil modulus by a certain factor following poulos and davis 1980 proposition to examine the effects of separation on the lateral responses of piles as well as the applicability limitation of the present simplified approach in handling such effects fig 10 shows the comparisons of the calculated ground deflection lateral load curve with and without considering the occurrence of gap between the current method and a more rigorous one developed by pranjoto and pender 2003 the results are based on an earlier case study provided by pender and pranjoto 1996 it can be seen that neglecting the soil pile separation generally underestimates the deflection of a laterally loaded single pile and such underestimation increases with the magnitude of the applied load fig 10 also indicates that in contrast to the more rigorous solution by pranjoto and pender 2003 the present model with the rough approximation implementation of the gaping effect tends to appreciably overestimate the deflection responses of the pile therefore one should be well aware of the aforementioned limitations inherent to the current investigation and in this sense it can only be regarded as a crude approximation to the scoured pile problem considered more accurate analysis modelling of the behavior of the involved soil pile interface involving both separation and sliding mechanisms can be found in a series of numerical solutions 2d finite element analysis based on a multi shear mechanism constitutive relationship flip and 3d finite differences analysis using the computer code flac3d recently reported by hussien s group hussien et al 2010 2012 2014 hazzar et al 2017a 2017b nevertheless given its analytical nature and convenience the present model may still serve as a good addition for estimating the deflection and moment responses of the scoured pile foundations subjected to combined lateral and vertical loading especially under the working loads at least a starting point from which more reasonable rigorous solutions can be developed future efforts may include the introduction of the detachable mechanism pender and pranjoto 1996 pranjoto and pender 2003 that incorporates the elastic perfectly plastic p y curves liang et al 2015c as well as the simplified τ z q z curves poulos and davis 1980 to modify the proposed model and thus improve its applicability and accuracy in evaluating the pile behavior under scour conditions 5 conclusions an analytical procedure was developed in this paper to investigate the influence of vertical loads on the lateral responses of scour affected piles in marine clay this procedure can account for the combined effect of the lateral reaction pressure the vertical shear stress along the pile shaft and the normal stress at the pile base moreover the effects of the three dimensional scour hole geometry as well as the stress history of the soils can be considered simultaneously in this procedure by modifying the key soil parameter based on the mindlin s solutions and the critical state soil mechanics the following conclusions have been drawn based on this study 1 the lateral load capacity of the pile is increased by the presence of the vertical load when the lateral displacement is not high below the critical value before scour however an opposite trend is observed at high lateral displacement level beyond the critical value under pre scour condition piles with a small slenderness ratio and flexible behavior show particularly strong interaction effects 2 scour depth plays the most important role among the three scour hole dimensions i e scour depth scour width and scour slope in influencing the lateral responses of scoured piles under combined vertical and lateral loading when the scour depth is increased the critical lateral displacement tends to decrease significantly and thus the unfavorable effects of the vertical load on the lateral responses of the scoured pile increase significantly with an increase in vertical load level furthermore an increase of the scour depth increases the vertical load effect significantly 3 for the scoured pile with a small slenderness ratio and flexible behavior an increase of the scour width decreases the vertical load effect slightly while a slight increasing trend of the vertical load effect is observed when the scour hole slope angle increases 4 considering the effect of stress history modifying the key soil parameter i e young s modulus of the remaining soil results in a little higher critical lateral displacement when compared with the case in which stress history effect is neglected which can thus be negligible during scour on the other hand the difference in the influence of vertical load on the scoured pile s lateral responses obtained by considering and ignoring stress history effect is significant which should be taken into account for the analysis of the laterally loaded piles with vertical load under scour condition the current study is limited to the simplistic assumption of linear elastic behavior for the soil without consideration of the soil pile sliding mechanism and to the approximate allowance made through the reduction of the soil modulus by a certain factor to account for the gapping effect nevertheless the simplicity and relative ease of using the analytical model described in this paper make it still a good alternative approach for estimating the deflection and moment responses of the scoured pile foundations subjected to combined lateral and vertical loading at least a starting point from which more reasonable rigorous

23395,scour induces the loss of soil support around the pile foundations for the offshore and coastal structures and thus increases their bending moments and lateral deflections which may change the vertical loads effect on the lateral response of piles applied in such cases in this paper the stress changes of the remaining soils at the corresponding pile location due to the three dimensional scour hole formation are first determined based on the mindlin s elastic solutions then the calculated new soil stresses are adopted to re examine the young s modulus of the remaining soils undergoing a stress history due to scour with this key soil parameter that have been modified appropriately to reasonably reflect the effects of three dimensional scour hole geometry and the stress history of the soils simultaneously an analytical model based on the principle of minimum potential energy is further developed to investigate the influence of vertical loads on the lateral responses of offshore piles in marine clay under scour conditions the influence of related parameters including the lateral displacement level and the vertical load level with different scour hole dimensions i e scour depth scour width and scour hole slope angle considering or ignoring stress history effect have also been analyzed based on a case study the results show that scour depth plays the most important role among the various scour hole dimensions in influencing the responses of scoured piles under combined vertical and lateral loading although still possessing some limitations e g the simplistic assumption of linear elastic behavior for the soil and the approximate allowance made to account for the gapping effect the simplicity and relative ease of utilization offered by this proposed analytical model make it a good alternative approach for estimating the deflection and moment responses of the scoured pile foundations subjected to combined lateral and vertical loading keywords vertical load lateral response offshore piles scour hole geometry stress history 1 introduction pile foundations supporting the offshore and coastal structures are not only subjected to vertical loads from the superstructures but also lateral loads due to wind or wave actions in such cases the effect of vertical loads on the pile s lateral responses i e bending moments and lateral deflections is to be expected in addition scouring of soil around pile foundations of offshore structures can significantly increase their bending moments and lateral deflections and sometimes pose a risk to structural stability briaud et al 1999 richardson and davis 2001 wardhana and hadipriono 2003 which may change the influence of vertical loads on the lateral responses of pile foundations yet the literature available on this topic is scanty and the results available in the limited literature are somewhat inconsistent with respect to the effect of vertical loads on the lateral responses of piles hussien et al 2014 for the pile embedded in sand some experimental jain et al 1987 lee et al 2011 2013 and analytical goryunov 1973 levy et al 2005 studies indicated that the presence of a vertical load increases the lateral deflection while other experimental pise 1975 karasev et al 1977 zhang et al 2002 and numerical karthigeyan et al 2006 achmus and thieken 2010a 2010b achmus et al 2009 investigations suggested a decrease in lateral deflection with the combination of vertical loads similarly model anagnostopoulos and georgiadis 1993 and field zhukov and balov 1978 sorochan and bykov 1976 tests as well as theoretical studies liang et al 2012 karthigeyan et al 2007 madhav and sarma 1982 reached opposite conclusions for the pile embedded in clay the contradiction regarding the effect of vertical loads on the lateral responses of piles found in the experimental results was considered to stem from the restraint condition of the pile head during loading lee et al 2011 2013 and other possible reasons for this contradiction such as the soil properties i e for the pile embedded in sand the confining stress increases with vertical loads while the interface between the pile and the surrounding clayey soils fails early in the presence of vertical loads and the lateral load level i e for higher load levels and thus larger lateral displacements the importance of the favorable influence of the vertical load on the pile s lateral response decreases due to geometrical non linearity were given by karthigeyan et al 2007 achmus and thieken 2010b and liang et al 2015a in theoretical studies moreover when studying the vertical loads effect on the lateral responses of pile foundations under scour conditions another significant difficulty is that scour holes formed around the piles usually involve certain shapes and sizes and meanwhile the remaining soils have undergone an unloading process associated with new stress states the latter of unloading produces the changes of stress history of the remaining soils and hence their resistances provided to the pile foundations as well although limited number of studies have been conducted to investigate the behavior of laterally loaded piles under scour conditions daniels et al 2007 bennett et al 2009 lin et al 2010b 2014a 2014b 2016 li et al 2013 however most of them have been largely limited to ignoring either the effect of scour hole geometry or that of the stress history characterized by the over consolidation ratio ocr the objective of this paper is to present a simplified analysis procedure to investigate the influence of vertical load on the lateral responses of offshore piles considering scour hole geometry and stress history of marine clay the major contribution to this procedure included 1 the application of a variational approach proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a for the analysis of vertical loads effect on the lateral response of fully embedded piles to further consider the exposure of the pile due to scour in which the combined effect of the lateral reaction pressure the vertical shear stress along the pile shaft and the normal stress at the pile base are accounted for and 2 the modification of the key soil parameter given in the proposed model i e the young s modulus of marine clay to account properly for the effects of the three dimensional scour hole geometry as well as of the stress history of the soils whose procedures are similar to those presented by the authors in zhang et al 2017 with the simplified procedure a case study is subsequently used to analyze the scour affected behavior of laterally loaded piles in marine clay with the combination of vertical load 2 analysis procedure a pile having length l and diameter d subjected to lateral load h t bending moment m t and vertical load p t at the head simultaneously is assumed to be embedded in a normally consolidated homogenous marine clay before the scour event as shown in fig 1 in this figure a typical scour hole with the dimensions defined by the scour depth s d width s w and slope angle α which has been successfully used by zhang et al 2017 for a laterally loaded single pile under scour condition is assumed to be formed around the pile for the demonstration purposes and the center of the scour hole at the ground surface is set to be the origin of the axisymmetrical cylindrical coordinate system r θ z the effect of vertical load on the lateral response of pile foundation under scour conditions which has not been studied before is analyzed by means of the analytical model proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a further in the analysis procedure to satisfy the scour conditions including scour hole dimensions and stress history effect the embedded length of the pile is altered and the key soil parameter of the analytical model and other corresponding soil properties are modified appropriately based on the framework developed by the authors in zhang et al 2017 the main analysis procedures are outlined briefly for completeness in the following 2 1 description of the analytical model proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a the analytical model summarized herein was proposed by the authors in liang et al 2015a for the analysis of vertical loads effect on the lateral response of offshore pile without any scour s d 0 for a single pile subjected to both the lateral and vertical loads the total potential energy π p can be written as 1 π p u p 1 2 s τ z w z d s 1 2 l p z ρ z d d z 1 2 a σ b w b d a p t w t h t ρ t ρ t z m t in eq 1 the first term u p equals elastic strain energy of the pile see liang et al 2015a the second and third terms are respectively the work done by the vertical shear stress τ z and the lateral reaction pressures p z along the pile shaft where w z and ρ z are respectively the vertical and the lateral displacements of the pile at depth z and s is the surface area of the pile the fourth term is the work done by the normal stresses σ b at the pile base where w b is the vertical displacement at the pile base and a denotes the cross sectional area of the pile the last three terms are the works done by the vertical load p t by the lateral load h t and by the applied moment m t at the pile head where w t and ρ t are respectively the vertical and lateral displacements of the pile at the pile head by using gauss integration and assuming uniform σ b and w b at the pile base eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 π p u p 1 2 ρ w t k s ρ w p t w t h t ρ t ρ t z m t where ρ w is the vector that include the lateral displacements ρ qi and the vertical displacements w gi of the pile at the gauss points as well as the vertical displacement w b at the pile base here ng and nq are the number of gauss points chosen for the pile along its shaft k s denotes the soil stiffness matrix which is described in a subsequent section the lateral and the vertical displacements of the pile which can be represented by finite series as given by liang et al 2015a can be written as 3 ρ z z h m t β h m w z z v t β v where z h m and z v are the vectors related to only the depth coordinate z β h m and β v containing undermined constants thus with the application of the principle of minimum potential energy eq 2 can be reduced as 4 u p δ j ρ w δ j t k s ρ w w t δ j t p t ρ t δ j t h t ρ t z δ j t m t where δ j are the coefficients in the vectors β h m and β v the soil load deformation relationship i e the soil stiffness matrix k s described in eq 2 can be determined based on the point load solution by mindlin 1936 specifically the lateral reaction pressures and the vertical shear stresses at depth z are first approximated by the following two finite series see liang et al 2015a 5 p z z p t α p τ z z τ t α τ where z p and z τ are the vectors related to only the depth coordinate z α p and α τ containing undermined constants then the vector ρ w in eq 2 which represent the displacement of the pile can be rewritten as 6 ρ w f α where α containing the coefficients in the vectors α p and α τ as well as the normal stresses σ b at the pile base and f can be expressed as 7 f f ρ l f ρ v f w l f w v the coefficients in the sub matrix f ρ l f ρ v f w l and f w v are given in appendix a and the soil stiffness matrix k s is therefore obtained 8 k s t f 1 in which 9 t t l t v and the coefficients in sub matrix t l and t v are given by eq b8 b9 in appendix b after some mathematic manipulations eq 4 can be rewritten as 10 k β p l a where β containing the undermined constants in the vectors β h m and β v k is the pile soil stiffness matrix which is given in appendix b and p l a is the vector reflecting the lateral load bending moment and the vertical load acting at the pile head for a pile with a free head boundary condition the vector β in eq 10 can be solved under known lateral load bending moment and vertical load at the pile head accordingly the lateral displacements ρ z rotations θ z and bending moments m z of the pile at any depth can be obtained furthermore an iterative procedure is required to consider the additional bending moment in the pile due to the moment arm of the vertical load i e geometrical non linearity achmus and thieken 2010a 2010b liang et al 2012 in this procedure the initial rotation θ 0 at the pile head can be obtained using the above calculations at first then the updated lateral load h t and vertical load p t at the pile head can be determined by 11 h t h t cos θ 0 p t sin θ 0 p t p t cos θ 0 h t sin θ 0 the updated values of h t and p t will be used in eq 10 to solve new rotation θ 0 at the pile head this iterative procedure will be repeated until the difference of the rotation at the pile head obtained between two successive iterations is within 5 2 2 key soil parameter of the analytical model the analytical model described in the previous section indicates that its key soil parameter is limited to the young s modulus of the soil e s as a constant poisson s ratio of 0 3 is often considered for the analysis of pile foundations in marine clay kim et al 2009 2011 jeong et al 2011 more specifically the young s modulus of the shallow soil layer is of great interest for this study because laterally loaded piles typically receive most of their support from the soil in the upper 7 10 pile diameters briaud 1997 kim and jeong 2011 kim et al 2011 therefore the young s modulus of the soil at the depth of 2 pile diameter below the mudline before after scour is used in this study for the demonstration purposes which can be further determined based on the empirical correlations with other soil properties for example from a number of published load deflection measurements on full scale piles poulos 1971 back figured the secant values of e s at working load levels on the assumption that e s is constant with depth and recommended the values of e s ranged between 15c u and 95c u for clays where c u is the undrained shear strength of clay banerjee and davies 1978 back figured values of e s ranged between 100c u and 180c u for cohesive soils the scatter of the back figured results reflects the effects of local yielding since more local yield may have occurred in the softer soils at working loads than in stiffer clays in other words the lower values tend to be associated with very soft clays and the higher values with stiff clays moreover poulos 1995 chen and poulos 1997 and comodromos and papadopoulou 2012 recommended that the tangent values of e s of 150c u to 400c u could also be used for laterally loaded piles in clay and the effect of pile soil separation under elastic conditions may be considered as approximately equivalent to reducing the soil modulus by a factor of about 2 for practical purposes poulos and davis 1980 altogether the young s modulus e s of 120c u which has been successfully used by li et al 2013 to investigate the scour effect on the behavior of laterally loaded piles in marine clay is adopted in this study for the scour affected piles embedded in marine clay to address the effect of scour on the key soil parameter e s of the analytical model the soil properties including the undrained shear strength of clay after scour should be examined based on the framework developed by the authors in zhang et al 2017 2 3 modified key soil parameter considering scour effect zhang et al 2017 consider the scour hole geometry and its symmetry as shown in fig 1 the circular uniform loads p v b o t t o m which can be calculated by γ s d γ is the effective unit weight of soil before scour act vertically on the scour hole bottom before the scour is underway simultaneously based on mohr s stress circle the triangle distributed loads p n s i d e w a l l and p p s i d

k 0 2 γ z p sin 2 α in eq 12 z p is the depth coordinate of loading action point ranging from 0 to s d and k 0 refers to the earth pressure coefficient at rest in the absence of test data the empirical formula mayne and kulhawy 1982 can be used as shown in eq 13 13 k 0 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ where φ is the effective internal friction angle of soil ocr denotes the over consolidation ratio and particularly for the normally consolidated homogenous clay before scour the earth pressure coefficient at rest is given by 14 k 0 1 sin ϕ when the scour hole is formed equivalent values of p v b o t t o m p n s i d e w a l l and p p s i d e w a l l which have been changed into opposite direction are applied to the bottom and surrounding sidewalls to simulate the scour induced unloading effects then mindlin 1936 green s function for vertical and lateral loads in a semi infinite half space can be thus used to calculate the scour induced soil unloading stress to facilitate the use of the green s function the triangle distributed loads p n s i d e w a l l and p p s i d e w a l l need to be rewritten as the corresponding triangle distributed vertical loads p v s i d e w a l l and lateral loads p h s i d e w a l l in eq 15 which are also acted reversely on the surrounding sidewalls of the scour hole to simulate the unloading effects 15 p v s i d e w a l l p n s i d e w a l l cos α p p s i d

stress σ z u l at the point of pile axis 0 0 z can be obtained by considering the unloading effects for the bottom and sidewall of scour hole 16 σ z u l σ z b o t t o m σ z s i d e w a l l v σ z s i d

due to the unit lateral loading p h s i d e w a l l r 1 d r d z p 2 d z p d θ acting at the point r θ z p of scour hole sidewall respectively which are given in appendix c after scour according to the first step analysis the present stress σ z s c of the remaining soil at the point of pile axis 0 0 z which can consider the effect of three dimensional scour hole geometry is thus given by 17 σ z s c σ z int σ z u l where σ z int is the soil stress at the point of pile axis 0 0 z before scour which can be calculated by γ z in the second step to further consider the stress history effect soil properties including the undrained shear strength after scour should be re examined by using the present stress σ z s c of the remaining soil calculated by eq 17 the procedures are described as below before scour the major effective stress σ 1 and the minor effective stress σ 3 at the point of pile axis 0 0 z are respectively shown in 18 σ 1 σ z int γ z σ 3 k 0 σ z int k 0 γ z where k 0 refers to the earth pressure coefficient at rest before scour which is previously given by eq 14 thus the mean effective stress is determined 19 p int σ 1 2 σ 3 3 γ z 3 2 sin ϕ 3 after scour the major effective

pressure coefficient at rest after scour which can be determined by using eq 13 accordingly the mean effective stress is calculated as shown 21 p s c σ 1 2 σ 3 3 σ z s c 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ 3 where the over consolidation ratio ocr is defined as 22 ocr σ z int σ z s c γ z σ z s c by using eqs 19 21 and 22 the specific volume after scour v sc can be expressed by eq 23 based on the compression and swelling curve 23 v s c v int κ ln p int p s c v int κ ln γ z 3 2 sin ϕ σ z s c 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ where κ is the swelling index from isotropic consolidation tests and v int is the specific volume before scour which can be determined by using eq 24 if the soil is saturated 24 v int γ w γ w w γ w γ w where γ w is the unit weight of water and w refers to the soil moisture content then the soil effective unit weight after scour can be obtained by 25 γ s c v int γ v s c v int γ v int κ ln 3 2 sin ϕ ocr 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ in addition as the normally consolidated soil after scour becomes over consolidated and the earth pressure coefficient at rest increases during the unloading process see eq 13 the relationship of the undrained shear strengths before and after scour can be established in terms of the mean effective stress by using eqs 26a and 26b which were derived based on the modified cam clay model muir wood 1990 26a c u s c p s c c u int p int c u p o c c u p n c p

consolidation tests c c and c ur are compression and swelling indexes obtained from the oedometer tests respectively hence by combining eqs 19 21 22 and 26 the undrained shear strength after scour can be finally determined by eq 27 27 c u s c c u int 3 2 sin ϕ ocr 1 2 1 sin ϕ ocr sin ϕ λ 1 by substituting eq 27 into the empirical correlations i e e s 120c u li et al 2013 the young s modulus of the

piles subjected to both vertical and lateral loads once the soil parameters before scour e g effective unit weight γ poisson s ratio ν soil effective internal friction angle φ moisture content w and undrained shear strength c u and the scour dimensions e g scour depth s d scour width s w and scour hole slope angle α are known the key soil parameter of the analytical model i e young s modulus e s of the soil and other corresponding soil properties e g effective unit weight over consolidation ratio and undrained shear strength can be modified by applying eqs 22 24 25 27 and 28 to consider the effect of scour hole geometry and soil stress history simultaneously then the modified young s modulus e s s c of the remaining soil after scour is further exported into the analytical model in which the embedded length of the pile is changed from l to l s d to determine the lateral response of scour affected piles subjected to both vertical and lateral loads 3 case study a thorough review of the literature available in this field indicated that there is no literature pertaining to numerical investigations or experimental tests on scour affected pile foundation subjected to both lateral and vertical loads nevertheless the above solution procedure has been coded into matlab and preliminarily validated by comparing the results with those of field load tests and laboratory load tests under the pre scour conditions liang et al 2015a the accuracy of the model makes it a powerful tool to analyze the influence of vertical load on the lateral response of scoured piles in marine clay then floating cylindrical piles with two flexibility factors k r e p i p e s l 4 10 4 10 3 and different slenderness ratios l d 15 20 25 which are fully embedded in a homogeneous soil deposit having the same properties as that of the upper marine clay at the incheon bridge site in south korea kim et al 2009 2011 are selected as an initial condition before scour for the case study here lateral loads h con where h con are the lateral loads developed at various lateral displacement levels lower than 0 12d bending moments m con h con d and vertical loads 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult where p ult is the ultimate vertical load capacity evaluated a priori by a separate analysis based on a general expression for the ultimate load capacity of a single pile in clay poulos and davis 1980 are applied at the pile head simultaneously and thus their synergistic effects on the lateral responses of the scour affected pile are subsequently investigated by analyzing the key influence factors including the lateral displacement level and the vertical load level for different scour hole dimensions various scour depth scour width and scour hole slope angle considering or ignoring stress history effect note that the number of gauss points used in eq 2 and that of terms used in eqs 3 and 5 are the same with that given by liang et al 2015a the details of this case study are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 site conditions the properties of the upper marine clay at the incheon bridge site in south korea reported by kim et al 2009 2011 are used in this analysis as described earlier see table 1 some of these properties are estimated based on empirical relationships for demonstration purposes they can be more accurately determined by laboratory or in situ tests the compression index c c is estimated based on the moisture content azzouz et al 1976 and the swelling index c ur is taken as 1 5 c c kulhawy and mayne 1990 note that usually λ and κ are assumed approximately equal to c c 2 3 and c ur 2 3 respectively as no value for the effective friction angle was provided from the field test performed by kim et al 2009 a typical friction angle ϕ 20 of marine clay is assumed for this case study the soil specific volume before scour is estimated to be 1 81 in eq 24 the water table is kept above the ground surface a pile having the diameter of 1 m was driven and the lateral load bending moment as well as the vertical load was assumed to be applied at the pile head 3 2 vertical load effect on the lateral response of the pile before scour in this section the lateral load displacement curves of a laterally loaded pile without vertical load p t 0 and one with vertical load p t 0 9p ult are compared for the pre scour condition in fig 2 it can be seen that piles with a small length to diameter ratio and flexible behavior small k r value show particularly strong interaction effects specifically the lateral load capacity is slightly increased by the presence of the vertical load when the lateral displacement level is not high which may be caused by the interactions among the lateral reaction pressures the vertical shear stress and the normal stress based on linearly elastic model for the soil liang et al 2015a with the increase of the lateral displacement level the increasing effect induced by the vertical force is diminishing which can be explained by the geometrical non linearity achmus and thieken 2010b as described in section 2 1 beyond a certain point the lateral capacity starts to decrease significantly with the vertical load and the similar result was also obtained by karthigeyan et al 2007 for piles in clay under combined vertical and lateral loading therefore we can define this point as the critical lateral displacement d cr below which the presence of the vertical load increases the lateral load capacity of the pile and beyond which the presence of the vertical load decreases the lateral capacity of the pile accordingly the variation in lateral deflection along the pile depth and the bending moments developed in the pile section at low lateral displacement level the lateral load developed at a deflection that below the critical value under pure lateral loading e g 0 5d cr and high lateral displacement level the lateral load developed at a deflection that beyond the critical value under pure lateral loading e g 3d cr are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 respectively for the pile subjected to lateral force and vertical load simultaneously two different ratios of p t p ult 0 and 0 9 are considered in these figures the pile flexibility factor k r and the pile slenderness ratio l d are chosen as 10 4 and 15 respectively for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects the effect of the vertical load on the lateral responses of the pile can be seen clearly from figs 3 and 4 specifically fig 3 shows a decrease of the lateral displacement and the bending moment of the pile with the vertical load however an opposite trend is observed in fig 4 i e both the lateral displacement and the bending moment of the pile particularly within its upper part increase with the vertical load 3 3 modified properties of the remaining soil after scour based on the procedures discussed earlier the properties of the remaining clay after scour i e the modified young s modulus of the soil li et al 2013 and other corresponding soil properties at the depth of 2 pile diameter below the present mudline are determined with different scour hole dimensions as presented in tables 2 4 the results show that the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil after scour decrease significantly when compared with those before scour while a minor decrease in the effective unit weight are observed more specifically table 2 illustrates a decrease of the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil and an increase of the ocr with an increasing of the scour depth furthermore table 3 indicates that the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil decrease as the scour width increases from zero considering the scour hole dimensions to infinite ignoring the scour hole dimensions while the ocr increases with increasing scour width finally it is found from table 4 that with the increase of the scour hole slope angle the undrained shear strength and thus the young s modulus of the soil gradually increase while the ocr decreases with increasing scour hole slope angle it is worth noting that the remaining soils undergo an unloading process due to scour and thus high ocr can be obtained near the soil surface to avoid a passive earth failure however a limited ocr of 27 can be determined for this study ϕ 20 by using eq 29 mayne and kulhawy 1982 which is based on the k o ocr relationship in soils 29 ocr limit 1 sin ϕ 1 sin ϕ 2 1 sin ϕ therefore the ocrlimit in eq 29 aids in determination of soil depth below which the young s modulus of the marine clay derived from eq 28 is valid 3 4 influence of the lateral displacement level under scour condition to examine the influence of the lateral displacement level on the synergistic effects of a lateral force including bending moment and a vertical load on the lateral responses of the scoured pile the critical lateral displacements at various scour depth see table 2 and the loading ratio of p t p ult 0 9 are calculated considering or ignoring the stress history effect in fig 5 also the pile flexibility factor k r of 10 4 and the pile slenderness ratio l d of 15 are selected in this figure for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects it is found that the critical lateral displacement is at a low level and decreases significantly as scour depth increases under the scour condition considering the stress history effect results in a little higher critical lateral displacements when compared with the case in which stress history effect is neglected which also indicates that the influence of the scour width and the slope angle on the critical lateral displacement that characterized by the effect of the modified young s modulus of the remaining soil may potentially be minor altogether the reduction effect of the vertical load on the lateral capacity of the offshore pile embedded in marine clay considering the lateral load level and thus the lateral displacement level are relatively high in such cases karthigeyan et al 2006 should be mainly analyzed during scour 3 5 influence of the vertical load level under scour condition to further study the influence of vertical load level on the combined effects of a lateral force including bending moment and a vertical load on the pile s lateral responses under scour condition the pvc of a pile at a deflection of 0 12d beyond the critical value with three typical vertical loads 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult are first calculated at various scour depth see table 2 considering or ignoring the stress history effect as shown in fig 6 in this figure the pile flexibility factor k r and the pile slenderness ratio l d are chosen as 10 4 and 15 respectively for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects the pvc is defined as follows in terms of the lateral load capacity with vertical load lcwv and the lateral load capacity under pure lateral loading lcpl 30 pvc lcwv lcpl lcpl 100 it can be seen from fig 6 that the influence of vertical load increases significantly with an increase in vertical load at various scour depth furthermore fig 6 shows that the vertical load effect increases significantly with an increasing of scour depth at all typical vertical load levels and particularly the pvc for the three typical vertical load levels decreases with scour depth in a nonlinear manner at an accelerating rate meanwhile fig 6 also indicates that considering the stress history effect results in significantly higher pvc at all typical loading ratios when compared with the case in which stress history effect is neglected and this difference becomes increasingly evident as the scour depth increases then fig 7 shows the pvc versus scour width curves obtained with the corresponding modified young s modulus of the remaining soil see table 3 at three typical vertical loads p t 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult and a pile head deflection of 0 12d beyond the critical value the pile flexibility factor k r of 10 4 and the pile slenderness ratio l d of 15 are also selected in this figure the results show that an increase of the vertical load significantly increases the influence of vertical load at various scour width moreover it is found from fig 7 that as the scour width increases the vertical load effect decreases slightly at all typical vertical load levels also considering the three typical vertical loads p t 0 3p ult 0 6p ult 0 9p ult and a pile head deflection of 0 12d fig 8 presents the pvc computed with the modified young s modulus of the remaining soil at various scour hole slope angles see table 4 it can be noted that the influence of vertical load increases significantly as the vertical load increases at different scour hole slope angles additionally with the increase of the scour hole slope angle a slight increasing trend of the vertical load effect can be observed in fig 8 at all typical vertical load levels furthermore fig 9 shows the influence of vertical load on the bending moments developed in the pile section the lateral load developed at a deflection of 0 12d that beyond the critical value under pure lateral loading for different vertical load levels and typical scour hole dimension i e s d 4d s w 0 α 40 for demonstration purpose strong interaction effects it can be seen that the maximum bending moment developed in the pile section is observed to increase significantly with the vertical load under scour condition while the depth at which the maximum bending moment occurred is influenced very little by the presence of vertical loads under scour condition the result shows that the design bending moment in the scour affected pile is higher under combined loading as compared to the scoured pile under pure lateral loading 3 6 remarks on the buckling of the pile foundation the critical buckling load p cr of a pile under scour conditions can be evaluated in an approximate manner by adopting the widely accepted analysis procedure developed by davisson and robinson 1965 see aashto 2007 liang et al 2009 and lin et al 2010a b in this procedure a partially embedded pile due to scour is treated as a pile having a fixed base of an equivalent depth below the ground note that the modified elastic modulus of the remaining clay after scour is also used to determine the equivalent depth to fixity while the boundary conditions at the pile head is assumed to be the same as that of the actual pile the buckling load thus may be calculated following the well known euler s formula with the total pile length equal to the equivalent embedment length plus the freestanding length of the pile davisson and robinson 1965 liang et al 2009 lin et al 2010a poulos and davis 1980 for the extreme scour conditions of s d 4d s w and α 40 the calculated critical buckling load of the pile is around 0 97 p ult which is quite comparable with the maximum vertical load of 0 9 p ult applied at the pile head this indicates that although the buckling of pile is a very important issue when considering the bearing capacity of scour damaged pile foundations it appears not to be a dominant factor controlling the ultimate capacity of the pile for the specific parameters involved in the present numerical analyses especially on account of the general lateral movement limitation of 0 12 d for the pile foundation under most scour conditions nevertheless in the future research the buckling stability of the scoured piles subjected to combined loading should be studied more systematically by using more rigorous models for example the integrated analysis procedure developed from the potential work by zhang et al 2017 and liang et al 2015a 2015b 4 limitations there are two major limitations that need to be addressed regarding the present analytical model proposed for evaluating the performance of scoured pile foundation under combined lateral and vertical loading first the proposed model is based on the assumption that the soil behaves in a simple linear elastic manner and that no slip is allowed to occur at the soil pile interface at all times the second limitation is pertaining to the soil pile separation effect on the lateral behavior of piles for which an approximate allowance has been made for this important gaping effect through the reduction of the soil modulus by a certain factor following poulos and davis 1980 proposition to examine the effects of separation on the lateral responses of piles as well as the applicability limitation of the present simplified approach in handling such effects fig 10 shows the comparisons of the calculated ground deflection lateral load curve with and without considering the occurrence of gap between the current method and a more rigorous one developed by pranjoto and pender 2003 the results are based on an earlier case study provided by pender and pranjoto 1996 it can be seen that neglecting the soil pile separation generally underestimates the deflection of a laterally loaded single pile and such underestimation increases with the magnitude of the applied load fig 10 also indicates that in contrast to the more rigorous solution by pranjoto and pender 2003 the present model with the rough approximation implementation of the gaping effect tends to appreciably overestimate the deflection responses of the pile therefore one should be well aware of the aforementioned limitations inherent to the current investigation and in this sense it can only be regarded as a crude approximation to the scoured pile problem considered more accurate analysis modelling of the behavior of the involved soil pile interface involving both separation and sliding mechanisms can be found in a series of numerical solutions 2d finite element analysis based on a multi shear mechanism constitutive relationship flip and 3d finite differences analysis using the computer code flac3d recently reported by hussien s group hussien et al 2010 2012 2014 hazzar et al 2017a 2017b nevertheless given its analytical nature and convenience the present model may still serve as a good addition for estimating the deflection and moment responses of the scoured pile foundations subjected to combined lateral and vertical loading especially under the working loads at least a starting point from which more reasonable rigorous solutions can be developed future efforts may include the introduction of the detachable mechanism pender and pranjoto 1996 pranjoto and pender 2003 that incorporates the elastic perfectly plastic p y curves liang et al 2015c as well as the simplified τ z q z curves poulos and davis 1980 to modify the proposed model and thus improve its applicability and accuracy in evaluating the pile behavior under scour conditions 5 conclusions an analytical procedure was developed in this paper to investigate the influence of vertical loads on the lateral responses of scour affected piles in marine clay this procedure can account for the combined effect of the lateral reaction pressure the vertical shear stress along the pile shaft and the normal stress at the pile base moreover the effects of the three dimensional scour hole geometry as well as the stress history of the soils can be considered simultaneously in this procedure by modifying the key soil parameter based on the mindlin s solutions and the critical state soil mechanics the following conclusions have been drawn based on this study 1 the lateral load capacity of the pile is increased by the presence of the vertical load when the lateral displacement is not high below the critical value before scour however an opposite trend is observed at high lateral displacement level beyond the critical value under pre scour condition piles with a small slenderness ratio and flexible behavior show particularly strong interaction effects 2 scour depth plays the most important role among the three scour hole dimensions i e scour depth scour width and scour slope in influencing the lateral responses of scoured piles under combined vertical and lateral loading when the scour depth is increased the critical lateral displacement tends to decrease significantly and thus the unfavorable effects of the vertical load on the lateral responses of the scoured pile increase significantly with an increase in vertical load level furthermore an increase of the scour depth increases the vertical load effect significantly 3 for the scoured pile with a small slenderness ratio and flexible behavior an increase of the scour width decreases the vertical load effect slightly while a slight increasing trend of the vertical load effect is observed when the scour hole slope angle increases 4 considering the effect of stress history modifying the key soil parameter i e young s modulus of the remaining soil results in a little higher critical lateral displacement when compared with the case in which stress history effect is neglected which can thus be negligible during scour on the other hand the difference in the influence of vertical load on the scoured pile s lateral responses obtained by considering and ignoring stress history effect is significant which should be taken into account for the analysis of the laterally loaded piles with vertical load under scour condition the current study is limited to the simplistic assumption of linear elastic behavior for the soil without consideration of the soil pile sliding mechanism and to the approximate allowance made through the reduction of the soil modulus by a certain factor to account for the gapping effect nevertheless the simplicity and relative ease of using the analytical model described in this paper make it still a good alternative approach for estimating the deflection and moment responses of the scoured pile foundations subjected to combined lateral and vertical loading at least a starting point from which more reasonable rigorous

23396,quantitative cfd model validation and inter model comparisons between ihfoam and ansys fluent were performed for pressures and forces on an elevated structure using a 1 10 physical model non breaking impulsive breaking and broken wave conditions at the structure s location were simulated in ihfoam and fluent the calculated time series of water surface elevation and horizontal and vertical pressures and forces were compared with the measured data we introduced the impulse of residual to quantify the variation of the force and pressure time series results indicated that the numerical models performed differently depending on the wave conditions even for the same initial set up non breaking wave simulations showed the best agreement with experimental data for both models while broken wave trials showed the largest deviations bottom pressures and vertical forces were less sensitive to wave breaking conditions results indicate that future benchmarking tests for an elevated structure must consider both horizontal and vertical forces due to various wave breaking conditions the accuracy of simulated wave shoaling and breaking processes played a key role in precisely calculating the forces and pressures on the structure and it was difficult for the cfd models to simulate the exact wave breaking conditions as the measurements keywords experiment ihfoam ansys fluent validation force pressure 1 introduction hurricanes and typhoons generate elevated surge levels and strong waves that can cause extensive damage to buildings and other coastal infrastructure especially those located in low lying coastal regions the history of recorded damage on buildings near the shoreline from past storms indicates that the intensity of storms and resulting damage has increased over the past 30 years emanuel 2005 for example the united states has been impacted by recent events such as hurricanes katrina 2005 ike 2008 and sandy 2012 the 2017 atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active and costliest seasons in recorded history to withstand the high surge levels and waves induced from hurricanes and typhoons structures are commonly elevated above grade this structural design is a common building type in regions of low elevation such as barrier islands on the east coast and gulf coast of the united states however the magnitude of damage is exacerbated in regions that are characterized by aging infrastructure and buildings that were built with outdated codes and standards especially as coastal regions are threatened by increasing storm intensity and global sea level rise e g mori et al 2013 retrofitting a structure is one option to mitigate damage during future storm events and thus increase the resilience of coastal communities however to effectively mitigate damage these techniques require precise predictions of the wave climate and the corresponding wave loads under various storm wave conditions estimation of wave forces on elevated structures is available through analytical solutions or empirical solutions based on physical experimental results previous studies have mostly focused on coastal infrastructure such as bridges and jetties rather than residential buildings kaplan 1992 and kaplan et al 1995 predicted the time history of impact loadings on offshore platforms and the wave impact force from large incident waves based on momentum flux cuomo et al 2007 conducted a 1 25 scale model test of wave forces on exposed jetties and developed new dimensionless predictive solutions cuomo et al 2009 also performed large scale 1 10 experiments on coastal highway bridges and determined the dynamics of wave loadings and the effects of openings in bridge decks based on this work they derived predictive methods for both quasi static and impulsive wave loads bradner et al 2011 investigated a 1 5 scale model of a reinforced concrete type coastal bridge superstructure they investigated the vertical and horizontal force for an array of wave heights periods and water levels and found that the vertical force could be greater than the horizontal force by a factor of four recently asce sei 2016 published minimum design standards for buildings as a design guideline for elevated structures including methodologies to calculate three wave loading types non breaking breaking and broken sections 5 4 2 to 5 4 5 fema 2011 also published a design manual for residential coastal dwellings which includes guidance on both horizontal and vertical wave forces similar to those presented in the asce standard however those theoretical approaches are limited in their applicability to real complex storm wave climates and the corresponding wave forces wiebe et al 2014 proposed an analytical solution to estimate the wave induced force on an elevated structure by modifying goda s pressure formulae for a caisson breakwater goda 1974 2010 to include the effects of various freeboard conditions air gap and wave climates they concluded that three types of breaking conditions yielded different aspects of horizontal wave force as function of wave height period and freeboard as an alternative method computational fluid dynamics cfd models have been widely developed and applied to estimate wave induced pressures and forces advances in recent years have been supported by an increase in computation power which allows more detailed calculations of the complex hydrodynamics associated with wave action however the performance of cfd models must be validated or verified through detailed comparisons with benchmark tests e g analytic solutions or physical experiments and difficulties of pressure and force calculations and their sensitivity to wave conditions were well reported by previous studies e g mokrani and abadie 2016 in case of the wave pressure forces on elevated structure many recent numerical studies have been performed with bridge decks xiao and huang 2008 jin and meng 2011 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 2015 seiffert et al 2015 wu et al 2016 and validated through the scaled physical experimental results they mostly utilized solitary or cnoidal waves with constant depth conditions for simple wave climate and focused on analyzing wave loads on coastal bridge decks recently do et al 2016 used the results of a 1 5 scale bridge experiment linton et al 2012 to validate the ansys fluent model ansys 2013 they then applied the model setup to a vertical wall using a solitary wave generally differences in wave impacts result from the three breaking types non breaking breaking and broken waves wave breaking is highly dependent on the wave characteristics e g wave height period and surge levels bathymetric and topographic conditions e g cross shore beach profile foreshore slope and presence or absence of offshore sandbars and dunes geometric conditions of the infrastructure e g community layout beach hardening are also important in particular the air gap or the distance from the water level to the lowest chord of the structure can significantly affect the magnitude of the wave impact force on the elevated structure e g wiebe et al 2014 park et al 2017 impulsive breaking waves wave slamming induce the highest horizontal forces on vertical walls e g bea et al 1999 linton et al 2012 however it is reported that the breaking wave itself could be separated into three phases such as early breaking late breaking and perfect breaking kirkgöz 1995 each phase creates a wave impact force of different magnitude therefore it is still a challenging task to model the various types of wave deformations over a sloping beach and to calculate the consequent wave pressure distributions and forces on elevated structures for various types of wave breaking conditions the goals of the present paper are to 1 validate two cfd models ihfoam and fluent with a scaled 1 10 experimental dataset of waves impacting an elevated structure park et al 2017 with a range of surge levels wave conditions and air gaps and 2 quantify the performance of the two models for the wave induced horizontal and vertical forces pressures on the elevated structure we compare the performance and sensitivity of the two cfd model results conditioned on the three different wave impact conditions non breaking breaking and broken in particular we compare the time series of the water surface elevations over the compound slope as well as the front and bottom pressures and vertical and horizontal force components on the elevated structure which was positioned on a flat region slightly inland of the compound slope section 2 introduces the overall setup of the experiment and dataset utilized in model validation including detailed instrumentation and test conditions section 3 introduces the two cfd models ihfoam and fluent and details of each cfd model setup section 4 presents an overview of the two cfd model results including the detailed validation process section 5 discusses the quantitative comparison of the two cfd models and the sensitivity of each model to different mesh size conditions in calculations of the water surface elevation pressure and force finally section 6 discusses the major conclusions of this work 2 experimental design the physical model tests were conducted at the large wave flume lwf at oregon state university s hinsdale wave research laboratory hwrl and are described in detail in park et al 2017 the tests are summarized here to provide a context for the numerical modeling in this work the experiment was designed to measure wave induced pressures horizontal forces and vertical forces separately on an elevated coastal structure experiments were performed with a constant water depth and bathymetry while varying the significant wave height and peak period for each test three different wave conditions were tested including regular periodic irregular random and transient tsunami like waves and the specimen was elevated to different air gap conditions to measure the horizontal and vertical wave forces on the structure the model data validations use the regular waves only 2 1 experimental setup a profile view sketch of the lwf including bathymetric conditions and wave gage locations is presented in fig 1 the length width and depth of the flume were 104 m 3 66 m and 4 6 m respectively with a piston type hydraulic actuator assembly wavemaker a compound slope was installed in the flume beginning 14 07 m from the wavemaker the first section was composed of a horizontal 3 64 m long slab with a 0 15 m height followed by a 10 98 m long section with a 1 11 slope giving a vertical rise of 0 99 m this steeper slope was followed by a 14 64 m long section with a 1 24 slope rising an additional 0 61 m and finally followed by a 36 60 m long flat section starting at x 43 33 m with a constant 1 75 m elevation the specimen which was based on a 1 10 length scale model of a residential coastal structure was designed to measure vertical and horizontal forces and pressures and was located at x 43 84 m 0 51 m landward from the start of the flat section fig 2 provides a detailed sketch of the instrumentation installed in the wave flume fig 2a is a detailed overhead view of wave flume showing the experimental specimen and nearby wave gauges three wire resistance wave gages were positioned at the beginning wg1 middle wg2 and end wg3 of the slope to capture the transformation as waves propagated along the sloping bathymetry fig 2b is a side view of the specimen a frame was utilized to hold the specimen in place at varying air gaps and to prevent lateral y direction motion the specimen has a box shape 1 02 m by 1 02 m square bottom with 0 61 m height and it represents an idealization of an elevated residential structure this specimen was designed to measure pressures on the front bottom and rear sides the rail connection to the frame system allowed the simultaneous independent measurements of the horizontal and vertical forces fig 2c depicts the front back bottom and top views of the specimen which show the locations of the 14 pressure gages and 5 load cells used in experiments all pressure gages and load cells recorded data at a frequency of 500 hz and data was filtered using a low pass filter for frequencies above 50 hz more details of the coordinate locations of instruments are available in park et al 2017 2 2 experimental wave conditions regular wave trials consisted of 10 different combinations of significant wave heights and peak periods to model storm wave conditions table 1 shows regular wave conditions measured at wg1 based on observations and video analysis of the wave impact on the structure we classify three types of wave impact conditions non breaking breaking and broken the non breaking impact is generally observed for relatively small wave heights and long wave period conditions the surface of sinusoidal wave transforms during the shoaling process approaching peaky asymmetric sine curves however wave breaking does not occur and thus the wave generates small run up at the specimen trials reg x1 x2 and x6 were classified as non breaking wave impact conditions the breaking wave condition is found when the shoaling wave height is over the breaking limits of depth or length e g h h 0 78 or h l 0 14 tanh kh the wave breaks near the specimen and creates a large jet of splashing water at the time of impact experimental trials reg x3 x7 and x8 are classified as breaking wave impact conditions lastly relatively higher wave height conditions result in the onset of wave breaking processes over the slope and show a decrease of wave height with air entrainment at the moment of impact reg x4 x5 x9 and x10 are classified as broken waves in these experiments the repeatability of wave maker and recording devices was tested and results are described in the physical model study by park et al 2017 for all trials the mean absolute error was 10 for pressure gages and less than 1 for water surface elevation gages for numerical model validation we choose three regular wave conditions reg x2 x8 and x4 which clearly show non breaking breaking and broken wave conditions at the time the wave reaches the specimen for each trial the breaking condition is verified based on both video recordings and pressure measurements on the specimen fig 3 provides snapshots from the video recordings of the wave interaction on the specimen for a reg x2 b reg x8 and c reg x4 in this study we consider the case in which the base of the structure was located at the still water level giving an air gap a equal to zero which was shown by park et al 2017 to induce the maximum vertical force 3 numerical model 3 1 model overview ihfoam and fluent the first cfd model utilized in this study is ihfoam 2 0 higuera et al 2013 which implemented a new solver and boundary conditions for wave generation and absorption ihfoam was developed in the open source platform of openfoam open field operation and manipulation openfoam solves the 3 d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for two incompressible phases using a finite volume discretization and the volume of fluid vof method it also supports several turbulence models such as κ ε κ ω sst and les the governing rans equation includes conservation of mass eq 1 and momentum eq 2 which are 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u μ e f f u p g x ρ u μ e f f where each vector u g and x is velocity acceleration of gravity and position respectively and each scalar p and μ eff is pseudo dynamic pressure and efficient dynamic viscosity which account for the molecular dynamic viscosity plus turbulent effects ihfoam 2017 the density ρ is calculated as ρ αρ water 1 α ρ air where α indicates the phase function given by 3 α t u α u c α 1 α in eq 3 u c is an artificial compression vector to preserve a sharp interface between air and water maza et al 2015 ihfoam utilizes a mixture of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms which is called pimple the main structure of pimple is inherited from the original piso but it allows equation under relaxation as in simple to ensure the convergence of all the equations at each time step ihfoam 2017 the performance of ihfoam was validated through several benchmark studies such as run up wave breaking higuera et al 2013 coastal structures higuera et al 2014 and 3 d oscillating water columns iturrioz et al 2015 the second cfd model is fluent a module in the ansys workbench to solve for the fluid flow fluent can interact with the mechanical module in ansys to solve the two way fluid structure interaction however this paper only focuses on one way fluid structure interaction by using the fluent module only therefore the structure can be assumed to be a rigid boundary condition during the analysis fluent inc 2005 the governing equations for volume of fluid vof model for multi phase problem solving in fluent are as below eqs 4 and 5 with the assumption that temperature remains unchanged during the analysis ansys 2009 the mass conservation equation is given as 4 1 ρ q t α q ρ q α q ρ q v q s 1 n m s q m q s where ρ q is the mass per unit volume of the phase q t is time is the differential operator v q is velocity vector of phase q α q is the volume fraction of phase q with s 1 n α q 1 m s q is mass transfer from phase s to phase q m q s is mass transfer from phase q to phase s and n is the number of phases the momentum conservation equation is used throughout the domain as 5 t ρ v ρ v v p μ v v t ρ g f where p is the static pressure and each ρ g and f are the gravitational and external body forces respectively and μ is the molecular viscosity in order to account for the turbulent effects realizable k ε model ansys 2009 was applied with the other two variables k turbulent kinetic energy and ε turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate in the next step implicit scheme is selected for discretize those governing equations and the pressure based coupled algorithm is obtained to solve the discretized equations for pressures velocities and other scalar equations 3 2 ihfoam model setup there are two mesh tools in openfoam blockmesh and snappyhexmesh the blockmesh tool creates the geometry of each block which is generally defined by 8 vertices and 6 boundary faces one at each corner of a hexahedron cube it requires information of the mesh vertices faces and correct numbering to generate the mesh thus relatively simple geometry conditions are preferred when using this tool however the snappyhexmesh tool generates 3 d meshes creating hexahedra and split hexahedra automatically from triangulated surface geometries given in stereolithography stl format so it supports the generation of mesh with complex geometry conditions in this study we utilize the blockmesh tool and generate a 1 1 scale model of the flume used for the physical model study including the specimen painted orange as shown in fig 3 but not the gray supporting frame with set of hexahedrons cubes we utilize a prism shaped block which is composed of 6 vertices and 4 boundary faces to reproduce the sloped bathymetry the piston type wavemaker is not directly modeled instead ihfoam allows users to choose various wave input conditions based on wave theory e g stokes solitary and irregular and wavemaker theory piston type flap type here we utilize the piston type wavemaker boundary condition inlet to replicate the wave input using the measured time series of displacement and free surface elevation at the wavemaker we assign the no slip wall boundary condition for both bottom slope and around the specimen and leave as an empty boundary the lateral walls the bathymetry of the flume was designed to dissipate waves through the natural beach at the end of the flume therefore we did not implement a radiation boundary condition or sponge layer at the end of the flume so that our simulation would replicate the conditions in the physical model both the water and air phases were simulated with density ρ set to 998 kg m3 and 1 20 kg m3 respectively and kinematic viscosity ν set to 1 0 10 6 m2 s and 1 48 10 5 m2 s respectively we utilized the default solver setups described in the ihfoam example ihfoam 2017 and both the κ ε and the κ ω sst turbulence equations were considered the default parameters of k ε e g launder and sharma 1974 and κ ω sst turbulence models wilcox 2008 were utilized in this study and we utilize k ε equations in the final validation results the sketch of the numerically modeled 3 d wave flume is presented in fig 4 a we treat the specimen and frame as located at the center of the flume and cut the flume in half in the y direction to reduce computation time three different sized meshes coarse m1 medium m2 and fine m3 were utilized in this study each of which had a variable mesh size depending on the location in the flume fig 4b and c show the sketches of the front and top views of the flume giving detailed information for the fine mesh size m3 and showing the variation in the mesh size in the flume the finest mesh 0 02 m on the x axis was concentrated near the specimen l1 and the finest mesh 0 02 0 025 m on z axis was around the region of the free surface elevation z2 and z3 to capture the non linear wave deformation including shoaling reflection and breaking processes during propagation over the slope we set the mesh size at 0 02 m at the specimen on the y axis and gradually increased the mesh size to 0 05 m at the lateral wall of the flume the smallest mesh sizes for m1 and m2 were 0 08 and 0 04 m respectively and the maximum mesh size for both configurations was limited to 0 2 m the total number of grid elements increased by 2 6 times from m1 to m2 and by 6 2 times from m1 to m3 table 2 summarizes the mesh types and lists the total number of elements utilized in each of the mesh types regular wave conditions were simulated for a duration of 50 s through a single desktop with i7 4770 3 4 ghz and 64g ram with 4 core parallel since we have set the maximum courant number co to 0 5 for all model runs different computation times were required for the different wave hydrodynamic conditions the average computation times for a 4 core computer are 1 1 15 2 and 127 2 h for the m1 m2 and m3 meshes generally the computation time increased by roughly 1 3 times for the breaking condition reg x8 and 1 9 times for the broken wave condition reg x4 compared to the non breaking wave calculations reg x2 the sampling rate and filtering of output results surface elevation pressure or forces for model validation is also a critical issue for the pressure and force comparison we utilize the function probes which is added at the end of the controldict text file that sets the simulation time and data input output control in openfoam the probes function allows us to extract any calculated values e g velocity pressure k and ε at the specific x y and z location with a varying frequency we apply the probes function for the 14 pressure gages and 9 wave gages and extract each datum with the same time of model calculation to set up the wave gages in ihfoam we define a series of x y and z points along the z axis with 0 02 m resolution at each wave gage location to obtain the surface elevation result we take the sum of all α values along the z axis at each wave gage location and multiply by the resolution 0 02 m here α is defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell thus if α 1 the cell is full of water and if α 0 the cell is full of air to estimate the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the front and bottom faces of the specimen respectively we set up a different patch for each the front and the bottom face in the blockmeshdict and then applied libforces so which is the intrinsic function implemented in openfoam to extract corresponding forces at a given patch wall with three cartesian directions to validate the performance of libforces so we compared the results of libforces so to the integrated force interpolated from multi pressure points 36 at the front and bottom with normal direction and they showed good agreement fig a1 in the appendix provides the computation frequencies of m1 m2 and m3 during the 20 50 s simulation as we mentioned earlier the extraction time of all surface elevation pressure and force data is the same as the computation time step fig a1 and the computation time is governed by designating a maximum courant number co 0 5 which varies depending on the velocity and size of mesh the computation time step is small enough to compare with the measurements and ranges from 300 hz to 1000 hz at the moment of wave impact for the non breaking wave condition m3 although the measurement results were processed using a low pass filter for frequencies more than 50 hz park et al 2017 the ihfoam results do not include any filtering in this study because there is essentially no noise in the ihfoam pressure and force results due to extremely small frequency components 3 3 fluent model setup because of symmetry one half of the wave flume and the specimen were modeled in fluent as was done in ihfoam the specimen was modeled as fixed walls meaning no dynamic effects were considered for the box during analysis all wall boundaries were assumed split free a multiphase volume of fluid model was employed to model water and air phases the realizable k ε viscous model was selected for the solver by adding a new turbulent viscosity formulation and dissipation rate transport equation this realizable k ε model is more accurately predicted for both planar and round jets compared to the standard k ε model ansys 2009 an enhanced wall treatment function was introduced for the near wall region by blending the laminar and turbulent law and combining with the reliable k ε model to produce better results for this type of problem ansys 2009 output time steps were controlled by a courant number of 0 5 the convergence criteria for continuity and velocity components was 1e 6 calculations for κ ε and the volume fraction were defined to converge at 1e 3 or repeated for a maximum 50 iterations at which point the analysis continued for computational efficiency an advantage of fluent is that the wavemaker can be treated as the moving boundary at the inlet so that the numerical flume has the same boundary conditions as the physical wave flume with the piston type wavemaker the displacement of the physical wavemaker was recorded during the experiments and was used as the input for the numerical wave flume remeshing every time step was necessary for the area close to the inlet boundary to remain consistent with the initial element size with a split and collapse factor of 0 4 the wave gauges were modeled by creating flat column with a height equal to that of the wave flume and width of 0 05 m at the wave gauge locations as shown in fig 5 a wave height was measured by integrating the water phase then dividing by the width of the column this technique works well with a solid wave but typically underestimates the splash compared to regular string wave gauges wg or ultrasonic wave gauges uswg pressures were collected by creating points at pressure gauge pg locations along the sides of the box as shown in fig 5b pg1 to pg9 represent pressure on the front side of the box and pg11 to pg14 represent the pressure at the bottom of the box the total horizontal and vertical forces were computed from the drag and lift coefficient at all faces of the box divided by the reference values for comparison with ihfoam the mesh configurations also should be consistent the cut cell mesh method was used to obtain the maximum number of square blocks which have the best element quality the overall minimum and maximum element size was set to be 0 02 m 0 16 m element size increased the block edge by a factor of two from fine resolution m3 to medium resolution m2 and from medium resolution to coarse resolution m3 as shown in table 3 the total number of elements increased by a factor of 2 7 from m1 to m2 and by a factor of 6 3 from m1 to m3 to evaluate the element quality of the m3 mesh the average element orthogonal quality ranging from 0 to 1 closer to 1 is better was determined as 0 99 with a minimum of 0 18 the average skewness ranging from 0 to 1 closer to 0 is better is 1 5e 3 with maximum of 0 81 the average computation times for the three cases run on a 12 core computer node in the linux system two intel xeon e5 2640 2 5 ghz are 16 7 61 5 and 176 3 h for the m1 m2 and m3 meshes respectively by comparing tables 2 and 3 we can see that the number of mesh elements for ihfoam and fluent were similar and vary by less than 5 for each of the mesh configurations however each model shows significantly different times of total computation those differences are somewhat expected because we could not perform both ihfoam and fluent runs under the exact same conditions such as solvers numerical schemes parallelization tool and computational resources in this study ihfoam has a relatively shorter computation time than fluent for m2 and m3 and a much shorter computation time for the coarse mesh condition m1 4 validations and comparisons of numerical models in section 4 1 we will present 3 d snapshots of modeling results for the three wave conditions in sections 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 we provide a detailed comparison of the numerically modelled water surface elevation and pressure gauge time series to the experimental data at six wave gages wg2 wg3 uswg2 uswg4 uswg5 and uswg6 and six pressure gages press1 press3 press6 press11 press12 and press14 for all wave conditions we also compare the time series of the horizontal and vertical forces measured from five load cells on the specimen to the numerically modelled results note that wg2 and wg3 were located at the middle and end of the slope respectively to capture wave shoaling and breaking and uswg 2 4 5 and 6 were positioned on the flat region to capture wave deformation around the specimen fig 2a the three ultrasonic wave gages uswg were offset 0 53 m from the wall with uswg2 uswg6 and uswg5 positioned in front at the middle and behind the specimen respectively uswg4 was also located behind the specimen but 1 83 m offset from the wall fig 2a for comparisons of pressure time series press6 press3 and press1 were located on the front face of the specimen and press11 press12 and press14 were located on the bottom of the specimen fig 2c 4 1 overview results of ihfoam and fluent figs 6 and 7 provide snapshots of the water surface field given by ihfaom and fluent modeling at four time steps including at the time of wave impact panels a b c and d in each figure show the non breaking wave condition panels e f g and h show the breaking wave condition and panels i j k and l show the broken wave condition for ihfoam fig 6 a e and i show the wave surface about 1 5 s before the impact on the specimen and each wave is a different shape depending on input conditions fig 6 c g and k include the detailed figures for non breaking breaking and broken wave impacts on the front of the specimen the frontal distributions of α for both non breaking and breaking waves are uniform while the broken wave impact shows an irregular distribution of α due to air entrapment when the comparing model output with the recorded videos of experiments we observed that the ihfoam results for the breaking and broken wave conditions tend to be less developed than waves generated in experiments i e numerical waves were not quite impulsively breaking or broke closer to the structure than experimental breaking and broken waves respectively thus the numerical model results showed relatively less splash for the breaking wave conditions and more splash for the broken wave conditions fig 7 shows the same time range as fig 6 for the three wave conditions modeled by fluent in 2d contours we can observe the highest wave height for the breaking wave condition fig 7e a smaller wave height for the non breaking wave condition fig 7a and the lowest wave height for the broken wave condition fig 7i by inspecting fig 7 c g and k we can see that at the time of impact the breaking condition fig 7g shows the strongest water splash on the structure followed by the non breaking and then the broken wave condition respectively 4 2 nonbreaking wave reg x2 fig 8 shows the model validation of the water surface elevation for the non breaking wave reg x2 condition we compared the time series of water surface elevation at six wave gages from 20 to 50 s of the experimental simulation time which includes the first regular wave impacting the specimen and 7 continuous regular waves as waves propagate toward the specimen their shapes transform and steepen from wg2 to uswg2 overall the wave heights increase due to shoaling effects and they are almost near breaking at uswg2 after waves pass the specimen they keep the steep waveform but in general wave heights decrease generally both ihfoam and fluent results show excellent agreement to the measured surface elevation but both models slightly underestimate the positive surface elevation and show relatively high deviations at uswg4 and uswg5 which are located behind of the specimen one interesting feature is that the first four waves of both ihfoam and fluent show excellent agreement at most of the wave gages but the models begin to show larger deviations for subsequent waves especially at wg3 uswg4 and uswg6 these disagreements could come from the effects of wave reflection from the specimen and sidewalls or from wave structure interaction which the numerical model cannot capture well due to the rigid body assumption fig 9 shows the model validation of the non breaking wave condition for the front pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press6 a press3 c and press1 e and show the corresponding detailed time series t 32 35 s at each pressure gage b d and f generally both ihfoam and fluent match well with the measured peak pressures but ihfoam slightly underestimates the peak at press6 while fluent underestimates the peak at press3 and press1 the overall pattern of pressure distribution at the time of impact shows good agreement except for instances where the experimental gages recorded negative pressures which are found at press3 and press6 it is interesting to note that only press3 and press6 recorded negative pressures among whole time span of the three wave gages negative pressures were also observed press3 for the breaking wave condition reg x8 but were not observed at any pressure gage for the broken wave condition reg x4 as seen in figs 12 and 16 this phenomenon could be caused by the large jet of splashing water that is projected upward at the time of wave impact but the current mesh size 0 02 m is not small enough to capture it the largest peak pressure is recorded at t 33 s for both the measurement and calculations which is the time of impact of the first wave whose wave height is equivalent to our input condition 0 2 m at wg1 fig 9b d and f show the detailed time series of pressure near the time of the largest peak pressure a reduction in peak pressures at all gages was observed for subsequent wave impacts t 33 s for both calculated and measured data this pressure reduction occurs despite the observed surface elevation at uswg2 recording similar wave heights for subsequent waves t 33 s the maximum reduction of peak pressure is observed at press6 decreasing from 2 3 kpa to 1 0 kpa this reduction highlights that even minor changes of water surface elevation resulted in large peak pressure changes in this case by over a factor 2 for both calculated and measured data fig 10 shows the model validation of the non breaking wave condition reg x2 for the bottom pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press11 a press12 c and press14 e and show the corresponding detailed time series of pressure for one wave b d and f both ihfoam and fluent results could not capture the large peaky pressures at the time of impact but both models captured the pattern of pressure distributions well the short peaky pressures at the time of wave impact had a relatively short frequency 20 hz and may require much finer mesh for the numerical model simulation to capture in addition negative pressures are observed in both experimentally measured and numerically modeled results relatively large negative pressures are observed at press11 with smaller negative pressures at press12 non negative pressures are seen at press14 for both measured data and ihfoam but they are not clearly found in fluent each pressure gage recorded a uniquely shaped time series of pressure depending on its location and both models capture this variation well for each pressure gage the major difference between the two models when compared with the measurement is that ihfoam results calculate a similar peak pressure distribution after t 30 s of simulation time for all gages but fluent either could not capture the peak pressure or modeled a relatively smaller peak especially at press12 fig 10d and press14 fig 10e generally the fluent results underestimated the peak pressure compared to the ihfoam results fig 11 shows the model validation of the horizontal force and vertical force for the reg x2 wave condition overall the ihfoam outputs show good agreement with the measurements for both the peak and pattern of wave forces and fluent outputs show a slight overestimation of the horizontal force the measurement results show a clear damping of forces after wave impacts especially for higher peak forces t 33 and 37 s but those damping effects decrease as the magnitude of the peak force decreases t 41 45 and 49 s in contrast ihfoam and fluent results do not predict any damping effects on forces because of the rigid body assumption applied in the calculation comparing modelled and measured vertical forces we observe that the overall shape of forces and the peaks generally match while ihfoam shows some deviation at the tail of each wave impact especially for negative forces after wave impact even though we could not capture the peaky pressures recorded by bottom pressure gages fig 10 these deviations did not result in a significant difference in the vertical force comparison for both ihfoam and fluent 4 3 breaking wave reg x8 fig 12 shows the model validation for the breaking wave condition reg x8 for water surface elevation both ihfoam and fluent results match well with the measured data at wg2 fig 11a but calculated data show some deviations to the measurements at the other wave gages generally both ihfoam and fluent results underestimate wave height at wg3 and uswg2 to be specific ihfoam results underestimate wave heights at wg3 after t 35 s and at uswg2 after t 40 s these differences propagate to the other wave gages located behind the specimen fluent outputs show relatively better agreement at wg3 however fluent also underestimates wave height at uswg2 after t 37 s these patterns are similar to what we observed for the non breaking wave condition in that the numerical results showed good agreement to the measurements until the wave height reached the target wave height 0 35 m at wg1 however once the experimental waves developed to fully breaking e g after t 35 s at uswg3 both model results match experimental results relatively poorly as a given wave passes the specimen the wave height generally decreases due to energy loss from wave breaking and wave impact ihfoam results show better agreement to the measured data while fluent results underestimate the wave height at uswg5 and uswg6 also a slight phase shift is observed at uswg2 uswg5 and uswg6 in ihfoam which is not seen for the non breaking condition or for fluent data the change in wave heights from wg2 to uswg2 indicate the effects of wave shoaling and breaking processes over the compound slope we observe that the wave height decreases slightly from wg2 to uswg2 in the measured data ihfoam wave heights are almost same or have slightly increased while fluent wave heights have clearly decreased between the two wave gages ihfoam shows better agreement to the measured data after the specimen at uswg5 and uswg6 while fluent results underestimate wave height at these locations upon careful observation of both the experimental and numerical model results including the snapshots in figs 6 and 7 we conclude that ihfoam waves tend to break later than the experimental data while waves output by fluent tend to break earlier along the compound slope compared with the measured data overall we find that both ihfoam and fluent results differ from the experimentally measured data however they show opposite patterns of deviation with ihfoam waves breaking later and fluent waves breaking earlier than experimental data deviations between modeled and measured wave heights are larger for the breaking wave condition than for the non breaking wave condition errors may be induced due to the limitations of the current numerical models setups e g mesh default solver or turbulence model and the complexity in simulating wave structure interaction and wall or specimen induced reflection effects fig 13 shows the model validation for the breaking wave reg x8 condition for the front pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press6 a press3 c and press1 e and show the detailed time series of pressure for t 33 36 s b d and f the overall patterns of pressure impact times at each gage show good agreement for both models however the ihfoam results underestimate the front pressure compared to fluent and both models show larger deviations from the measurement for the upper pressure gage especially at press6 fig 13a the underestimations of pressure in ihfoam and fluent are somewhat expected based on the underestimation of wave height at wg3 and uswg2 seen in fig 12 generally ihfoam results indicate a weaker plunging type of wave breaking at the specimen compared to the experimental measurements consequently the numerical model significantly underestimates the peak pressure at press6 fluent results also underestimate the frontal pressure but show relatively better agreement to the measurement for their peak pressure outputs still fluent cannot capture the peak pressures in addition as was seen for the non breaking reg x2 case negative pressures are measured at press3 and both ihfoam and fluent could not capture these negative pressures the largest peak pressure was recorded at t 33 s at press6 which is the impact time of the first wave whose wave height was equal to the intended wave height both model results predicted the largest peak pressure for this wave fig 14 shows the model validation of breaking wave condition for bottom pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press11 a press12 c and press14 e and show the detailed time series near the maximum peak pressure b d and f overall both ihfoam and fluent results show good agreement with the measurement frontal peaky pressures are observed for all measured data ihfoam outputs did not capture the first short peaks e g at t 33 9 s in fig 14b however it captures well the secondary peak pressure e g at t 34 2 s in fig 14b fluent results capture relatively well the first peak pressure but could not capture the secondary peak pressure overall the absolute peak pressure for each wave is similar to the measurement but each model shows different pressure distributions for the vertical pressures as the pressure gages move from the leading edge press11 to the trailing edge press14 of the specimen the peak pressure tends to decrease and the expanse of the positive pressure region increases in addition ihfoam results show a phase shift at press14 similar to the phase shift for the water surface elevation that we observed at uswg5 and uswg6 fig 11e and f fig 15 shows the model validation of the horizontal force and vertical force for the reg x8 wave condition overall ihfoam results underestimate the experimentally measured horizontal force but show better agreement to the measured vertical force fluent shows better agreement to the measurement for the horizontal forces but greater deviation from the measured vertical forces generally the characteristics of the wave at the moment of impact significantly affect the magnitude of the horizontal force to specify ihfoam results show good agreement to the measurement for both horizontal and vertical forces at t 31 s however ihfoam significantly underestimates the horizontal force for the following waves while the vertical force shows slightly uniform results after t 31 s for both ihfoam and measurement upon careful observation of both the experimental and ihfoam model results we find that the plunging shape of the wave as it impacted the front face of the specimen in ihfoam was not same as the shape of the experimental wave the measurement shows clear plunging impact on the specimen while ihfoam did not a show fully developed plunging wave impact this difference in wave shape causes the underestimation of the front pressure and horizontal force after t 34 s in addition both model results were unable to capture the horizontal force measured at the impact including the inertial force on the specimen which consequently effected the underestimation of the horizontal force we also observe clear damping effects in the measured horizontal force after the wave impact while there are no oscillations in either model result relatively small damping effects are observed for the vertical force and each vertical force is generally uniform in summary we can conclude that the horizontal force is sensitive to the shape of the breaking wave in the numerical model results while the vertical force is less sensitive to the breaking wave shape hence numerical outputs of vertical force show good agreement to the measurement 4 4 broken wave reg x4 a5 fig 16 shows the model validation of the free surface for the broken waves generally ihfoam results show good agreement with measurement capturing the shoaling and breaking processes recorded in the experiment for first four waves before 35 s at uswg2 however it overestimates the water surface elevation at uswg2 5 and 6 for subsequent waves after 35 s at uswg2 and we observe a slight phase shift in ihfoam water surface outputs fluent tends to underestimate the water surface elevation at most of wave gages except at uswg5 and fluent results show a similar phase shift compared with the experimental measurements the different aspects of the water surface elevation between two models especially at wg3 and uswg2 indicate that ihfoam and fluent each undergo different wave shoaling and breaking calculations these calculations are dependent on each model s inherent differences or set up preferences which we cannot define in exactly the same way for this study e g default model setups numerical solvers and schemes ihfoam waves tended to break later compared with measured results in that the numerically modelled results indicated that the wave broke closer to the front of the specimen compared to the measurement in contrast waves modelled by fluent tended to break sooner than the measured data in summary ihfoam overestimate the water surface elevations while fluent underestimates the water surface elevations associated with broken waves these trends propagate through in comparisons between the experimental and numerical pressure and force data fig 17 shows the model validation of the front pressure gages for the broken waves we compare the time series of pressure at press6 a press3 c and press1 e and show the detailed time series of pressure between t 31 34 s b d and f in general ihfoam results overestimate the frontal pressure after t 36 s while fluent results tend to underestimate the pressures for the entire time series the deviations of both model results from measurements were somewhat expected based on the comparison of water surface elevation results at wg3 and uswg2 fig 16b and c ihfoam results show that the wave broke closer to the front of the specimen compared to the measurement while fluent results show that the wave broke further offshore of the specimen compared to the measurement thus ihfoam results produced higher wave heights at uswg2 and higher front pressures than the measurement while fluent results produced lower wave heights at uswg2 and smaller front pressures fig 18 shows the model validation of the bottom pressure gages for broken waves we compare the time series of pressure at press11 a press12 c and press14 e and detailed time series of pressure between t 31 34 s b d and f generally bottom pressure results given by the models show better agreement to measurements than front pressures still we observe a similar pattern to the horizontal pressure validation in that ihfoam results overestimate pressure at press11 and fluent results underestimate pressure at press 11 12 and 14 fewer short peaky pressures were observed in the measurement for reg x4 and pressures generally decrease as the wave passes by the specimen similar to the reg x8 condition in addition both ihfoam and fluent results show phase shifts at press12 and 14 these are related to the phase shifts of water surface elevations that we observed for both models at uswg5 and 6 fig 16e and f fig 19 shows the model validation of the horizontal force and vertical force for the reg x4 wave condition generally ihfoam overestimates both the horizontal and vertical forces as was observed in comparisons of both the front and bottom pressures while fluent shows good agreement to the measurements one explanation for this large difference in pressure but relatively small difference in the force is that the bore type wave randomly impacts the front of the structure creating wet and dry conditions that are not the same in the physical and numerical models consequently peak pressures do not all occur at the same time therefore the magnitude of the peak pressure could vary significantly depending on location of interest on the structure and any peak pressure at a point provides a relatively small contribution to the total force for example the maximum horizontal force in ihfoam is greater than the measurement by a factor of 2 at t 40 s while the numerically output front pressure is greater than the measured by a factor of 5 at press6 the observed points considered in comparisons with measurements press1 3 and 6 could not capture the complete pattern of the pressure distribution and the corresponding horizontal force of the bore type wave 5 cfd model residual comparison and sensitivity test 5 1 residual comparison of two cfd models time series comparisons between ihfoam fluent and measured free surface elevations pressure time series and force time series were performed in previous section note that both the peak value and duration of wave induced pressures forces are important factors that can affect structural damage e g bullock et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to determine the uncertainty not only in the peak pressure but also throughout the time series of a given wave impact to quantify the uncertainty of time series data we determine the residual between the calculations and measurements residual r measurement calculation fig 20 shows an example of the measured and calculated pressure and the resulting r using ihfoam with 0 01 s resolution for the three wave conditions a negative residual indicates overestimation by the model to quantify the residuals over a given time duration we integrate the absolute value of residual over the time domain 6 j r t 1 t 2 r d t where j r is the impulse of absolute residual at the specific time range from t 1 to t 2 we choose t 1 and t 2 as the simulation time of numerical model 50 s but we exclude the initial three waves for ramp up which do not satisfy our input condition thus t 1 is the time at which the fourth wave reaches uswg2 and t 2 is the time at which the next four waves have propagated past uswg2 for example we observe the fourth wave of reg x2 at uswg2 at t 32 s therefore t 1 is 32 s and t 2 is 48 s 32 s 4 waves 4 s wave period note that the wave period in both reg x2 and reg x4 is 4 s and the wave period in trial reg x8 is 3 5 s we normalize j r with the impulse of absolute force or force per unit area pressure given by 7 j x t 1 t 2 x d t where j x is the impulse of force or force per unit area pressure at the specific range of time finally the normalized form of ratio of impulse r j is represented as 8 r j j r j x fig 21 shows the ihfoam results of the ratio of impulse for all front and bottom pressure gages and horizontal and vertical forces for the three wave conditions considered each filled and void symbol indicates the results of pressure and force and each red circle blue square and black triangle indicates the results of non breaking reg x2 breaking reg x8 and broken wave conditions reg x4 respectively generally the highest r j is observed for the broken wave condition and the smallest r j is observed for the non breaking wave condition as observed in section 4 the best agreement between measured and calculated pressure f h and f v is found for the non breaking wave condition in addition a relatively larger r j is observed at lower frontal pressure gages e g at press1 for all three wave conditions non breaking wave conditions also show the smallest r j for bottom pressures however for this wave condition the ratio of impulse is larger for bottom pressures than for front pressures the calculated r j values for the bottom pressures in the breaking and broken wave conditions were relatively more consistent than those calculated for frontal pressures except at press11 we can conclude that the horizontal force and frontal pressures are more sensitive to the wave breaking condition than the vertical force and bottom pressures the residual of surface elevation is also evaluated in a similar manner but we find that generally the r j for surface elevation is a factor 10 3 smaller than the pressure and force results note that because of the definitions used in eq 6 8 particularly the time intervals used the resultant r j is not a direct measure of the absolute error in the model so r j 0 01 should not be interpreted as an error of 1 however since the time intervals are the same for all comparisons in this section the values can be used to show the relative errors between the computed outputs of pressure and force and between the two numerical models e g comparing figs 21 and 22 in a similar manner we perform the quantitative comparison for fluent fig 22 shows the ratio of impulse for fluent results of all pressure gages except for the rear gage press10 and horizontal and vertical forces for the three wave conditions similar to ihfoam results the highest r j is in general observed for the broken wave condition and the smallest r j is observed for the non breaking wave condition also a relatively larger r j is observed at lower frontal pressure gages e g at press1 for all three wave conditions however fluent results show the highest r j for both horizontal and vertical forces at the breaking wave condition in contrast the r j for both non breaking and broken wave conditions are similar and significantly smaller than that calculated for the breaking wave condition this pattern follows our observation in fig 19 that fluent results showed good agreement to the measurement for the both horizontal and vertical forces for the broken wave condition even though the frontal pressures show a higher r j at the bottommost pressure gages for broken wave condition both ihfoam and fluent results show a relatively smaller r j for the total horizontal force 5 2 sensitivity of mesh size ihfoam the three mesh resolutions m1 m2 and m3 described in section 3 were tested with ihfoam for the three wave conditions to evaluate the sensitivity of outputs of water surface elevation pressure and forces to mesh size fig 23 shows the comparison of water surface elevation results at two representative wave gages fig 23a and b show the comparison of results at wg2 and uswg2 for the non breaking wave condition fig 23c and d show the comparison of results at wg2 and uswg2 for the breaking wave condition and fig 23e and f show the comparison of results at wg2 and uswg2 for the broken wave condition line colors indicate results of the measurement solid black m1 red dash dot m2 blue dot and m3 black dash results generally the peak and shape of each mesh condition show similar results among the three mesh conditions while m1 shows relatively smaller wave heights compared with the other two relatively small differences between modelled and measured water surface elevations are observed for all three mesh conditions at wg2 and larger deviations are observed at the peak and tail of the water surface elevation time series at uswg2 which was located closer to the specimen the detailed comparisons of the front and bottom pressures are shown in fig 24 we focus on the same time duration of the fourth wave impacting the structure that was used for the pressure comparisons in section 4 fig 24a and b show the comparison of results for the non breaking wave at press2 and press12 fig 24c and d show the comparison of results for the breaking wave at press2 and press12 and fig 24e and f show the comparison of results for the broken wave at press2 and press12 all mesh sizes m1 m2 and m3 show a similarly shaped nonbreaking wave induced pressure distribution for front and bottom gages the finest mesh produces relatively higher pressure outputs over the duration of the wave and also shows slightly shorter duration of pressure compared to the two coarser mesh conditions for the breaking wave condition m1 clearly underestimates the pressure for both front and bottom pressures compared with the other two mesh conditions for the broken wave condition both and m2 and m3 capture the frontal peak pressure while m1 could not capture it generally all mesh resolutions tested show similar results for bottom pressure the detailed comparisons of pressures at representative gages provide the complete temporal pattern of pressure distributions and indicate the sensitivity of pressure outputs to different mesh sizes however it is difficult to compare outputs at all pressure gages in the experiment therefore the conclusion we have made here may not represent all pressure characteristics of mesh dependence and they could generate biased results due to systematic errors for example at pressure gages located lower on the structure for better quantitative comparison of the sensitivity of mesh sizes we apply the ratio of residual impulse r j to evaluate mesh sensitivity fig 25 shows r j of the three mesh conditions determined for a non breaking b breaking and c broken wave conditions each red circle blue triangle and black square represents the r j from m1 m2 and m3 for the non breaking wave condition fig 25a r j for all pressure gages is less than 0 01 overall there are minor differences among three mesh conditions with m3 showing a slightly smaller r j for all pressures and horizontal force m3 results clearly show the lowest r j for all bottom pressures but not for the vertical force for the breaking wave condition the overall r j is less than 0 015 m2 and m3 results show similar r j values while m1 results show higher r j for front pressures all mesh conditions show a similar r j for the horizontal force as in the non breaking condition m3 results clearly show a smaller r j for bottom pressures but not for vertical force broken wave trials resulted in a much higher rj than other wave conditions at pressure gages but not at the load cell to be specific the difference between the m1 and m3 condition is a factor of 1 7 at press2 we can also observe a decrease of r j with elevation above the base of the structure from press1 to press9 for all mesh conditions this reduction makes sense in the context of the major contact area of bore type waves on the specimen the deviation observed for the broken wave condition is especially large for coarser mesh m1 simulations which could result from the difficulty in simulating the same conditions of air entrainment and water and air density at the time of wave impact although there are relatively higher r j values for front pressures the ratios of residual impulses for the horizontal force for all three meshes are quite small bottom pressures show a similar pattern to front pressures finer mesh results in a smaller r j and a higher r j is observed at press11 with a sharp decrease moving inland from press11 to press14 in general the horizontal and vertical forces are less sensitive to mesh size for all wave conditions while front and bottom pressures show the significant sensitivity to mesh size especially for the broken wave condition this result is meaningful when considering cfd modeling for the structural design because the total forces are less sensitive to mesh and wave conditions than pressure gages thus significant computational expense may be saved by using a coarser mesh resolution in a cfd model while still achieving a reliable estimate of the total force 6 conclusions and discussion the validation of two cfd models for the wave induced force on an elevated structure were performed including quantitative comparisons of pressures and forces to experimentally measured data we simulated ihfoam and fluent for three regular wave conditions which generated non breaking breaking and broken wave impacts on the structure the following general conclusions were found from this study 1 the performance of numerical models varied depending on the wave condition for the same cfd model set up non breaking wave conditions generally showed the best agreement for both fluent and ihfoam results and the broken wave conditions showed the worst agreement 2 generally the free surface comparisons were excellent for both the ihfoam and fluent models and horizontal and vertical forces of both models showed better agreement to the measured data despite calculated pressures showing relatively high deviations from the short peaky pressures recorded in the measurement 3 front pressures and horizontal forces were sensitive to wave breaking types while bottom pressures and vertical forces were less sensitive this result highlights that numerical model benchmark tests for wave loads on an elevated structure should include both horizontal force frontal pressures and vertical force bottom pressures 4 in general as one would anticipate a finer mesh provided improved numerical simulation results and non breaking and breaking wave impacts showed minor sensitivity to mesh size broken wave results are significantly sensitive to the mesh conditions ihfoam 5 the horizontal and vertical force were less sensitive to mesh size for all wave conditions this result is meaningful when considering cfd modeling for structural design because the total force is less sensitive to mesh and wave conditions than the pressure gages significant computational expense may be saved by using a coarser mesh resolution in a cfd model while still achieving a reliable estimate of the total force as noted earlier we applied the same turbulence coefficient for the κ ε turbulence model in both ihfaom and fluent for model consistency in the ihfoam model we also tested the simulation using the κ ω sst turbulence model wilcox 2008 and compared the two model results both turbulence models generate slightly different aspects of wave deformation during propagation over the slope but yield significant differences in pressure and force calculations the difference in results from the respective turbulence models was similar to that observed between ihfoam and fluent using the κ ε model when using κ ω sst in ihfoam the simulated wave tends to shoal and break further offshore over the sloped bathymetry consequently κ ω sst results slightly overestimated pressures and forces for non breaking waves and underestimated the measurement for both breaking and broken wave conditions however as observed in section 4 the results of the κ ε model show good agreement with non breaking wave induced pressures and forces while tending to underestimate those produced by breaking waves and overestimate those produced by broken waves the courant number co is also a significant variable for model stability and computation time we set a constant co 0 5 as the default for both ihfoam and fluent simulations but evaluate the sensitivity of co by applying various co such as co 1 0 0 5 0 25 and 0 1 for m2 in ihfoam the results show that the computation time increased as co decreased this is expected but there are not even minor changes of surface elevation pressure and forces for all three wave conditions in ihfoam therefore the computation time step utilized in the model co 1 0 was small enough to achieve the highest resolution for the current model set up this result implies that other disagreements between modeled and measured data such as the negative pressure fig 9 and short peaky pressures at bottom face of the specimen e g fig 10 were not induced from computation time parameters as a future work we will evaluate the effects of finer mesh 0 01 m and different turbulence models e g les for model

23396,quantitative cfd model validation and inter model comparisons between ihfoam and ansys fluent were performed for pressures and forces on an elevated structure using a 1 10 physical model non breaking impulsive breaking and broken wave conditions at the structure s location were simulated in ihfoam and fluent the calculated time series of water surface elevation and horizontal and vertical pressures and forces were compared with the measured data we introduced the impulse of residual to quantify the variation of the force and pressure time series results indicated that the numerical models performed differently depending on the wave conditions even for the same initial set up non breaking wave simulations showed the best agreement with experimental data for both models while broken wave trials showed the largest deviations bottom pressures and vertical forces were less sensitive to wave breaking conditions results indicate that future benchmarking tests for an elevated structure must consider both horizontal and vertical forces due to various wave breaking conditions the accuracy of simulated wave shoaling and breaking processes played a key role in precisely calculating the forces and pressures on the structure and it was difficult for the cfd models to simulate the exact wave breaking conditions as the measurements keywords experiment ihfoam ansys fluent validation force pressure 1 introduction hurricanes and typhoons generate elevated surge levels and strong waves that can cause extensive damage to buildings and other coastal infrastructure especially those located in low lying coastal regions the history of recorded damage on buildings near the shoreline from past storms indicates that the intensity of storms and resulting damage has increased over the past 30 years emanuel 2005 for example the united states has been impacted by recent events such as hurricanes katrina 2005 ike 2008 and sandy 2012 the 2017 atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active and costliest seasons in recorded history to withstand the high surge levels and waves induced from hurricanes and typhoons structures are commonly elevated above grade this structural design is a common building type in regions of low elevation such as barrier islands on the east coast and gulf coast of the united states however the magnitude of damage is exacerbated in regions that are characterized by aging infrastructure and buildings that were built with outdated codes and standards especially as coastal regions are threatened by increasing storm intensity and global sea level rise e g mori et al 2013 retrofitting a structure is one option to mitigate damage during future storm events and thus increase the resilience of coastal communities however to effectively mitigate damage these techniques require precise predictions of the wave climate and the corresponding wave loads under various storm wave conditions estimation of wave forces on elevated structures is available through analytical solutions or empirical solutions based on physical experimental results previous studies have mostly focused on coastal infrastructure such as bridges and jetties rather than residential buildings kaplan 1992 and kaplan et al 1995 predicted the time history of impact loadings on offshore platforms and the wave impact force from large incident waves based on momentum flux cuomo et al 2007 conducted a 1 25 scale model test of wave forces on exposed jetties and developed new dimensionless predictive solutions cuomo et al 2009 also performed large scale 1 10 experiments on coastal highway bridges and determined the dynamics of wave loadings and the effects of openings in bridge decks based on this work they derived predictive methods for both quasi static and impulsive wave loads bradner et al 2011 investigated a 1 5 scale model of a reinforced concrete type coastal bridge superstructure they investigated the vertical and horizontal force for an array of wave heights periods and water levels and found that the vertical force could be greater than the horizontal force by a factor of four recently asce sei 2016 published minimum design standards for buildings as a design guideline for elevated structures including methodologies to calculate three wave loading types non breaking breaking and broken sections 5 4 2 to 5 4 5 fema 2011 also published a design manual for residential coastal dwellings which includes guidance on both horizontal and vertical wave forces similar to those presented in the asce standard however those theoretical approaches are limited in their applicability to real complex storm wave climates and the corresponding wave forces wiebe et al 2014 proposed an analytical solution to estimate the wave induced force on an elevated structure by modifying goda s pressure formulae for a caisson breakwater goda 1974 2010 to include the effects of various freeboard conditions air gap and wave climates they concluded that three types of breaking conditions yielded different aspects of horizontal wave force as function of wave height period and freeboard as an alternative method computational fluid dynamics cfd models have been widely developed and applied to estimate wave induced pressures and forces advances in recent years have been supported by an increase in computation power which allows more detailed calculations of the complex hydrodynamics associated with wave action however the performance of cfd models must be validated or verified through detailed comparisons with benchmark tests e g analytic solutions or physical experiments and difficulties of pressure and force calculations and their sensitivity to wave conditions were well reported by previous studies e g mokrani and abadie 2016 in case of the wave pressure forces on elevated structure many recent numerical studies have been performed with bridge decks xiao and huang 2008 jin and meng 2011 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 2015 seiffert et al 2015 wu et al 2016 and validated through the scaled physical experimental results they mostly utilized solitary or cnoidal waves with constant depth conditions for simple wave climate and focused on analyzing wave loads on coastal bridge decks recently do et al 2016 used the results of a 1 5 scale bridge experiment linton et al 2012 to validate the ansys fluent model ansys 2013 they then applied the model setup to a vertical wall using a solitary wave generally differences in wave impacts result from the three breaking types non breaking breaking and broken waves wave breaking is highly dependent on the wave characteristics e g wave height period and surge levels bathymetric and topographic conditions e g cross shore beach profile foreshore slope and presence or absence of offshore sandbars and dunes geometric conditions of the infrastructure e g community layout beach hardening are also important in particular the air gap or the distance from the water level to the lowest chord of the structure can significantly affect the magnitude of the wave impact force on the elevated structure e g wiebe et al 2014 park et al 2017 impulsive breaking waves wave slamming induce the highest horizontal forces on vertical walls e g bea et al 1999 linton et al 2012 however it is reported that the breaking wave itself could be separated into three phases such as early breaking late breaking and perfect breaking kirkgöz 1995 each phase creates a wave impact force of different magnitude therefore it is still a challenging task to model the various types of wave deformations over a sloping beach and to calculate the consequent wave pressure distributions and forces on elevated structures for various types of wave breaking conditions the goals of the present paper are to 1 validate two cfd models ihfoam and fluent with a scaled 1 10 experimental dataset of waves impacting an elevated structure park et al 2017 with a range of surge levels wave conditions and air gaps and 2 quantify the performance of the two models for the wave induced horizontal and vertical forces pressures on the elevated structure we compare the performance and sensitivity of the two cfd model results conditioned on the three different wave impact conditions non breaking breaking and broken in particular we compare the time series of the water surface elevations over the compound slope as well as the front and bottom pressures and vertical and horizontal force components on the elevated structure which was positioned on a flat region slightly inland of the compound slope section 2 introduces the overall setup of the experiment and dataset utilized in model validation including detailed instrumentation and test conditions section 3 introduces the two cfd models ihfoam and fluent and details of each cfd model setup section 4 presents an overview of the two cfd model results including the detailed validation process section 5 discusses the quantitative comparison of the two cfd models and the sensitivity of each model to different mesh size conditions in calculations of the water surface elevation pressure and force finally section 6 discusses the major conclusions of this work 2 experimental design the physical model tests were conducted at the large wave flume lwf at oregon state university s hinsdale wave research laboratory hwrl and are described in detail in park et al 2017 the tests are summarized here to provide a context for the numerical modeling in this work the experiment was designed to measure wave induced pressures horizontal forces and vertical forces separately on an elevated coastal structure experiments were performed with a constant water depth and bathymetry while varying the significant wave height and peak period for each test three different wave conditions were tested including regular periodic irregular random and transient tsunami like waves and the specimen was elevated to different air gap conditions to measure the horizontal and vertical wave forces on the structure the model data validations use the regular waves only 2 1 experimental setup a profile view sketch of the lwf including bathymetric conditions and wave gage locations is presented in fig 1 the length width and depth of the flume were 104 m 3 66 m and 4 6 m respectively with a piston type hydraulic actuator assembly wavemaker a compound slope was installed in the flume beginning 14 07 m from the wavemaker the first section was composed of a horizontal 3 64 m long slab with a 0 15 m height followed by a 10 98 m long section with a 1 11 slope giving a vertical rise of 0 99 m this steeper slope was followed by a 14 64 m long section with a 1 24 slope rising an additional 0 61 m and finally followed by a 36 60 m long flat section starting at x 43 33 m with a constant 1 75 m elevation the specimen which was based on a 1 10 length scale model of a residential coastal structure was designed to measure vertical and horizontal forces and pressures and was located at x 43 84 m 0 51 m landward from the start of the flat section fig 2 provides a detailed sketch of the instrumentation installed in the wave flume fig 2a is a detailed overhead view of wave flume showing the experimental specimen and nearby wave gauges three wire resistance wave gages were positioned at the beginning wg1 middle wg2 and end wg3 of the slope to capture the transformation as waves propagated along the sloping bathymetry fig 2b is a side view of the specimen a frame was utilized to hold the specimen in place at varying air gaps and to prevent lateral y direction motion the specimen has a box shape 1 02 m by 1 02 m square bottom with 0 61 m height and it represents an idealization of an elevated residential structure this specimen was designed to measure pressures on the front bottom and rear sides the rail connection to the frame system allowed the simultaneous independent measurements of the horizontal and vertical forces fig 2c depicts the front back bottom and top views of the specimen which show the locations of the 14 pressure gages and 5 load cells used in experiments all pressure gages and load cells recorded data at a frequency of 500 hz and data was filtered using a low pass filter for frequencies above 50 hz more details of the coordinate locations of instruments are available in park et al 2017 2 2 experimental wave conditions regular wave trials consisted of 10 different combinations of significant wave heights and peak periods to model storm wave conditions table 1 shows regular wave conditions measured at wg1 based on observations and video analysis of the wave impact on the structure we classify three types of wave impact conditions non breaking breaking and broken the non breaking impact is generally observed for relatively small wave heights and long wave period conditions the surface of sinusoidal wave transforms during the shoaling process approaching peaky asymmetric sine curves however wave breaking does not occur and thus the wave generates small run up at the specimen trials reg x1 x2 and x6 were classified as non breaking wave impact conditions the breaking wave condition is found when the shoaling wave height is over the breaking limits of depth or length e g h h 0 78 or h l 0 14 tanh kh the wave breaks near the specimen and creates a large jet of splashing water at the time of impact experimental trials reg x3 x7 and x8 are classified as breaking wave impact conditions lastly relatively higher wave height conditions result in the onset of wave breaking processes over the slope and show a decrease of wave height with air entrainment at the moment of impact reg x4 x5 x9 and x10 are classified as broken waves in these experiments the repeatability of wave maker and recording devices was tested and results are described in the physical model study by park et al 2017 for all trials the mean absolute error was 10 for pressure gages and less than 1 for water surface elevation gages for numerical model validation we choose three regular wave conditions reg x2 x8 and x4 which clearly show non breaking breaking and broken wave conditions at the time the wave reaches the specimen for each trial the breaking condition is verified based on both video recordings and pressure measurements on the specimen fig 3 provides snapshots from the video recordings of the wave interaction on the specimen for a reg x2 b reg x8 and c reg x4 in this study we consider the case in which the base of the structure was located at the still water level giving an air gap a equal to zero which was shown by park et al 2017 to induce the maximum vertical force 3 numerical model 3 1 model overview ihfoam and fluent the first cfd model utilized in this study is ihfoam 2 0 higuera et al 2013 which implemented a new solver and boundary conditions for wave generation and absorption ihfoam was developed in the open source platform of openfoam open field operation and manipulation openfoam solves the 3 d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for two incompressible phases using a finite volume discretization and the volume of fluid vof method it also supports several turbulence models such as κ ε κ ω sst and les the governing rans equation includes conservation of mass eq 1 and momentum eq 2 which are 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u μ e f f u p g x ρ u μ e f f where each vector u g and x is velocity acceleration of gravity and position respectively and each scalar p and μ eff is pseudo dynamic pressure and efficient dynamic viscosity which account for the molecular dynamic viscosity plus turbulent effects ihfoam 2017 the density ρ is calculated as ρ αρ water 1 α ρ air where α indicates the phase function given by 3 α t u α u c α 1 α in eq 3 u c is an artificial compression vector to preserve a sharp interface between air and water maza et al 2015 ihfoam utilizes a mixture of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms which is called pimple the main structure of pimple is inherited from the original piso but it allows equation under relaxation as in simple to ensure the convergence of all the equations at each time step ihfoam 2017 the performance of ihfoam was validated through several benchmark studies such as run up wave breaking higuera et al 2013 coastal structures higuera et al 2014 and 3 d oscillating water columns iturrioz et al 2015 the second cfd model is fluent a module in the ansys workbench to solve for the fluid flow fluent can interact with the mechanical module in ansys to solve the two way fluid structure interaction however this paper only focuses on one way fluid structure interaction by using the fluent module only therefore the structure can be assumed to be a rigid boundary condition during the analysis fluent inc 2005 the governing equations for volume of fluid vof model for multi phase problem solving in fluent are as below eqs 4 and 5 with the assumption that temperature remains unchanged during the analysis ansys 2009 the mass conservation equation is given as 4 1 ρ q t α q ρ q α q ρ q v q s 1 n m s q m q s where ρ q is the mass per unit volume of the phase q t is time is the differential operator v q is velocity vector of phase q α q is the volume fraction of phase q with s 1 n α q 1 m s q is mass transfer from phase s to phase q m q s is mass transfer from phase q to phase s and n is the number of phases the momentum conservation equation is used throughout the domain as 5 t ρ v ρ v v p μ v v t ρ g f where p is the static pressure and each ρ g and f are the gravitational and external body forces respectively and μ is the molecular viscosity in order to account for the turbulent effects realizable k ε model ansys 2009 was applied with the other two variables k turbulent kinetic energy and ε turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate in the next step implicit scheme is selected for discretize those governing equations and the pressure based coupled algorithm is obtained to solve the discretized equations for pressures velocities and other scalar equations 3 2 ihfoam model setup there are two mesh tools in openfoam blockmesh and snappyhexmesh the blockmesh tool creates the geometry of each block which is generally defined by 8 vertices and 6 boundary faces one at each corner of a hexahedron cube it requires information of the mesh vertices faces and correct numbering to generate the mesh thus relatively simple geometry conditions are preferred when using this tool however the snappyhexmesh tool generates 3 d meshes creating hexahedra and split hexahedra automatically from triangulated surface geometries given in stereolithography stl format so it supports the generation of mesh with complex geometry conditions in this study we utilize the blockmesh tool and generate a 1 1 scale model of the flume used for the physical model study including the specimen painted orange as shown in fig 3 but not the gray supporting frame with set of hexahedrons cubes we utilize a prism shaped block which is composed of 6 vertices and 4 boundary faces to reproduce the sloped bathymetry the piston type wavemaker is not directly modeled instead ihfoam allows users to choose various wave input conditions based on wave theory e g stokes solitary and irregular and wavemaker theory piston type flap type here we utilize the piston type wavemaker boundary condition inlet to replicate the wave input using the measured time series of displacement and free surface elevation at the wavemaker we assign the no slip wall boundary condition for both bottom slope and around the specimen and leave as an empty boundary the lateral walls the bathymetry of the flume was designed to dissipate waves through the natural beach at the end of the flume therefore we did not implement a radiation boundary condition or sponge layer at the end of the flume so that our simulation would replicate the conditions in the physical model both the water and air phases were simulated with density ρ set to 998 kg m3 and 1 20 kg m3 respectively and kinematic viscosity ν set to 1 0 10 6 m2 s and 1 48 10 5 m2 s respectively we utilized the default solver setups described in the ihfoam example ihfoam 2017 and both the κ ε and the κ ω sst turbulence equations were considered the default parameters of k ε e g launder and sharma 1974 and κ ω sst turbulence models wilcox 2008 were utilized in this study and we utilize k ε equations in the final validation results the sketch of the numerically modeled 3 d wave flume is presented in fig 4 a we treat the specimen and frame as located at the center of the flume and cut the flume in half in the y direction to reduce computation time three different sized meshes coarse m1 medium m2 and fine m3 were utilized in this study each of which had a variable mesh size depending on the location in the flume fig 4b and c show the sketches of the front and top views of the flume giving detailed information for the fine mesh size m3 and showing the variation in the mesh size in the flume the finest mesh 0 02 m on the x axis was concentrated near the specimen l1 and the finest mesh 0 02 0 025 m on z axis was around the region of the free surface elevation z2 and z3 to capture the non linear wave deformation including shoaling reflection and breaking processes during propagation over the slope we set the mesh size at 0 02 m at the specimen on the y axis and gradually increased the mesh size to 0 05 m at the lateral wall of the flume the smallest mesh sizes for m1 and m2 were 0 08 and 0 04 m respectively and the maximum mesh size for both configurations was limited to 0 2 m the total number of grid elements increased by 2 6 times from m1 to m2 and by 6 2 times from m1 to m3 table 2 summarizes the mesh types and lists the total number of elements utilized in each of the mesh types regular wave conditions were simulated for a duration of 50 s through a single desktop with i7 4770 3 4 ghz and 64g ram with 4 core parallel since we have set the maximum courant number co to 0 5 for all model runs different computation times were required for the different wave hydrodynamic conditions the average computation times for a 4 core computer are 1 1 15 2 and 127 2 h for the m1 m2 and m3 meshes generally the computation time increased by roughly 1 3 times for the breaking condition reg x8 and 1 9 times for the broken wave condition reg x4 compared to the non breaking wave calculations reg x2 the sampling rate and filtering of output results surface elevation pressure or forces for model validation is also a critical issue for the pressure and force comparison we utilize the function probes which is added at the end of the controldict text file that sets the simulation time and data input output control in openfoam the probes function allows us to extract any calculated values e g velocity pressure k and ε at the specific x y and z location with a varying frequency we apply the probes function for the 14 pressure gages and 9 wave gages and extract each datum with the same time of model calculation to set up the wave gages in ihfoam we define a series of x y and z points along the z axis with 0 02 m resolution at each wave gage location to obtain the surface elevation result we take the sum of all α values along the z axis at each wave gage location and multiply by the resolution 0 02 m here α is defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell thus if α 1 the cell is full of water and if α 0 the cell is full of air to estimate the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the front and bottom faces of the specimen respectively we set up a different patch for each the front and the bottom face in the blockmeshdict and then applied libforces so which is the intrinsic function implemented in openfoam to extract corresponding forces at a given patch wall with three cartesian directions to validate the performance of libforces so we compared the results of libforces so to the integrated force interpolated from multi pressure points 36 at the front and bottom with normal direction and they showed good agreement fig a1 in the appendix provides the computation frequencies of m1 m2 and m3 during the 20 50 s simulation as we mentioned earlier the extraction time of all surface elevation pressure and force data is the same as the computation time step fig a1 and the computation time is governed by designating a maximum courant number co 0 5 which varies depending on the velocity and size of mesh the computation time step is small enough to compare with the measurements and ranges from 300 hz to 1000 hz at the moment of wave impact for the non breaking wave condition m3 although the measurement results were processed using a low pass filter for frequencies more than 50 hz park et al 2017 the ihfoam results do not include any filtering in this study because there is essentially no noise in the ihfoam pressure and force results due to extremely small frequency components 3 3 fluent model setup because of symmetry one half of the wave flume and the specimen were modeled in fluent as was done in ihfoam the specimen was modeled as fixed walls meaning no dynamic effects were considered for the box during analysis all wall boundaries were assumed split free a multiphase volume of fluid model was employed to model water and air phases the realizable k ε viscous model was selected for the solver by adding a new turbulent viscosity formulation and dissipation rate transport equation this realizable k ε model is more accurately predicted for both planar and round jets compared to the standard k ε model ansys 2009 an enhanced wall treatment function was introduced for the near wall region by blending the laminar and turbulent law and combining with the reliable k ε model to produce better results for this type of problem ansys 2009 output time steps were controlled by a courant number of 0 5 the convergence criteria for continuity and velocity components was 1e 6 calculations for κ ε and the volume fraction were defined to converge at 1e 3 or repeated for a maximum 50 iterations at which point the analysis continued for computational efficiency an advantage of fluent is that the wavemaker can be treated as the moving boundary at the inlet so that the numerical flume has the same boundary conditions as the physical wave flume with the piston type wavemaker the displacement of the physical wavemaker was recorded during the experiments and was used as the input for the numerical wave flume remeshing every time step was necessary for the area close to the inlet boundary to remain consistent with the initial element size with a split and collapse factor of 0 4 the wave gauges were modeled by creating flat column with a height equal to that of the wave flume and width of 0 05 m at the wave gauge locations as shown in fig 5 a wave height was measured by integrating the water phase then dividing by the width of the column this technique works well with a solid wave but typically underestimates the splash compared to regular string wave gauges wg or ultrasonic wave gauges uswg pressures were collected by creating points at pressure gauge pg locations along the sides of the box as shown in fig 5b pg1 to pg9 represent pressure on the front side of the box and pg11 to pg14 represent the pressure at the bottom of the box the total horizontal and vertical forces were computed from the drag and lift coefficient at all faces of the box divided by the reference values for comparison with ihfoam the mesh configurations also should be consistent the cut cell mesh method was used to obtain the maximum number of square blocks which have the best element quality the overall minimum and maximum element size was set to be 0 02 m 0 16 m element size increased the block edge by a factor of two from fine resolution m3 to medium resolution m2 and from medium resolution to coarse resolution m3 as shown in table 3 the total number of elements increased by a factor of 2 7 from m1 to m2 and by a factor of 6 3 from m1 to m3 to evaluate the element quality of the m3 mesh the average element orthogonal quality ranging from 0 to 1 closer to 1 is better was determined as 0 99 with a minimum of 0 18 the average skewness ranging from 0 to 1 closer to 0 is better is 1 5e 3 with maximum of 0 81 the average computation times for the three cases run on a 12 core computer node in the linux system two intel xeon e5 2640 2 5 ghz are 16 7 61 5 and 176 3 h for the m1 m2 and m3 meshes respectively by comparing tables 2 and 3 we can see that the number of mesh elements for ihfoam and fluent were similar and vary by less than 5 for each of the mesh configurations however each model shows significantly different times of total computation those differences are somewhat expected because we could not perform both ihfoam and fluent runs under the exact same conditions such as solvers numerical schemes parallelization tool and computational resources in this study ihfoam has a relatively shorter computation time than fluent for m2 and m3 and a much shorter computation time for the coarse mesh condition m1 4 validations and comparisons of numerical models in section 4 1 we will present 3 d snapshots of modeling results for the three wave conditions in sections 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 we provide a detailed comparison of the numerically modelled water surface elevation and pressure gauge time series to the experimental data at six wave gages wg2 wg3 uswg2 uswg4 uswg5 and uswg6 and six pressure gages press1 press3 press6 press11 press12 and press14 for all wave conditions we also compare the time series of the horizontal and vertical forces measured from five load cells on the specimen to the numerically modelled results note that wg2 and wg3 were located at the middle and end of the slope respectively to capture wave shoaling and breaking and uswg 2 4 5 and 6 were positioned on the flat region to capture wave deformation around the specimen fig 2a the three ultrasonic wave gages uswg were offset 0 53 m from the wall with uswg2 uswg6 and uswg5 positioned in front at the middle and behind the specimen respectively uswg4 was also located behind the specimen but 1 83 m offset from the wall fig 2a for comparisons of pressure time series press6 press3 and press1 were located on the front face of the specimen and press11 press12 and press14 were located on the bottom of the specimen fig 2c 4 1 overview results of ihfoam and fluent figs 6 and 7 provide snapshots of the water surface field given by ihfaom and fluent modeling at four time steps including at the time of wave impact panels a b c and d in each figure show the non breaking wave condition panels e f g and h show the breaking wave condition and panels i j k and l show the broken wave condition for ihfoam fig 6 a e and i show the wave surface about 1 5 s before the impact on the specimen and each wave is a different shape depending on input conditions fig 6 c g and k include the detailed figures for non breaking breaking and broken wave impacts on the front of the specimen the frontal distributions of α for both non breaking and breaking waves are uniform while the broken wave impact shows an irregular distribution of α due to air entrapment when the comparing model output with the recorded videos of experiments we observed that the ihfoam results for the breaking and broken wave conditions tend to be less developed than waves generated in experiments i e numerical waves were not quite impulsively breaking or broke closer to the structure than experimental breaking and broken waves respectively thus the numerical model results showed relatively less splash for the breaking wave conditions and more splash for the broken wave conditions fig 7 shows the same time range as fig 6 for the three wave conditions modeled by fluent in 2d contours we can observe the highest wave height for the breaking wave condition fig 7e a smaller wave height for the non breaking wave condition fig 7a and the lowest wave height for the broken wave condition fig 7i by inspecting fig 7 c g and k we can see that at the time of impact the breaking condition fig 7g shows the strongest water splash on the structure followed by the non breaking and then the broken wave condition respectively 4 2 nonbreaking wave reg x2 fig 8 shows the model validation of the water surface elevation for the non breaking wave reg x2 condition we compared the time series of water surface elevation at six wave gages from 20 to 50 s of the experimental simulation time which includes the first regular wave impacting the specimen and 7 continuous regular waves as waves propagate toward the specimen their shapes transform and steepen from wg2 to uswg2 overall the wave heights increase due to shoaling effects and they are almost near breaking at uswg2 after waves pass the specimen they keep the steep waveform but in general wave heights decrease generally both ihfoam and fluent results show excellent agreement to the measured surface elevation but both models slightly underestimate the positive surface elevation and show relatively high deviations at uswg4 and uswg5 which are located behind of the specimen one interesting feature is that the first four waves of both ihfoam and fluent show excellent agreement at most of the wave gages but the models begin to show larger deviations for subsequent waves especially at wg3 uswg4 and uswg6 these disagreements could come from the effects of wave reflection from the specimen and sidewalls or from wave structure interaction which the numerical model cannot capture well due to the rigid body assumption fig 9 shows the model validation of the non breaking wave condition for the front pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press6 a press3 c and press1 e and show the corresponding detailed time series t 32 35 s at each pressure gage b d and f generally both ihfoam and fluent match well with the measured peak pressures but ihfoam slightly underestimates the peak at press6 while fluent underestimates the peak at press3 and press1 the overall pattern of pressure distribution at the time of impact shows good agreement except for instances where the experimental gages recorded negative pressures which are found at press3 and press6 it is interesting to note that only press3 and press6 recorded negative pressures among whole time span of the three wave gages negative pressures were also observed press3 for the breaking wave condition reg x8 but were not observed at any pressure gage for the broken wave condition reg x4 as seen in figs 12 and 16 this phenomenon could be caused by the large jet of splashing water that is projected upward at the time of wave impact but the current mesh size 0 02 m is not small enough to capture it the largest peak pressure is recorded at t 33 s for both the measurement and calculations which is the time of impact of the first wave whose wave height is equivalent to our input condition 0 2 m at wg1 fig 9b d and f show the detailed time series of pressure near the time of the largest peak pressure a reduction in peak pressures at all gages was observed for subsequent wave impacts t 33 s for both calculated and measured data this pressure reduction occurs despite the observed surface elevation at uswg2 recording similar wave heights for subsequent waves t 33 s the maximum reduction of peak pressure is observed at press6 decreasing from 2 3 kpa to 1 0 kpa this reduction highlights that even minor changes of water surface elevation resulted in large peak pressure changes in this case by over a factor 2 for both calculated and measured data fig 10 shows the model validation of the non breaking wave condition reg x2 for the bottom pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press11 a press12 c and press14 e and show the corresponding detailed time series of pressure for one wave b d and f both ihfoam and fluent results could not capture the large peaky pressures at the time of impact but both models captured the pattern of pressure distributions well the short peaky pressures at the time of wave impact had a relatively short frequency 20 hz and may require much finer mesh for the numerical model simulation to capture in addition negative pressures are observed in both experimentally measured and numerically modeled results relatively large negative pressures are observed at press11 with smaller negative pressures at press12 non negative pressures are seen at press14 for both measured data and ihfoam but they are not clearly found in fluent each pressure gage recorded a uniquely shaped time series of pressure depending on its location and both models capture this variation well for each pressure gage the major difference between the two models when compared with the measurement is that ihfoam results calculate a similar peak pressure distribution after t 30 s of simulation time for all gages but fluent either could not capture the peak pressure or modeled a relatively smaller peak especially at press12 fig 10d and press14 fig 10e generally the fluent results underestimated the peak pressure compared to the ihfoam results fig 11 shows the model validation of the horizontal force and vertical force for the reg x2 wave condition overall the ihfoam outputs show good agreement with the measurements for both the peak and pattern of wave forces and fluent outputs show a slight overestimation of the horizontal force the measurement results show a clear damping of forces after wave impacts especially for higher peak forces t 33 and 37 s but those damping effects decrease as the magnitude of the peak force decreases t 41 45 and 49 s in contrast ihfoam and fluent results do not predict any damping effects on forces because of the rigid body assumption applied in the calculation comparing modelled and measured vertical forces we observe that the overall shape of forces and the peaks generally match while ihfoam shows some deviation at the tail of each wave impact especially for negative forces after wave impact even though we could not capture the peaky pressures recorded by bottom pressure gages fig 10 these deviations did not result in a significant difference in the vertical force comparison for both ihfoam and fluent 4 3 breaking wave reg x8 fig 12 shows the model validation for the breaking wave condition reg x8 for water surface elevation both ihfoam and fluent results match well with the measured data at wg2 fig 11a but calculated data show some deviations to the measurements at the other wave gages generally both ihfoam and fluent results underestimate wave height at wg3 and uswg2 to be specific ihfoam results underestimate wave heights at wg3 after t 35 s and at uswg2 after t 40 s these differences propagate to the other wave gages located behind the specimen fluent outputs show relatively better agreement at wg3 however fluent also underestimates wave height at uswg2 after t 37 s these patterns are similar to what we observed for the non breaking wave condition in that the numerical results showed good agreement to the measurements until the wave height reached the target wave height 0 35 m at wg1 however once the experimental waves developed to fully breaking e g after t 35 s at uswg3 both model results match experimental results relatively poorly as a given wave passes the specimen the wave height generally decreases due to energy loss from wave breaking and wave impact ihfoam results show better agreement to the measured data while fluent results underestimate the wave height at uswg5 and uswg6 also a slight phase shift is observed at uswg2 uswg5 and uswg6 in ihfoam which is not seen for the non breaking condition or for fluent data the change in wave heights from wg2 to uswg2 indicate the effects of wave shoaling and breaking processes over the compound slope we observe that the wave height decreases slightly from wg2 to uswg2 in the measured data ihfoam wave heights are almost same or have slightly increased while fluent wave heights have clearly decreased between the two wave gages ihfoam shows better agreement to the measured data after the specimen at uswg5 and uswg6 while fluent results underestimate wave height at these locations upon careful observation of both the experimental and numerical model results including the snapshots in figs 6 and 7 we conclude that ihfoam waves tend to break later than the experimental data while waves output by fluent tend to break earlier along the compound slope compared with the measured data overall we find that both ihfoam and fluent results differ from the experimentally measured data however they show opposite patterns of deviation with ihfoam waves breaking later and fluent waves breaking earlier than experimental data deviations between modeled and measured wave heights are larger for the breaking wave condition than for the non breaking wave condition errors may be induced due to the limitations of the current numerical models setups e g mesh default solver or turbulence model and the complexity in simulating wave structure interaction and wall or specimen induced reflection effects fig 13 shows the model validation for the breaking wave reg x8 condition for the front pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press6 a press3 c and press1 e and show the detailed time series of pressure for t 33 36 s b d and f the overall patterns of pressure impact times at each gage show good agreement for both models however the ihfoam results underestimate the front pressure compared to fluent and both models show larger deviations from the measurement for the upper pressure gage especially at press6 fig 13a the underestimations of pressure in ihfoam and fluent are somewhat expected based on the underestimation of wave height at wg3 and uswg2 seen in fig 12 generally ihfoam results indicate a weaker plunging type of wave breaking at the specimen compared to the experimental measurements consequently the numerical model significantly underestimates the peak pressure at press6 fluent results also underestimate the frontal pressure but show relatively better agreement to the measurement for their peak pressure outputs still fluent cannot capture the peak pressures in addition as was seen for the non breaking reg x2 case negative pressures are measured at press3 and both ihfoam and fluent could not capture these negative pressures the largest peak pressure was recorded at t 33 s at press6 which is the impact time of the first wave whose wave height was equal to the intended wave height both model results predicted the largest peak pressure for this wave fig 14 shows the model validation of breaking wave condition for bottom pressure gages we compare the time series of pressure at press11 a press12 c and press14 e and show the detailed time series near the maximum peak pressure b d and f overall both ihfoam and fluent results show good agreement with the measurement frontal peaky pressures are observed for all measured data ihfoam outputs did not capture the first short peaks e g at t 33 9 s in fig 14b however it captures well the secondary peak pressure e g at t 34 2 s in fig 14b fluent results capture relatively well the first peak pressure but could not capture the secondary peak pressure overall the absolute peak pressure for each wave is similar to the measurement but each model shows different pressure distributions for the vertical pressures as the pressure gages move from the leading edge press11 to the trailing edge press14 of the specimen the peak pressure tends to decrease and the expanse of the positive pressure region increases in addition ihfoam results show a phase shift at press14 similar to the phase shift for the water surface elevation that we observed at uswg5 and uswg6 fig 11e and f fig 15 shows the model validation of the horizontal force and vertical force for the reg x8 wave condition overall ihfoam results underestimate the experimentally measured horizontal force but show better agreement to the measured vertical force fluent shows better agreement to the measurement for the horizontal forces but greater deviation from the measured vertical forces generally the characteristics of the wave at the moment of impact significantly affect the magnitude of the horizontal force to specify ihfoam results show good agreement to the measurement for both horizontal and vertical forces at t 31 s however ihfoam significantly underestimates the horizontal force for the following waves while the vertical force shows slightly uniform results after t 31 s for both ihfoam and measurement upon careful observation of both the experimental and ihfoam model results we find that the plunging shape of the wave as it impacted the front face of the specimen in ihfoam was not same as the shape of the experimental wave the measurement shows clear plunging impact on the specimen while ihfoam did not a show fully developed plunging wave impact this difference in wave shape causes the underestimation of the front pressure and horizontal force after t 34 s in addition both model results were unable to capture the horizontal force measured at the impact including the inertial force on the specimen which consequently effected the underestimation of the horizontal force we also observe clear damping effects in the measured horizontal force after the wave impact while there are no oscillations in either model result relatively small damping effects are observed for the vertical force and each vertical force is generally uniform in summary we can conclude that the horizontal force is sensitive to the shape of the breaking wave in the numerical model results while the vertical force is less sensitive to the breaking wave shape hence numerical outputs of vertical force show good agreement to the measurement 4 4 broken wave reg x4 a5 fig 16 shows the model validation of the free surface for the broken waves generally ihfoam results show good agreement with measurement capturing the shoaling and breaking processes recorded in the experiment for first four waves before 35 s at uswg2 however it overestimates the water surface elevation at uswg2 5 and 6 for subsequent waves after 35 s at uswg2 and we observe a slight phase shift in ihfoam water surface outputs fluent tends to underestimate the water surface elevation at most of wave gages except at uswg5 and fluent results show a similar phase shift compared with the experimental measurements the different aspects of the water surface elevation between two models especially at wg3 and uswg2 indicate that ihfoam and fluent each undergo different wave shoaling and breaking calculations these calculations are dependent on each model s inherent differences or set up preferences which we cannot define in exactly the same way for this study e g default model setups numerical solvers and schemes ihfoam waves tended to break later compared with measured results in that the numerically modelled results indicated that the wave broke closer to the front of the specimen compared to the measurement in contrast waves modelled by fluent tended to break sooner than the measured data in summary ihfoam overestimate the water surface elevations while fluent underestimates the water surface elevations associated with broken waves these trends propagate through in comparisons between the experimental and numerical pressure and force data fig 17 shows the model validation of the front pressure gages for the broken waves we compare the time series of pressure at press6 a press3 c and press1 e and show the detailed time series of pressure between t 31 34 s b d and f in general ihfoam results overestimate the frontal pressure after t 36 s while fluent results tend to underestimate the pressures for the entire time series the deviations of both model results from measurements were somewhat expected based on the comparison of water surface elevation results at wg3 and uswg2 fig 16b and c ihfoam results show that the wave broke closer to the front of the specimen compared to the measurement while fluent results show that the wave broke further offshore of the specimen compared to the measurement thus ihfoam results produced higher wave heights at uswg2 and higher front pressures than the measurement while fluent results produced lower wave heights at uswg2 and smaller front pressures fig 18 shows the model validation of the bottom pressure gages for broken waves we compare the time series of pressure at press11 a press12 c and press14 e and detailed time series of pressure between t 31 34 s b d and f generally bottom pressure results given by the models show better agreement to measurements than front pressures still we observe a similar pattern to the horizontal pressure validation in that ihfoam results overestimate pressure at press11 and fluent results underestimate pressure at press 11 12 and 14 fewer short peaky pressures were observed in the measurement for reg x4 and pressures generally decrease as the wave passes by the specimen similar to the reg x8 condition in addition both ihfoam and fluent results show phase shifts at press12 and 14 these are related to the phase shifts of water surface elevations that we observed for both models at uswg5 and 6 fig 16e and f fig 19 shows the model validation of the horizontal force and vertical force for the reg x4 wave condition generally ihfoam overestimates both the horizontal and vertical forces as was observed in comparisons of both the front and bottom pressures while fluent shows good agreement to the measurements one explanation for this large difference in pressure but relatively small difference in the force is that the bore type wave randomly impacts the front of the structure creating wet and dry conditions that are not the same in the physical and numerical models consequently peak pressures do not all occur at the same time therefore the magnitude of the peak pressure could vary significantly depending on location of interest on the structure and any peak pressure at a point provides a relatively small contribution to the total force for example the maximum horizontal force in ihfoam is greater than the measurement by a factor of 2 at t 40 s while the numerically output front pressure is greater than the measured by a factor of 5 at press6 the observed points considered in comparisons with measurements press1 3 and 6 could not capture the complete pattern of the pressure distribution and the corresponding horizontal force of the bore type wave 5 cfd model residual comparison and sensitivity test 5 1 residual comparison of two cfd models time series comparisons between ihfoam fluent and measured free surface elevations pressure time series and force time series were performed in previous section note that both the peak value and duration of wave induced pressures forces are important factors that can affect structural damage e g bullock et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to determine the uncertainty not only in the peak pressure but also throughout the time series of a given wave impact to quantify the uncertainty of time series data we determine the residual between the calculations and measurements residual r measurement calculation fig 20 shows an example of the measured and calculated pressure and the resulting r using ihfoam with 0 01 s resolution for the three wave conditions a negative residual indicates overestimation by the model to quantify the residuals over a given time duration we integrate the absolute value of residual over the time domain 6 j r t 1 t 2 r d t where j r is the impulse of absolute residual at the specific time range from t 1 to t 2 we choose t 1 and t 2 as the simulation time of numerical model 50 s but we exclude the initial three waves for ramp up which do not satisfy our input condition thus t 1 is the time at which the fourth wave reaches uswg2 and t 2 is the time at which the next four waves have propagated past uswg2 for example we observe the fourth wave of reg x2 at uswg2 at t 32 s therefore t 1 is 32 s and t 2 is 48 s 32 s 4 waves 4 s wave period note that the wave period in both reg x2 and reg x4 is 4 s and the wave period in trial reg x8 is 3 5 s we normalize j r with the impulse of absolute force or force per unit area pressure given by 7 j x t 1 t 2 x d t where j x is the impulse of force or force per unit area pressure at the specific range of time finally the normalized form of ratio of impulse r j is represented as 8 r j j r j x fig 21 shows the ihfoam results of the ratio of impulse for all front and bottom pressure gages and horizontal and vertical forces for the three wave conditions considered each filled and void symbol indicates the results of pressure and force and each red circle blue square and black triangle indicates the results of non breaking reg x2 breaking reg x8 and broken wave conditions reg x4 respectively generally the highest r j is observed for the broken wave condition and the smallest r j is observed for the non breaking wave condition as observed in section 4 the best agreement between measured and calculated pressure f h and f v is found for the non breaking wave condition in addition a relatively larger r j is observed at lower frontal pressure gages e g at press1 for all three wave conditions non breaking wave conditions also show the smallest r j for bottom pressures however for this wave condition the ratio of impulse is larger for bottom pressures than for front pressures the calculated r j values for the bottom pressures in the breaking and broken wave conditions were relatively more consistent than those calculated for frontal pressures except at press11 we can conclude that the horizontal force and frontal pressures are more sensitive to the wave breaking condition than the vertical force and bottom pressures the residual of surface elevation is also evaluated in a similar manner but we find that generally the r j for surface elevation is a factor 10 3 smaller than the pressure and force results note that because of the definitions used in eq 6 8 particularly the time intervals used the resultant r j is not a direct measure of the absolute error in the model so r j 0 01 should not be interpreted as an error of 1 however since the time intervals are the same for all comparisons in this section the values can be used to show the relative errors between the computed outputs of pressure and force and between the two numerical models e g comparing figs 21 and 22 in a similar manner we perform the quantitative comparison for fluent fig 22 shows the ratio of impulse for fluent results of all pressure gages except for the rear gage press10 and horizontal and vertical forces for the three wave conditions similar to ihfoam results the highest r j is in general observed for the broken wave condition and the smallest r j is observed for the non breaking wave condition also a relatively larger r j is observed at lower frontal pressure gages e g at press1 for all three wave conditions however fluent results show the highest r j for both horizontal and vertical forces at the breaking wave condition in contrast the r j for both non breaking and broken wave conditions are similar and significantly smaller than that calculated for the breaking wave condition this pattern follows our observation in fig 19 that fluent results showed good agreement to the measurement for the both horizontal and vertical forces for the broken wave condition even though the frontal pressures show a higher r j at the bottommost pressure gages for broken wave condition both ihfoam and fluent results show a relatively smaller r j for the total horizontal force 5 2 sensitivity of mesh size ihfoam the three mesh resolutions m1 m2 and m3 described in section 3 were tested with ihfoam for the three wave conditions to evaluate the sensitivity of outputs of water surface elevation pressure and forces to mesh size fig 23 shows the comparison of water surface elevation results at two representative wave gages fig 23a and b show the comparison of results at wg2 and uswg2 for the non breaking wave condition fig 23c and d show the comparison of results at wg2 and uswg2 for the breaking wave condition and fig 23e and f show the comparison of results at wg2 and uswg2 for the broken wave condition line colors indicate results of the measurement solid black m1 red dash dot m2 blue dot and m3 black dash results generally the peak and shape of each mesh condition show similar results among the three mesh conditions while m1 shows relatively smaller wave heights compared with the other two relatively small differences between modelled and measured water surface elevations are observed for all three mesh conditions at wg2 and larger deviations are observed at the peak and tail of the water surface elevation time series at uswg2 which was located closer to the specimen the detailed comparisons of the front and bottom pressures are shown in fig 24 we focus on the same time duration of the fourth wave impacting the structure that was used for the pressure comparisons in section 4 fig 24a and b show the comparison of results for the non breaking wave at press2 and press12 fig 24c and d show the comparison of results for the breaking wave at press2 and press12 and fig 24e and f show the comparison of results for the broken wave at press2 and press12 all mesh sizes m1 m2 and m3 show a similarly shaped nonbreaking wave induced pressure distribution for front and bottom gages the finest mesh produces relatively higher pressure outputs over the duration of the wave and also shows slightly shorter duration of pressure compared to the two coarser mesh conditions for the breaking wave condition m1 clearly underestimates the pressure for both front and bottom pressures compared with the other two mesh conditions for the broken wave condition both and m2 and m3 capture the frontal peak pressure while m1 could not capture it generally all mesh resolutions tested show similar results for bottom pressure the detailed comparisons of pressures at representative gages provide the complete temporal pattern of pressure distributions and indicate the sensitivity of pressure outputs to different mesh sizes however it is difficult to compare outputs at all pressure gages in the experiment therefore the conclusion we have made here may not represent all pressure characteristics of mesh dependence and they could generate biased results due to systematic errors for example at pressure gages located lower on the structure for better quantitative comparison of the sensitivity of mesh sizes we apply the ratio of residual impulse r j to evaluate mesh sensitivity fig 25 shows r j of the three mesh conditions determined for a non breaking b breaking and c broken wave conditions each red circle blue triangle and black square represents the r j from m1 m2 and m3 for the non breaking wave condition fig 25a r j for all pressure gages is less than 0 01 overall there are minor differences among three mesh conditions with m3 showing a slightly smaller r j for all pressures and horizontal force m3 results clearly show the lowest r j for all bottom pressures but not for the vertical force for the breaking wave condition the overall r j is less than 0 015 m2 and m3 results show similar r j values while m1 results show higher r j for front pressures all mesh conditions show a similar r j for the horizontal force as in the non breaking condition m3 results clearly show a smaller r j for bottom pressures but not for vertical force broken wave trials resulted in a much higher rj than other wave conditions at pressure gages but not at the load cell to be specific the difference between the m1 and m3 condition is a factor of 1 7 at press2 we can also observe a decrease of r j with elevation above the base of the structure from press1 to press9 for all mesh conditions this reduction makes sense in the context of the major contact area of bore type waves on the specimen the deviation observed for the broken wave condition is especially large for coarser mesh m1 simulations which could result from the difficulty in simulating the same conditions of air entrainment and water and air density at the time of wave impact although there are relatively higher r j values for front pressures the ratios of residual impulses for the horizontal force for all three meshes are quite small bottom pressures show a similar pattern to front pressures finer mesh results in a smaller r j and a higher r j is observed at press11 with a sharp decrease moving inland from press11 to press14 in general the horizontal and vertical forces are less sensitive to mesh size for all wave conditions while front and bottom pressures show the significant sensitivity to mesh size especially for the broken wave condition this result is meaningful when considering cfd modeling for the structural design because the total forces are less sensitive to mesh and wave conditions than pressure gages thus significant computational expense may be saved by using a coarser mesh resolution in a cfd model while still achieving a reliable estimate of the total force 6 conclusions and discussion the validation of two cfd models for the wave induced force on an elevated structure were performed including quantitative comparisons of pressures and forces to experimentally measured data we simulated ihfoam and fluent for three regular wave conditions which generated non breaking breaking and broken wave impacts on the structure the following general conclusions were found from this study 1 the performance of numerical models varied depending on the wave condition for the same cfd model set up non breaking wave conditions generally showed the best agreement for both fluent and ihfoam results and the broken wave conditions showed the worst agreement 2 generally the free surface comparisons were excellent for both the ihfoam and fluent models and horizontal and vertical forces of both models showed better agreement to the measured data despite calculated pressures showing relatively high deviations from the short peaky pressures recorded in the measurement 3 front pressures and horizontal forces were sensitive to wave breaking types while bottom pressures and vertical forces were less sensitive this result highlights that numerical model benchmark tests for wave loads on an elevated structure should include both horizontal force frontal pressures and vertical force bottom pressures 4 in general as one would anticipate a finer mesh provided improved numerical simulation results and non breaking and breaking wave impacts showed minor sensitivity to mesh size broken wave results are significantly sensitive to the mesh conditions ihfoam 5 the horizontal and vertical force were less sensitive to mesh size for all wave conditions this result is meaningful when considering cfd modeling for structural design because the total force is less sensitive to mesh and wave conditions than the pressure gages significant computational expense may be saved by using a coarser mesh resolution in a cfd model while still achieving a reliable estimate of the total force as noted earlier we applied the same turbulence coefficient for the κ ε turbulence model in both ihfaom and fluent for model consistency in the ihfoam model we also tested the simulation using the κ ω sst turbulence model wilcox 2008 and compared the two model results both turbulence models generate slightly different aspects of wave deformation during propagation over the slope but yield significant differences in pressure and force calculations the difference in results from the respective turbulence models was similar to that observed between ihfoam and fluent using the κ ε model when using κ ω sst in ihfoam the simulated wave tends to shoal and break further offshore over the sloped bathymetry consequently κ ω sst results slightly overestimated pressures and forces for non breaking waves and underestimated the measurement for both breaking and broken wave conditions however as observed in section 4 the results of the κ ε model show good agreement with non breaking wave induced pressures and forces while tending to underestimate those produced by breaking waves and overestimate those produced by broken waves the courant number co is also a significant variable for model stability and computation time we set a constant co 0 5 as the default for both ihfoam and fluent simulations but evaluate the sensitivity of co by applying various co such as co 1 0 0 5 0 25 and 0 1 for m2 in ihfoam the results show that the computation time increased as co decreased this is expected but there are not even minor changes of surface elevation pressure and forces for all three wave conditions in ihfoam therefore the computation time step utilized in the model co 1 0 was small enough to achieve the highest resolution for the current model set up this result implies that other disagreements between modeled and measured data such as the negative pressure fig 9 and short peaky pressures at bottom face of the specimen e g fig 10 were not induced from computation time parameters as a future work we will evaluate the effects of finer mesh 0 01 m and different turbulence models e g les for model

23397,the post cyclic undrained shear characteristics of marine silty clay was investigated by conducting a series of cyclic triaxial tests on undisturbed specimens the effects of confining pressure initial undrained shear stress ratio q s p 0 cyclic stress ratio q cy p 0 and number of cycles n on the post cyclic undrained shear behavior were investigated results show that the post cyclic shear strength decreases with the increase in q s p 0 q cy p 0 and n the confining pressure has no apparent effect on the normalized post cyclic monotonic undrained shear strength for the silty clay during the post cyclic shear the specimens with small q s p 0 and q cy p 0 contract while the cases with large q s p 0 and q cy p 0 dilate also the terminal value of normalized post cyclic shear induced excess pore pressure decreases with q s p 0 or q cy p 0 increasing the equivalent hvorslev line ehl was proposed to form a failure envelop for the post cyclic silty clay and the slope of ehl increases with the increase in q cy p 0 or q s p 0 regardless of the number of cycles moreover a post cyclic strength model which could consider the influence of initial shear stress and previous cyclic loading history was proposed on the basis of yasuhara model this model demonstrates a good agreement with the test results keywords silty clay post cyclic behavior initial shear stress strength degradation effective stress path modelling 1 introduction the behavior of marine silty clay subjected to cyclic loading such as earthquakes and storm waves is of great interest in the design of nearshore and offshore structures such soils with the characteristics of high water content high void ratio and low strength are widely distributed in the coastal area of china on which more and more coastal structures have been constructed the marine silty clay beneath the coastal structures is subjected to wave load for a long time one of the major issues in the design of such structures is the post cyclic shear behavior of the clay when the clay is subjected to the undrained cyclic loading the cyclic induced pore pressure will gradually grow and the effective mean principle pressure of normally consolidated soil progressively decreased if an undrained monotonic test on the specimen is followed the clay after cyclic loading may behave similar to the overconsolidated specimen which refers to the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation the monotonic shear strength measured after cyclic loading is often lower than the strength of the soils without cyclic loading history many researchers also have investigated the degradation of post cyclic strength for different types of soils by conducting different tests including cyclic triaxial tests and direct simple shear tests thiers and seed 1968 andersen et al 1980 1988 kaya and erken 2015 wang et al 2015b moreover yasuhara et al 1992 1994 studied the post cyclic characteristics of the reconstituted ariake clay and found that the post cyclic undrained shear strength can be well evaluated by the cyclic induced pore pressure based on the theory of equivalent overconsolidation wang et al 2013 founded that the yield shear strength of the low plasticity mrv silt were reduced with an increase in excess pore pressure ratio and the reductions were significant about 80 for yield shear strength when the excess pore pressure ratio was greater than 0 70 above all the post cyclic strength degradation behavior is directly related to the development of pore pressure which is identified as cyclic induced pore pressure in previous studies however if a specimen is subjected to an initial undrained shear stress a certain amount of initial shear induced excess pore pressure can be produced and it can also affect the post cyclic strength and critical characteristic of the soils therefore to further clarify the effect of pore pressure developing in different stages on post cyclic shear behavior more researches are required the cyclic loading history can affect the shear strength characteristics after cyclic loading but its effect on post cyclic critical strength parameters is controversial li et al 2011 concluded that although the post cyclic shear strength decreases the previous undrained cyclic loading seemed to have little influence on the critical strength property of the normally consolidated clay similar observations were made by tavakoli et al 2011 on mixture sand clay and by yasuhara 1982 on ariake clay however andersen et al 1980 observed a higher post cyclic cohesion intercept indicated in the test results for normally consolidated specimens and moses et al 2003 found a reduced value of cohesion intercept and internal friction angle instead wang et al 2015a concluded that the critical stress line is not unique for silts by carrying out a series of triaxial tests of mrv silts the line can be changed with cyclic loading history as the excess pore pressure ratio reaches a value of 1 0 above all although many researchers have studied the critical post cyclic strength characteristics the effect of undrained cyclic loading history on the post cyclic critical strength parameters exists significant differences therefore the influence of cyclic loading history on critical strength parameters and the development of post cyclic effective stress paths esps for silty clay are required additional efforts the model for evaluating the effect of cyclic loading on shear strength has been widely investigated one type among these models developed based on the concept of degradation parameter t introduced by idriss et al 1978 such as the model of zhou and gong 2011 and matasovic and vucetic 1995 can predict the cyclic shear strength due to stiffness degradation but cannot calculate the post cyclic shear strength other types of models such as the anisotropic elastic viscoplastic model li et al 2011 and the anisotropic hardening model mroz et al 1978 are not commonly used to evaluate the post cyclic strength in practical application based on the concept of equivalent overconsolidation yasuhara et al 2003 established another type of model to evaluate the post cyclic strength of clay the same type of models was also proposed by wang et al 2015a matsui et al 1992 and soroush and soltani jigheh 2009 and so on the model proposed by yasuhara was easy to use and of explicit physical meaning however this model was developed on the basis of isotropic consolidation without considering the effect of initial shear stress on post cyclic strength in actual engineering situation the soil beneath the structures tends to be subjected to complicated combinations of initial shear stress and cyclic stress according to the previous researches andersen et al 1988 hyodo et al 1993 sharma and fahey 2003 the initial shear stress is one of the most influential factors for the post cyclic strength for soil so the effect of initial shear stress should be taken into account moreover the terminal excess pore pressure measured at the end of the cyclic stage is the only parameter to reflect the influence of previous cyclic loading in the yasuhara model however this parameter cannot consider the effect of different previous cyclic loading conditions on the development of excess pore pressure during cyclic loading therefore an excess pore pressure model is required to be developed for the silty clay to evaluate the post cyclic shear strength with different previous cyclic loading history in this paper a series of triaxial tests were performed to study the post cyclic behavior of yantai silty clay first the influences of confining pressure initial undrained shear stress undrained cyclic loading and number of cycles on post cyclic undrained shear behavior of the silty clay have been discussed the developments of excess pore pressure and effective stress paths during post cyclic monotonic shear under various loading conditions was also investigated then the critical post cyclic strength characteristic of the silty clay was studied based on the development of the post cyclic esps finally a post cyclic strength model which could consider the influence of initial shear stress and previous cyclic loading history was proposed on the basis of yasuhara model and its validity and limitation was discussed 2 experimental program 2 1 apparatus and materials triaxial tests were performed using the gds dynamic triaxial testing system the undisturbed soil specimens employed in the present paper were taken from yantai port of china below seabed level of 2 5 m related average index properties of the silty clay were listed in table 1 the cylindrical silty clay specimens were 3 91 cm in diameter and 8 0 cm in height and saturated with vacuum pumping method to ensure the values of skempton pore pressure parameter b at least 95 in all tests 2 2 testing procedure the experiment procedure and relevant parameters can be illustrated by the stress strain curves in fig 1 a and the esps in fig 1 b the stress parameters of q and p are defined as q σ 1 σ 3 and p σ 1 2σ 3 3 where σ 1 and σ 3 are major and minor principal stress respectively the slope of the critical state line csl for normally consolidated clay in monotonic tests m is equal to q p f first the specimens were consolidated under confining pressure of p 0 for 24 h with the drain valve open after the consolidation drain valve was turned off and the initial undrained deviator stress q s was applied the deviator stress was allowed to sit for a while until the axial deformation and excess pore pressure of specimens remain basically unchanged and then the undrained cyclic shear stress q cy was applied on the specimen the cyclic stress was stress controlled sinusoidal load with a period of 8 sec to simulate the actual wave loading occurred in yantai sea area when studying the effect of initial shear stress q s and cyclic stress q cy on post cyclic strength the number of cycles was specified as 1500 however once the effect of the number of cycles was investigated the number of cycles varied from 50 to 2000 as presented in table 2 due to the hysteresis of excess pore pressure measurement of the silty clay the specimens after cycling were allowed to stand for a while to achieve equilibrium of excess pore pressure following the cyclic process of the specimens the undrained strain controlled monotonic tests with a strain rate of 0 1 mm min were conducted to study the post cyclic characteristics of silty clay the failure of the silty clay specimens in monotonic tests and post cyclic monotonic tests are all defined as 15 accumulated axial strain the post cyclic monotonic undrained shear strength s u cy can be acquired in addition the monotonic undrained shear strength s u nc can be obtained in the tests without cyclic loading history the s u cy and s u nc correspond to one half the deviator stress at failure moreover as shown in fig 1 b after applying the initial shear stress q s on the specimen the initial shear induced pore pressure δu s develops during the cyclic loading the cyclic induced pore pressure δu cy develops leading to a decrease in p in the stage of monotonic shear after cycling the post cyclic shear induced pore pressure δu p develops therefore the total excess pore pressure during the experiment can be written in the form as following 1 δ u δ u s δ u c y δ u p the triaxial tests in this paper fall into three categories tests with different confining pressures cot tests with different combinations of initial shear stress and cyclic stress dost and tests with different number of cycles cyst as shown in table 2 the initial shear stress ratio q s p 0 and cyclic stress ratio q cy p 0 are used to describe the load conditions of specimens all of the tests should ensure that failure would not occur during cyclic loading so several trials were conducted to figure out the maximum initial stress ratio and cyclic stress ratio 3 test results and discussion 3 1 effect of confining pressure on post cyclic undrained monotonic shear behavior in this section the effect of confining pressure on the post cyclic shear behavior of the marine silty clay with q cy p 0 0 4 was investigated consolidation process was carried out under three different mean effective confining pressure p 0 20 35 and 50 kpa meanwhile the monotonic shear tests on the specimens without previous cyclic loading were investigated for comparison fig 2 shows the effective stress paths esps plotted in q p plane of the specimens with and without previous cyclic loading under different confining pressure the slope of critical stress line csl m 1 36 can be determined by the terminal points of esps of specimens not previously subjected to cyclic loading the total stress path tsp for the specimen cot 2 p 0 35 kpa with slope 3 1 is also plotted in fig 2 for specimens not subjected to previous cyclic loading their esps progress along tsp initially then a positiveδu p develops and hence the p reduces until reaching the csl similarly the esps for specimens with previous cyclic loading cot 1 cot 2 and cot 3 also progress along tsp at initial stage but their start points located respectively to the left of the specimens cot 4 dost 4 and cot 5 due to the development of positive δu cy during cycling subsequently with continued shearing the post cyclic esps will cross the csl behaving a similar manner with the overconsolidated one the csl determined by specimens without cyclic loading is no longer applicable for specimens with cyclic loading in q p plane fig 3 shows the stress paths in e log p plane with and without previous cyclic loading under different confining pressure the csl in e log p plane can be determined by the terminal points of the stress paths for specimens cot 1 cot 2 and cot 3 the normal consolidation line ncl with a slope of 0 205 and the swelling line sl with a slope of 0 035 can also be plotted in fig 3 for purpose of clarity in fig 3 the symbol p cyc indicates the specimens with previous cyclic loading and the symbol no cyc indicates the specimens with no cyclic loading history due to the undrained condition during the shear process the volumetric strain of all specimens remains unchanged and so does the void ratio when the specimens are sheared to failure the critical state points can be obtained in e log p plane the critical state points of post cyclic specimens located to the left to that of specimens with no previous cyclic loading the csl p cyc and csl no cyc can be determined by linear fitting of the critical state points for the specimens with and without previous cyclic loading respectively it can be seen that the csls are not parallel to the ncl and different from each other the similar observation is made by wang et al 2015a for mrv silt fig 4 presents the relationship between normalized deviator stress and axial strain under three different confining pressure this is done to investigate the influence of normalizing the post cyclic shear behavior for the silty clay with respect to monotonic undrained shear strength as presented in fig 4 the value of axial strain is not equal to zero at the beginning of post cyclic shearing due to the accumulation of axial strain during cycling the normalized deviator stress increases with an increase in axial strain and its growth rate is higher at initial stages than at terminal stage of shearing the shapes between post cyclic normalized stress strain curves are similar and the maximum values of normalized deviator stress for each curves have not much difference it is concluded that the confining pressure has no apparent effect on the normalized post cyclic undrained shear behavior the post cyclic shearing curves can also be normalized with respect to the monotonic shear strength regardless of the confining pressure therefore a specified value of confining pressure p 0 35 kpa can be adopted to investigate the effect of other factors on post cyclic shear behavior of the silty clay 3 2 effect of the number of cycles on post cyclic shear behavior the q s p 0 0 0 and q cy p 0 0 4 were specified for investigating the effect of the number of cycles from 50 to 2000 fig 5 shows the post cyclic esps for specimens after multiple loading cycles as shown in fig 5 the start point of each curve moves along the negative direction of axial of p with the increase in number of cycles during cyclic loading resulting in a reduction in p the terminal point of each post cyclic esp will also cross the csl similar to that of esp of overconsolidated specimens in the critical state soil mechanics it has been found that a straight line called hvorslev line approximates satisfactorily the failure envelop for over consolidated soils on the dry side schofield and wroth 1968 therefore a straight line on the dry side can be formed similar to the hvorslev line as the failure envelop for post cyclic silty clay specimens named equivalent hvorslev line ehl the terminal point of the esp for specimen cot 2 is on one end of the ehl and the other end of the ehl is on the tension cut off line as presented in fig 5 the slope of ehl basically remains intact 0 589 for specimens with q cy p 0 0 4 and q s p 0 0 0 irrespective of the number of cycles the post cyclic monotonic shear strength s u cy can be normalized with respect to the static monotonic shear strength s u nc to assess the level of post cyclic strength degradation for a silty clay specimen due to previous cyclic loading the physical meaning of normalized post cyclic strength is the post cyclic strength degradation rate represented by the symbol β as shown in eq 2 2 β s u c y s u n c the relationship between the post cyclic strength degradation rate and the number of cycles can be seen in fig 6 there is a large scatter in the test data in β n plot however the degradation tendency of β with the increase in the number of cycles can be easily observed besides fig 6 shows the decrease rate of β reduced with the increase in n with the n less than 300 the decrease rate of β is large and its maximum value is 0 15 once the n larger than 800 the decrease rate of β tends to be zero therefore the decrease rate of β varies in the range of 0 0 15 with different loading cycles in contradistinction to the scatter plot for β the curve of cyclic induced pore pressure against n for specimen cyst 14 can also be plotted in fig 6 with the increase of n the normalized pore pressure increases in a reduced growth rate showing a negative correlation with β it concludes that the post cyclic strength degradation rate is associated with the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure and may be evaluated by this pore pressure 3 3 effects of qs p0 and qcy p0 on post cyclic undrained shear behavior fig 7 shows the normalized initial shear induced pore pressure δu s p 0 versus initial shear stress ratio q s p 0 after initial shearing as presented in fig 7 the normalized initial shear induced pore pressure δu s p 0 increase with the increase in q s p 0 and a nearly linear relationship between the δu s p 0 and q s p 0 can be found the data points can be best fitted with a straight line through the origin with a slope of 0 156 fig 8 shows the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure δu cy p 0 after cyclic loading versus initial shear stress ratio q s p 0 after 1500 cycles the maximum normalized cyclic induced pore pressure δu cy p 0 increase with the increase in q cy p 0 irrespective of q s p 0 it can be concluded that the level of initial shear stress have a minuscule effect on the terminal values of δu cy p 0 when a steady state of cycling is reached fig 9 a b c and d show the relationship between the normalized post cyclic shear induced pore pressure δu p p 0 and the axial strain ε a for the specimens with different q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the initial shear stress ratios include 0 0 0 4 and 0 8 and the cyclic stress ratios include 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 there is a substantial difference in the normalized post cyclic monotonic pore pressure behavior for specimens in fig 9 a b c and d the initial values of ε a for curves in fig 9 are different at the beginning of the post cyclic shear this is because the initial shear stress and the cyclic stress have a previous shear effect on the specimens before the post cyclic shear so that a certain amount of accumulative strain is produced moreover the greater the q s p 0 and q cy p 0 are the larger the corresponding initial value of ε a before shearing besides it can be seen that the specimens dost 3 and the cases in fig 9 a and b develop throughout positive pore pressure during post cyclic monotonic shearing contraction tendency conversely specimens dost 7 dost 11 and cases in fig 9 d develop a negative normalized post cyclic shear induced pore pressure during shearing dilative tendency to some extent the reason for the behavior can be explained using critical accumulated pore pressure u k which is defined as the accumulated pore pressure in which the soil neither dilate nor contract during monotonic shear at smaller q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the development in accumulated pore pressure of specimens is below the critical value during post cyclic shear and thus the specimens contract however with the increase in q s p 0 or q cy p 0 the accumulated pore pressure for specimens reach and exceed the critical value and hence the dilative behavior is presented in the soil moreover fig 9 a shows a near linear correlation betweenδu p p 0 and ε a for specimen dost 1 but for specimens dost 2 12 a near stable stage can be reached for each curve at larger axial strain as shown in fig 9 a b c and d during post cyclic shearing the δu p p 0 from 0 176 to 0 206 decrease with the increase in q s p 0 besides it can be found that with the same q s p 0 the δu p p 0 at failure decrease with the increase in q cy p 0 the post cyclic strength degradation rate β versus q s p 0 and q cy p 0 is plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that β decreases with the increase in q s p 0 and q cy p 0 and its rate of decrease increases with increasing q cy p 0 fig 11 a b and c show the post cyclic undrained monotonic esps for specimens with different q s p 0 and q cy p 0 in p q plane the critical state line determined in monotonic tests and the equivalent hvorslev line slope 0 589 determined in section 3 3 are also plotted in fig 11 a b and c in fig 11 a for q s p 0 0 the ehl with slope 0 589 can only predict the critical state for specimen dost 8 q cy p 0 0 4 however for the cases with q cy p 0 no more than 0 3 the terminal points of the esps will located on a new ehl with slope of 0 293 similarly in fig 11 b for q s p 0 0 4 the slope 0 301 for specimen dost 5 q cy p 0 0 1 and slope 0 790 for specimen dost 8 can be obtained in fig 11 c with q s p 0 0 8 for specimen dost 11 and dost 12 the ehl with slope 0 801 and the slope 1 098 can be obtained respectively it can be concluded that the increase in q s p 0 or q cy p 0 all lead to an increase in the slope of ehl and the ehl for the specimens with larger q s p 0 and q cy p 0 will be close to the csl this can be explained by the change in the fabric of clay specimens with small q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the fabric of the specimen may not be changed during cyclic loading and the behavior of post cyclic strength degradation is mainly caused by the development in cyclic induced pore pressure as q s p 0 and q cy p 0 increase the arrangement of clay grains is changed during cycling and thus the post cyclic behavior is changed at this moment the post cyclic strength is mainly affected by the change in the fabric of silty clay specimens and once a combination of large q cy p 0 and q s p 0 applied the failure for clay specimen during cycling may be caused 4 post cyclic undrained shear strength model yasuhara et al 1992 2003 has proposed a model to evaluate the post cyclic undrained shear strength based on the concept of equivalent overconsolidation for clay the model has clear physical meaning and predicts the post cyclic shear strength well however as pointed above the effect of initial shear stress and previous cyclic loading history on the post cyclic strength degradation cannot be considered in the model therefore the post cyclic strength model of yasuhara is modified in this section the equivalent overconsolidation behavior for clay and the derivation of yasuhara model may be illustrated by fig 12 in e logp plane during undrained cyclic shear a normally consolidated clay specimen at point a reaches point b the specimen may behave in a similar manner to an overconsolidated clay specimen produced by unloading from point d to point b matsui et al 1992 yasuhara et al 1992 with ocr p d p b the clay therefore can be regarded as equivalent overconsolidated the equivalent overconsolidated ratio ocr eq due to cyclic loading can be defined in eq 3 3 o c r e q p a p b p a p a δ u as can be seen in q p plane for normally consolidated clay at point a and point d a positive correlation between the static monotonic shear strength and effective confining pressure can be expressed as s u d nc s u a nc p d p a meanwhile the undrained strength of overconsolidated clay due to unloading can be estimated using s u oc s u nc ocr λ0 mayhe 1980 based on the formulas the model for evaluating the post cyclic undrained shear strength can be derived by yasuhara et al 1992 as shown in eq 4 4 s u c y s u n c o c r e q λ 0 1 c s c c 1 1 δ u p 0 1 λ 0 1 c s c c where c s is the swelling index c c is the compression index λ 0 is the experimental parameter 4 1 modification to consider effect of initial shear stress it can be seen in eq 4 the post cyclic strength of clay depends on the ocr eq associated with the distance of point a from point b corresponding to δu cy in order to consider the effect of initial shear stress the definition of the term δp lim in sharma and fahey 2003 is used the original definition of ocr eq is modified as follows and named as ocr eq s hereafter 5 o c r e q s δ p lim δ p lim δ u c y where δp lim is the limiting distance between the stress state point of f after an initial shear stress q s applied and the csl as shown in fig 13 point k corresponds to the failure point for a specimen on which a monotonic test is carried the physical meaning of δp lim refers to the maximum cyclic induced pore pressure developing in the clay specimen during cyclic loading in accordance with the relationship of δu s p 0 against q s p 0 in fig 7 a the data points of f can be best fitted using a straight line through point a in q p plane on the basis of the geometric relationship in fig 13 the equation for calculating δp lim can be obtained as shown in eq 6 and the value of the coefficient ω is 0 567 by linear fitting 6 δ p lim ω q s p a for normally consolidated clay specimens at point a its mean effective principle stress p a is equal to its confining pressure p 0 therefore the post cyclic strength model considering the effect of initial shear stress on the normalized post cyclic shear strength can be obtained by substituting eq 5 and eq 6 into eq 4 7 s u c y s u n c o c r e q s λ 0 1 c s c c 1 1 δ u c y ω q s p 0 1 λ 0 1 c s c c fig 14 shows a comparison between predicted and measured post cyclic strength degradation rate with different initial shear stress ratios it can be seen that with the test parameter λ 0 0 70 and ω 0 567 the results calculated by eq 7 are in good agreement with the experimental results the value of λ 0 for marine silty clay has little difference with the value of λ 0 0 683 adopted by yasuhara et al 2003 for low plasticity silt 4 2 modification to consider cyclic loading history in eq 7 the predicted post cyclic monotonic shear strength is computed on a known δu cy if the post cyclic shear strength needs to be evaluated with different cyclic loading history an empirical pore pressure model needs to be built however it is difficult to develop a general cyclic induced pore pressure model to compute δu cy therefore different types of empirical pore pressure models have been built including the polynomial form matasovic and vucetic 1992 1995 the exponential form soltani jigheh et al 2012 and so on fig 15 illustrates the near linear correlation between the inverse of normalized cyclic induced pore pressure and the inverse of loading cycles therefore the hyperbolic form is chosen to develop the empirical pore pressure model for silty clay as shown in eq 8 8 δ u c y p 0 n α n κ where α and κ are the experimental parameters the parameter α decides the ultimate value of the pore pressure during cycling and the parameter κ decides the shape of curves of δu cy versus n eq 9 which can be used to effectively predict the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure is estimated by fitting the measured results a reasonably good prediction for the measured normalized cyclic induced pore pressure during cyclic loading can be seen in fig 16 a b and c and the relative errors between the predicted and measured results are in a range of 15 showed in fig 17 9 δ u c y p 0 n a b q c y p 0 n c q c y p 0 d q s p 0 e where a b and c are cyclic induced pore pressure constants and for the silty clay a b c d and e equal to 5 45 9 72 202 68 393 51 and 34 45 respectively the post cyclic shear strength model obtained in section 4 1 can be further modified by submitting eq 9 into eq 7 to evaluate the post cyclic shear strength degradation rate of the silty clay under different loading cycles as shown in eq 10 10 β 1 1 1 ω q s p 0 n a b q c y p 0 n c q c y p 0 d q s p 0 e 4 3 validation of the modified model first in order to validate the accuracy and reasonability of the model for prediction of post cyclic strength under different confining pressure the relative error between the predicted by eq 10 and measured data were calculated the results show that the errors for specimens with confining pressure of 20 kpa 35 kpa and 50 kpa are 5 25 2 10 and 5 59 respectively moreover fig 18 a and b show a comparison between the post cyclic strength degradation rate predicted by eq 10 and the measured data fig 18 a shows the comparison of measured and predicted β under various q cy p 0 and q s p 0 when q cy p 0 tends to be zero the prediction curves of post cyclic strength degradation rate occur a distinguished position as shown in fig 18 a it is caused due to the appearance of the cyclic loading leading to a substantial change in the predicated cyclic induced pore pressure at small number of cycles fig 18 b shows the predicted and measured of β versus n for q cy p 0 0 4 and q s p 0 0 0 both fig 18 a and b show that eq 10 gives a good prediction for the post cyclic undrained monotonic shear strength for the silty clay the accuracy reasonability feasibility and reliability of the proposed model can be validated the previous study showed that there exists a critical shear strain level for the soils erken and ülker 2007 higher than which the post cyclic strength rapidly reduced the tests in this paper focused on the post cyclic behavior of the specimens which can reach cyclic stability during cyclic loading so whether the model proposed is suitable for the specimens with the cyclic level higher than the critical value needs further verification moreover the coefficients of proposed model were fitted based on limited test data of cyclic stress controlled experiments so these coefficients need to be generalized using more test results obtained from laboratory tests 5 conclusions in this paper a series of cyclic triaxial tests on marine silty clay specimens were carried out to study its post cyclic strength behavior the following conclusions can be drawn based on the test results 1 the csl determined for specimens without previously cyclic loading under different confining pressure is no longer applicable for specimens with cyclic loading history and the confining pressure has no apparent effect on the normalized post cyclic monotonic undrained shear strength 2 the equivalent hvorslev line ehl was proposed to form a failure envelop for post cyclic silty clay on the dry side in q p plane based on the critical state soil mechanics with a specified q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the slope of ehl remains intact irrespectively of the number of cycles but the increase in q s p 0 or q cy p 0 all lead to a substantial increase in the slope of ehl 3 with the increase in the number of cycles the post cyclic strength degradation rate decreases in a reduced growth rate showing a negative correlation with the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure it illustrates that the post cyclic strength degradation rate is associated with the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure and can be evaluated by the pore pressure 4 a near linear correlation between the δu s p 0 and q s p 0 was found the level of initial shear stress has a minuscule effect on the development of δu cy p 0 during the post cyclic shearing the specimens with small q s p 0 and q cy p 0 contract while the cases with large q s p 0 and q cy p 0 dilate also the terminal value of normalized post cyclic shear induced pore pressure decreases with increasing q s p 0 or q cy p 0 5 the yasuhara model was modified based on a modified definition of ocr eq s for evaluating the post cyclic shear strength with the initial shear stress applied substantially an empirical cyclic induced pore pressure model was estimated and then submitted into the modified yasuhara model to consider the effect of the number of cycles on the post cyclic strength the modified yasuhara model for evaluating the post cyclic strength of the silty clay demonstrates a good agreement with the test results acknowledgements this work was supported by the national science foundation of china grant number 51679166 the national key research and

23397,the post cyclic undrained shear characteristics of marine silty clay was investigated by conducting a series of cyclic triaxial tests on undisturbed specimens the effects of confining pressure initial undrained shear stress ratio q s p 0 cyclic stress ratio q cy p 0 and number of cycles n on the post cyclic undrained shear behavior were investigated results show that the post cyclic shear strength decreases with the increase in q s p 0 q cy p 0 and n the confining pressure has no apparent effect on the normalized post cyclic monotonic undrained shear strength for the silty clay during the post cyclic shear the specimens with small q s p 0 and q cy p 0 contract while the cases with large q s p 0 and q cy p 0 dilate also the terminal value of normalized post cyclic shear induced excess pore pressure decreases with q s p 0 or q cy p 0 increasing the equivalent hvorslev line ehl was proposed to form a failure envelop for the post cyclic silty clay and the slope of ehl increases with the increase in q cy p 0 or q s p 0 regardless of the number of cycles moreover a post cyclic strength model which could consider the influence of initial shear stress and previous cyclic loading history was proposed on the basis of yasuhara model this model demonstrates a good agreement with the test results keywords silty clay post cyclic behavior initial shear stress strength degradation effective stress path modelling 1 introduction the behavior of marine silty clay subjected to cyclic loading such as earthquakes and storm waves is of great interest in the design of nearshore and offshore structures such soils with the characteristics of high water content high void ratio and low strength are widely distributed in the coastal area of china on which more and more coastal structures have been constructed the marine silty clay beneath the coastal structures is subjected to wave load for a long time one of the major issues in the design of such structures is the post cyclic shear behavior of the clay when the clay is subjected to the undrained cyclic loading the cyclic induced pore pressure will gradually grow and the effective mean principle pressure of normally consolidated soil progressively decreased if an undrained monotonic test on the specimen is followed the clay after cyclic loading may behave similar to the overconsolidated specimen which refers to the phenomenon of equivalent overconsolidation the monotonic shear strength measured after cyclic loading is often lower than the strength of the soils without cyclic loading history many researchers also have investigated the degradation of post cyclic strength for different types of soils by conducting different tests including cyclic triaxial tests and direct simple shear tests thiers and seed 1968 andersen et al 1980 1988 kaya and erken 2015 wang et al 2015b moreover yasuhara et al 1992 1994 studied the post cyclic characteristics of the reconstituted ariake clay and found that the post cyclic undrained shear strength can be well evaluated by the cyclic induced pore pressure based on the theory of equivalent overconsolidation wang et al 2013 founded that the yield shear strength of the low plasticity mrv silt were reduced with an increase in excess pore pressure ratio and the reductions were significant about 80 for yield shear strength when the excess pore pressure ratio was greater than 0 70 above all the post cyclic strength degradation behavior is directly related to the development of pore pressure which is identified as cyclic induced pore pressure in previous studies however if a specimen is subjected to an initial undrained shear stress a certain amount of initial shear induced excess pore pressure can be produced and it can also affect the post cyclic strength and critical characteristic of the soils therefore to further clarify the effect of pore pressure developing in different stages on post cyclic shear behavior more researches are required the cyclic loading history can affect the shear strength characteristics after cyclic loading but its effect on post cyclic critical strength parameters is controversial li et al 2011 concluded that although the post cyclic shear strength decreases the previous undrained cyclic loading seemed to have little influence on the critical strength property of the normally consolidated clay similar observations were made by tavakoli et al 2011 on mixture sand clay and by yasuhara 1982 on ariake clay however andersen et al 1980 observed a higher post cyclic cohesion intercept indicated in the test results for normally consolidated specimens and moses et al 2003 found a reduced value of cohesion intercept and internal friction angle instead wang et al 2015a concluded that the critical stress line is not unique for silts by carrying out a series of triaxial tests of mrv silts the line can be changed with cyclic loading history as the excess pore pressure ratio reaches a value of 1 0 above all although many researchers have studied the critical post cyclic strength characteristics the effect of undrained cyclic loading history on the post cyclic critical strength parameters exists significant differences therefore the influence of cyclic loading history on critical strength parameters and the development of post cyclic effective stress paths esps for silty clay are required additional efforts the model for evaluating the effect of cyclic loading on shear strength has been widely investigated one type among these models developed based on the concept of degradation parameter t introduced by idriss et al 1978 such as the model of zhou and gong 2011 and matasovic and vucetic 1995 can predict the cyclic shear strength due to stiffness degradation but cannot calculate the post cyclic shear strength other types of models such as the anisotropic elastic viscoplastic model li et al 2011 and the anisotropic hardening model mroz et al 1978 are not commonly used to evaluate the post cyclic strength in practical application based on the concept of equivalent overconsolidation yasuhara et al 2003 established another type of model to evaluate the post cyclic strength of clay the same type of models was also proposed by wang et al 2015a matsui et al 1992 and soroush and soltani jigheh 2009 and so on the model proposed by yasuhara was easy to use and of explicit physical meaning however this model was developed on the basis of isotropic consolidation without considering the effect of initial shear stress on post cyclic strength in actual engineering situation the soil beneath the structures tends to be subjected to complicated combinations of initial shear stress and cyclic stress according to the previous researches andersen et al 1988 hyodo et al 1993 sharma and fahey 2003 the initial shear stress is one of the most influential factors for the post cyclic strength for soil so the effect of initial shear stress should be taken into account moreover the terminal excess pore pressure measured at the end of the cyclic stage is the only parameter to reflect the influence of previous cyclic loading in the yasuhara model however this parameter cannot consider the effect of different previous cyclic loading conditions on the development of excess pore pressure during cyclic loading therefore an excess pore pressure model is required to be developed for the silty clay to evaluate the post cyclic shear strength with different previous cyclic loading history in this paper a series of triaxial tests were performed to study the post cyclic behavior of yantai silty clay first the influences of confining pressure initial undrained shear stress undrained cyclic loading and number of cycles on post cyclic undrained shear behavior of the silty clay have been discussed the developments of excess pore pressure and effective stress paths during post cyclic monotonic shear under various loading conditions was also investigated then the critical post cyclic strength characteristic of the silty clay was studied based on the development of the post cyclic esps finally a post cyclic strength model which could consider the influence of initial shear stress and previous cyclic loading history was proposed on the basis of yasuhara model and its validity and limitation was discussed 2 experimental program 2 1 apparatus and materials triaxial tests were performed using the gds dynamic triaxial testing system the undisturbed soil specimens employed in the present paper were taken from yantai port of china below seabed level of 2 5 m related average index properties of the silty clay were listed in table 1 the cylindrical silty clay specimens were 3 91 cm in diameter and 8 0 cm in height and saturated with vacuum pumping method to ensure the values of skempton pore pressure parameter b at least 95 in all tests 2 2 testing procedure the experiment procedure and relevant parameters can be illustrated by the stress strain curves in fig 1 a and the esps in fig 1 b the stress parameters of q and p are defined as q σ 1 σ 3 and p σ 1 2σ 3 3 where σ 1 and σ 3 are major and minor principal stress respectively the slope of the critical state line csl for normally consolidated clay in monotonic tests m is equal to q p f first the specimens were consolidated under confining pressure of p 0 for 24 h with the drain valve open after the consolidation drain valve was turned off and the initial undrained deviator stress q s was applied the deviator stress was allowed to sit for a while until the axial deformation and excess pore pressure of specimens remain basically unchanged and then the undrained cyclic shear stress q cy was applied on the specimen the cyclic stress was stress controlled sinusoidal load with a period of 8 sec to simulate the actual wave loading occurred in yantai sea area when studying the effect of initial shear stress q s and cyclic stress q cy on post cyclic strength the number of cycles was specified as 1500 however once the effect of the number of cycles was investigated the number of cycles varied from 50 to 2000 as presented in table 2 due to the hysteresis of excess pore pressure measurement of the silty clay the specimens after cycling were allowed to stand for a while to achieve equilibrium of excess pore pressure following the cyclic process of the specimens the undrained strain controlled monotonic tests with a strain rate of 0 1 mm min were conducted to study the post cyclic characteristics of silty clay the failure of the silty clay specimens in monotonic tests and post cyclic monotonic tests are all defined as 15 accumulated axial strain the post cyclic monotonic undrained shear strength s u cy can be acquired in addition the monotonic undrained shear strength s u nc can be obtained in the tests without cyclic loading history the s u cy and s u nc correspond to one half the deviator stress at failure moreover as shown in fig 1 b after applying the initial shear stress q s on the specimen the initial shear induced pore pressure δu s develops during the cyclic loading the cyclic induced pore pressure δu cy develops leading to a decrease in p in the stage of monotonic shear after cycling the post cyclic shear induced pore pressure δu p develops therefore the total excess pore pressure during the experiment can be written in the form as following 1 δ u δ u s δ u c y δ u p the triaxial tests in this paper fall into three categories tests with different confining pressures cot tests with different combinations of initial shear stress and cyclic stress dost and tests with different number of cycles cyst as shown in table 2 the initial shear stress ratio q s p 0 and cyclic stress ratio q cy p 0 are used to describe the load conditions of specimens all of the tests should ensure that failure would not occur during cyclic loading so several trials were conducted to figure out the maximum initial stress ratio and cyclic stress ratio 3 test results and discussion 3 1 effect of confining pressure on post cyclic undrained monotonic shear behavior in this section the effect of confining pressure on the post cyclic shear behavior of the marine silty clay with q cy p 0 0 4 was investigated consolidation process was carried out under three different mean effective confining pressure p 0 20 35 and 50 kpa meanwhile the monotonic shear tests on the specimens without previous cyclic loading were investigated for comparison fig 2 shows the effective stress paths esps plotted in q p plane of the specimens with and without previous cyclic loading under different confining pressure the slope of critical stress line csl m 1 36 can be determined by the terminal points of esps of specimens not previously subjected to cyclic loading the total stress path tsp for the specimen cot 2 p 0 35 kpa with slope 3 1 is also plotted in fig 2 for specimens not subjected to previous cyclic loading their esps progress along tsp initially then a positiveδu p develops and hence the p reduces until reaching the csl similarly the esps for specimens with previous cyclic loading cot 1 cot 2 and cot 3 also progress along tsp at initial stage but their start points located respectively to the left of the specimens cot 4 dost 4 and cot 5 due to the development of positive δu cy during cycling subsequently with continued shearing the post cyclic esps will cross the csl behaving a similar manner with the overconsolidated one the csl determined by specimens without cyclic loading is no longer applicable for specimens with cyclic loading in q p plane fig 3 shows the stress paths in e log p plane with and without previous cyclic loading under different confining pressure the csl in e log p plane can be determined by the terminal points of the stress paths for specimens cot 1 cot 2 and cot 3 the normal consolidation line ncl with a slope of 0 205 and the swelling line sl with a slope of 0 035 can also be plotted in fig 3 for purpose of clarity in fig 3 the symbol p cyc indicates the specimens with previous cyclic loading and the symbol no cyc indicates the specimens with no cyclic loading history due to the undrained condition during the shear process the volumetric strain of all specimens remains unchanged and so does the void ratio when the specimens are sheared to failure the critical state points can be obtained in e log p plane the critical state points of post cyclic specimens located to the left to that of specimens with no previous cyclic loading the csl p cyc and csl no cyc can be determined by linear fitting of the critical state points for the specimens with and without previous cyclic loading respectively it can be seen that the csls are not parallel to the ncl and different from each other the similar observation is made by wang et al 2015a for mrv silt fig 4 presents the relationship between normalized deviator stress and axial strain under three different confining pressure this is done to investigate the influence of normalizing the post cyclic shear behavior for the silty clay with respect to monotonic undrained shear strength as presented in fig 4 the value of axial strain is not equal to zero at the beginning of post cyclic shearing due to the accumulation of axial strain during cycling the normalized deviator stress increases with an increase in axial strain and its growth rate is higher at initial stages than at terminal stage of shearing the shapes between post cyclic normalized stress strain curves are similar and the maximum values of normalized deviator stress for each curves have not much difference it is concluded that the confining pressure has no apparent effect on the normalized post cyclic undrained shear behavior the post cyclic shearing curves can also be normalized with respect to the monotonic shear strength regardless of the confining pressure therefore a specified value of confining pressure p 0 35 kpa can be adopted to investigate the effect of other factors on post cyclic shear behavior of the silty clay 3 2 effect of the number of cycles on post cyclic shear behavior the q s p 0 0 0 and q cy p 0 0 4 were specified for investigating the effect of the number of cycles from 50 to 2000 fig 5 shows the post cyclic esps for specimens after multiple loading cycles as shown in fig 5 the start point of each curve moves along the negative direction of axial of p with the increase in number of cycles during cyclic loading resulting in a reduction in p the terminal point of each post cyclic esp will also cross the csl similar to that of esp of overconsolidated specimens in the critical state soil mechanics it has been found that a straight line called hvorslev line approximates satisfactorily the failure envelop for over consolidated soils on the dry side schofield and wroth 1968 therefore a straight line on the dry side can be formed similar to the hvorslev line as the failure envelop for post cyclic silty clay specimens named equivalent hvorslev line ehl the terminal point of the esp for specimen cot 2 is on one end of the ehl and the other end of the ehl is on the tension cut off line as presented in fig 5 the slope of ehl basically remains intact 0 589 for specimens with q cy p 0 0 4 and q s p 0 0 0 irrespective of the number of cycles the post cyclic monotonic shear strength s u cy can be normalized with respect to the static monotonic shear strength s u nc to assess the level of post cyclic strength degradation for a silty clay specimen due to previous cyclic loading the physical meaning of normalized post cyclic strength is the post cyclic strength degradation rate represented by the symbol β as shown in eq 2 2 β s u c y s u n c the relationship between the post cyclic strength degradation rate and the number of cycles can be seen in fig 6 there is a large scatter in the test data in β n plot however the degradation tendency of β with the increase in the number of cycles can be easily observed besides fig 6 shows the decrease rate of β reduced with the increase in n with the n less than 300 the decrease rate of β is large and its maximum value is 0 15 once the n larger than 800 the decrease rate of β tends to be zero therefore the decrease rate of β varies in the range of 0 0 15 with different loading cycles in contradistinction to the scatter plot for β the curve of cyclic induced pore pressure against n for specimen cyst 14 can also be plotted in fig 6 with the increase of n the normalized pore pressure increases in a reduced growth rate showing a negative correlation with β it concludes that the post cyclic strength degradation rate is associated with the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure and may be evaluated by this pore pressure 3 3 effects of qs p0 and qcy p0 on post cyclic undrained shear behavior fig 7 shows the normalized initial shear induced pore pressure δu s p 0 versus initial shear stress ratio q s p 0 after initial shearing as presented in fig 7 the normalized initial shear induced pore pressure δu s p 0 increase with the increase in q s p 0 and a nearly linear relationship between the δu s p 0 and q s p 0 can be found the data points can be best fitted with a straight line through the origin with a slope of 0 156 fig 8 shows the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure δu cy p 0 after cyclic loading versus initial shear stress ratio q s p 0 after 1500 cycles the maximum normalized cyclic induced pore pressure δu cy p 0 increase with the increase in q cy p 0 irrespective of q s p 0 it can be concluded that the level of initial shear stress have a minuscule effect on the terminal values of δu cy p 0 when a steady state of cycling is reached fig 9 a b c and d show the relationship between the normalized post cyclic shear induced pore pressure δu p p 0 and the axial strain ε a for the specimens with different q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the initial shear stress ratios include 0 0 0 4 and 0 8 and the cyclic stress ratios include 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 there is a substantial difference in the normalized post cyclic monotonic pore pressure behavior for specimens in fig 9 a b c and d the initial values of ε a for curves in fig 9 are different at the beginning of the post cyclic shear this is because the initial shear stress and the cyclic stress have a previous shear effect on the specimens before the post cyclic shear so that a certain amount of accumulative strain is produced moreover the greater the q s p 0 and q cy p 0 are the larger the corresponding initial value of ε a before shearing besides it can be seen that the specimens dost 3 and the cases in fig 9 a and b develop throughout positive pore pressure during post cyclic monotonic shearing contraction tendency conversely specimens dost 7 dost 11 and cases in fig 9 d develop a negative normalized post cyclic shear induced pore pressure during shearing dilative tendency to some extent the reason for the behavior can be explained using critical accumulated pore pressure u k which is defined as the accumulated pore pressure in which the soil neither dilate nor contract during monotonic shear at smaller q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the development in accumulated pore pressure of specimens is below the critical value during post cyclic shear and thus the specimens contract however with the increase in q s p 0 or q cy p 0 the accumulated pore pressure for specimens reach and exceed the critical value and hence the dilative behavior is presented in the soil moreover fig 9 a shows a near linear correlation betweenδu p p 0 and ε a for specimen dost 1 but for specimens dost 2 12 a near stable stage can be reached for each curve at larger axial strain as shown in fig 9 a b c and d during post cyclic shearing the δu p p 0 from 0 176 to 0 206 decrease with the increase in q s p 0 besides it can be found that with the same q s p 0 the δu p p 0 at failure decrease with the increase in q cy p 0 the post cyclic strength degradation rate β versus q s p 0 and q cy p 0 is plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that β decreases with the increase in q s p 0 and q cy p 0 and its rate of decrease increases with increasing q cy p 0 fig 11 a b and c show the post cyclic undrained monotonic esps for specimens with different q s p 0 and q cy p 0 in p q plane the critical state line determined in monotonic tests and the equivalent hvorslev line slope 0 589 determined in section 3 3 are also plotted in fig 11 a b and c in fig 11 a for q s p 0 0 the ehl with slope 0 589 can only predict the critical state for specimen dost 8 q cy p 0 0 4 however for the cases with q cy p 0 no more than 0 3 the terminal points of the esps will located on a new ehl with slope of 0 293 similarly in fig 11 b for q s p 0 0 4 the slope 0 301 for specimen dost 5 q cy p 0 0 1 and slope 0 790 for specimen dost 8 can be obtained in fig 11 c with q s p 0 0 8 for specimen dost 11 and dost 12 the ehl with slope 0 801 and the slope 1 098 can be obtained respectively it can be concluded that the increase in q s p 0 or q cy p 0 all lead to an increase in the slope of ehl and the ehl for the specimens with larger q s p 0 and q cy p 0 will be close to the csl this can be explained by the change in the fabric of clay specimens with small q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the fabric of the specimen may not be changed during cyclic loading and the behavior of post cyclic strength degradation is mainly caused by the development in cyclic induced pore pressure as q s p 0 and q cy p 0 increase the arrangement of clay grains is changed during cycling and thus the post cyclic behavior is changed at this moment the post cyclic strength is mainly affected by the change in the fabric of silty clay specimens and once a combination of large q cy p 0 and q s p 0 applied the failure for clay specimen during cycling may be caused 4 post cyclic undrained shear strength model yasuhara et al 1992 2003 has proposed a model to evaluate the post cyclic undrained shear strength based on the concept of equivalent overconsolidation for clay the model has clear physical meaning and predicts the post cyclic shear strength well however as pointed above the effect of initial shear stress and previous cyclic loading history on the post cyclic strength degradation cannot be considered in the model therefore the post cyclic strength model of yasuhara is modified in this section the equivalent overconsolidation behavior for clay and the derivation of yasuhara model may be illustrated by fig 12 in e logp plane during undrained cyclic shear a normally consolidated clay specimen at point a reaches point b the specimen may behave in a similar manner to an overconsolidated clay specimen produced by unloading from point d to point b matsui et al 1992 yasuhara et al 1992 with ocr p d p b the clay therefore can be regarded as equivalent overconsolidated the equivalent overconsolidated ratio ocr eq due to cyclic loading can be defined in eq 3 3 o c r e q p a p b p a p a δ u as can be seen in q p plane for normally consolidated clay at point a and point d a positive correlation between the static monotonic shear strength and effective confining pressure can be expressed as s u d nc s u a nc p d p a meanwhile the undrained strength of overconsolidated clay due to unloading can be estimated using s u oc s u nc ocr λ0 mayhe 1980 based on the formulas the model for evaluating the post cyclic undrained shear strength can be derived by yasuhara et al 1992 as shown in eq 4 4 s u c y s u n c o c r e q λ 0 1 c s c c 1 1 δ u p 0 1 λ 0 1 c s c c where c s is the swelling index c c is the compression index λ 0 is the experimental parameter 4 1 modification to consider effect of initial shear stress it can be seen in eq 4 the post cyclic strength of clay depends on the ocr eq associated with the distance of point a from point b corresponding to δu cy in order to consider the effect of initial shear stress the definition of the term δp lim in sharma and fahey 2003 is used the original definition of ocr eq is modified as follows and named as ocr eq s hereafter 5 o c r e q s δ p lim δ p lim δ u c y where δp lim is the limiting distance between the stress state point of f after an initial shear stress q s applied and the csl as shown in fig 13 point k corresponds to the failure point for a specimen on which a monotonic test is carried the physical meaning of δp lim refers to the maximum cyclic induced pore pressure developing in the clay specimen during cyclic loading in accordance with the relationship of δu s p 0 against q s p 0 in fig 7 a the data points of f can be best fitted using a straight line through point a in q p plane on the basis of the geometric relationship in fig 13 the equation for calculating δp lim can be obtained as shown in eq 6 and the value of the coefficient ω is 0 567 by linear fitting 6 δ p lim ω q s p a for normally consolidated clay specimens at point a its mean effective principle stress p a is equal to its confining pressure p 0 therefore the post cyclic strength model considering the effect of initial shear stress on the normalized post cyclic shear strength can be obtained by substituting eq 5 and eq 6 into eq 4 7 s u c y s u n c o c r e q s λ 0 1 c s c c 1 1 δ u c y ω q s p 0 1 λ 0 1 c s c c fig 14 shows a comparison between predicted and measured post cyclic strength degradation rate with different initial shear stress ratios it can be seen that with the test parameter λ 0 0 70 and ω 0 567 the results calculated by eq 7 are in good agreement with the experimental results the value of λ 0 for marine silty clay has little difference with the value of λ 0 0 683 adopted by yasuhara et al 2003 for low plasticity silt 4 2 modification to consider cyclic loading history in eq 7 the predicted post cyclic monotonic shear strength is computed on a known δu cy if the post cyclic shear strength needs to be evaluated with different cyclic loading history an empirical pore pressure model needs to be built however it is difficult to develop a general cyclic induced pore pressure model to compute δu cy therefore different types of empirical pore pressure models have been built including the polynomial form matasovic and vucetic 1992 1995 the exponential form soltani jigheh et al 2012 and so on fig 15 illustrates the near linear correlation between the inverse of normalized cyclic induced pore pressure and the inverse of loading cycles therefore the hyperbolic form is chosen to develop the empirical pore pressure model for silty clay as shown in eq 8 8 δ u c y p 0 n α n κ where α and κ are the experimental parameters the parameter α decides the ultimate value of the pore pressure during cycling and the parameter κ decides the shape of curves of δu cy versus n eq 9 which can be used to effectively predict the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure is estimated by fitting the measured results a reasonably good prediction for the measured normalized cyclic induced pore pressure during cyclic loading can be seen in fig 16 a b and c and the relative errors between the predicted and measured results are in a range of 15 showed in fig 17 9 δ u c y p 0 n a b q c y p 0 n c q c y p 0 d q s p 0 e where a b and c are cyclic induced pore pressure constants and for the silty clay a b c d and e equal to 5 45 9 72 202 68 393 51 and 34 45 respectively the post cyclic shear strength model obtained in section 4 1 can be further modified by submitting eq 9 into eq 7 to evaluate the post cyclic shear strength degradation rate of the silty clay under different loading cycles as shown in eq 10 10 β 1 1 1 ω q s p 0 n a b q c y p 0 n c q c y p 0 d q s p 0 e 4 3 validation of the modified model first in order to validate the accuracy and reasonability of the model for prediction of post cyclic strength under different confining pressure the relative error between the predicted by eq 10 and measured data were calculated the results show that the errors for specimens with confining pressure of 20 kpa 35 kpa and 50 kpa are 5 25 2 10 and 5 59 respectively moreover fig 18 a and b show a comparison between the post cyclic strength degradation rate predicted by eq 10 and the measured data fig 18 a shows the comparison of measured and predicted β under various q cy p 0 and q s p 0 when q cy p 0 tends to be zero the prediction curves of post cyclic strength degradation rate occur a distinguished position as shown in fig 18 a it is caused due to the appearance of the cyclic loading leading to a substantial change in the predicated cyclic induced pore pressure at small number of cycles fig 18 b shows the predicted and measured of β versus n for q cy p 0 0 4 and q s p 0 0 0 both fig 18 a and b show that eq 10 gives a good prediction for the post cyclic undrained monotonic shear strength for the silty clay the accuracy reasonability feasibility and reliability of the proposed model can be validated the previous study showed that there exists a critical shear strain level for the soils erken and ülker 2007 higher than which the post cyclic strength rapidly reduced the tests in this paper focused on the post cyclic behavior of the specimens which can reach cyclic stability during cyclic loading so whether the model proposed is suitable for the specimens with the cyclic level higher than the critical value needs further verification moreover the coefficients of proposed model were fitted based on limited test data of cyclic stress controlled experiments so these coefficients need to be generalized using more test results obtained from laboratory tests 5 conclusions in this paper a series of cyclic triaxial tests on marine silty clay specimens were carried out to study its post cyclic strength behavior the following conclusions can be drawn based on the test results 1 the csl determined for specimens without previously cyclic loading under different confining pressure is no longer applicable for specimens with cyclic loading history and the confining pressure has no apparent effect on the normalized post cyclic monotonic undrained shear strength 2 the equivalent hvorslev line ehl was proposed to form a failure envelop for post cyclic silty clay on the dry side in q p plane based on the critical state soil mechanics with a specified q s p 0 and q cy p 0 the slope of ehl remains intact irrespectively of the number of cycles but the increase in q s p 0 or q cy p 0 all lead to a substantial increase in the slope of ehl 3 with the increase in the number of cycles the post cyclic strength degradation rate decreases in a reduced growth rate showing a negative correlation with the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure it illustrates that the post cyclic strength degradation rate is associated with the normalized cyclic induced pore pressure and can be evaluated by the pore pressure 4 a near linear correlation between the δu s p 0 and q s p 0 was found the level of initial shear stress has a minuscule effect on the development of δu cy p 0 during the post cyclic shearing the specimens with small q s p 0 and q cy p 0 contract while the cases with large q s p 0 and q cy p 0 dilate also the terminal value of normalized post cyclic shear induced pore pressure decreases with increasing q s p 0 or q cy p 0 5 the yasuhara model was modified based on a modified definition of ocr eq s for evaluating the post cyclic shear strength with the initial shear stress applied substantially an empirical cyclic induced pore pressure model was estimated and then submitted into the modified yasuhara model to consider the effect of the number of cycles on the post cyclic strength the modified yasuhara model for evaluating the post cyclic strength of the silty clay demonstrates a good agreement with the test results acknowledgements this work was supported by the national science foundation of china grant number 51679166 the national key research and

23398,this paper proposes a methodology based on control volume analysis of energy applied on computational fluid dynamics cfd results for analyzing ship propulsion interaction effects as a complement to the well established terminology including thrust deduction wake fraction and propulsive efficiency the method titled energy balance analysis is demonstrated on a propeller operating in open water through consideration of a complete energy balance including kinetic energy flux turbulent kinetic energy flux internal energy flux originating from dissipation and pressure work all possible hydrodynamic losses are included in the analysis implying that it should be possible to avoid sub optimized solutions the results for different control volumes and grid refinements are compared the deviation of the power obtained from the proposed energy balance analysis relative to the power based on integrated forces on the propeller is less than 1 the method is considered promising for analyzing and understanding propulsor hull interaction for conventional as well as novel propulsion configurations the energy balance analysis is conducted as a post processing step and could be used in automated optimization procedures keywords rans propeller in open water reynolds transport theorem energy balance hydrodynamic losses 1 introduction the interaction effects between hull and propulsion system are most commonly described using a well established terminology including thrust deduction wake fraction propulsive efficiency etc however this decomposition has its primary origin in the experimental procedures used to establish ship scale performance rather than from principles of hydrodynamics this can imply limitations in design and optimization of hull and propulsion system as the interaction may thus not be correctly represented we believe that the reliability and capacity of modern computational fluid dynamics cfd has reached a high level of maturity which can be used to extract detailed data of the flow around vessels and propulsion units even in full scale different methods for analyzing interaction effects based on cfd or other calculated results have been proposed in the literature dyne 1995 suggested a propulsive efficiency based on wake losses and gains the method was derived based on potential flow assumptions which implies that it is not applicable for analyzing viscous flow simulation results however it is an appealing idea and easily understandable concept to separate the flow features in losses and gains dang et al 2012 2015 evaluated the dimensionless kinetic energy in the wake for comparison of different propulsion systems this methodology focuses on axial and transverse kinetic energy without accounting for all the energy transferred from the propeller to the water a more comprehensive methodology was proposed by van terwisga 2013 based on an energy balance over a control volume enclosing the entire vessel including propulsion unit through the assumption of a uniform control volume inflow the evaluation of the fluxes were limited to the control volume downstream boundary however the method was not demonstrated schuiling and van terwisga 2016 suggested a methodology for performing an energy analysis based on evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume and applied it on a propeller operating in open water the viscous losses are obtained through volume integrals of the dissipation terms thus the numerical dissipation which cannot be evaluated from cfd has to be obtained indirectly from the difference between delivered power obtained from forces acting on the propeller and the other energy components interaction effects and wake analyses has also been studied within the aircraft industry using control volume analyses of energy for instance by denton 1993 drela 2009 and capitao patrao et al 2016 designers developing novel aircraft concepts such as boundary layer ingestion bli are actually facing very similar design issues as ship propulsion system designers with propulsion units operating in the wake of the craft the objective of this paper is to propose a methodology based on control volume analysis of the energy equation for analyzing ship propulsion interaction effects unlike other proposed methods for hull propulsion system interaction the energy equation is solved which provides a clearer picture of the hydrodynamic losses caused by dissipation of kinetic energy the method will be demonstrated on a simplified case a propeller operating in open water 2 energy balance method the methodology is based on the evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume surrounding the propulsion system with the flow field obtained through cfd it will be possible to express the delivered power which traditionally is evaluated through the torque acting on the blades as a sum of energy fluxes through the control volume surface the reason for selecting energy and not momentum for the control volume analysis is described by van terwisga 2013 as long as a ship moves at a steady speed for a control volume enclosing the entire ship with propeller no net momentum change in the flow exists whereas an energy change over the control volume can be measured thus all effects of a new design which appear in form of different energy losses in the flow can be identified by means of studying the energy change through the control volume control volume analyses i e application of reynolds transport theorem is a well established tool but has traditionally not been applied on cfd simulation results reynolds transport theorem states that the change of any fluid property within the system is the sum of the change within the control volume plus the outflow from the control volume minus the inflow to the control volume the control volume could be of arbitrary shape which is of importance to facilitate analyses of various kind of propulsion systems fig 1 illustrates a possible control volume surrounding skeg propeller and rudder the control volume is bounded by both the virtual control volume surface shown in blue as well as the material surfaces i e some proportion of the hull the rudder and the propeller surfaces to establish an energy balance accounting for all propulsive energy the propulsion unit needs to be fully enclosed by the control volume selection of an appropriate control volume for the analyses will be further discussed in section 4 the energy conservation equation reads white 2008 1 δ e q w where e represents energy q denotes the rate at which heat is added to the system and w denotes the rate at which work is done by the system heat transfer from ship and propulsion unit to surrounding water is neglected for these analyses since associated energy fluxes do not contribute to the hydrodynamic analyses for simplicity we describe a stationary system i e a steady state or periodic unsteady flow it is however possible to generalize the method for analyzing unsteady flows as well denoting energy per unit mass with e the energy conservation equation without heat transfer using the reynolds transport theorem for stationary flow yields white 2008 2 δ e w c s e ρ v n d a where c s denotes the control volume surface v the velocity vector ρ density and n the normal vector to the control volume surface positive outwards note for a periodic unsteady flow the energy balance analysis needs to be evaluated as time average over at least one period the work done by the system constitutes work done by pressure and shear stresses on the control volume surface 3 w w p w v c s p v n τ v d a where p denotes pressure and τ is the shear stress vector on the elemental surface d a the pressure and shear stress work acting on the rotating material surfaces of c s constitutes the delivered power p d and can be expressed as 4 p d 2 π n m where m is the torque evaluated over all rotating material surfaces in c s and n denotes rotation rate compared to the classical notation as shown in eq 1 the delivered power is here defined as power added to the system the pressure and shear stress work eq 3 also act on the virtual control volume boundaries of c s these terms are moved to the right hand side of eq 2 and evaluated together with the energy fluxes the work done by shear stresses on virtual boundaries of the control volume w v v i r t u a l can often be neglected this will be further examined in section 4 1 due to no slip and no flux protruding the hull no work is done by the system on the material surfaces in c s fixed relative to the control volume to increase the level of detail in the energy balance the energy per unit mass e occurring on the right hand side of eq 2 could be further decomposed it is proposed to split the term into kinetic energy in axial direction kinetic energy in transverse directions internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy 5 e 1 2 v x 2 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 u ˆ k where tangential and radial velocity components are denoted by v t and v r respectively in a cartesian coordinate system these components should be replaced with the non axial velocity components v y and v z introducing eq 5 and the above mentioned decomposition of the work rate into eq 2 we obtain 6 p d c s p ρ 1 2 v x 2 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 u ˆ k v n d a w v v i r t u a l the presented approach referred to as energy balance analysis in the rest of this paper will be employed for the evaluation of a propeller performance in open water in section 4 prior to this the different terms which appear in eq 6 are discussed in section 2 1 2 3 2 1 pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux the propulsion unit is converting rotational motion to thrust a pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the blade and the water is accelerated downstream accelerating water in any direction other than the course of the vessel will not contribute to useful thrust to be able to distinguish between kinetic energy in preferred and non preferred directions it is beneficial to define the coordinate system so that the axial direction is in line with the vessels sailing direction not necessary identical to the propeller axis the kinetic energy flux in the preferred direction of motion for the ship is therefore denoted as a x i a l as described by the actuator disc model of a propeller low and high pressure regions are generated ahead and behind the propeller disk respectively which accelerate the flow this is a continuous energy conversion process where pressure work is converted to axial kinetic energy flux for the energy balance eq 6 this implies that the distribution between the pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms will be dependent on the location of the upstream and downstream control volume boundaries the combined pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux term consists of both useful thrust generation and loss components for a propeller operating in open water this division can be explained through the use of a control volume analysis of both linear momentum and energy in the manner of drela 2009 for a propeller in open water consider a control volume enclosing the propeller the upstream boundary is located far upstream so that the inlet conditions can be considered homogeneous with advance velocity v a no tangential flows and p and the lateral boundaries are streamlines where p p for such a control volume the evaluation can be limited to the control volume downstream boundary o u t through definition of velocity and pressure perturbations δ v x v x v a and δ p p p a control volume analysis of linear momentum provides us with the useful thrust 7 f x o u t δ p v a δ v x ρ δ v x d a through multiplication of all momentum flux balance terms with the advance velocity the thrust power is obtained 8 p x f x v a o u t v a δ p ρ v a 2 δ v x ρ v a δ v x 2 d a performing a control volume analysis of energy for the same control volume gives us the required delivered power expressed as a sum of energy fluxes similar to eq 6 9 p d o u t δ p δ v x v a δ p ρ v a 2 δ v x ρ v a δ v x 2 1 2 ρ δ v x 2 v x d a o u t 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 δ u ˆ δ k ρ v x d a δ u ˆ and δ k denotes the change over the control volume in internal and turbulent kinetic energy respectively amongst the pressure and axial kinetic energy flux terms in the energy balance the thrust power can be identified as well as two additional terms denoted the secondary axial kinetic energy flux 10 o u t 1 2 ρ δ v x 2 v x d a and the pressure defect work rate 11 o u t δ p δ v x d a these terms represents the total irreversible outflow losses of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux through the control volume outlet boundary they correspond to the total dissipation of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux to internal energy which eventually occurs downstream due to the mixing out of spatial wake non uniformity note that the evaluation of secondary axial kinetic energy flux and pressure defect work rate is not possible for the general control volume as described in fig 1 since the lateral boundaries are not streamlines with p p and the inlet conditions are not required to be homogeneous for a propeller operating in open water applying an arbitrary control volume with boundaries in the vicinity of the propeller these two terms can however be evaluated indirectly as the difference between the sum of axial kinetic energy flux plus pressure work and the thrust power evaluated from forces acting on the propeller this will be shown in section 4 2 2 2 transverse kinetic energy flux transverse kinetic energy flux is defined as kinetic energy flux in directions other than the vessel sailing direction transverse kinetic energy is often associated with radial and tangential flows induced by the propulsion unit but can for instance also be due to a propeller slipstream not in line with the sailing direction or bilge vortices caused by the hull curvature transverse kinetic energy flux behind the propulsion unit or vessel should be considered as a loss since the accelerated water in a direction other than the course of the vessel will not contribute to useful thrust note that dependent on application and control volume it can also appear as a negative term i e as a gain when the transverse kinetic energy inflow is exceeding the outflow from the control volume 2 3 internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy flux in a viscous flow kinetic energy of the mean flow is converted to internal energy i e heat through two processes a dissipation of turbulent velocity fluctuations and b direct viscous dissipation from the mean flow to internal energy thus the internal energy flux is a measure of both these processes whereas the turbulent kinetic energy flux only accounts for an intermediate stage in a the turbulent kinetic energy has to be included only due to the cfd modeling where turbulence is modeled using an eddy viscosity model there is actually no need to study the internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes separately since they both are due to the same phenomena kinetic energy losses due to turbulence and fluid viscosity in boundary layers and elsewhere where spatial non uniformities mix out the internal energy is obtained through u ˆ c p t c p specific heat capacity t temperature i e a temperature field is required from cfd implying that the energy equation needs to be solved for note that the temperature increase due to dissipation is very small requiring well resolved cfd results to obtain sufficient accuracy internal and turbulent kinetic energy can be considered as pure losses the viscous losses are highly dependent on the velocity of the propeller blade relative to the surrounding water flow separations and the existence of spatial non uniformities in the flow that will be mixed out such as circumferential variations associated with the finite number of blades and flow structures such as hub tip vortices and wakes 3 cfd simulation of propeller in open water a model scale 1 22 629 propeller tested at marintek trondheim has been used for the analyses it is a four bladed propeller designed for a 120 m single screw cargo vessel with a propeller diameter d p of 185 6 mm pitch ratio at r r 0 7 of 0 975 and a blade area ratio of 0 515 for validation purposes advance ratios j between 0 1 and 0 9 are simulated however to limit the extent of the energy balance analysis it is only conducted at j 0 65 which is close to the best efficiency point of the propeller the simulated propeller rotation rate is 11 32 rps identical to open water test conditions 3 1 computational domain the computational domain is divided into one outer stationary domain and one inner propeller domain the stationary domain is extending 10 d p upstream and downstream the propeller and 20 d p in diameter the propeller is placed on a streamlined cylindrical body to mimic the boundary layers close to the propeller hub during model tests see fig 2 to avoid interpolation errors on periodic boundaries a full propeller is studied the computational grids are generated in star ccm v10 06 polyhedral cells which are suitable for geometries with highly curved surfaces are employed inside the propeller domain prism layers are extruded from the polyhedral surface mesh using the advancing layer mesher in star ccm the boundary layers are resolved using 15 prism layers near the walls with an expansion ratio of 1 3 see table 1 for resulting y values similar to common practice for self propulsion simulations the outer domain consists of cut cells which are predominantly hexahedral cells created using the trimmer mesher in star ccm the mesh structure within the propeller region is shown in fig 3 the applied meshing strategy is similar to the one applied by andersson et al 2015 where for instance leading trailing edge refinement surface cell size and the effect of switching between wall functions and resolved boundary layers were studied here only the overall mesh refinement is studied to evaluate its influence on the results such as the delivered power and the energy flux components through the control volume 3 2 cfd simulation method the commercial cfd package star ccm v10 06 a finite volume method solver is employed star ccm is a general purpose cfd code used for a wide variety of applications it solves the conservation equations for momentum mass energy and turbulence quantities using a segregated solver based on the simple algorithm a second order upwind discretization scheme in space is used in addition to the standard procedure for open water propeller simulation the energy equation is also solved this enables the measurement of kinetic and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation in the form of a temperature rise since the main aim of the energy balance analysis is to study propeller hull interaction a turbulence model suitable for these kind of applications is applied also for the propeller open water simulations thus turbulence is modeled using k ω sst which in previous studies has been considered as a reliable compromise for self propulsion simulations with free water surface andersson et al 2015 the effect of employing γ r e θ transition model menter et al 2004 along with k ω sst will be studied in section 3 4 since the transition model is sensitive to turbulent intensity and turbulent viscosity ratio to counteract the decay of turbulence from inlet boundary to propeller the method outlined by bhattacharyya et al 2015 will be applied when the transition model is applied the grid is adjusted to better suit the model requirements this implies a refined grid on the propeller blade in x and z directions and reduced expansion ratio to 1 2 while the total prism layer thickness is kept unmodified these changes leads to about 50 increase in the propeller domain cell count the advance velocity is set on the inlet boundary to reach the desired operating point moreover the turbulence intensity and the turbulence viscosity ratio are set to 1 and 10 respectively on the outlet boundary a static pressure is prescribed while the far field lateral boundary is modeled as a symmetry plane multiple reference frames mrf are applied where a rotating reference frame is specified for the propeller domain and a stationary reference frame for the outer domain convergence is measured through average residuals as well as averaged quantities such as thrust and torque a simulation is considered converged when the residuals are stable and averaged quantities are stable and deviating with less than 0 1 from their mean value 3 3 grid convergence three grids with a cell refinement ratio of 50 are generated see table 1 for details the thrust coefficient k t t h r u s t ρ n 2 d p 4 scatters within 0 3 between the grids and the torque coefficient k q t o r q u e ρ n 2 d p 5 decreases with increased mesh refinement resulting in a 0 9 difference between grid 1 and 3 the maximum difference in efficiency η t h r u s t v a p d is 0 4 points among the grids despite that a clear mesh convergence cannot be observed the small differences between the grids indicate that the resolution is sufficient to represent the main flow features 3 4 validation cfd results applying k ω sst with and without γ r e θ transition model are compared to open water test data in fig 4 grid 2 and a transition model adapted version of grid 2 are used accordingly as shown in fig 4 the computed thrust and torque are under estimated compared to experiment apart from at high advance ratios the prediction of thrust and torque is improved by applying the transition model indicating that the reynolds number during test most probably has been too low to create a fully turbulent flow over the entire blade surfaces the correspondence between cfd results and open water test data is slightly lower than expected accurate cfd results are crucial for the outcome of the energy balance analysis therefore more effort in general needs to be spent on obtaining accurate cfd methods representative for model as well as full scale conditions however the ambition here was not to reproduce the experiments but rather to conduct a standardized cfd simulation of a propeller in open water further the detailed test conditions and procedures are unfamiliar to the authors and due to the relatively low reynolds number of the tests the flow transition from laminar to turbulent will substantially influence the results 4 energy balance analysis of propeller in open water the energy balance analysis is applied on the studied propeller in open water the work done by viscous stresses on the control volume surface is investigated further in section 4 1 thereafter the influence of size location of the control volume and grid refinement on the energy balance analysis is demonstrated in section 4 2 and 4 3 respectively finally the energy balance analysis is discussed together with qualitative results in section 4 4 the control volumes are established as a post processing step with the aid of extracted surfaces using derived parts in star ccm to enable flexibility when analyzing the results the control volume boundaries are all located within the outer domain consisting of a cut cell grid aligned with a cartesian coordinate system to avoid unnecessary interpolation the shape of the control volumes within this study is set to a rectangular box aligned with the same coordinate system as the grid 4 1 work by viscous stresses on control volume surfaces the work performed by viscous stresses on control volume surfaces shown in eq 3 is at its maximum if the control volume surfaces are placed tangential to the flow direction and there are significant velocity gradients within the flow if the flow is approximately normal to the control volume surface or if they are placed outside the boundary layer viscous stresses are expected to be lower the work performed by viscous stresses is evaluated on two different control volumes both with upstream and downstream boundaries located at 0 5 d p from the propeller while the lateral boundaries are located at 1 02 d p and 1 5 d p from the propeller center respectively for both control volumes the work performed by viscous stresses is negligible constituting less than 0 01 of the propeller power the lateral boundaries of both control volumes are located in areas with predominantly low velocity gradients the largest share of the work performed by the viscous stresses on these control volumes is due to tangential flow and strong velocity gradients on the control volume downstream boundary since it may not be possible to obtain suitable control volume boundary locations for more complex cases avoiding areas with tangential flow and significant velocity gradients it is recommended to always include an evaluation of the work performed by viscous stresses 4 2 influence of control volume the energy balance analysis is conducted over two different control volumes denoted a and b illustrated in fig 5 the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at 0 5 d p and 5 d p from the propeller center for control volume a and b respectively the lateral boundaries are located at 1 5 d p from the propeller center for both control volumes the energy balance for control volume a and b based on the results for grid 2 is shown in fig 6 and the detailed numbers are provided in table 2 the propeller thrust power is based on the forces acting on the propeller and the axial wake non uniformity loss is calculated as the difference between axial kinetic energy flux pressure work and the thrust power this implies that the axial wake non uniformity loss represents the secondary axial kinetic energy flux eq 7 and pressure defect work rate eq 8 the internal and turbulent kinetic energy flux is larger for control volume b than for a this is explained by turbulent and viscous dissipation due to mixing out of spatial non uniformities occurring between 0 5 d p and 5 d p downstream of the propeller within the propeller slipstream as well as on the border between the slipstream and surrounding water this is also observed through a reduction in the axial wake non uniformity loss term for control volume b relative to control volume a this shows that for a representative illustration of the axial wake non uniformity loss the control volume downstream boundary has to be located in the vicinity of the propeller the transverse kinetic energy flux is increased for control volume b which may be surprising since the main energy conversion process ought to be from kinetic energy to internal and turbulent kinetic energy this is however not just a study including a propeller but also the cylindrical body attached to the propeller this implies that control volume b will capture the hub vortex leaving the cylindrical body while control volume a will not a slightly larger discrepancy between delivered power and the energy balance is observed for the larger control volume b compared to a as shown on the last line in table 2 this will be discussed further in section 4 3 the energy balance for control volumes with different locations of the downstream boundary is shown in fig 7 with the upstream boundary kept constant at a distance of 0 5 d p from the propeller and the lateral boundaries at 1 5 d p in this figure the pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms are kept separate without indication of the axial wake non uniformity loss term the axial deceleration of the flow and appearance of a hub vortex behind the cylindrical body ending at 1 25 d p influences the evolution of the axial kinetic energy flux pressure work and transverse kinetic energy flux terms the contribution from the pressure work term to the energy balance is larger the closer the downstream boundary is located to the propeller while the opposite holds for the axial kinetic energy flux a behavior which is in accordance with common actuator disc theory the internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes increase as the downstream boundary is moved away from the propeller due to viscous and turbulent dissipation associated with mixing out of spatial non uniformities in the flow the conversion process from kinetic energy to internal energy will in theory continue until all energy has been dissipated into heat further downstream as discussed above the control volume choice has an important role on the energy balance results obviously more information about the flow is obtained in the vicinity of the propulsion unit whereas further away the kinetic energy terms are to a larger extent converted to internal and turbulent kinetic energy since the distribution of the energy balance is highly dependent on the location of the control volume it is important to apply identical control volumes when comparing different designs 4 3 accuracy and influence of grid refinement it was noted in section 4 2 that a better agreement between the delivered power evaluated based on forces acting on the propeller and energy balance was obtained for the smaller control volume a in fig 8 the difference between these terms is compared for different control volumes were the upstream and lateral boundaries are fixed while the position of the downstream boundary is varied until the end of the cylindrical body at 1 25 d p the difference oscillates around zero this is most probably associated with inaccuracies in the numerical convergence of the solution and interpolation errors on the control volume surfaces behind the cylindrical body the difference increases with increasing distance between propeller and downstream boundary and reaches 0 8 of the delivered power at 5 d p which most probably is associated with numerical dissipation in table 3 the energy balance analysis is conducted using control volume a on grid 1 2 and 3 respectively the difference between the energy balance and the delivered power evaluated based on forces acting on the propeller is below 0 3 for all grids the difference does not decrease with increasing grid refinement however relating to fig 8 the magnitude of the oscillations most probably related to inaccuracies in the numerical convergence of the solution and interpolation errors on the control volume surfaces is reduced with increased grid refinement interestingly the differences between the energy balance between grid 1 2 and 3 are less than the differences between the delivered power the discrepancies are most probably deduced from a combination of numerical dissipation and numerical convergence of solution table 3 also includes the detailed energy balance decomposition the pressure work reduces with increased grid refinement while the axial kinetic energy flux contribution increases studying these terms combined which often is relevant less difference is seen between the grids 75 0 75 5 and 76 0 respectively a larger contribution from these terms and the transverse kinetic energy flux in conjunction with grid refinement can be related to the reduced contribution from internal energy flux a finer grid may imply a reduced numerical dissipation in the propeller vicinity to estimate the level of numerical dissipation for control volume a a rickardson extrapolation of the internal energy flux is conducted see fig 9 two additional grids coarser than grid 1 still keeping the cell refinement ratio of 50 are included for the extrapolation due to the unstructured grid a rickardson extrapolation is not strictly valid but can still give an indication of the discretization error the discretization error of the internal energy flux may be considered as a representative of the numerical dissipation the error is 1 2 for control volume a and grid 2 in comparison to the asymptotic value of the internal energy flux 17 3 since the energy decomposition is grid dependent it is highly recommended to apply similar meshing strategy and grid refinement level for comparative studies 4 4 discussion to be able to improve the propulsive system or to analyze differences in performance between propulsive systems the energy balance decomposition is preferably complemented by a visualization of the energy fluxes in fig 10 the internal energy flux is shown over the control volume surface as expected the flux is negligible on the upstream and lateral control volume boundaries where no work has been extracted from the flow on the downstream side of the control volume the boundary layer losses from the individual blades are depicted the highest level of internal energy flux is seen in the tip region where the blade velocity relative the surrounding fluid is highest and the tip vortex is present for a ship propulsion system including skeg propeller axes rudder etc it can be beneficial to view all sides of this volume as well as intermediate surfaces within the control volume to be able to analyze and locate the origin of the losses due to the absence of interaction effects for the propeller in open water the visualization of the results is limited to contour plots of axial kinetic energy flux transverse kinetic energy flux pressure work and internal energy flux at a distance of 0 2 d p downstream the propeller see figure 11 note that the color scales are different for the different terms so direct comparisons should not be made the high pressure produced behind the blade surfaces is clearly depicted at this distance behind the propeller the circumferential non uniformities due to the four blades are also observed on the axial kinetic energy flux contour plot the axial wake non uniformity loss secondary axial kinetic energy flux and pressure defect work rate are not visualized since they cannot be evaluated for a generic control volume these terms will however decrease as the pressure and axial velocity perturbations are reduced and the relative magnitude of the perturbations between different designs may be identified with the aid of axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work contour plots the transverse kinetic energy originates from the wake behind the propeller blade with the highest fluxes initiate from the propeller root where suction side separation zones are present 5 conclusions we have shown that a control volume analysis of energy applied on cfd results provide an alternative method to study the power consumption of a propulsion unit the delivered power to the propeller shaft can be expressed in terms of thrust power axial wake non uniformity losses transverse kinetic energy flux and internal turbulent kinetic energy flux this implies that the hydrodynamic losses associated with a high and or uneven acceleration of the flow slipstream rotation and viscous losses can be tracked and quantified since all possible hydrodynamic losses in the system are depicted in the analysis it should be possible for a designer to avoid sub optimized solutions we consider this method promising as a complement to the established methods based on experimental procedures for analyzing propulsor hull interaction especially for novel but also for more common propulsion configurations where the hydrodynamic performance cannot always be fully understood based on established methods the method also enables analysis of the propeller performance during one revolution which can open up possibilities for design improvements our further work will therefore focus on application of the energy balance analysis on propulsion systems in behind conditions as well as a quantitative method for determination or guidance of the distribution between favorable and loss components of axial kinetic energy flux pressure work for more complex systems energy balance analyses can be used not only as a tool for more comprehensive understanding of a system but it can also be used within design and automated optimization procedures since it gives quantitative information on the hydrodynamic losses it is a post processing tool with the only additional requirement of solving the energy equation and can be employed in any cfd code based on commonly available variables acknowledgements this research is supported by the swedish energy agency grant number 38849 1 and

23398,this paper proposes a methodology based on control volume analysis of energy applied on computational fluid dynamics cfd results for analyzing ship propulsion interaction effects as a complement to the well established terminology including thrust deduction wake fraction and propulsive efficiency the method titled energy balance analysis is demonstrated on a propeller operating in open water through consideration of a complete energy balance including kinetic energy flux turbulent kinetic energy flux internal energy flux originating from dissipation and pressure work all possible hydrodynamic losses are included in the analysis implying that it should be possible to avoid sub optimized solutions the results for different control volumes and grid refinements are compared the deviation of the power obtained from the proposed energy balance analysis relative to the power based on integrated forces on the propeller is less than 1 the method is considered promising for analyzing and understanding propulsor hull interaction for conventional as well as novel propulsion configurations the energy balance analysis is conducted as a post processing step and could be used in automated optimization procedures keywords rans propeller in open water reynolds transport theorem energy balance hydrodynamic losses 1 introduction the interaction effects between hull and propulsion system are most commonly described using a well established terminology including thrust deduction wake fraction propulsive efficiency etc however this decomposition has its primary origin in the experimental procedures used to establish ship scale performance rather than from principles of hydrodynamics this can imply limitations in design and optimization of hull and propulsion system as the interaction may thus not be correctly represented we believe that the reliability and capacity of modern computational fluid dynamics cfd has reached a high level of maturity which can be used to extract detailed data of the flow around vessels and propulsion units even in full scale different methods for analyzing interaction effects based on cfd or other calculated results have been proposed in the literature dyne 1995 suggested a propulsive efficiency based on wake losses and gains the method was derived based on potential flow assumptions which implies that it is not applicable for analyzing viscous flow simulation results however it is an appealing idea and easily understandable concept to separate the flow features in losses and gains dang et al 2012 2015 evaluated the dimensionless kinetic energy in the wake for comparison of different propulsion systems this methodology focuses on axial and transverse kinetic energy without accounting for all the energy transferred from the propeller to the water a more comprehensive methodology was proposed by van terwisga 2013 based on an energy balance over a control volume enclosing the entire vessel including propulsion unit through the assumption of a uniform control volume inflow the evaluation of the fluxes were limited to the control volume downstream boundary however the method was not demonstrated schuiling and van terwisga 2016 suggested a methodology for performing an energy analysis based on evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume and applied it on a propeller operating in open water the viscous losses are obtained through volume integrals of the dissipation terms thus the numerical dissipation which cannot be evaluated from cfd has to be obtained indirectly from the difference between delivered power obtained from forces acting on the propeller and the other energy components interaction effects and wake analyses has also been studied within the aircraft industry using control volume analyses of energy for instance by denton 1993 drela 2009 and capitao patrao et al 2016 designers developing novel aircraft concepts such as boundary layer ingestion bli are actually facing very similar design issues as ship propulsion system designers with propulsion units operating in the wake of the craft the objective of this paper is to propose a methodology based on control volume analysis of the energy equation for analyzing ship propulsion interaction effects unlike other proposed methods for hull propulsion system interaction the energy equation is solved which provides a clearer picture of the hydrodynamic losses caused by dissipation of kinetic energy the method will be demonstrated on a simplified case a propeller operating in open water 2 energy balance method the methodology is based on the evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume surrounding the propulsion system with the flow field obtained through cfd it will be possible to express the delivered power which traditionally is evaluated through the torque acting on the blades as a sum of energy fluxes through the control volume surface the reason for selecting energy and not momentum for the control volume analysis is described by van terwisga 2013 as long as a ship moves at a steady speed for a control volume enclosing the entire ship with propeller no net momentum change in the flow exists whereas an energy change over the control volume can be measured thus all effects of a new design which appear in form of different energy losses in the flow can be identified by means of studying the energy change through the control volume control volume analyses i e application of reynolds transport theorem is a well established tool but has traditionally not been applied on cfd simulation results reynolds transport theorem states that the change of any fluid property within the system is the sum of the change within the control volume plus the outflow from the control volume minus the inflow to the control volume the control volume could be of arbitrary shape which is of importance to facilitate analyses of various kind of propulsion systems fig 1 illustrates a possible control volume surrounding skeg propeller and rudder the control volume is bounded by both the virtual control volume surface shown in blue as well as the material surfaces i e some proportion of the hull the rudder and the propeller surfaces to establish an energy balance accounting for all propulsive energy the propulsion unit needs to be fully enclosed by the control volume selection of an appropriate control volume for the analyses will be further discussed in section 4 the energy conservation equation reads white 2008 1 δ e q w where e represents energy q denotes the rate at which heat is added to the system and w denotes the rate at which work is done by the system heat transfer from ship and propulsion unit to surrounding water is neglected for these analyses since associated energy fluxes do not contribute to the hydrodynamic analyses for simplicity we describe a stationary system i e a steady state or periodic unsteady flow it is however possible to generalize the method for analyzing unsteady flows as well denoting energy per unit mass with e the energy conservation equation without heat transfer using the reynolds transport theorem for stationary flow yields white 2008 2 δ e w c s e ρ v n d a where c s denotes the control volume surface v the velocity vector ρ density and n the normal vector to the control volume surface positive outwards note for a periodic unsteady flow the energy balance analysis needs to be evaluated as time average over at least one period the work done by the system constitutes work done by pressure and shear stresses on the control volume surface 3 w w p w v c s p v n τ v d a where p denotes pressure and τ is the shear stress vector on the elemental surface d a the pressure and shear stress work acting on the rotating material surfaces of c s constitutes the delivered power p d and can be expressed as 4 p d 2 π n m where m is the torque evaluated over all rotating material surfaces in c s and n denotes rotation rate compared to the classical notation as shown in eq 1 the delivered power is here defined as power added to the system the pressure and shear stress work eq 3 also act on the virtual control volume boundaries of c s these terms are moved to the right hand side of eq 2 and evaluated together with the energy fluxes the work done by shear stresses on virtual boundaries of the control volume w v v i r t u a l can often be neglected this will be further examined in section 4 1 due to no slip and no flux protruding the hull no work is done by the system on the material surfaces in c s fixed relative to the control volume to increase the level of detail in the energy balance the energy per unit mass e occurring on the right hand side of eq 2 could be further decomposed it is proposed to split the term into kinetic energy in axial direction kinetic energy in transverse directions internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy 5 e 1 2 v x 2 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 u ˆ k where tangential and radial velocity components are denoted by v t and v r respectively in a cartesian coordinate system these components should be replaced with the non axial velocity components v y and v z introducing eq 5 and the above mentioned decomposition of the work rate into eq 2 we obtain 6 p d c s p ρ 1 2 v x 2 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 u ˆ k v n d a w v v i r t u a l the presented approach referred to as energy balance analysis in the rest of this paper will be employed for the evaluation of a propeller performance in open water in section 4 prior to this the different terms which appear in eq 6 are discussed in section 2 1 2 3 2 1 pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux the propulsion unit is converting rotational motion to thrust a pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the blade and the water is accelerated downstream accelerating water in any direction other than the course of the vessel will not contribute to useful thrust to be able to distinguish between kinetic energy in preferred and non preferred directions it is beneficial to define the coordinate system so that the axial direction is in line with the vessels sailing direction not necessary identical to the propeller axis the kinetic energy flux in the preferred direction of motion for the ship is therefore denoted as a x i a l as described by the actuator disc model of a propeller low and high pressure regions are generated ahead and behind the propeller disk respectively which accelerate the flow this is a continuous energy conversion process where pressure work is converted to axial kinetic energy flux for the energy balance eq 6 this implies that the distribution between the pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms will be dependent on the location of the upstream and downstream control volume boundaries the combined pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux term consists of both useful thrust generation and loss components for a propeller operating in open water this division can be explained through the use of a control volume analysis of both linear momentum and energy in the manner of drela 2009 for a propeller in open water consider a control volume enclosing the propeller the upstream boundary is located far upstream so that the inlet conditions can be considered homogeneous with advance velocity v a no tangential flows and p and the lateral boundaries are streamlines where p p for such a control volume the evaluation can be limited to the control volume downstream boundary o u t through definition of velocity and pressure perturbations δ v x v x v a and δ p p p a control volume analysis of linear momentum provides us with the useful thrust 7 f x o u t δ p v a δ v x ρ δ v x d a through multiplication of all momentum flux balance terms with the advance velocity the thrust power is obtained 8 p x f x v a o u t v a δ p ρ v a 2 δ v x ρ v a δ v x 2 d a performing a control volume analysis of energy for the same control volume gives us the required delivered power expressed as a sum of energy fluxes similar to eq 6 9 p d o u t δ p δ v x v a δ p ρ v a 2 δ v x ρ v a δ v x 2 1 2 ρ δ v x 2 v x d a o u t 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 δ u ˆ δ k ρ v x d a δ u ˆ and δ k denotes the change over the control volume in internal and turbulent kinetic energy respectively amongst the pressure and axial kinetic energy flux terms in the energy balance the thrust power can be identified as well as two additional terms denoted the secondary axial kinetic energy flux 10 o u t 1 2 ρ δ v x 2 v x d a and the pressure defect work rate 11 o u t δ p δ v x d a these terms represents the total irreversible outflow losses of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux through the control volume outlet boundary they correspond to the total dissipation of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux to internal energy which eventually occurs downstream due to the mixing out of spatial wake non uniformity note that the evaluation of secondary axial kinetic energy flux and pressure defect work rate is not possible for the general control volume as described in fig 1 since the lateral boundaries are not streamlines with p p and the inlet conditions are not required to be homogeneous for a propeller operating in open water applying an arbitrary control volume with boundaries in the vicinity of the propeller these two terms can however be evaluated indirectly as the difference between the sum of axial kinetic energy flux plus pressure work and the thrust power evaluated from forces acting on the propeller this will be shown in section 4 2 2 2 transverse kinetic energy flux transverse kinetic energy flux is defined as kinetic energy flux in directions other than the vessel sailing direction transverse kinetic energy is often associated with radial and tangential flows induced by the propulsion unit but can for instance also be due to a propeller slipstream not in line with the sailing direction or bilge vortices caused by the hull curvature transverse kinetic energy flux behind the propulsion unit or vessel should be considered as a loss since the accelerated water in a direction other than the course of the vessel will not contribute to useful thrust note that dependent on application and control volume it can also appear as a negative term i e as a gain when the transverse kinetic energy inflow is exceeding the outflow from the control volume 2 3 internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy flux in a viscous flow kinetic energy of the mean flow is converted to internal energy i e heat through two processes a dissipation of turbulent velocity fluctuations and b direct viscous dissipation from the mean flow to internal energy thus the internal energy flux is a measure of both these processes whereas the turbulent kinetic energy flux only accounts for an intermediate stage in a the turbulent kinetic energy has to be included only due to the cfd modeling where turbulence is modeled using an eddy viscosity model there is actually no need to study the internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes separately since they both are due to the same phenomena kinetic energy losses due to turbulence and fluid viscosity in boundary layers and elsewhere where spatial non uniformities mix out the internal energy is obtained through u ˆ c p t c p specific heat capacity t temperature i e a temperature field is required from cfd implying that the energy equation needs to be solved for note that the temperature increase due to dissipation is very small requiring well resolved cfd results to obtain sufficient accuracy internal and turbulent kinetic energy can be considered as pure losses the viscous losses are highly dependent on the velocity of the propeller blade relative to the surrounding water flow separations and the existence of spatial non uniformities in the flow that will be mixed out such as circumferential variations associated with the finite number of blades and flow structures such as hub tip vortices and wakes 3 cfd simulation of propeller in open water a model scale 1 22 629 propeller tested at marintek trondheim has been used for the analyses it is a four bladed propeller designed for a 120 m single screw cargo vessel with a propeller diameter d p of 185 6 mm pitch ratio at r r 0 7 of 0 975 and a blade area ratio of 0 515 for validation purposes advance ratios j between 0 1 and 0 9 are simulated however to limit the extent of the energy balance analysis it is only conducted at j 0 65 which is close to the best efficiency point of the propeller the simulated propeller rotation rate is 11 32 rps identical to open water test conditions 3 1 computational domain the computational domain is divided into one outer stationary domain and one inner propeller domain the stationary domain is extending 10 d p upstream and downstream the propeller and 20 d p in diameter the propeller is placed on a streamlined cylindrical body to mimic the boundary layers close to the propeller hub during model tests see fig 2 to avoid interpolation errors on periodic boundaries a full propeller is studied the computational grids are generated in star ccm v10 06 polyhedral cells which are suitable for geometries with highly curved surfaces are employed inside the propeller domain prism layers are extruded from the polyhedral surface mesh using the advancing layer mesher in star ccm the boundary layers are resolved using 15 prism layers near the walls with an expansion ratio of 1 3 see table 1 for resulting y values similar to common practice for self propulsion simulations the outer domain consists of cut cells which are predominantly hexahedral cells created using the trimmer mesher in star ccm the mesh structure within the propeller region is shown in fig 3 the applied meshing strategy is similar to the one applied by andersson et al 2015 where for instance leading trailing edge refinement surface cell size and the effect of switching between wall functions and resolved boundary layers were studied here only the overall mesh refinement is studied to evaluate its influence on the results such as the delivered power and the energy flux components through the control volume 3 2 cfd simulation method the commercial cfd package star ccm v10 06 a finite volume method solver is employed star ccm is a general purpose cfd code used for a wide variety of applications it solves the conservation equations for momentum mass energy and turbulence quantities using a segregated solver based on the simple algorithm a second order upwind discretization scheme in space is used in addition to the standard procedure for open water propeller simulation the energy equation is also solved this enables the measurement of kinetic and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation in the form of a temperature rise since the main aim of the energy balance analysis is to study propeller hull interaction a turbulence model suitable for these kind of applications is applied also for the propeller open water simulations thus turbulence is modeled using k ω sst which in previous studies has been considered as a reliable compromise for self propulsion simulations with free water surface andersson et al 2015 the effect of employing γ r e θ transition model menter et al 2004 along with k ω sst will be studied in section 3 4 since the transition model is sensitive to turbulent intensity and turbulent viscosity ratio to counteract the decay of turbulence from inlet boundary to propeller the method outlined by bhattacharyya et al 2015 will be applied when the transition model is applied the grid is adjusted to better suit the model requirements this implies a refined grid on the propeller blade in x and z directions and reduced expansion ratio to 1 2 while the total prism layer thickness is kept unmodified these changes leads to about 50 increase in the propeller domain cell count the advance velocity is set on the inlet boundary to reach the desired operating point moreover the turbulence intensity and the turbulence viscosity ratio are set to 1 and 10 respectively on the outlet boundary a static pressure is prescribed while the far field lateral boundary is modeled as a symmetry plane multiple reference frames mrf are applied where a rotating reference frame is specified for the propeller domain and a stationary reference frame for the outer domain convergence is measured through average residuals as well as averaged quantities such as thrust and torque a simulation is considered converged when the residuals are stable and averaged quantities are stable and deviating with less than 0 1 from their mean value 3 3 grid convergence three grids with a cell refinement ratio of 50 are generated see table 1 for details the thrust coefficient k t t h r u s t ρ n 2 d p 4 scatters within 0 3 between the grids and the torque coefficient k q t o r q u e ρ n 2 d p 5 decreases with increased mesh refinement resulting in a 0 9 difference between grid 1 and 3 the maximum difference in efficiency η t h r u s t v a p d is 0 4 points among the grids despite that a clear mesh convergence cannot be observed the small differences between the grids indicate that the resolution is sufficient to represent the main flow features 3 4 validation cfd results applying k ω sst with and without γ r e θ transition model are compared to open water test data in fig 4 grid 2 and a transition model adapted version of grid 2 are used accordingly as shown in fig 4 the computed thrust and torque are under estimated compared to experiment apart from at high advance ratios the prediction of thrust and torque is improved by applying the transition model indicating that the reynolds number during test most probably has been too low to create a fully turbulent flow over the entire blade surfaces the correspondence between cfd results and open water test data is slightly lower than expected accurate cfd results are crucial for the outcome of the energy balance analysis therefore more effort in general needs to be spent on obtaining accurate cfd methods representative for model as well as full scale conditions however the ambition here was not to reproduce the experiments but rather to conduct a standardized cfd simulation of a propeller in open water further the detailed test conditions and procedures are unfamiliar to the authors and due to the relatively low reynolds number of the tests the flow transition from laminar to turbulent will substantially influence the results 4 energy balance analysis of propeller in open water the energy balance analysis is applied on the studied propeller in open water the work done by viscous stresses on the control volume surface is investigated further in section 4 1 thereafter the influence of size location of the control volume and grid refinement on the energy balance analysis is demonstrated in section 4 2 and 4 3 respectively finally the energy balance analysis is discussed together with qualitative results in section 4 4 the control volumes are established as a post processing step with the aid of extracted surfaces using derived parts in star ccm to enable flexibility when analyzing the results the control volume boundaries are all located within the outer domain consisting of a cut cell grid aligned with a cartesian coordinate system to avoid unnecessary interpolation the shape of the control volumes within this study is set to a rectangular box aligned with the same coordinate system as the grid 4 1 work by viscous stresses on control volume surfaces the work performed by viscous stresses on control volume surfaces shown in eq 3 is at its maximum if the control volume surfaces are placed tangential to the flow direction and there are significant velocity gradients within the flow if the flow is approximately normal to the control volume surface or if they are placed outside the boundary layer viscous stresses are expected to be lower the work performed by viscous stresses is evaluated on two different control volumes both with upstream and downstream boundaries located at 0 5 d p from the propeller while the lateral boundaries are located at 1 02 d p and 1 5 d p from the propeller center respectively for both control volumes the work performed by viscous stresses is negligible constituting less than 0 01 of the propeller power the lateral boundaries of both control volumes are located in areas with predominantly low velocity gradients the largest share of the work performed by the viscous stresses on these control volumes is due to tangential flow and strong velocity gradients on the control volume downstream boundary since it may not be possible to obtain suitable control volume boundary locations for more complex cases avoiding areas with tangential flow and significant velocity gradients it is recommended to always include an evaluation of the work performed by viscous stresses 4 2 influence of control volume the energy balance analysis is conducted over two different control volumes denoted a and b illustrated in fig 5 the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at 0 5 d p and 5 d p from the propeller center for control volume a and b respectively the lateral boundaries are located at 1 5 d p from the propeller center for both control volumes the energy balance for control volume a and b based on the results for grid 2 is shown in fig 6 and the detailed numbers are provided in table 2 the propeller thrust power is based on the forces acting on the propeller and the axial wake non uniformity loss is calculated as the difference between axial kinetic energy flux pressure work and the thrust power this implies that the axial wake non uniformity loss represents the secondary axial kinetic energy flux eq 7 and pressure defect work rate eq 8 the internal and turbulent kinetic energy flux is larger for control volume b than for a this is explained by turbulent and viscous dissipation due to mixing out of spatial non uniformities occurring between 0 5 d p and 5 d p downstream of the propeller within the propeller slipstream as well as on the border between the slipstream and surrounding water this is also observed through a reduction in the axial wake non uniformity loss term for control volume b relative to control volume a this shows that for a representative illustration of the axial wake non uniformity loss the control volume downstream boundary has to be located in the vicinity of the propeller the transverse kinetic energy flux is increased for control volume b which may be surprising since the main energy conversion process ought to be from kinetic energy to internal and turbulent kinetic energy this is however not just a study including a propeller but also the cylindrical body attached to the propeller this implies that control volume b will capture the hub vortex leaving the cylindrical body while control volume a will not a slightly larger discrepancy between delivered power and the energy balance is observed for the larger control volume b compared to a as shown on the last line in table 2 this will be discussed further in section 4 3 the energy balance for control volumes with different locations of the downstream boundary is shown in fig 7 with the upstream boundary kept constant at a distance of 0 5 d p from the propeller and the lateral boundaries at 1 5 d p in this figure the pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms are kept separate without indication of the axial wake non uniformity loss term the axial deceleration of the flow and appearance of a hub vortex behind the cylindrical body ending at 1 25 d p influences the evolution of the axial kinetic energy flux pressure work and transverse kinetic energy flux terms the contribution from the pressure work term to the energy balance is larger the closer the downstream boundary is located to the propeller while the opposite holds for the axial kinetic energy flux a behavior which is in accordance with common actuator disc theory the internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes increase as the downstream boundary is moved away from the propeller due to viscous and turbulent dissipation associated with mixing out of spatial non uniformities in the flow the conversion process from kinetic energy to internal energy will in theory continue until all energy has been dissipated into heat further downstream as discussed above the control volume choice has an important role on the energy balance results obviously more information about the flow is obtained in the vicinity of the propulsion unit whereas further away the kinetic energy terms are to a larger extent converted to internal and turbulent kinetic energy since the distribution of the energy balance is highly dependent on the location of the control volume it is important to apply identical control volumes when comparing different designs 4 3 accuracy and influence of grid refinement it was noted in section 4 2 that a better agreement between the delivered power evaluated based on forces acting on the propeller and energy balance was obtained for the smaller control volume a in fig 8 the difference between these terms is compared for different control volumes were the upstream and lateral boundaries are fixed while the position of the downstream boundary is varied until the end of the cylindrical body at 1 25 d p the difference oscillates around zero this is most probably associated with inaccuracies in the numerical convergence of the solution and interpolation errors on the control volume surfaces behind the cylindrical body the difference increases with increasing distance between propeller and downstream boundary and reaches 0 8 of the delivered power at 5 d p which most probably is associated with numerical dissipation in table 3 the energy balance analysis is conducted using control volume a on grid 1 2 and 3 respectively the difference between the energy balance and the delivered power evaluated based on forces acting on the propeller is below 0 3 for all grids the difference does not decrease with increasing grid refinement however relating to fig 8 the magnitude of the oscillations most probably related to inaccuracies in the numerical convergence of the solution and interpolation errors on the control volume surfaces is reduced with increased grid refinement interestingly the differences between the energy balance between grid 1 2 and 3 are less than the differences between the delivered power the discrepancies are most probably deduced from a combination of numerical dissipation and numerical convergence of solution table 3 also includes the detailed energy balance decomposition the pressure work reduces with increased grid refinement while the axial kinetic energy flux contribution increases studying these terms combined which often is relevant less difference is seen between the grids 75 0 75 5 and 76 0 respectively a larger contribution from these terms and the transverse kinetic energy flux in conjunction with grid refinement can be related to the reduced contribution from internal energy flux a finer grid may imply a reduced numerical dissipation in the propeller vicinity to estimate the level of numerical dissipation for control volume a a rickardson extrapolation of the internal energy flux is conducted see fig 9 two additional grids coarser than grid 1 still keeping the cell refinement ratio of 50 are included for the extrapolation due to the unstructured grid a rickardson extrapolation is not strictly valid but can still give an indication of the discretization error the discretization error of the internal energy flux may be considered as a representative of the numerical dissipation the error is 1 2 for control volume a and grid 2 in comparison to the asymptotic value of the internal energy flux 17 3 since the energy decomposition is grid dependent it is highly recommended to apply similar meshing strategy and grid refinement level for comparative studies 4 4 discussion to be able to improve the propulsive system or to analyze differences in performance between propulsive systems the energy balance decomposition is preferably complemented by a visualization of the energy fluxes in fig 10 the internal energy flux is shown over the control volume surface as expected the flux is negligible on the upstream and lateral control volume boundaries where no work has been extracted from the flow on the downstream side of the control volume the boundary layer losses from the individual blades are depicted the highest level of internal energy flux is seen in the tip region where the blade velocity relative the surrounding fluid is highest and the tip vortex is present for a ship propulsion system including skeg propeller axes rudder etc it can be beneficial to view all sides of this volume as well as intermediate surfaces within the control volume to be able to analyze and locate the origin of the losses due to the absence of interaction effects for the propeller in open water the visualization of the results is limited to contour plots of axial kinetic energy flux transverse kinetic energy flux pressure work and internal energy flux at a distance of 0 2 d p downstream the propeller see figure 11 note that the color scales are different for the different terms so direct comparisons should not be made the high pressure produced behind the blade surfaces is clearly depicted at this distance behind the propeller the circumferential non uniformities due to the four blades are also observed on the axial kinetic energy flux contour plot the axial wake non uniformity loss secondary axial kinetic energy flux and pressure defect work rate are not visualized since they cannot be evaluated for a generic control volume these terms will however decrease as the pressure and axial velocity perturbations are reduced and the relative magnitude of the perturbations between different designs may be identified with the aid of axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work contour plots the transverse kinetic energy originates from the wake behind the propeller blade with the highest fluxes initiate from the propeller root where suction side separation zones are present 5 conclusions we have shown that a control volume analysis of energy applied on cfd results provide an alternative method to study the power consumption of a propulsion unit the delivered power to the propeller shaft can be expressed in terms of thrust power axial wake non uniformity losses transverse kinetic energy flux and internal turbulent kinetic energy flux this implies that the hydrodynamic losses associated with a high and or uneven acceleration of the flow slipstream rotation and viscous losses can be tracked and quantified since all possible hydrodynamic losses in the system are depicted in the analysis it should be possible for a designer to avoid sub optimized solutions we consider this method promising as a complement to the established methods based on experimental procedures for analyzing propulsor hull interaction especially for novel but also for more common propulsion configurations where the hydrodynamic performance cannot always be fully understood based on established methods the method also enables analysis of the propeller performance during one revolution which can open up possibilities for design improvements our further work will therefore focus on application of the energy balance analysis on propulsion systems in behind conditions as well as a quantitative method for determination or guidance of the distribution between favorable and loss components of axial kinetic energy flux pressure work for more complex systems energy balance analyses can be used not only as a tool for more comprehensive understanding of a system but it can also be used within design and automated optimization procedures since it gives quantitative information on the hydrodynamic losses it is a post processing tool with the only additional requirement of solving the energy equation and can be employed in any cfd code based on commonly available variables acknowledgements this research is supported by the swedish energy agency grant number 38849 1 and

finally simulations are carried on a supply ship to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach keywords dynamic positioning adaptive fuzzy system auxiliary dynamic system high gain observer output feedback 1 introduction dynamic positioning dp system enable the ship automatically to maintain at the desired position and heading by means of its thrusters and propellers sørensen 2011 tannuri and morishita 2006 compared with the traditional anchor moored positioning the dp system has the strength of working in the deep ocean high positioning accuracy and avoiding damaging the seabed fossen 2011 with the development of the ocean exploration and exploitation the dp system has been increasingly used in offshore operations such as offshore oil and gas drilling underwater cable and pipe laying and dredging hassani et al 2013 the first dp system was designed by proportional integrator derivative pid controllers cascaded with low pass or notch filters in the early 1960 s in the middle of 1970 s all kinds of control methodologies based on optimal control theory of linear kalman filter were introduced into the dp system balchen and jenssen 1980 the main disadvantages of these methods were that the kinetic equations of motions must be linearized under certain conditions with the progress of the nonlinear control theory the dp nonlinear control gradually gained a lot attention in 1990 s the dp controller with nonlinear observer were developed by the vectorial backstepping methology where the disturbances were neglected fossen and grøvlen 1998 subsequently the study in fossen and strand 1999 a passive observer with wave filtering was proposed for the dp system to estimate low frequency positions and velocities of ships from noisy position measurements and environment disturbances combining the passive observer and proportional derivative pd control law a globally asymptotically stable controller was presented for the dp system in loria et al 2000 where the slowly varying environmental disturbances and the unmeasured states were considered and then to deal with the problem of dynamic uncertainties and the disturbances acting on the ship a class of feedforward approximators in tee and ge 2006 and a radial basis function rbf networks in du et al 2013 were employed to compensate for these furthermore in the presence of unknown dynamic parameters of the ship unmeasured velocities and unknown time varying disturbances an adaptive robust output feedback controller was developed for the dp system by merging adaptive rbf neural networks and high gain observer into the vectorial backstepping method du et al 2015 unfortunately it should be pointed out that all aforementioned control methods for the dp system did not take into account input saturation input saturation is a potential problem for the dp system as the commanded control inputs computed by the dp controller are probably constrained by the maximum forces and moment that the propulsion system can provide this would degrade the control system performance and even lead to instability of the dp system in recent years many approaches have been put into use in order to resolve the input saturation problem for the dp control system for example a model predictive control mpc was introduced for the dp system combining dp control design with thruster allocation where the unknown disturbance and input saturation problem were addressed by the optimization problem of mpc veksler et al 2016 also a dp proportional integral pi controller was proposed in perez and donaire 2009 where the disturbances and input saturation were settled by integral control with anti windup scheme in addition a dp passivity based control design was proposed in donaire and perez 2012 where disturbances and input saturation were handled by using anti windup compensator in the port hamiltonian however in veksler et al 2016 perez and donaire 2009 and donaire and perez 2012 the disturbance acting on the ship was unknown constant it is restrictive in practice in the latest literature a robust nonlinear control law for the dp system has been given in du et al 2016 where a disturbance observer was constructed to estimate unknown time varying disturbance and an auxiliary dynamic system was employed to resolve input saturation but the unmeasured states of the ship were not considered with the development of fuzzy control theory adaptive fuzzy control scheme provides an effective control approach for the nonlinear system an adaptive fuzzy tracking controller was designed for uncertain nonstrict feedback nonlinear systems with unknown nonlinear functions or model uncertain for the case of the states measurable and the states immeasurable tong et al 2016a also an adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller was developed for the switched systems under the consideration of unknown nonlinearities unmeasured states and unknown dead zones tong et al 2016b subsequently considering unstructured uncertainties unmodeled dynamics and unavailable states a novel robust adaptive fuzzy output feedback stabilization control approach was proposed in tong and li 2017 in addition the problem of adaptive fuzzy output feedback control was investigated for a class of output constrained uncertain nonlinear systems with input saturation unmeasured states and unknown disturbance in li et al 2014 to be specific using backstepping control and approximation based adaptive technique to accommodate certain faults in the plant and the controller itself in the tracking control of surface vessels yet only the time varying hydrodynamic disturbances were considered chen and tan 2013 however all aforementioned fuzzy control theory for the nonlinear system did not take into account unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters dynamic disturbance and input saturation simultaneously it is known that the problem of unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters dynamic disturbance and input saturation is unavoidable for the dp control system design yet the above literature exist theoretical obstruction or engineering practical shortcoming motivated by the above considerations a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is developed for the dp system considering the unmeasured states of the ship unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation simultaneously in this paper to the best of authors knowledge it is the first time in the literature that all the conditions above are simultaneously dealt with in the dp control design on one hand a high gain observer is used to estimate unmeasured state and the estimated states are fed back to the control system on the other hand an adaptive fuzzy system is employed to approximate the uncertain term induced by unknown dynamic model parameters and the unknown time varying environment disturbances without the need for explicit knowledge of the bounds in the control law in particularly an auxiliary dynamic system is exploited to deal with the input saturation on the basis of above the dp control law is developed by vectorial backstepping method the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the established adaptive fuzzy output feedback control method can solve the problems of unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation simultaneously 2 the proposed dp control scheme is simple and easy to implement in practice due to applying adaptive fuzzy control 3 the boundedness of the closed loop system is guaranteed the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the problem formulation and preliminaries are provided for preparation the nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback control design is presented for the dp system of ships with unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation in section 3 simulation studies and comparations on a supply ship are given in section 4 to illustrate the effective of the proposed control approach finally the conclusion is drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 problem formulation the nonlinear motion mathematical model of a ship in the dp mode is expressed as fossen and strand 1999 1 η j ψ ν 2 m ν d ν τ d η ν t where η x y ψ t is the position vector in the earth fixed frame consisting of the surge position x the sway position y and the heading ψ 0 2 π of the ship ν u υ r t is the velocity vector in the body fixed frame consisting of the surge velocity u the sway velocity υ the yaw rate r of the ship j ψ is the rotation matrix given by 3 j ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 with the property j 1 ψ j t ψ and j ψ 1 here stands for the determinant of a matrix m denotes the inertial matrix including added mass effects which is invertible and positive definite d denotes the linear damping matrix τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t represents the control input vector produced by propeller and thruster system consisting of force τ 1 in surge force τ 2 in sway and moment τ 3 in yaw in practice the control forces and moment are limited to saturation nonlinearities due to the physical limitations of thrusters and can be described as follows 4 τ i τ i max i f τ c i τ i max τ c i i f τ i min τ c i τ i max i 1 2 3 τ i min i f τ c i τ i min where τ i max and τ i min are the maximum and minimum control forces or moments that the ship s propulsion system can provide respectively τ c τ c 1 τ c 2 τ c 3 t is the commanded control vector calculated by the dp control law including commanded control forces τ c 1 in surge and τ c 2 in sway and moment τ c 3 in yaw d η ν t r 3 is unknown time varying environmental disturbance depends on η and v due to wind waves and currents and unmodeled dynamics assumption 1 the parameters m and d are unknown yet m m t and d is positive definite the ship s velocity vector is not available for the feedback remark 1 the parameters m and d are related to ship s operation and sea states which are constantly changing besides the ship s velocities are unmeasured for most ships hence the assumption 1 is reasonable lemma 1 tee and ge 2006 for the continuous disturbance function d i η ν t r i 1 2 3 there exists positive smooth nondecreasing functions p i η υ r and q i t r such that d i η υ t p i η υ q i t remark 2 since the ocean environment is constantly changing and has finite energy the disturbance acting on ship can be deemed to be the unknown time varying yet bounded signals lemma 1 allows one to separate the multivariable disturbance term d i η υ t i 1 2 3 into a bounding function in terms of the internal states of the ship η υ and a bounding function in terms of time t as will be shown in section 3 2 this separation is available since p i η υ can be approximated with observable position and velocity subsequently we just need to make a mild assumption on the general time dependent effects assumption 2 for the time dependent function q i t i 1 2 3 there exists constant q i r i 1 2 3 t t 0 such that q i t q i remark 3 since the time dependent component of the disturbance can be largely ascribed to the exogenous environment effects which have finite energy hence are bounded based on the approximate ability of the controller knowledge of the bound is not required only the assertion of its existence is in this paper the control objective is to design a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller for the dp system of the ship 1 and 2 under the assumption 1 and 2 such that the ship is maintained at the desired values of its position and heading with arbitrary accuracy and guaranteeing all signals in the closed loop dp control system are uniformly ultimately bounded 2 2 fuzzy logic systems in this paper a fuzzy logic system is used to approximate an unknown polynomial induced by unknown dynamic model uncertainties and the unknown time varying environment disturbances a fuzzy logic system consists of four components fuzzy rule base singleton fuzzifier the product inference and the center average defuzzifier fuzzy rule base is composed of fuzzy if then rule set and it is the core of the fuzzy system in this sense the other part of the fuzzy system is based on a reasonable and effective way to perform these rules wang 1997 tong et al 2009 liu et al 2014 specifically the fuzzy rule base is composed of the following fuzzy if then rule sets in this paper 5 i f x 1 i s f 1 l 1 x 2 i s f 2 l 2 x n i s f n l n t h e n g i s e l 1 l n where x x 1 x 2 x n t r n and g r are the input variable and the output variable of the fuzzy logic system respectively f i l i i 1 2 n l i 1 2 p i is a fuzzy set for the input variable x i p i is the number of the fuzzy sets for the input variable x i e l i l n l 1 l n 1 2 n n i 1 n p i is a fuzzy set for the output variable g n is the total number of rules in the fuzzy rule base through the singleton fuzzifier the product inference and the center average defuzzifier wang 1997 tong et al 2009 liu et al 2014 the output of the fuzzy system is 6 g x l 1 1 p 1 l n 1 p n g l 1 l n i 1 n μ f i l i x i l 1 1 p 1 l n 1 p n i 1 n μ f i l i x i where μ f i l i x is the membership function of the fuzzy set f i l i g l 1 l n a r g max g r μ e l 1 l n g with μ e l 1 l n g as the membership function of the fuzzy set e l 1 l n notate 7 g g 1 g 2 g n t r n as the fuzzy parameter vector define the fuzzy basis functions as 8 ϕ l 1 l n x i 1 n μ f i l i x i l 1 1 p 1 l n 1 p n i 1 n μ f i l i x i l 1 l n 1 2 n notate 9 ϕ x ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x ϕ n x t r n as the fuzzy basis function vector then the fuzzy logic system 6 can be written as the linearization parametric form 10 g x g t ϕ x lemma 2 universal approximation theorem wang 1997 for any given real continuous function f x on a compact u r n and arbitrary ε 0 there exists a fuzzy system g x in the form of 10 such that 11 sup x u f x g x ε by lemma 1 the fuzzy logic system is universal approximator it can approximate any continuous function on a compact space which is expressed as 12 f x g t ϕ x δ x where δ x r is the minimum approximation error define the optimal parameter vector g r n as 13 g arg min g r n sup x u f x g t ϕ x 2 3 high gain observer since only the ship s position and heading are measurable and the velocity of the ship is unavailable the high gain observer will be used to estimate the immeasurable velocity of the ship with dynamic uncertainties and unknown disturbances to implement the output feedback control in this paper the lemma about the high gain observer is given as follows lemma 3 ge and zhang 2003 assume the output y t of a system and its first n 1 derivatives are bounded that is y k y k k 0 1 2 n 1 with positive constants y k consider the following system 14 δ χ i χ i 1 k 0 1 n 1 δ χ n λ 1 χ n λ 2 χ n 1 λ n 1 χ 2 χ 1 y t with δ being any small positive constant where χ i i 1 2 n are the state variables of the observer choosing the parameters λ 1 λ 2 λ n 1 such that the polynomial s n λ 1 s n 1 λ n 1 s 1 is hurwitz then we have the following properties 1 χ k 1 δ k y k δ β k 1 k 0 1 n 1 where β χ n λ 1 χ n 1 λ n 1 χ 1 with β k denoting the k th derivative of β 2 there exist positive constants t and b k only depending on y k 1 k 1 2 n δ and λ i i 1 n 1 such that β k b k for all t t remark 4 the properties 1 and 2 of lemma 3 indicate that χ k 1 δ k converges to y k with bounded error if y and its k th derivative are bounded thus χ k 1 δ k k 0 1 n 1 can provide the estimations of the unmeasured derivatives of the output of the system up to the n 1 th order in addition 14 does not need to know a priori knowledge of unavailable state variables of system and only relies on the available output signals of system the above mentioned advantages make the high gain observer attractive in the output feedback control design for a class of nonlinear systems with only output being available and with dynamic uncertainties and unknown disturbances there is no doubt that such systems represent extensive practical applications 3 dp system nonlinear adaptive design the schematic diagram of the dp control system of the ship is shown in fig 1 the desired position and heading of the ship are the input variables of the dp control system and the actual position and heading of the ship are the output variables of the dp control system the ship operating in the ocean is affected by the environmental disturbances which causes the deviations of the ship s position and heading from their expected values for the sake of eliminating the positioning deviations of the ship under the condition of input saturation the dp control system can calculate the appropriate forces and moment that the propellers and thrusters system can provide according to the deviations between the actual and the desired position and heading of the ship in this section by combing the high gain observer the adaptive fuzzy system and auxiliary dynamic system with vectorial backstepping method a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback control scheme for the dp system of the ship is designed 3 1 high gain observer design for dp system of the ship in most cases measurements of the ship s velocities are not available therefore estimations of the velocities must be computed from noisy position and heading measurements through a state observer in this subsection a high gain observer is employed to estimate the unavailable velocity of the system from the output η of the system for the preparation of the controller design guaranteeing the security of the system under the condition of temporary failure of the measurement then the high gain observer for dp system of the ship is constructed as follows 15 δ χ 1 χ 2 16 δ χ 2 λ 1 χ 2 χ 1 η t where δ is any small positive constant and χ 1 χ 2 r 3 are the state vectors of the high gain observer then the estimation of η t and its first derivative η t are 17 η ˆ χ 1 18 η ˆ 1 δ χ 2 hence according to 1 and 18 the estimated value ν ˆ of the velocity vector ν of the ship can be denoted as 19 ν ˆ j t ψ 1 δ χ 2 according to 17 and the property 1 of lemma 3 when k 0 we can obtain 20 η ˆ η χ 1 η δ β where β χ 2 λ 1 χ 1 in the light of 20 and the property 2 of lemma 3 when k 0 we can obtain 21 η ˆ η δ β δ b 1 where b 1 is a positive constant similarly according to 1 19 and the property 1 of lemma 3 we have 22 ν ˆ ν j t ψ 1 δ χ 2 η δ j t ψ β in the light of 22 and property 2 of lemma 3 we have 23 ν ˆ ν δ β δ b 2 where b 2 is positive constant theorem 1 under the assumption 1 the high gain observer constructed by 15 17 and 19 can provide the estimations of the position vector η and velocity vector ν of the ship 1 and 2 by properly choosing the parameters δ and λ 1 such that the polynomial s 2 λ 1 s is hurwitz the estimation errors η ˆ η and ν ˆ ν of the observer are guaranteed to be bounded proof it is obviously known from 21 and 23 that the position estimation error η ˆ η and the velocity estimation error ν ˆ ν are bounded thus theorem 1 has been proved 3 2 nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback control design for dp system of the ship in this subsection a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is designed based on the high gain observer for the dp system of the ship combining a fuzzy logic system and an auxiliary dynamic system with vectorial backstepping methodology the design process consists of the following two steps step 1 define the first error variable 24 z 1 η η d where η d x d y d ψ d is constant ν z 2 α 1 is the virtual control variable and ν is defined as the sum of the second error variable z 2 and α 1 which can be interpreted as a stabilizing function therefore 25 z 1 j ψ z 2 α 1 the stability function is selected as 26 α 1 j t ψ k 1 z 1 where k 1 k 1 t r 3 3 is the positive definite design matrix substituting 26 into 25 z 1 becomes 27 z 1 k 1 z 1 j ψ z 2 consider the lyapunov function candidate for the subsystem 24 28 v 1 1 2 z 1 t z 1 29 v 1 z 1 t z 1 z 1 t

ς 2 ς 3 t is the state variable of the auxiliary dynamic system τ τ τ c k ς k ς t r 3 3 is a positive definite design matrix and ϖ 0 is the small design value then the nonlinear control law is designed as follows 36 τ c j ψ z 1 k 2 z 2 d ν m α 1 p η v q t k s ς where k 2 k 2 t r 3 3 and k s k s t r 3 3 are the positive definite design matrices noticing the assumption 1 here we employ the estimations η ˆ and ν ˆ of the high gain observer instead of η and ν in the following control law design then we define the new error vectors 37 z ˆ 1 η ˆ η d 38 z ˆ 2 ν ˆ α ˆ 1 where 39 α ˆ 1 j t ψ k

control law is not feasible in order to resolve this problem based on lemma 2 the fuzzy logic system 10 could be used to approximate the unknown term d ν m α 1 p q in the control law τ c i e using the fuzzy logic system 10 instead of the unknown term in the control law to be specific applying to the ship model define x ˆ x ˆ y ˆ ψ ˆ u ˆ v ˆ r ˆ t r 6 and f ˆ x f ˆ 1 x f ˆ 2 x f ˆ 3 x t r 3 as the

with the assumption 1 and 2 under the action of nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller 50 and adaptive update law 51 with the fuzzy logic system and the auxiliary dynamic system the

71 0 v 2 a c 2 ρ v 2 a 0 c 2 ρ e ρ t where ρ min ρ 1 ρ 2 and c max c a c b it becomes obvious that v 2 a is uniformly ultimately bounded from 71 furthermore according to 55 z 1 z 2 θ j ς are uniformly ultimately bounded besides it is known that η is bounded from the boundedness of z 1 η d and 24 similarly from 30 ν is also bounded furthermore θ j is bounded due to 49 hence θ ˆ j θ j θ j is also bounded in addition we can know the estimation error η η ˆ and ν ν ˆ are bounded in the light of theorem 1 in section 3 1 thus all signals in the closed loop dp control system are bounded furthermore substituting 55 into 71 we can obtain 72 z 1 c 2 ρ v 2 a 0 c 2 ρ e ρ t as we all know z 1 denotes the ship positioning error and depends on the values of c and ρ only z 1 is small enough can the ship

that z 1 λ z 1 for all t t z 1 thus the ship positioning error can converge to the compact set ω z 1 z 1 λ z 1 which c 2 ρ can be made arbitrarily small by approximately selecting design parameter δ λ

accuracy theorem 2 has been proved remark 5 according to formula 72 we can make positioning error to be small by increasing the eigenvalue of the matrix k 1 k 2 k ς γ j and σ j or decreasing the eigenvalue of the matrix δ k s and ϖ it should be noted that the small positioning errors will result in the large control energy therefore in practical applications the design parameters should be adjusted carefully for achieving suitable transient performance and control action 4 simulation results in this section the simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed

respectively the norm z 1 of position error tending to zero is shown in fig 6 which demonstrates the proposed controller has good steady state performance fig 7 shows that the norms θ ˆ 1 θ ˆ 2 θ ˆ 3 of adaptive update law converge to certain values which indicate the boundedness of adaptive update law fig 8 and fig 9 indicate that the high gain observer would be able to estimate the ship states and guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the ship states therefore from the simulation results it is seen that the proposed nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller based on the high gain observer has the good robustness against unknown time varying disturbance and could achieve the control target 4 2 comparisons with the pid controller in this subsection the simulations of

k d d i a g 9 10 7 9 10 7 9 10 10 the simulation results are depicted using dashed line in figs 2 7 respectively it can be observed from figs 2 7 that the pid controller can force the ship to the desired position and heading 0 m 0 m 0 t also the velocities control input of the ship and the norm z 1 of position error can converge to zero however the difference between the proposed controller and the pid controller is that the latter has longer response time about 150s shown in figs 3 and 4 the error convergence speed is not satisfactory as well in fig 6 that is to say the pid controller possesses unsatisfactory control performance since the pid controller with the fixed control gains k p k i and k d has no adaptive ability to unknown model parameters and robustness against uncertain time varying environment disturbances whereas the adaptive fuzzy logic system has the adaptability of exploiting the universal approximation and online learning to compensate the uncertain term induced by unknown dynamic model parameters and the unknown time varying environment disturbances therefore the proposed nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is more effective for the dp system of ships in the presence of unmeasured states of ships unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation 5 conclusion in this paper a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller based on the high gain observer has been designed for dp system of ships combining a fuzzy logic system and an auxiliary dynamic system in the presence of unmeasured states of the ship unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation the proposed control scheme only depends on the measurements of the ship position and heading because the high gain observer is used to estimate the unavailable velocities of the ship it has been proved that the proposed control scheme can make the position error arbitrarily small while guaranteeing the uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed loop signals in the dp system simulation results and comparisons have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed dp control scheme in the future we will consider the character of the adaptive update law for the purpose of converging to the small value further we will improve the nonlinear controller such that the control system is asymptotic stable 
23399,this paper develops a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller for dynamic positioning dp system of ships in the presence of unmeasured states of ships unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation it is the first time that all the conditions above are simultaneously dealt with in the dp control design by combining adaptive fuzzy system and auxiliary dynamic system a control scheme with high gain observer is developed via vectorial backstepping method it is proved that the proposed nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller can maintain the ship at desired position and heading with arbitrary accuracy while guaranteeing the uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed loop signals in the dp system finally simulations are carried on a supply ship to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach keywords dynamic positioning adaptive fuzzy system auxiliary dynamic system high gain observer output feedback 1 introduction dynamic positioning dp system enable the ship automatically to maintain at the desired position and heading by means of its thrusters and propellers sørensen 2011 tannuri and morishita 2006 compared with the traditional anchor moored positioning the dp system has the strength of working in the deep ocean high positioning accuracy and avoiding damaging the seabed fossen 2011 with the development of the ocean exploration and exploitation the dp system has been increasingly used in offshore operations such as offshore oil and gas drilling underwater cable and pipe laying and dredging hassani et al 2013 the first dp system was designed by proportional integrator derivative pid controllers cascaded with low pass or notch filters in the early 1960 s in the middle of 1970 s all kinds of control methodologies based on optimal control theory of linear kalman filter were introduced into the dp system balchen and jenssen 1980 the main disadvantages of these methods were that the kinetic equations of motions must be linearized under certain conditions with the progress of the nonlinear control theory the dp nonlinear control gradually gained a lot attention in 1990 s the dp controller with nonlinear observer were developed by the vectorial backstepping methology where the disturbances were neglected fossen and grøvlen 1998 subsequently the study in fossen and strand 1999 a passive observer with wave filtering was proposed for the dp system to estimate low frequency positions and velocities of ships from noisy position measurements and environment disturbances combining the passive observer and proportional derivative pd control law a globally asymptotically stable controller was presented for the dp system in loria et al 2000 where the slowly varying environmental disturbances and the unmeasured states were considered and then to deal with the problem of dynamic uncertainties and the disturbances acting on the ship a class of feedforward approximators in tee and ge 2006 and a radial basis function rbf networks in du et al 2013 were employed to compensate for these furthermore in the presence of unknown dynamic parameters of the ship unmeasured velocities and unknown time varying disturbances an adaptive robust output feedback controller was developed for the dp system by merging adaptive rbf neural networks and high gain observer into the vectorial backstepping method du et al 2015 unfortunately it should be pointed out that all aforementioned control methods for the dp system did not take into account input saturation input saturation is a potential problem for the dp system as the commanded control inputs computed by the dp controller are probably constrained by the maximum forces and moment that the propulsion system can provide this would degrade the control system performance and even lead to instability of the dp system in recent years many approaches have been put into use in order to resolve the input saturation problem for the dp control system for example a model predictive control mpc was introduced for the dp system combining dp control design with thruster allocation where the unknown disturbance and input saturation problem were addressed by the optimization problem of mpc veksler et al 2016 also a dp proportional integral pi controller was proposed in perez and donaire 2009 where the disturbances and input saturation were settled by integral control with anti windup scheme in addition a dp passivity based control design was proposed in donaire and perez 2012 where disturbances and input saturation were handled by using anti windup compensator in the port hamiltonian however in veksler et al 2016 perez and donaire 2009 and donaire and perez 2012 the disturbance acting on the ship was unknown constant it is restrictive in practice in the latest literature a robust nonlinear control law for the dp system has been given in du et al 2016 where a disturbance observer was constructed to estimate unknown time varying disturbance and an auxiliary dynamic system was employed to resolve input saturation but the unmeasured states of the ship were not considered with the development of fuzzy control theory adaptive fuzzy control scheme provides an effective control approach for the nonlinear system an adaptive fuzzy tracking controller was designed for uncertain nonstrict feedback nonlinear systems with unknown nonlinear functions or model uncertain for the case of the states measurable and the states immeasurable tong et al 2016a also an adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller was developed for the switched systems under the consideration of unknown nonlinearities unmeasured states and unknown dead zones tong et al 2016b subsequently considering unstructured uncertainties unmodeled dynamics and unavailable states a novel robust adaptive fuzzy output feedback stabilization control approach was proposed in tong and li 2017 in addition the problem of adaptive fuzzy output feedback control was investigated for a class of output constrained uncertain nonlinear systems with input saturation unmeasured states and unknown disturbance in li et al 2014 to be specific using backstepping control and approximation based adaptive technique to accommodate certain faults in the plant and the controller itself in the tracking control of surface vessels yet only the time varying hydrodynamic disturbances were considered chen and tan 2013 however all aforementioned fuzzy control theory for the nonlinear system did not take into account unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters dynamic disturbance and input saturation simultaneously it is known that the problem of unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters dynamic disturbance and input saturation is unavoidable for the dp control system design yet the above literature exist theoretical obstruction or engineering practical shortcoming motivated by the above considerations a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is developed for the dp system considering the unmeasured states of the ship unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation simultaneously in this paper to the best of authors knowledge it is the first time in the literature that all the conditions above are simultaneously dealt with in the dp control design on one hand a high gain observer is used to estimate unmeasured state and the estimated states are fed back to the control system on the other hand an adaptive fuzzy system is employed to approximate the uncertain term induced by unknown dynamic model parameters and the unknown time varying environment disturbances without the need for explicit knowledge of the bounds in the control law in particularly an auxiliary dynamic system is exploited to deal with the input saturation on the basis of above the dp control law is developed by vectorial backstepping method the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the established adaptive fuzzy output feedback control method can solve the problems of unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation simultaneously 2 the proposed dp control scheme is simple and easy to implement in practice due to applying adaptive fuzzy control 3 the boundedness of the closed loop system is guaranteed the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the problem formulation and preliminaries are provided for preparation the nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback control design is presented for the dp system of ships with unmeasured states unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation in section 3 simulation studies and comparations on a supply ship are given in section 4 to illustrate the effective of the proposed control approach finally the conclusion is drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 problem formulation the nonlinear motion mathematical model of a ship in the dp mode is expressed as fossen and strand 1999 1 η j ψ ν 2 m ν d ν τ d η ν t where η x y ψ t is the position vector in the earth fixed frame consisting of the surge position x the sway position y and the heading ψ 0 2 π of the ship ν u υ r t is the velocity vector in the body fixed frame consisting of the surge velocity u the sway velocity υ the yaw rate r of the ship j ψ is the rotation matrix given by 3 j ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 with the property j 1 ψ j t ψ and j ψ 1 here stands for the determinant of a matrix m denotes the inertial matrix including added mass effects which is invertible and positive definite d denotes the linear damping matrix τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t represents the control input vector produced by propeller and thruster system consisting of force τ 1 in surge force τ 2 in sway and moment τ 3 in yaw in practice the control forces and moment are limited to saturation nonlinearities due to the physical limitations of thrusters and can be described as follows 4 τ i τ i max i f τ c i τ i max τ c i i f τ i min τ c i τ i max i 1 2 3 τ i min i f τ c i τ i min where τ i max and τ i min are the maximum and minimum control forces or moments that the ship s propulsion system can provide respectively τ c τ c 1 τ c 2 τ c 3 t is the commanded control vector calculated by the dp control law including commanded control forces τ c 1 in surge and τ c 2 in sway and moment τ c 3 in yaw d η ν t r 3 is unknown time varying environmental disturbance depends on η and v due to wind waves and currents and unmodeled dynamics assumption 1 the parameters m and d are unknown yet m m t and d is positive definite the ship s velocity vector is not available for the feedback remark 1 the parameters m and d are related to ship s operation and sea states which are constantly changing besides the ship s velocities are unmeasured for most ships hence the assumption 1 is reasonable lemma 1 tee and ge 2006 for the continuous disturbance function d i η ν t r i 1 2 3 there exists positive smooth nondecreasing functions p i η υ r and q i t r such that d i η υ t p i η υ q i t remark 2 since the ocean environment is constantly changing and has finite energy the disturbance acting on ship can be deemed to be the unknown time varying yet bounded signals lemma 1 allows one to separate the multivariable disturbance term d i η υ t i 1 2 3 into a bounding function in terms of the internal states of the ship η υ and a bounding function in terms of time t as will be shown in section 3 2 this separation is available since p i η υ can be approximated with observable position and velocity subsequently we just need to make a mild assumption on the general time dependent effects assumption 2 for the time dependent function q i t i 1 2 3 there exists constant q i r i 1 2 3 t t 0 such that q i t q i remark 3 since the time dependent component of the disturbance can be largely ascribed to the exogenous environment effects which have finite energy hence are bounded based on the approximate ability of the controller knowledge of the bound is not required only the assertion of its existence is in this paper the control objective is to design a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller for the dp system of the ship 1 and 2 under the assumption 1 and 2 such that the ship is maintained at the desired values of its position and heading with arbitrary accuracy and guaranteeing all signals in the closed loop dp control system are uniformly ultimately bounded 2 2 fuzzy logic systems in this paper a fuzzy logic system is used to approximate an unknown polynomial induced by unknown dynamic model uncertainties and the unknown time varying environment disturbances a fuzzy logic system consists of four components fuzzy rule base singleton fuzzifier the product inference and the center average defuzzifier fuzzy rule base is composed of fuzzy if then rule set and it is the core of the fuzzy system in this sense the other part of the fuzzy system is based on a reasonable and effective way to perform these rules wang 1997 tong et al 2009 liu et al 2014 specifically the fuzzy rule base is composed of the following fuzzy if then rule sets in this paper 5 i f x 1 i s f 1 l 1 x 2 i s f 2 l 2 x n i s f n l n t h e n g i s e l 1 l n where x x 1 x 2 x n t r n and g r are the input variable and the output variable of the fuzzy logic system respectively f i l i i 1 2 n l i 1 2 p i is a fuzzy set for the input variable x i p i is the number of the fuzzy sets for the input variable x i e l i l n l 1 l n 1 2 n n i 1 n p i is a fuzzy set for the output variable g n is the total number of rules in the fuzzy rule base through the singleton fuzzifier the product inference and the center average defuzzifier wang 1997 tong et al 2009 liu et al 2014 the output of the fuzzy system is 6 g x l 1 1 p 1 l n 1 p n g l 1 l n i 1 n μ f i l i x i l 1 1 p 1 l n 1 p n i 1 n μ f i l i x i where μ f i l i x is the membership function of the fuzzy set f i l i g l 1 l n a r g max g r μ e l 1 l n g with μ e l 1 l n g as the membership function of the fuzzy set e l 1 l n notate 7 g g 1 g 2 g n t r n as the fuzzy parameter vector define the fuzzy basis functions as 8 ϕ l 1 l n x i 1 n μ f i l i x i l 1 1 p 1 l n 1 p n i 1 n μ f i l i x i l 1 l n 1 2 n notate 9 ϕ x ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x ϕ n x t r n as the fuzzy basis function vector then the fuzzy logic system 6 can be written as the linearization parametric form 10 g x g t ϕ x lemma 2 universal approximation theorem wang 1997 for any given real continuous function f x on a compact u r n and arbitrary ε 0 there exists a fuzzy system g x in the form of 10 such that 11 sup x u f x g x ε by lemma 1 the fuzzy logic system is universal approximator it can approximate any continuous function on a compact space which is expressed as 12 f x g t ϕ x δ x where δ x r is the minimum approximation error define the optimal parameter vector g r n as 13 g arg min g r n sup x u f x g t ϕ x 2 3 high gain observer since only the ship s position and heading are measurable and the velocity of the ship is unavailable the high gain observer will be used to estimate the immeasurable velocity of the ship with dynamic uncertainties and unknown disturbances to implement the output feedback control in this paper the lemma about the high gain observer is given as follows lemma 3 ge and zhang

λ 1 s n 1 λ n 1 s 1 is hurwitz then we have the following properties 1 χ k 1 δ k y k δ β k 1 k 0 1 n 1 where β χ n λ 1 χ n 1 λ n 1 χ 1 with β k denoting the k th derivative of β 2 there exist positive constants t and b k only depending on y k 1 k 1 2 n δ and λ i i 1 n 1 such that β k b k for all t t remark 4 the properties 1 and 2 of lemma 3 indicate that χ k 1 δ k converges to y k with bounded error if y and its k th derivative are bounded thus χ k 1 δ k k 0 1 n 1 can provide the estimations of the unmeasured derivatives of the output of the system up to the n 1 th order in addition 14 does not need to know a priori knowledge of unavailable state variables of system and only relies on the available output signals of system the above mentioned advantages make the high gain observer attractive in the output feedback control design for a class of nonlinear systems with only output being available and with dynamic uncertainties and unknown disturbances there is no doubt that such systems represent extensive practical applications 3 dp system nonlinear adaptive design the schematic diagram of the dp control system of the ship is shown in fig 1 the desired position and heading of the ship are the input variables of the dp control system and the actual position and heading of the ship are the output variables of the dp control system the ship operating in the ocean is affected by the environmental disturbances which causes the deviations of the ship s position and heading from their expected values for the sake of eliminating the positioning deviations of the ship under the condition of input saturation the dp control system can calculate the appropriate forces and moment that the propellers and thrusters system can provide according to the deviations between the actual and the desired position and heading of the ship in this section by combing the high gain observer the adaptive fuzzy system and auxiliary dynamic system with vectorial backstepping method a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback control scheme for the dp system of the ship is designed 3 1 high gain observer design for dp system of the ship in most cases measurements of the ship s velocities are not available therefore estimations of the velocities must be computed from noisy position and heading measurements through a state observer in this subsection a high gain observer is employed to estimate the unavailable velocity of the system from the output η of the system for the preparation of the controller design guaranteeing the security of the system under the condition of temporary failure of the measurement then the high gain observer for dp system of the ship is constructed as follows 15 δ χ 1 χ 2 16 δ χ 2 λ 1 χ 2 χ 1 η t where δ is any small positive constant and χ 1 χ 2 r 3 are the state vectors of the high gain observer then the estimation of η t and its first derivative η t are 17 η ˆ χ 1 18 η ˆ 1 δ χ 2 hence according to 1 and 18 the estimated value ν ˆ of the velocity vector ν of the ship can be denoted as 19 ν ˆ j t ψ 1 δ χ 2 according to 17 and the property 1 of lemma 3 when k 0 we can obtain 20 η ˆ η χ 1 η δ β where β χ 2 λ 1 χ 1 in the light of 20 and the property 2 of lemma 3 when k 0 we can obtain 21 η ˆ η δ β δ b 1 where b 1 is a positive constant similarly according to 1 19 and the property 1 of lemma 3 we have 22 ν ˆ ν j t ψ 1 δ χ 2 η δ j t ψ β in the light of 22 and property 2 of lemma 3 we have 23 ν ˆ ν δ β δ b 2 where b 2 is positive constant theorem 1 under the assumption 1 the high gain observer constructed by 15 17 and 19 can provide the estimations of the position vector η and velocity vector ν of the ship 1 and 2 by properly choosing the parameters δ and λ 1 such that the polynomial s 2 λ 1 s is hurwitz the estimation errors η ˆ η and ν ˆ ν of the observer are guaranteed to be bounded proof it is obviously known from 21 and 23 that the position estimation error η ˆ η and the velocity estimation error ν ˆ ν are bounded thus theorem 1 has been proved 3 2 nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback control design for dp system of the ship in this subsection a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is designed based on the high gain observer for the dp system of the ship combining a fuzzy logic system and an auxiliary dynamic system with vectorial backstepping methodology the design process consists of the following two steps step 1 define the first error variable 24 z 1 η η d where η d x d y d ψ d is constant ν z 2 α 1 is the virtual control variable and ν is defined as the sum of the second error variable z 2 and α 1 which can be interpreted as a stabilizing function therefore 25 z 1 j ψ z 2 α 1 the stability function is selected as 26 α 1 j t ψ k 1 z 1 where k 1 k 1 t r 3 3 is the positive definite design matrix substituting 26 into 25 z 1 becomes 27 z 1 k 1 z 1 j ψ z 2 consider the lyapunov function candidate for the subsystem 24 28 v 1 1 2 z 1 t z 1 29 v 1 z 1 t z 1 z 1 t

ς 2 ς 3 t is the state variable of the auxiliary dynamic system τ τ τ c k ς k ς t r 3 3 is a positive definite design matrix and ϖ 0 is the small design value then the nonlinear control law is designed as follows 36 τ c j ψ z 1 k 2 z 2 d ν m α 1 p η v q t k s ς where k 2 k 2 t r 3 3 and k s k s t r 3 3 are the positive definite design matrices noticing the assumption 1 here we employ the estimations η ˆ and ν ˆ of the high gain observer instead of η and ν in the following control law design then we define the new error vectors 37 z ˆ 1 η ˆ η d 38 z ˆ 2 ν ˆ α ˆ 1 where 39 α ˆ 1 j t ψ k

control law is not feasible in order to resolve this problem based on lemma 2 the fuzzy logic system 10 could be used to approximate the unknown term d ν m α 1 p q in the control law τ c i e using the

ultimately bounded besides it is known that η is bounded from the boundedness of z 1 η d and 24 similarly from 30 ν is also bounded furthermore θ j is bounded due to 49 hence θ ˆ j θ j θ j is also bounded in addition we can know the estimation error η η ˆ and ν ν ˆ are bounded in the light of theorem 1 in section 3 1 thus all signals in the closed loop dp control system are bounded furthermore substituting 55 into 71 we can obtain 72 z 1 c 2 ρ v 2 a 0 c 2 ρ e ρ t as we all know z 1 denotes the ship positioning error and depends on the values of c and ρ only z 1 is small enough can the ship positioning be more accurate it is clear that the decrease of c 2 ρ v 2 a 0 c 2 ρ e ρ t can be achieved through increasing ρ or decreasing c for given λ z 1 c 2 ρ there exists a constant t z 1 0 such that z 1 λ z 1 for all t t z 1 thus the ship positioning error can converge to the compact set ω z 1 z 1 λ z 1 which c 2 ρ can be made arbitrarily small by approximately selecting design parameter δ λ

eigenvalue of the matrix δ k s and ϖ it should be noted that the small positioning errors will result in the large control energy therefore in practical applications the design parameters should be adjusted carefully for achieving suitable transient performance and control action 4 simulation results in this section the simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed

respectively the norm z 1 of position error tending to zero is shown in fig 6 which demonstrates the proposed controller has good steady state performance fig 7 shows that the norms θ ˆ 1 θ ˆ 2 θ ˆ 3 of adaptive update law converge to certain values which indicate the boundedness of adaptive update law fig 8 and fig 9 indicate that the high gain observer would be able to estimate the ship states and guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the ship states therefore from the simulation results it is seen that the proposed nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller based on the high gain observer has the good robustness against unknown time varying disturbance and could achieve the control target 4 2 comparisons with the pid controller in this subsection the simulations of

k d d i a g 9 10 7 9 10 7 9 10 10 the simulation results are depicted using dashed line in figs 2 7 respectively it can be observed from figs 2 7 that the pid controller can force the ship to the desired position and heading 0 m 0 m 0 t also the velocities control input of the ship and the norm z 1 of position error can converge to zero however the difference between the proposed controller and the pid controller is that the latter has longer response time about 150s shown in figs 3 and 4 the error convergence speed is not satisfactory as well in fig 6 that is to say the pid controller possesses unsatisfactory control performance since the pid controller with the fixed control gains k p k i and k d has no adaptive ability to unknown model parameters and robustness against uncertain time varying environment disturbances whereas the adaptive fuzzy logic system has the adaptability of exploiting the universal approximation and online learning to compensate the uncertain term induced by unknown dynamic model parameters and the unknown time varying environment disturbances therefore the proposed nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is more effective for the dp system of ships in the presence of unmeasured states of ships unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation 5 conclusion in this paper a nonlinear adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller based on the high gain observer has been designed for dp system of ships combining a fuzzy logic system and an auxiliary dynamic system in the presence of unmeasured states of the ship unknown dynamic model parameters unknown time varying environment disturbances and input saturation the proposed control scheme only depends on the measurements of the ship position and heading because the high gain observer is used to estimate the unavailable velocities of the ship it has been proved that the proposed control scheme can make the position error arbitrarily small while guaranteeing the uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed loop signals in the dp system simulation results and comparisons have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed dp control scheme in the future we will consider the character of the adaptive update law for the purpose of converging to the small value further we will improve the nonlinear controller such that the control system is asymptotic stable
