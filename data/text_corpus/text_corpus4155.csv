20775,in traditional pigging operations sealed disks having a specific amount of interference guarantee that the pig runs at the velocity of the gas behind it a bypass flow path in the pig lowers its speed while causes the uneven pig motion which is referred to as slippage the slippage raises the risk of the pig becoming stuck and negatively impacts the pipe and related facilities this paper proposes a numerical method to solve a pigging model consisting of arbitrary lagrange euler forms of the fluid flow equations and the bypass pig kinetic equation based on the moving grid method which considers the contact surfaces between the pig and the fluid as discretized grid nodes a detailed moving mesh was adopted to study the flow field around the pig the consistency between the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy and applicability of the numerical method gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the transitional motions of the pig especially its gradual restarting and the gradually smoothed velocity furthermore the variation in the friction force is the primary factor that determines the appearance of the pigging stoppage and the scale of the pig resting and the next uneven pig velocity keywords pigging simulation gas pipeline slippage moving grid 1 introduction for decades pipelines have been the most economical and efficient way to transport gas and oil to terminals pigging rids the pipeline of liquid reduces its inner corrosion and keeps it working safely and efficiently lim et al 2015 different pigs are used in different pipe working conditions and can be rubber spheres or cylinders containing several parts the diameter of the pig is usually slightly larger than the inner pipe diameter this ensures sufficient interference fit between the pipe and pig the sealing surface guarantees limited liquid leakage when the gas or the liquid propellant drives the pig the excellent sealing effect causes the pig to run at the speed of the driven fluid assuming no matter exchange between the fluid at the pig head and the pig tail the gas fluid velocity in the pipeline is usually designed to be 10 20 m s which could force a traditional pig to run at a high speed the effectiveness of the cleaning and the safety of the pigging operation can be guaranteed when the pig runs at a nearly constant speed that is not excessively high hence the use of a bypass hole which is usually at the center of a cylindrical pig has been adopted to promote the transfer of gas from the pig tail to the pig head thus lowering the pig velocity waltrich et al 2015 norris and rydahl 2003 however the various mechanisms of pig movement with and without bypass are still not completely understood in either theory or practice few studies have investigated pig motion and bypass slippage using theory or transient models most available studies have been based on field experiments and the assumption of the steady state motion of the bypass pig which neglects the transient pigging movement mcdonald and baker 1964 were the first to study pigging in a gas liquid pipeline in the steady state theory their work focused on conventional average treatments in a physical pigging model and a numerical procedure the physical pigging model separated the pipeline into four sections multiphase flow regeneration net gas liquid slug and undisturbed multiphase the steady state assumptions and empirical equations for pressure drop and liquid holdup were adopted for each step of the calculation the calculation errors primarily resulted from the steady state assumption and empirical formulas barua 1982 attempted to improve the accuracy of the empirical equations based on a large amount of experimental data nieckele et al 2001 simplified the solution procedure by assuming a constant and incompressible gas flow they improved the pigging model by including the contact force of the pig disks and the consideration of bypass flow saeidbakhsh et al 2009 investigated the motion of a small pig through different curves the trajectory of the pig was considered by applying differential kinetic equations while ignoring the effects of the flow and the constant friction force however a steady state pigging model might not provide the specific flow parameters at the points of interest in the pipe which hampers the monitoring of the pigging process kohda et al 1987 found the inconvenience in the upstream sections of pigging using the mcdonald baker model in the transient simulation hence they added two nodes to monitor the pig position and the liquid slug head which separated the pipe into three sections in a study by scoggins 1977 the rules of drift flow based on the method of characteristic moc were coupled with the pig motion which resulted in more reasonable numerical liquid holdup profiles and pressure distributions along the pipe nguyen et al 2001a 2001b proposed a transient pigging model consisting of the conservation equations of gas mass momentum and energy the gas state equation and the kinetic equation of the bypass pig in a natural gas pipeline their solution method coupled a moving pig node and moc to estimate the flow parameters and the pig velocity based on a fixed rectangular grid furthermore they demonstrated the model in an investigation of the kinetic motion of the pig as it travelled through a 90 curved pipe with the assumption of a compressible gas 2001c esmaeilzadeh et al 2006 2009 investigated a pigging model without bypass in gas and liquid pipe their concept coupled the conservation equations and the moc proposed by nguyen and was evaluated through modeling and simulation esmaeilzadeh extended the use of the nguyen model in the liquid pipeline and the findings of botros 2010 verified the accuracy and applicability of the nguyen model and esmaeilzadeh model figueiredo et al 2017 verified the accuracy and application of flux corrected transport method fct in two fluid model patricio et al 2020 simplified the two phase fct calculation to study pigging in one phase pipeline with the ghost cells connecting the pig motion and the fluid flow to the implicit numerical solution minami et al 1991 1996 proposed a pigging model using the simplified two fluid model flow regime model and pigging slug model the quasi steady state assumption for the gas phase i e that the gas phase is treated as a steady state flow for the quick changes in the high speed gas was adopted to simplify the solution the semi implicit method provided numerical results that approximated the experimental results in his work the study of pigging models then transitioned from the steady state models to transient study using the design solving method xu and gong 2005 coupled the phase transition model and the hydrodynamic model mass momentum and energy equations in an adiabatic pipe the parameters of liquid flow were primarily controlled by the phase equilibrium between the gas and condensate few studies have theoretically analyzed the non uniformity of the pig bypass velocity though some have implied that the unpredictable friction force and gas compressibility might result in slippage simone and felipe 2012 furthermore in experimental studies slippage tends to appear during the early stages of pigging and is likely to decrease along the pipe length the present study developed a pigging model by combining the gas flow and pig kinetic models which was solved by applying the finite element method fem based on a moving grid under appropriate initial and boundary conditions further laboratory experiments were performed to demonstrate the validity of the solution method and the numerical results comparisons between the numerical friction forces were performed to investigate the impact of the friction 2 mathematical modeling for the modeling the pipe was divided into two sections the upstream section which was from the inlet to the tail of the bypass pig and the downstream section which was from the pig head to the pipe outlet ambient air was used as the compressible fluid in the experiments the gas temperature was given or measured over time to simplify the solution process the flow parameters were governed by the conservation of mass and momentum equations and the state equation of the experimental gas the pigging model comprised the fluid equations and the pig kinetic motion equation evaluated using newton s second law 2 1 gas flow model for the gas flow the fluid was considered to be one phase and one dimensional with a given temperature along the pipe the mass conservation equation with assumptions of no leakage and no phase transition can be written as 1 ρ t ρ u x 0 where ρ u x and t are the gas density gas velocity distance along the pipe and time respectively the momentum conservation equation can be written as 2 ρ u t ρ u 2 x p x s where p is the absolute pressure along the pipe and s refers to the source term in the momentum conservation equation which primarily consists of the fluid friction force and the body force for simplification purposes s f f a ρ g sin θ where f f is the friction force per unit length a is the area of the pipe cross section g is the acceleration of gravity which was measured to be 9 81 m s2 θ is inclination with respect to the horizontal at the given point the friction force between the gas flow and the inner pipe wall can be calculated using the friction factor by applying the swamee jain equation jain 1976 3 1 f 1 14 2 log 10 21 25 re 0 9 ε d where f re ε and d are the friction factor reynolds number pipe inner wall roughness and inner pipe diameter respectively the swamee jain equation is used for turbulent flow re 2000 if the reynolds number is less than 2000 the friction factor is taken as 64 re the reynolds number of the fluid is re ρud μ where μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity the gas state equation is 4 p ρ r t γ 1 c v t where r t γ and c v are the gas constant the temperature of the gas flow the ratio of the specific heat and the specific heat at constant volume respectively the density of the gas can be calculated given the physical properties of the gas and the temperature 2 2 pig dynamic model in a one dimensional model the combined effects of the pig motion and the gas flow determine the pressures at the head and tail of the pig and the gas flow through the bypass hole the pig runs in a force balance state as shown in fig 1 the dynamic equation of the pig can be written based on newton s second law as follows 5 m p i g d v p i g d t p t a i l p h e a d a a h m p i g g sin θ f f f τ where m pig v pig p tail and p head are the pig mass pig velocity and pressure at the pig tail and head respectively the terms f f and f τ are the friction force and the gas shear force in the bypass hole respectively a h is the area of the bypass hole where the gas flows from the upstream to the downstream the bypass rate φ is defined as φ a h a the term f f can be calculated using the friction factor and the contact force between the pig and the pipe and the contact force can be obtained from the shrink fit correlation given by shigley 2005 the term f τ is usually far smaller than f f due to the small hole size f τ reaches its maximum value 0 244 n in the simulations when bypass rate is 1 the superficial gas velocity is 20 m s and the pig velocity is zero hence in the present study by using a winch the friction force was determined to be 193 02 n which led to less error in the friction force and provided more accurate numerical results the term f τ indicates the shear force resulting from the velocity difference between the bypass gas and the pig this term can be written as the product of the shear force stress and the bypass hole area 6 f τ τ h π d h l p i g the shear stress factor can be written as 7 τ h 1 2 f h ρ g b y u g b y v p i g u g b y v p i g where f h ρ gby and u gby are the wall friction factor of the bypass hole the bypass gas density and the absolute velocity of the bypass gas respectively for simplification the assumption of steady state flow is adopted for the bypass hole hence the gas mass at the inlet the bypass path and the outlet of bypass hole are identical i e 8 ρ g i n u g i n ρ g b y u g b y ρ g o u t u g o u t the bypass average pressure p by is determined as the bypass average pressure when assuming the pig nose and pig tail were suddenly sealed and the bypass gas reached steady state 9 p b y 2 3 p i n p o u t 2 p i n p o u t and then ρ gby is obtained by eq 4 in calculating the shear force of the bypass hole the wall hole friction factor f h can be obtained using the strategy proposed by bendiksen et al 1991 which couples the friction factors for laminar and turbulent flows proposed by moody 1947 10 f h max 16 re h 0 001375 1 2 10 4 ε h d h 10 4 re h 3 for ε d h 0 05 and re h 10 8 where re h ε h and d h are the reynolds number of the bypass flow the bypass hole roughness and the diameter of the hole respectively the reynolds number of the bypass flow is re h ρ gb u gby d h μ in a one dimensional model the pressure drop through the bypass pig is also the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the bypass hole hence given the steady state bypass flow assumption the pressure drop over the pig can be written as groote et al 2015 hosseinalipour et al 2007 singh and henkes 2012 11 p t a i l p h e a d 1 2 κ p i g ρ g b y u g b y v p i g u g b y v p i g where κ pig is the pressure loss coefficient which mainly consists of three

these parameters which were analyzed using cfd models in fluent in azpiroz s work 2015 12 κ c 1 2 1 a h a 0 75 κ f 4 f κ l d κ e 1 2 1 a h a 2 where f κ is the fanning factor which is related to the reynolds number of the gas and can be obtained by applying the churchill equation churchill 1977 for the turbulent flow pressure loss coefficient calculation 13 1 f κ 2 log 10 ε h 3 71 d h 7 re h 0 9 2 3 initial and boundary conditions treatment initial and boundary conditions need to be provided for the partial difference equations model in a real gas pipeline the velocity volume flow rate or the mass flow rate is given at the inlet point and the pressure condition is usually located at the outlet of the pipe laboratory experiments have assumed a constant mass flow rate of gas at the pipe inlet and atmospheric pressure at the pipe outlet hence the constant inlet mass flow rate of gas and the constant outlet pressure were adopted herein to verify the accuracy of the numerical results as compared with the experiments the flow reaches a steady state before the beginning of the pigging operations therefore the steady state motion of the gas was taken as the initial condition 3 numerical method the pigging procedure is a transient process and the resulting transient pig motion cannot be evaluated by applying the steady state pigging model of mcdonald and baker most researchers have adopted transient pigging models based on implicit or explicit numerical methods coupled with a fixed grid the explicit discretized method requires the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition to guarantee the stability of the calculation procedure which requires small time intervals and can thus increase the computational burden due to the complexity of the implicit methods a few of the studies have employed an implicit scheme to develop a pigging model the present study proposed a numerical method similar to the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple patankar and spalding 1972 and is described as follows most researchers use a fixed grid for pigging simulations in practice pipelines are usually several or tens of kilometers long therefore even if a pipe is divided into thousands of elements the average element length will be several meters this is significantly longer than the pig which is usually 1 2 1 5 times the pipe diameter the pressures and flow parameters at the pig head and tail are typically obtained through linear interpolation of the parameters at the two boundary nodes of the elements nguyen et al 2001a 2001b 2001c 2001b this approach can not consider the rapid variations in the flow field and pressure field near the pig moreover interpolation introduces numerical errors and fails to satisfy the relation of the pig velocity bypass flow and pressure drop over the pig in eq 11 special consideration is therefore required to represent the pipe and pig system accurately the moving grid method guarantees that the boundaries of the pig will be located at the discretized nodes at every time interval this co location of the pig and the grid node causes the pig to occupy one element thereby removing error that would be introduced by linear interpolation the equivalence of the pig velocity and the boundary node velocity guarantees the pressure drop relation eq 11 a comparison of the fixed and moving grid methods is provided in fig 2 3 1 mathematical approach when adapting this model for the moving grid method the partial spatial differential in eqs 1 and 2 is transformed from eulerian coordinates to arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale coordinates using the grid velocity 14 ρ t ρ u χ v g ρ χ 0 and 15 ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ p χ s where v g is the grid velocity and χ is the distance along the pipe in the ale coordinate system the difference between eqs 1 and 14 is primarily the convective term the term v g ρ χ represents the mass flow through the moving boundary the physical representation of this convective term is the momentum relative to the grid velocity the ale coordinates capture the expansion and reduction in the pig length when the grid velocity equals zero eqs 14 and 15 become eqs 1 and 2 the ale coordinates were used to investigate the discretized forms and the explicit method was adopted to update the pig location based on the known location and the pig velocity from the previous time step the velocities of the end node in the upstream section and the first node in the downstream section are equal to the pig velocity the moving grid strategy was designed to obtain the length of the two sections and the flow parameters were solved using an implicit method based on fem this solution approach shares several features with the simple method partanker and spalding 1972 such as the concept of pressure correction the classical simple method adopts and solves the differential equations based on the discretized approach of the finite volume method the shape functions are used in the fem to describe the domains of the desired variables and simplify the analysis of the differential equations by fem discretization techniques using the same notations of partanker and spalding 1972 the primary parameters were designated as estimated and corrected ˊ values the pressure gradient term in eq 15 can be taken as the estimated value from the previous step m and the correction value in the current step 16 p χ p χ p χ p m χ p χ the other terms in eq 15 are then developed in the same way 17 ρ u t ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ ρ u v g χ p χ p χ s s first the estimated velocity field is generated from the components designated by which are the results of the m th time step from eq 17 18 ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ p χ s therefore the corrected velocity field can be solved by applying the correction terms from eq 17 19 ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ p χ s the pressure correction equation eq 19 is simplified as follows by ignoring the corrections of convection term and source term partanker and spalding 1972 20 ρ u t p χ this approach could result in an unstable correction force leading to divergence in the simulation therefore relaxation factors were introduced to ensure that the results would converge moreover the mass conservation equation in the ale coordinates is divided into the estimated part and the corrected part 21 ρ t ρ t ρ u χ ρ u χ v g ρ χ v g ρ χ 0 the mass conservation equation is applied as 22 ρ u χ d where d represents the divergence force which diminishes to become acceptably small when the numerical result is the convergence value combining eqs 20 and 22 23 2 p χ 2 2 ρ u t χ d t in the last step the numerical solution provides an acceptable degree of error which indicates that the divergence force d is very close to zero in typical interactions the divergence force d is not zero the corrected pressure field p can be calculated by eq 23 to update the pressure field using the estimated and correction values the updated pressure is treated as the estimated value in the next interactive step the other parameters such as the gas density and source term are then updated the estimated velocity field can be calculated based on eq 18 using these updated values when the numerical results converge the pig motion can be updated by applying the bypass pressure and gas flow parameters at the two sides of the pig 3 2 solution procedure in simulation the grid velocity and the boundaries of the upstream and downstream sections are required for calculation of the desired flow parameters at each time step the solution procedure for one time step can be summarized as follows step 1 give or assume the initial pressure field p and the initial velocity field u then obtain the source term s step 2 solve for the new velocity field u using eq 18 and the given pressure field p step 3 calculate the pressure correction pˊ by applying eq 23 to obtain the velocity correction uˊ in eq 20 step 4 update pressure p and velocity u using the correction values from step 3 step 5 if the numerical results reach convergence the calculation goes to the next step if not substitute pressure field velocity field and source term with the improved values and return to step 2 step 6 proceed to the next time step go to step 1 and adopt the improved values of pressure and velocity as the initial pressure field and initial velocity field the framework of the simulation process is illustrated in fig 3 the interactions of the conservation of mass and momentum in the solution procedure guarantee the stability and convergence of the algorithm 3 3 adaptive mesh the ale forms of the differential equations require the grid velocities at all grid nodes first the moving grid method is applied to the solution process in the pigging simulation the grid nodes are separated into static nodes and nodes having the velocity of the pig the moving nodes near the pig tail and head are represented using a small element length the fine mesh makes it possible to obtain the substantial variations of the pressure and flow fields near the pig the individual element length of the detailed mesh is recommended to be several millimeters twenty 1 mm elements were used in the simulation in this study the sparse static nodes were primarily utilized to monitor the flow and pressure fields in the pipe compared with the fine mesh applied near the pig the sparse element length was designated as 10 mm in the simulation in this study because the variations in the desired variables are much less substantial in this region unstable numerical variations may occur at the contact area between the fine mesh and sparse mesh this instability mainly results from the ratio of the nearby element lengths i e the ratio of the element length to the adjacent elements in this study the range of this ratio is suggested to be 0 5 2 thus the ratio at the contact surface of the fine mesh and sparse mesh was evidently beyond the suggested range hence the use of transitional regions was proposed by adopting six continuous elements of 1 5 mm 2 2 mm 3 3 mm 5 2 mm 7 8 mm and 10 mm in length in the simulation the nearby element length ratio was then approximately 1 5 in the transitional region the nodes in the transitional region also move at the pig velocity therefore the meshes from the pipe inlet to the outlet are in the following order the sparse transitional and fine meshes the pig element and then the fine transitional and sparse meshes the grid nodes of the transition mesh fine mesh and pig element move at the pig velocity in the pigging process the pig moves from the pig launcher to the pig receiver which are typically located near but not at pipe ends the grid moves as the pig runs in the pipe while the grid velocities in the sparse meshes are zero the speed differences between the transitional mesh and sparse mesh result in grid element deformations which are shown in fig 4 this deformation of the upstream elements tends to increase over time because the expanding element tends to be much longer than the nearby sparse element the upstream transition from state 2 to state 3 in fig 4 this excessive length may fail to reflect the changes in the variables based on one element with a fixed fem shape function moreover the excessive nearby element length ratio could increase the instability of the solution process therefore a grid generation treatment was proposed in this study wherein the increasing element is divided into an element with the same length as the nearby sparse element and an element that continues to increase if the nearby element length ratio is more than 1 618 the values of the desired variables at the generated grid the grid node with the red circle in fig 4 rely on the shape functions in the fem discretization the downstream deformation tends to decrease when this decreasing downstream element length results in a ratio less than 0 618 a treatment is adopted wherein the decreasing element and the nearby sparse element are merged into one decreasing element the variable values at the reduction grid node the grid node with the green circle in fig 4 will then not be used in the subsequent time step 4 discretization using fem analysis the combination of the fem and galerkin method provides a solution for the discretized equations based on the conservation of volume work and virtual work by applying the appropriate element shape functions the numerical results of the fem yield the values of the desired variables which provides the parameters to obtain a solution at any given point the fundamental procedure to solve the pigging model is analyzed below using the fem in the implicit discretization procedure parabolic three node isoparametric elements with the shape function φ are used to discretize the velocity field and linear two node elements with the shape function ψ are adopted to describe the pressure field comini and del giudice 1985 the conservation of gas momentum in eq 18 is considered first and its discretized form is 24 a u u 0 δ t b u n p q u the typical matrix elements in eq 24 are a i j x e ρ l φ l φ i φ j d x b i j x e ρ k u k l φ l φ i φ j x d x 25 n i j x e a l φ l φ i ψ j x d x a n d q u i x e s j φ j φ i d x the divergence force d equals zero at the last time step hence the discretized velocity

in addition the source matrix q should be updated in time to promise the accuracy of numerical results the calculation of the desired values reaches convergence when the correction amounts reach is within an acceptable margin of error the relaxation terms sor p and sor u enhance the stability of the algorithm by accounting for the appearance of unpredictable and excessive modification in the solution process sor p 1 0 and sor u 0 6 in our simulation in addition the source matrix q must be updated sufficiently quickly to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results the calculation of the desired values converges when the amount of correction is within the acceptable margin of error 5 results and discussion the laboratory experiment performed for the pipe analysis is shown in fig 5 and the physical map of pigging experiments are illustrated in fig 6 the pigging process was visualized using a plexiglass tube with an inner diameter of 64 0 mm and a total length of 15 026 m a polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe was used to connect the pig launcher and the vortex flowmeter and dry gas was applied as the working fluid in the experiments nine pressure sensors keller pr25y with satisfactory accuracy 0 25 fs and high response sensitivity 5 ms were placed unevenly between the beginning and end of the transparent pipe to record the transient pressure variations during the pigging experiments the bypass pig containing several parts is shown in fig 7 the cooperation of different parts makes the bypass pig stand upright when it travels along the pipe the replaceable bypass nozzle ensures the substitution of the bypass rate the bypass rate of 3 d h 11 09 mm with the length of 88 0 mm and the mass of 0 485 kg was adopted to verify the numerical solutions and pigging slippage in this paper the gas flow at the inlet was 0 0643 0 002 kg s and the outlet was at atmospheric pressure the experimental pressure variations caused by the pig at a 3 bypass rate are shown in fig 8 a and the numerical trends are shown in fig 8 b when the pig traversed the observation points the pressure at the monitoring point changed from the pig head pressure to the pig tail pressure in fig 8 a the quick pressure change caused a sudden rise in the pressure observed at the other eight sensors the amount of this increase indicated the pressure drop over the pig when the pig passed the monitoring point pressure fluctuations of nearly 60 kpa became stronger over time indicating that the friction distribution in the pipe was uneven in contrast the fluctuations in the numerical model tended to become smoother with time as shown in fig 8 b the experimental pigging time was 3 242 s which was slightly longer than the 2 892 s value obtained from the numerical procedure the minor differences between the numerical friction forces and the experimental values resulted in slight differences in the pigging performance the first abrupt pressure increase in the simulation is quite close to that in the experiment and the higher pressure appeared when the pigging time was between 0 s and 0 6 s which indicated the numerical friction force between the pig and the pipe was close to the experimental data in this region when the pigging time passed 0 6 s the numerical pressure values were generally smaller than the experimental values indicating that the numerical friction force was smaller than the actual friction force and resulting in the pig s earlier arrival at the observation points in the numerical result it was challenging to measure the transient gas velocity along the pipe during the experiments due to the rapid changes in the gas velocity and passage of the pig hence the numerical gas velocities were adopted to study the gas behavior during the pigging process the gas velocity trends at the nine pressure sensors are illustrated in fig 9 the pressure drop over the pig becomes approximately zero when the pig is being placed when the pig was suddenly placed in the pipe the pressure at the pig tail increased although the bypass hole permitted the gas to flow from upstream to the downstream the gas was blocked by the pig during the initial stage the gas trapped in the bypass pigging was not due to the gas fully flowing rather it was flowing extremely slowly near the pig specifically the gas velocity near the pig was approximately 4 m s at 0 1 s the trend of u 0 when the time was less than 0 1 s the trapped gas was primarily due to the density change resulting from the pressure difference across the pig the suddenly increasing pressure caused the gas density to increase and the gas velocity decreased to an extremely low value shown at 0 15 s in fig 9 when the pig began to move the upstream gas near the pig expanded quickly which caused the gas velocity to increase these suddenly increased gas velocities critically impact the pigging safety the pig started to move when the pressure force over the pig overcame the friction force the sudden decreases in velocity after 0 6 s resulted from the higher gas density and higher pressure at the pig tail the gas compressibility influenced the flow parameters in the plexiglass pipe and the upper pvc pipe both the upstream pressures and the gas velocity fields could be affected by the pig motion hence when evaluating the profile along the pipe the outlet of the upstream vortex flowmeter was taken as the zero point on the x axis the evolution of the pressure and gas velocity profiles along the pipe over time are shown in fig 10 the pressure profiles demonstrated a significant pressure drop over the pig as shown in fig 10 a and the pressure near the pig began to rise rapidly after it was launched the differential pressure gradually increased until the pig started to move the pink line in fig 10 a indicates the trapped gas flow and the resultant accumulation of pressure during the early stage of the pigging when the pressure drop overcame the friction force the pig gradually moved which is represented by the red line in fig 10 a in comparison the trapped upstream gas the pink line in fig 10 b corresponds to the pressure increase before the pig moving as the pressure and the gas density rose at the pig tail the trapped gas velocity decreased to an extremely low value due to the conservation of mass during this stage the downstream gas expanded and moved due to inertia the yellow line in fig 10 b which ended when the upstream pressure became steady in fig 10 b the green arrows indicate the expansion of the inlet gas and the purple arrows indicate the expansion of the gas through the bypass pig as the gas expanded through the entire pipe length the pig began to move as indicated by the red line in fig 10 b the different pressures and different gas densities ahead of and behind the pig resulted in the observed variations in the pig velocity the effects of the pipe inlet and pipe outlet on the pig can be grasped by the fine mesh near the pig ten element ahead the pig and ten behind the pig with the length of 1 mm the upstream gas was stucked by the sudden increased pressure ahead the pig pink lines in fig 10 and then pushed by the constant injecting gas at pipe inlet green line in fig 10 b this stuck expansion procedure appeared only when the pig starts to move the inertia of the downstream gas resulted that the downstream pressure was slightly lower than the constant outlet pressure the yellow line in fig 10 b and then the increased gas velocity in the bypass hole gradually pushed the downstream gas which resulted in the normal gradually decreasing downstream pressure fields these phenomena indicated that the inlet flow provided the propellant of the gas fluid which gradually pushed the pig and the constant outlet pressure provides the mass outlet and the pressure at the last node in simulation which gives no effect on the gas field and the pressure fields the pressure trends velocity trends and pressure profiles provided in figs 8 10 respectively illustrate the significant impact of the gas compressibility upon the pigging operation moreover the numerical results provided more accurate details regarding the pressure profiles and velocity distributions when the friction force between the pipe and the pig was a given value the numerical variations in the pig velocity the local gas velocity of the pig and the pressure drop over the pig over time are given in fig 11 the rapidly increasing pressure drop during the very early stages was a phased process as seen in fig 11 the gas compressibility caused the upstream gas near the pig to cyclically compress expand compress again and so on the reciprocating motion of the gas resulted in an uneven increase in the trend of the pressure differential when the time was less than 0 5 s the pig would not move at the early stage until the pressure force overcame the friction the local gas velocity at 0 s was 4 m s corresponding to the u 0 value in fig 9 further fig 11 shows that the pig did not move at a constant speed the balance between the pressure drop and the friction force was gradually established during the pigging process hence the fluctuations of the three parameters lessened over time during this stabilization process the amplitude of the three curves gradually decreased as the pig moved the final steady values of the pressure drop local gas velocity and pig velocity satisfied eq 11 and caused the right side of eq 5 to equal zero in both the laboratory experiments and the real engineering pigging the bypass pig was likely to move at an inconstant velocity and occasionally stop at an unpredicted location and it might restart after a period of stasis this stopping and starting activity in the pig velocity is termed bypass slippage and occurred during the early stage of pigging in fig 11 due to the constant friction force the steady state assumption failed to account for this phenomenon further this early pig stoppage is significantly different from the pig stopping in an unpredicted area in the actual pigging process the variation of the friction force between the pipe and the pig could be responsible for this slippage the transient pigging model is therefore vital to the modeling and solution methods for the simulation of the inconstant friction the changes in the friction force of the entire pipe were investigated through a friction force study the trends in the pressure drop over the pig and the pigging time at different friction forces of 154 416 n 173 718 n 193 020 n 212 322 n and 231 624 n are given in fig 12 and the velocity trends are shown in fig 13 fig 12 a shows that the pressure drop over the pig demonstrated the same increasing trend during the early stage of the pigging the concurrence of the five aforementioned trends indicates the continuously increasing pressure drop which was caused by the reciprocating gas motion and the pig stoppage can also be seen in fig 13 a moreover the same trends in the movement after 0 6 s also verified the accuracy of the numerical method when the friction force increased the stabilized pressure drop increased further to overcome the friction as shown in fig 12 b based on the steady state analysis of eq 11 the increasing pressure drop resulted in decreasing stabilized pig velocity as shown in fig 13 b the decreased pig velocity caused the pigging time to increase as represented by the red lines in figs 12 b and 13 b the stabilized pressure drop exhibited a significant linear correlation with the friction force resulting from the approximate equivalence of the pressure driving force and the friction force in contrast the trend of the stabilized pig velocity did not have a linear correlation with the friction force the pressure at the pig varied as the pig moved which resulted in minor variations in the gas density and the local gas velocity eq 11 provides that the linear decrease in the pressure resulted in a nonlinear effect on the pig velocity as the friction varied which was confirmed by the results shown in fig 13 b the nonlinear variation of the pig velocity caused the unstable decrease in the pigging time different constant frictions only affected the duration for which the pig was stopped during the early pigging stage which is different from the typical bypass pigging slippage two meter long pipes with abnormal friction forces of 154 416 n 173 718 n 193 020 n 212 322 n and 231 624 n were placed in the center of the plexiglass pipe in the simulation to investigate the actual pigging slippage the abnormal friction of 193 020 n indicated that the friction was constant in the simulation the resultant pig velocity and pressure drop are illustrated in fig 14 the abnormal friction forces did not affect the pig velocity and pressure drop until the pig moved into the abnormal section in fig 14 a the pressure drop exhibits an inflection at the pigging time of 1 470 s which was when the pig moved into the abnormal pipe when the pig moved in the abnormal section and afterward the pressure drop maintained a nearly constant value which failed to reveal the characteristics of the pig motion the velocity trends in fig 14 b also indicate a velocity change at 1 470 s the slippage occurred when the friction changed the pig velocity increased in the pipes with the friction values of 173 718 n and 154 416 n which were 10 and 20 less than the normal friction respectively moreover the pig rested when it moved from areas of lower to higher friction the area of this abnormal pig stoppage increased with lower abnormal friction 154 416 n in contrast when the abnormal friction was 10 and 20 higher than the normal friction i e 212 322 n and 231 624 n respectively the pig velocity tended to decrease in the abnormal section this decrease might have resulted in the pig stopping for the abnormal friction of 231 624 n as shown in fig 14 b when the pig moved into the section having normal friction it stopped as well the relatively minor variation in the friction force over a small length caused this bypass slippage the trends of the pressure drop and velocity when the abnormal length was modified to be 0 2 m are shown in fig 15 the trends of the pressure drop demonstrated an inflection at the pigging time of 1 583 s and when the pig moved out of the abnormal section another change occurred in the velocity trends as shown in fig 15 b moreover bypass slippage did not occur in the 0 2 m long abnormal pipe section a comparison of the velocity trends in fig 15 b and b indicates that the abnormal slippage might disappear for a smaller abnormal section the pigging time for the different lengths of the abnormal pipes and different friction forces is provided in fig 16 all the trends red trend blue trend and pink trend indicated that a higher average friction force led to increased pigging time and the longer friction section and the larger friction variation brought the more significant deviation in the pigging time to the friction the higher pressure drop over the pig was required to overcome the friction eq 5 which indicated the more intense relative motion between bypass gas and the pig based on eq 11 the more intense velocity deviation indicated that the higher friction resulted in a lower pig velocity hence a longer pigging time the comparisons of the pigging time of different lengths indicated the increase of the abnormal length brought a more obvious deviation to the pigging time it could be concluded that the compressibility primarily affected the transient pig motion to change from dynamic to static or vice versa and that the variation in the friction force resulted in the pigging stoppage the stoppage mainly occurred after the friction variations from the high friction region to the low or from the low to the high and the degree of stoppage was related to the characteristics of the abnormal section the stopping and restarting of the pig were influenced by the variations in the gas density that resulted from the pressure variation to overcome the friction the pigging time would be extended in the higher friction and the larger abnormal length 6 conclusions this study proposed a computational method that coupled the fem and moving rectangular grid method for estimating the dynamic pig motion and the flow field during a pigging operation the fundamental mathematical model comprised the gas state equation and the conservation equations of mass and momentum and the numerical method was developed based on the formulas rather than a discretized scheme the temperature is a given parameter in the model the moving grid employing a detailed mesh near the pig guaranteed the accuracy of the flow field and the pig velocity the agreement in pressure trends between the numerical results and experimental data verified the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method in this paper the simulation results were used to study the pig motion with constant frictions and inconstant frictions in the analysis of the gas velocity profiles and pressure profiles with constant friction the trapped expanded upstream gas motion indicated that the gas compressibility was the primary factor responsible for the pig early stage stoppage this stoppage was corresponding to the initial static state of the pig in the trends of the pig velocity local gas velocity and pressure drop over the pig the uneven pig motion with gradually smoothed fluctuations was also related to the gas compressibility the friction mainly determined the appearance and the scales of the pigging stoppage variations in the overall friction force did not result in stop restart pig motion after the initial stoppage the higher friction resulted in a lower pig velocity with gradually smoothed fluctuations and the longer initial stoppage time and pigging time and the pig will not stop once the pig starts to move in the constant friction profiles however abnormal friction in a particular section of the pipe resulted in the stoppage of the pig the pig was likely to stop after the point of the variations in the friction force when the friction deviation reached the certain degree the pig was stucked after sudden deceleration in the higher abnormal friction the acceleration deceleration motion of the pig appeared before the stuck when the pig travelled into the small abnormal friction moreover the stoppages were also corresponding to the scale of the abnormal section that whether it can meet the demands of the pig travelled before stoppage credit authorship contribution statement xiaowei li conceptualization methodology formal analysis software data curation visualization

20775,in traditional pigging operations sealed disks having a specific amount of interference guarantee that the pig runs at the velocity of the gas behind it a bypass flow path in the pig lowers its speed while causes the uneven pig motion which is referred to as slippage the slippage raises the risk of the pig becoming stuck and negatively impacts the pipe and related facilities this paper proposes a numerical method to solve a pigging model consisting of arbitrary lagrange euler forms of the fluid flow equations and the bypass pig kinetic equation based on the moving grid method which considers the contact surfaces between the pig and the fluid as discretized grid nodes a detailed moving mesh was adopted to study the flow field around the pig the consistency between the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy and applicability of the numerical method gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the transitional motions of the pig especially its gradual restarting and the gradually smoothed velocity furthermore the variation in the friction force is the primary factor that determines the appearance of the pigging stoppage and the scale of the pig resting and the next uneven pig velocity keywords pigging simulation gas pipeline slippage moving grid 1 introduction for decades pipelines have been the most economical and efficient way to transport gas and oil to terminals pigging rids the pipeline of liquid reduces its inner corrosion and keeps it working safely and efficiently lim et al 2015 different pigs are used in different pipe working conditions and can be rubber spheres or cylinders containing several parts the diameter of the pig is usually slightly larger than the inner pipe diameter this ensures sufficient interference fit between the pipe and pig the sealing surface guarantees limited liquid leakage when the gas or the liquid propellant drives the pig the excellent sealing effect causes the pig to run at the speed of the driven fluid assuming no matter exchange between the fluid at the pig head and the pig tail the gas fluid velocity in the pipeline is usually designed to be 10 20 m s which could force a traditional pig to run at a high speed the effectiveness of the cleaning and the safety of the pigging operation can be guaranteed when the pig runs at a nearly constant speed that is not excessively high hence the use of a bypass hole which is usually at the center of a cylindrical pig has been adopted to promote the transfer of gas from the pig tail to the pig head thus lowering the pig velocity waltrich et al 2015 norris and rydahl 2003 however the various mechanisms of pig movement with and without bypass are still not completely understood in either theory or practice few studies have investigated pig motion and bypass slippage using theory or transient models most available studies have been based on field experiments and the assumption of the steady state motion of the bypass pig which neglects the transient pigging movement mcdonald and baker 1964 were the first to study pigging in a gas liquid pipeline in the steady state theory their work focused on conventional average treatments in a physical pigging model and a numerical procedure the physical pigging model separated the pipeline into four sections multiphase flow regeneration net gas liquid slug and undisturbed multiphase the steady state assumptions and empirical equations for pressure drop and liquid holdup were adopted for each step of the calculation the calculation errors primarily resulted from the steady state assumption and empirical formulas barua 1982 attempted to improve the accuracy of the empirical equations based on a large amount of experimental data nieckele et al 2001 simplified the solution procedure by assuming a constant and incompressible gas flow they improved the pigging model by including the contact force of the pig disks and the consideration of bypass flow saeidbakhsh et al 2009 investigated the motion of a small pig through different curves the trajectory of the pig was considered by applying differential kinetic equations while ignoring the effects of the flow and the constant friction force however a steady state pigging model might not provide the specific flow parameters at the points of interest in the pipe which hampers the monitoring of the pigging process kohda et al 1987 found the inconvenience in the upstream sections of pigging using the mcdonald baker model in the transient simulation hence they added two nodes to monitor the pig position and the liquid slug head which separated the pipe into three sections in a study by scoggins 1977 the rules of drift flow based on the method of characteristic moc were coupled with the pig motion which resulted in more reasonable numerical liquid holdup profiles and pressure distributions along the pipe nguyen et al 2001a 2001b proposed a transient pigging model consisting of the conservation equations of gas mass momentum and energy the gas state equation and the kinetic equation of the bypass pig in a natural gas pipeline their solution method coupled a moving pig node and moc to estimate the flow parameters and the pig velocity based on a fixed rectangular grid furthermore they demonstrated the model in an investigation of the kinetic motion of the pig as it travelled through a 90 curved pipe with the assumption of a compressible gas 2001c esmaeilzadeh et al 2006 2009 investigated a pigging model without bypass in gas and liquid pipe their concept coupled the conservation equations and the moc proposed by nguyen and was evaluated through modeling and simulation esmaeilzadeh extended the use of the nguyen model in the liquid pipeline and the findings of botros 2010 verified the accuracy and applicability of the nguyen model and esmaeilzadeh model figueiredo et al 2017 verified the accuracy and application of flux corrected transport method fct in two fluid model patricio et al 2020 simplified the two phase fct calculation to study pigging in one phase pipeline with the ghost cells connecting the pig motion and the fluid flow to the implicit numerical solution minami et al 1991 1996 proposed a pigging model using the simplified two fluid model flow regime model and pigging slug model the quasi steady state assumption for the gas phase i e that the gas phase is treated as a steady state flow for the quick changes in the high speed gas was adopted to simplify the solution the semi implicit method provided numerical results that approximated the experimental results in his work the study of pigging models then transitioned from the steady state models to transient study using the design solving method xu and gong 2005 coupled the phase transition model and the hydrodynamic model mass momentum and energy equations in an adiabatic pipe the parameters of liquid flow were primarily controlled by the phase equilibrium between the gas and condensate few studies have theoretically analyzed the non uniformity of the pig bypass velocity though some have implied that the unpredictable friction force and gas compressibility might result in slippage simone and felipe 2012 furthermore in experimental studies slippage tends to appear during the early stages of pigging and is likely to decrease along the pipe length the present study developed a pigging model by combining the gas flow and pig kinetic models which was solved by applying the finite element method fem based on a moving grid under appropriate initial and boundary conditions further laboratory experiments were performed to demonstrate the validity of the solution method and the numerical results comparisons between the numerical friction forces were performed to investigate the impact of the friction 2 mathematical modeling for the modeling the pipe was divided into two sections the upstream section which was from the inlet to the tail of the bypass pig and the downstream section which was from the pig head to the pipe outlet ambient air was used as the compressible fluid in the experiments the gas temperature was given or measured over time to simplify the solution process the flow parameters were governed by the conservation of mass and momentum equations and the state equation of the experimental gas the pigging model comprised the fluid equations and the pig kinetic motion equation evaluated using newton s second law 2 1 gas flow model for the gas flow the fluid was considered to be one phase and one dimensional with a given temperature along the pipe the mass conservation equation with assumptions of no leakage and no phase transition can be written as 1 ρ t ρ u x 0 where ρ u x and t are the gas density gas velocity distance along the pipe and time respectively the momentum conservation equation can be written as 2 ρ u t ρ u 2 x p x s where p is the absolute pressure along the pipe and s refers to the source term in the momentum conservation equation which primarily consists of the fluid friction force and the body force for simplification purposes s f f a ρ g sin θ where f f is the friction force per unit length a is the area of the pipe cross section g is the acceleration of gravity which was measured to be 9 81 m s2 θ is inclination with respect to the horizontal at the given point the friction force between the gas flow and the inner pipe wall can be calculated using the friction factor by applying the swamee jain equation jain 1976 3 1 f 1 14 2 log 10 21 25 re 0 9 ε d where f re ε and d are the friction factor reynolds number pipe inner wall roughness and inner pipe diameter respectively the swamee jain equation is used for turbulent flow re 2000 if the reynolds number is less than 2000 the friction factor is taken as 64 re the reynolds number of the fluid is re ρud μ where μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity the gas state equation is 4 p ρ r t γ 1 c v t where r t γ and c v are the gas constant the temperature of the gas flow the ratio of the specific heat and the specific heat at constant volume respectively the density of the gas can be calculated given the physical properties of the gas and the temperature 2 2 pig dynamic model in a one dimensional model the combined effects of the pig motion and the gas flow determine the pressures at the head and tail of the pig and the gas flow through the bypass hole the pig runs in a force balance state as shown in fig 1 the dynamic equation of the pig can be written based on newton s second law as follows 5 m p i g d v p i g d t p t a i l p h e a d a a h m p i g g sin θ f f f τ where m pig v pig p tail and p head are the pig mass pig velocity and pressure at the pig tail and head respectively the terms f f and f τ are the friction force and the gas shear force in the bypass hole respectively a h is the area of the bypass hole where the gas flows from the upstream to the downstream the bypass rate φ is defined as φ a h a the term f f can be calculated using the friction factor and the contact force between the pig and the pipe and the contact force can be obtained from the shrink fit correlation given by shigley 2005 the term f τ is usually far smaller than f f due to the small hole size f τ reaches its maximum value 0 244 n in the simulations when bypass rate is 1 the superficial gas velocity is 20 m s and the pig velocity is zero hence in the present study by using a winch the friction force was determined to be 193 02 n which led to less error in the friction force and provided more accurate numerical results the term f τ indicates the shear force resulting from the velocity difference between the bypass gas and the pig this term can be written as the product of the shear force stress and the bypass hole area 6 f τ τ h π d h l p i g the shear stress factor can be written as 7 τ h 1 2 f h ρ g b y u g b y v p i g u g b y v p i g where f h ρ gby and u gby are the wall friction factor of the bypass hole the bypass gas density and the absolute velocity of the bypass gas respectively for simplification the assumption of steady state flow is adopted for the bypass hole hence the gas mass at the inlet the bypass path and the outlet of bypass hole are identical i e 8 ρ g i n u g i n ρ g b y u g b y ρ g o u t u g o u t the bypass average pressure p by is determined as the bypass average pressure when assuming the pig nose and pig tail were suddenly sealed and the bypass gas reached steady state 9 p b y 2 3 p i n p o u t 2 p i n p o u t and then ρ gby is obtained by eq 4 in calculating the shear force of the bypass hole the wall hole friction factor f h can be obtained using the strategy proposed by bendiksen et al 1991 which couples the friction factors for laminar and turbulent flows proposed by moody 1947 10 f h max 16 re h 0 001375 1 2 10 4 ε h d h 10 4 re h 3 for ε d h 0 05 and re h 10 8 where re h ε h and d h are the reynolds number of the bypass flow the bypass hole roughness and the diameter of the hole respectively the reynolds number of the bypass flow is re h ρ gb u gby d h μ in a one dimensional model the pressure drop through the bypass pig is also the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the bypass hole hence given the steady state bypass flow assumption the pressure drop over the pig can be written as groote et al 2015 hosseinalipour et al 2007 singh and henkes 2012 11 p t a i l p h e a d 1 2 κ p i g ρ g b y u g b y v p i g u g b y v p i g where κ pig is the pressure loss coefficient which mainly consists of three parts the sudden constriction loss coefficient κ c the straight bypass coefficient κ f and the sudden expansion loss coefficient κ e idelchik et al 1986 provided empirical equations for calculating these parameters which were analyzed using cfd models in fluent in azpiroz s work 2015 12 κ c 1 2 1 a h a 0 75 κ f 4 f κ l d κ e 1 2 1 a h a 2 where f κ is the fanning factor which is related to the reynolds number of the gas and can be obtained by applying the churchill equation churchill 1977 for the turbulent flow pressure loss coefficient calculation 13 1 f κ 2 log 10 ε h 3 71 d h 7 re h 0 9 2 3 initial and boundary conditions treatment initial and boundary conditions need to be provided for the partial difference equations model in a real gas pipeline the velocity volume flow rate or the mass flow rate is given at the inlet point and the pressure condition is usually located at the outlet of the pipe laboratory experiments have assumed a constant mass flow rate of gas at the pipe inlet and atmospheric pressure at the pipe outlet hence the constant inlet mass flow rate of gas and the constant outlet pressure were adopted herein to verify the accuracy of the numerical results as compared with the experiments the flow reaches a steady state before the beginning of the pigging operations therefore the steady state motion of the gas was taken as the initial condition 3 numerical method the pigging procedure is a transient process and the resulting transient pig motion cannot be evaluated by applying the steady state pigging model of mcdonald and baker most researchers have adopted transient pigging models based on implicit or explicit numerical methods coupled with a fixed grid the explicit discretized method requires the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition to guarantee the stability of the calculation procedure which requires small time intervals and can thus increase the computational burden due to the complexity of the implicit methods a few of the studies have employed an implicit scheme to develop a pigging model the present study proposed a numerical method similar to the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple patankar and spalding 1972 and is described as follows most researchers use a fixed grid for pigging simulations in practice pipelines are usually several or tens of kilometers long therefore even if a pipe is divided into thousands of elements the average element length will be several meters this is significantly longer than the pig which is usually 1 2 1 5 times the pipe diameter the pressures and flow parameters at the pig head and tail are typically obtained through linear interpolation of the parameters at the two boundary nodes of the elements nguyen et al 2001a 2001b 2001c 2001b this approach can not consider the rapid variations in the flow field and pressure field near the pig moreover interpolation introduces numerical errors and fails to satisfy the relation of the pig velocity bypass flow and pressure drop over the pig in eq 11 special consideration is therefore required to represent the pipe and pig system accurately the moving grid method guarantees that the boundaries of the pig will be located at the discretized nodes at every time interval this co location of the pig and the grid node causes the pig to occupy one element thereby removing error that would be introduced by linear interpolation the equivalence of the pig velocity and the boundary node velocity guarantees the pressure drop relation eq 11 a comparison of the fixed and moving grid methods is provided in fig 2 3 1 mathematical approach when adapting this model for the moving grid method the partial spatial differential in eqs 1 and 2 is transformed from eulerian coordinates to arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale coordinates using the grid velocity 14 ρ t ρ u χ v g ρ χ 0 and 15 ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ p χ s where v g is the grid velocity and χ is the distance along the pipe in the ale coordinate system the difference between eqs 1 and 14 is primarily the convective term the term v g ρ χ represents the mass flow through the moving boundary the physical representation of this convective term is the momentum relative to the grid velocity the ale coordinates capture the expansion and reduction in the pig length when the grid velocity equals zero eqs 14 and 15 become eqs 1 and 2 the ale coordinates were used to investigate the discretized forms and the explicit method was adopted to update the pig location based on the known location and the pig velocity from the previous time step the velocities of the end node in the upstream section and the first node in the downstream section are equal to the pig velocity the moving grid strategy was designed to obtain the length of the two sections and the flow parameters were solved using an implicit method based on fem this solution approach shares several features with the simple method partanker and spalding 1972 such as the concept of pressure correction the classical simple method adopts and solves the differential equations based on the discretized approach of the finite volume method the shape functions are used in the fem to describe the domains of the desired variables and simplify the analysis of the differential equations by fem discretization techniques using the same notations of partanker and spalding 1972 the primary parameters were designated as estimated and corrected ˊ values the pressure gradient term in eq 15 can be taken as the estimated value from the previous step m and the correction value in the current step 16 p χ p χ p χ p m χ p χ the other terms in eq 15 are then developed in the same way 17 ρ u t ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ ρ u v g χ p χ p χ s s first the estimated velocity field is generated from the components designated by which are the results of the m th time step from eq 17 18 ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ p χ s therefore the corrected velocity field can be solved by applying the correction terms from eq 17 19 ρ u t ρ u v g u χ ρ u v g χ p χ s the pressure correction equation eq 19 is simplified as follows by ignoring the corrections of convection term and source term partanker and spalding 1972 20 ρ u t p χ this approach could result in an unstable correction force leading to divergence in the simulation therefore relaxation factors were introduced to ensure that the results would converge moreover the mass conservation equation in the ale coordinates is divided into the estimated part and the corrected part 21 ρ t ρ t ρ u χ ρ u χ v g ρ χ v g ρ χ 0 the mass conservation equation is applied as 22 ρ u χ d where d represents the divergence force which diminishes to become acceptably small when the numerical result is the convergence value combining eqs 20 and 22 23 2 p χ 2 2 ρ u t χ d t in the last step the numerical solution provides an acceptable degree of error which indicates that the divergence force d is very close to zero in typical interactions the divergence force d is not zero the corrected pressure field p can be calculated by eq 23 to update the pressure field using the estimated and correction values the updated pressure is treated as the estimated value in the next interactive step the other parameters such as the gas density and source term are then updated the estimated velocity field can be calculated based on eq 18 using these updated values when the numerical results converge the pig motion can be updated by applying the bypass pressure and gas flow parameters at the two sides of the pig 3 2 solution procedure in simulation the grid velocity and the boundaries of the upstream and downstream sections are required for calculation of the desired flow parameters at each time step the solution procedure for one time step can be summarized as follows step 1 give or assume the initial pressure field p and the initial velocity field u then obtain the source term s step 2 solve for the new velocity field u using eq 18 and the given pressure field p step 3 calculate the pressure correction pˊ by applying eq 23 to obtain the velocity correction uˊ in eq 20 step 4 update pressure p and velocity u using the correction values from step 3 step 5 if the numerical results reach convergence the calculation goes to the next step if not substitute pressure field velocity field and source term with the improved values and return to step 2 step 6 proceed to the next time step go to step 1 and adopt the improved values of pressure and velocity as the initial pressure field and initial velocity field the framework of the simulation process is illustrated in fig 3 the interactions of the conservation of mass and momentum in the solution procedure guarantee the stability and convergence of the algorithm 3 3 adaptive mesh the ale forms of the differential equations require the grid velocities at all grid nodes first the moving grid method is applied to the solution process in the pigging simulation the grid nodes are separated into static nodes and nodes having the velocity of the pig the moving nodes near the pig tail and head are represented using a small element length the fine mesh makes it possible to obtain the substantial variations of the pressure and flow fields near the pig the individual element length of the detailed mesh is recommended to be several millimeters twenty 1 mm elements were used in the simulation in this study the sparse static nodes were primarily utilized to monitor the flow and pressure fields in the pipe compared with the fine mesh applied near the pig the sparse element length was designated as 10 mm in the simulation in this study because the variations in the desired variables are much less substantial in this region unstable numerical variations may occur at the contact area between the fine mesh and sparse mesh this instability mainly results from the ratio of the nearby element lengths i e the ratio of the element length to the adjacent elements in this study the range of this ratio is suggested to be 0 5 2 thus the ratio at the contact surface of the fine mesh and sparse mesh was evidently beyond the suggested range hence the use of transitional regions was proposed by adopting six continuous elements of 1 5 mm 2 2 mm 3 3 mm 5 2 mm 7 8 mm and 10 mm in length in the simulation the nearby element length ratio was then approximately 1 5 in the transitional region the nodes in the transitional region also move at the pig velocity therefore the meshes from the pipe inlet to the outlet are in the following order the sparse transitional and fine meshes the pig element and then the fine transitional and sparse meshes the grid nodes of the transition mesh fine mesh and pig element move at the pig velocity in the pigging process the pig moves from the pig launcher to the pig receiver which are typically located near but not at pipe ends the grid moves as the pig runs in the pipe while the grid velocities in the sparse meshes are zero the speed differences between the transitional mesh and sparse mesh result in grid element deformations which are shown in fig 4 this deformation of the upstream elements tends to increase over time because the expanding element tends to be much longer than the nearby sparse element the upstream transition from state 2 to state 3 in fig 4 this excessive length may fail to reflect the changes in the variables based on one element with a fixed fem shape function moreover the excessive nearby element length ratio could increase the instability of the solution process therefore a grid generation treatment was proposed in this study wherein the increasing element is divided into an element with the same length as the nearby sparse element and an element that continues to increase if the nearby element length ratio is more than 1 618 the values of the desired variables at the generated grid the grid node with the red circle in fig 4 rely on the shape functions in the fem discretization the downstream deformation tends to decrease when this decreasing downstream element length results in a ratio less than 0 618 a treatment is adopted wherein the decreasing element and the nearby sparse element are merged into one decreasing element the variable values at the reduction grid node the grid node with the green circle in fig 4 will then not be used in the subsequent time step 4 discretization using fem analysis the combination of the fem and galerkin method provides a solution for the discretized equations based on the conservation of volume work and virtual work by applying the appropriate element shape functions the numerical results of the fem yield the values of the desired variables which provides the parameters to obtain a solution at any given point the fundamental procedure to solve the pigging model is analyzed below using the fem in the implicit discretization procedure parabolic three node isoparametric elements with the shape function φ are used to discretize the velocity field and linear two node elements with the shape function ψ are adopted to describe the pressure field comini and del giudice 1985 the conservation of gas momentum in eq 18 is considered first and its discretized form is 24 a u u 0 δ t b u n p q u the typical matrix elements in eq 24 are a i j x e ρ l φ l φ i φ j

in addition the source matrix q should be updated in time to promise the accuracy of numerical results the calculation of the desired values reaches convergence when the correction amounts reach is within an acceptable margin of error the relaxation terms sor p and sor u enhance the stability of the algorithm by accounting for the appearance of unpredictable and excessive modification in the solution process sor p 1 0 and sor u 0 6 in our simulation in addition the source matrix q must be updated sufficiently quickly to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results the calculation of the desired values converges when the amount of correction is within the acceptable margin of error 5 results and discussion the laboratory experiment performed for the pipe analysis is shown in fig 5 and the physical map of pigging experiments are illustrated in fig 6 the pigging process was visualized using a plexiglass tube with an inner diameter of 64 0 mm and a total length of 15 026 m a polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe was used to connect the pig launcher and the vortex flowmeter and dry gas was applied as the working fluid in the experiments nine pressure sensors keller pr25y with satisfactory accuracy 0 25 fs and high response sensitivity 5 ms were placed unevenly between the beginning and end of the transparent pipe to record the transient pressure variations during the pigging experiments the bypass pig containing several parts is shown in fig 7 the cooperation of different parts makes the bypass pig stand upright when it travels along the pipe the replaceable bypass nozzle ensures the substitution of the bypass rate the bypass rate of 3 d h 11 09 mm with the length of 88 0 mm and the mass of 0 485 kg was adopted to verify the numerical solutions and pigging slippage in this paper the gas flow at the inlet was 0 0643 0 002 kg s and the outlet was at atmospheric pressure the experimental pressure variations caused by the pig at a 3 bypass rate are shown in fig 8 a and the numerical trends are shown in fig 8 b when the pig traversed the observation points the pressure at the monitoring point changed from the pig head pressure to the pig tail pressure in fig 8 a the quick pressure change caused a sudden rise in the pressure observed at the other eight sensors the amount of this increase indicated the pressure drop over the pig when the pig passed the monitoring point pressure fluctuations of nearly 60 kpa became stronger over time indicating that the friction distribution in the pipe was uneven in contrast the fluctuations in the numerical model tended to become smoother with time as shown in fig 8 b the experimental pigging time was 3 242 s which was slightly longer than the 2 892 s value obtained from the numerical procedure the minor differences between the numerical friction forces and the experimental values resulted in slight differences in the pigging performance the first abrupt pressure increase in the simulation is quite close to that in the experiment and the higher pressure appeared when the pigging time was between 0 s and 0 6 s which indicated the numerical friction force between the pig and the pipe was close to the experimental data in this region when the pigging time passed 0 6 s the numerical pressure values were generally smaller than the experimental values indicating that the numerical friction force was smaller than the actual friction force and resulting in the pig s earlier arrival at the observation points in the numerical result it was challenging to measure the transient gas velocity along the pipe during the experiments due to the rapid changes in the gas velocity and passage of the pig hence the numerical gas velocities were adopted to study the gas behavior during the pigging process the gas velocity trends at the nine pressure sensors are illustrated in fig 9 the pressure drop over the pig becomes approximately zero when the pig is being placed when the pig was suddenly placed in the pipe the pressure at the pig tail increased although the bypass hole permitted the gas to flow from upstream to the downstream the gas was blocked by the pig during the initial stage the gas trapped in the bypass pigging was not due to the gas fully flowing rather it was flowing extremely slowly near the pig specifically the gas velocity near the pig was approximately 4 m s at 0 1 s the trend of u 0 when the time was less than 0 1 s the trapped gas was primarily due to the density change resulting from the pressure difference across the pig the suddenly increasing pressure caused the gas density to increase and the gas velocity decreased to an extremely low value shown at 0 15 s in fig 9 when the pig began to move the upstream gas near the pig expanded quickly which caused the gas velocity to increase these suddenly increased gas velocities critically impact the pigging safety the pig started to move when the pressure force over the pig overcame the friction force the sudden decreases in velocity after 0 6 s resulted from the higher gas density and higher pressure at the pig tail the gas compressibility influenced the flow parameters in the plexiglass pipe and the upper pvc pipe both the upstream pressures and the gas velocity fields could be affected by the pig motion hence when evaluating the profile along the pipe the outlet of the upstream vortex flowmeter was taken as the zero point on the x axis the evolution of the pressure and gas velocity profiles along the pipe over time are shown in fig 10 the pressure profiles demonstrated a significant pressure drop over the pig as shown in fig 10 a and the pressure near the pig began to rise rapidly after it was launched the differential pressure gradually increased until the pig started to move the pink line in fig 10 a indicates the trapped gas flow and the resultant accumulation of pressure during the early stage of the pigging when the pressure drop overcame the friction force the pig gradually moved which is represented by the red line in fig 10 a in comparison the trapped upstream gas the pink line in fig 10 b corresponds to the pressure increase before the pig moving as the pressure and the gas density rose at the pig tail the trapped gas velocity decreased to an extremely low value due to the conservation of mass during this stage the downstream gas expanded and moved due to inertia the yellow line in fig 10 b which ended when the upstream pressure became steady in fig 10 b the green arrows indicate the expansion of the inlet gas and the purple arrows indicate the expansion of the gas through the bypass pig as the gas expanded through the entire pipe length the pig began to move as indicated by the red line in fig 10 b the different pressures and different gas densities ahead of and behind the pig resulted in the observed variations in the pig velocity the effects of the pipe inlet and pipe outlet on the pig can be grasped by the fine mesh near the pig ten element ahead the pig and ten behind the pig with the length of 1 mm the upstream gas was stucked by the sudden increased pressure ahead the pig pink lines in fig 10 and then pushed by the constant injecting gas at pipe inlet green line in fig 10 b this stuck expansion procedure appeared only when the pig starts to move the inertia of the downstream gas resulted that the downstream pressure was slightly lower than the constant outlet pressure the yellow line in fig 10 b and then the increased gas velocity in the bypass hole gradually pushed the downstream gas which resulted in the normal gradually decreasing downstream pressure fields these phenomena indicated that the inlet flow provided the propellant of the gas fluid which gradually pushed the pig and the constant outlet pressure provides the mass outlet and the pressure at the last node in simulation which gives no effect on the gas field and the pressure fields the pressure trends velocity trends and pressure profiles provided in figs 8 10 respectively illustrate the significant impact of the gas compressibility upon the pigging operation moreover the numerical results provided more accurate details regarding the pressure profiles and velocity distributions when the friction force between the pipe and the pig was a given value the numerical variations in the pig velocity the local gas velocity of the pig and the pressure drop over the pig over time are given in fig 11 the rapidly increasing pressure drop during the very early stages was a phased process as seen in fig 11 the gas compressibility caused the upstream gas near the pig to cyclically compress expand compress again and so on the reciprocating motion of the gas resulted in an uneven increase in the trend of the pressure differential when the time was less than 0 5 s the pig would not move at the early stage until the pressure force overcame the friction the local gas velocity at 0 s was 4 m s corresponding to the u 0 value in fig 9 further fig 11 shows that the pig did not move at a constant speed the balance between the pressure drop and the friction force was gradually established during the pigging process hence the fluctuations of the three parameters lessened over time during this stabilization process the amplitude of the three curves gradually decreased as the pig moved the final steady values of the pressure drop local gas velocity and pig velocity satisfied eq 11 and caused the right side of eq 5 to equal zero in both the laboratory experiments and the real engineering pigging the bypass pig was likely to move at an inconstant velocity and occasionally stop at an unpredicted location and it might restart after a period of stasis this stopping and starting activity in the pig velocity is termed bypass slippage and occurred during the early stage of pigging in fig 11 due to the constant friction force the steady state assumption failed to account for this phenomenon further this early pig stoppage is significantly different from the pig stopping in an unpredicted area in the actual pigging process the variation of the friction force between the pipe and the pig could be responsible for this slippage the transient pigging model is therefore vital to the modeling and solution methods for the simulation of the inconstant friction the changes in the friction force of the entire pipe were investigated through a friction force study the trends in the pressure drop over the pig and the pigging time at different friction forces of 154 416 n 173 718 n 193 020 n 212 322 n and 231 624 n are given in fig 12 and the velocity trends are shown in fig 13 fig 12 a shows that the pressure drop over the pig demonstrated the same increasing trend during the early stage of the pigging the concurrence of the five aforementioned trends indicates the continuously increasing pressure drop which was caused by the reciprocating gas motion and the pig stoppage can also be seen in fig 13 a moreover the same trends in the movement after 0 6 s also verified the accuracy of the numerical method when the friction force increased the stabilized pressure drop increased further to overcome the friction as shown in fig 12 b based on the steady state analysis of eq 11 the increasing pressure drop resulted in decreasing stabilized pig velocity as shown in fig 13 b the decreased pig velocity caused the pigging time to increase as represented by the red lines in figs 12 b and 13 b the stabilized pressure drop exhibited a significant linear correlation with the friction force resulting from the approximate equivalence of the pressure driving force and the friction force in contrast the trend of the stabilized pig velocity did not have a linear correlation with the friction force the pressure at the pig varied as the pig moved which resulted in minor variations in the gas density and the local gas velocity eq 11 provides that the linear decrease in the pressure resulted in a nonlinear effect on the pig velocity as the friction varied which was confirmed by the results shown in fig 13 b the nonlinear variation of the pig velocity caused the unstable decrease in the pigging time different constant frictions only affected the duration for which the pig was stopped during the early pigging stage which is different from the typical bypass pigging slippage two meter long pipes with abnormal friction forces of 154 416 n 173 718 n 193 020 n 212 322 n and 231 624 n were placed in the center of the plexiglass pipe in the simulation to investigate the actual pigging slippage the abnormal friction of 193 020 n indicated that the friction was constant in the simulation the resultant pig velocity and pressure drop are illustrated in fig 14 the abnormal friction forces did not affect the pig velocity and pressure drop until the pig moved into the abnormal section in fig 14 a the pressure drop exhibits an inflection at the pigging time of 1 470 s which was when the pig moved into the abnormal pipe when the pig moved in the abnormal section and afterward the pressure drop maintained a nearly constant value which failed to reveal the characteristics of the pig motion the velocity trends in fig 14 b also indicate a velocity change at 1 470 s the slippage occurred when the friction changed the pig velocity increased in the pipes with the friction values of 173 718 n and 154 416 n which were 10 and 20 less than the normal friction respectively moreover the pig rested when it moved from areas of lower to higher friction the area of this abnormal pig stoppage increased with lower abnormal friction 154 416 n in contrast when the abnormal friction was 10 and 20 higher than the normal friction i e 212 322 n and 231 624 n respectively the pig velocity tended to decrease in the abnormal section this decrease might have resulted in the pig stopping for the abnormal friction of 231 624 n as shown in fig 14 b when the pig moved into the section having normal friction it stopped as well the relatively minor variation in the friction force over a small length caused this bypass slippage the trends of the pressure drop and velocity when the abnormal length was modified to be 0 2 m are shown in fig 15 the trends of the pressure drop demonstrated an inflection at the pigging time of 1 583 s and when the pig moved out of the abnormal section another change occurred in the velocity trends as shown in fig 15 b moreover bypass slippage did not occur in the 0 2 m long abnormal pipe section a comparison of the velocity trends in fig 15 b and b indicates that the abnormal slippage might disappear for a smaller abnormal section the pigging time for the different lengths of the abnormal pipes and different friction forces is provided in fig 16 all the trends red trend blue trend and pink trend indicated that a higher average friction force led to increased pigging time and the longer friction section and the larger friction variation brought the more significant deviation in the pigging time to the friction the higher pressure drop over the pig was required to overcome the friction eq 5 which indicated the more intense relative motion between bypass gas and the pig based on eq 11 the more intense velocity deviation indicated that the higher friction resulted in a lower pig velocity hence a longer pigging time the comparisons of the pigging time of different lengths indicated the increase of the abnormal length brought a more obvious deviation to the pigging time it could be concluded that the compressibility primarily affected the transient pig motion to change from dynamic to static or vice versa and that the variation in the friction force resulted in the pigging stoppage the stoppage mainly occurred after the friction variations from the high friction region to the low or from the low to the high and the degree of stoppage was related to the characteristics of the abnormal section the stopping and restarting of the pig were influenced by the variations in the gas density that resulted from the pressure variation to overcome the friction the pigging time would be extended in the higher friction and the larger abnormal length 6 conclusions this study proposed a computational method that coupled the fem and moving rectangular grid method for estimating the dynamic pig motion and the flow field during a pigging operation the fundamental mathematical model comprised the gas state equation and the conservation equations of mass and momentum and the numerical method was developed based on the formulas rather than a discretized scheme the temperature is a given parameter in the model the moving grid employing a detailed mesh near the pig guaranteed the accuracy of the flow field and the pig velocity the agreement in pressure trends between the numerical results and experimental data verified the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method in this paper the simulation results were used to study the pig motion with constant frictions and inconstant frictions in the analysis of the gas velocity profiles and pressure profiles with constant friction the trapped expanded upstream gas motion indicated that the gas compressibility was the primary factor responsible for the pig early stage stoppage this stoppage was corresponding to the initial static state of the pig in the trends of the pig velocity local gas velocity and pressure drop over the pig the uneven pig motion with gradually smoothed fluctuations was also related to the gas compressibility the friction mainly determined the appearance and the scales of the pigging stoppage variations in the overall friction force did not result in stop restart pig motion after the initial stoppage the higher friction resulted in a lower pig velocity with gradually smoothed fluctuations and the longer initial stoppage time and pigging time and the pig will not stop once the pig starts to move in the constant friction profiles however abnormal friction in a particular section of the pipe resulted in the stoppage of the pig the pig was likely to stop after the point of the variations in the friction force when the friction deviation reached the certain degree the pig was stucked after sudden deceleration in the higher abnormal friction the acceleration deceleration motion of the pig appeared before the stuck when the pig travelled into the small abnormal friction moreover the stoppages were also corresponding to the scale of the abnormal section that whether it can meet the demands of the pig travelled before stoppage credit authorship contribution statement xiaowei li conceptualization methodology formal analysis software data curation visualization

20776,it is common practice to represent wave climate and sea severity through significant wave height the development of accurate probabilistic models of wave height is paramount in ocean related activities e g offshore structures weather routing wave energy assessment studies in this work several models for the probabilistic description of the significant wave height are examined and evaluated along with a new distribution that is introduced for the first time in wave height modelling namely the extended generalized inverse gaussian model the corresponding density and the cumulative distribution function are expressed through closed forms all the examined models were applied on long term measured wave data at four different locations of the greek seas and wave height data obtained from four buoys of the us noaa national data buoy centre the coefficient of determination the bayesian information criterion and the average deviation criteria were used for the evaluation of the examined models performance the final selection is based on the multiplicative criterion that combines the above criteria into a single expression the proposed distribution

applications including the probabilistic design and assessment of marine and coastal structures interacting with sea waves therefore subjected to wave loads the estimation of the long term sediment transport and morphological changes of the nearshore area wave energy assessment etc in addition in the context of particular applications the sea state direction and or the sea state duration is also required for the efficient modelling of the wave climate see e g soukissian and theochari 2001 soukissian 2014 except for significant wave height energy period t e plays also an important role in wave energy assessment studies the knowledge and modelling of the stochastic behavior of these variables is critical since it reduces the wave flux estimation error and contributes to the optimization of a wave farm layout see for example ren et al 2014 ambühl et al 2014 valamanesh et al 2014 valamanesh et al 2015 amirinia et al 2017 an assessment for potential small scale wec development utilizing the univariate distributions of h s and peak period t p can be found in vogler and venugopal 2016 in the same context the joint modelling of significant wave height and wave period is quite often of interest various bivariate families of distributions copulas are available for that purpose the most important characteristic of the copulas is that they take explicitly into account the marginal distributions of h s and t p or t e and their dependence structure through the copula function sklar 1959 examples of copulas used in the joint modelling of h s and t p are the farlie gumbel morgenstern farlie 1960 and plackett 1965 models for applications see e g lucas and soares 2015 vanem 2016 zhang et al 2018 significant wave height h s is a random variable that exhibits variations in the spatial and temporal domain in addition to the estimation of the standard low order statistical parameters of wave height the corresponding probability density function pdf provides a better insight into wave climate properties since the selection of the appropriate pdf describes analytically the relative frequency of the intensity of sea states moreover as is also noted by lucas and soares 2015 it may be more convenient to have theoretical models to combine with other models in any further computational procedure the use of parametric probability models instead of direct use of the discrete data is also justified by the fact that a theoretical model may represent better some probability levels that are not included in the sample allowing thus data extrapolation and densification a discussion on the statistical uncertainties involved in the estimation procedures of a parametric probability distribution for significant wave height can be found in guedes soares and henriques 1996 the probabilistic description of significant wave height h s is of great importance in weather routing applications and the design of coastal and offshore structures in terms of safety stability strength etc for example wave induced loads are an essential input parameter for the design of novel ship types and classification societies provide specific wave scatter diagrams for the sea areas where the ship will operate olsen et al 2006 on the other hand a distribution that fits well the right tail of h s data can be also used in the initial distribution method idm for extreme design sea state estimation see e g alves and young 2003 soukissian and kalantzi 2006 however it should be taken into account that the distribution fit is based at a large extent on data that are concentrated around the mode of the empirical distribution therefore the extrapolation of the right tail is characterized by a major degree of uncertainty see also the interesting discussion in vanem 2015 and section 6 the main objective of this paper is to assess and evaluate different parametric distribution functions for the description of significant wave height the data used here correspond to in situ wave measurements performed at different geographical locations representing diverse wave regimes in this framework numerous univariate conventional parametric models were addressed with respect to h s the evaluation of the resulting distributions is made in detail by applying three different metrics coefficient of determination bayesian information criterion and the average deviation of the cumulative distribution function and a unique measure that combines these three measures in a single expression the structure of the present work is the following in section 2 wave data obtained from four buoy locations in the greek seas along with data obtained from four ncdc buoys in the atlantic and pacific oceans and in the gulf of mexico are described and a preliminary statistical analysis is performed the examined univariate probability models for h s are presented in section 3 along with the introduction of the rather unknown extended generalized inverse gaussian egig distribution section 4 deals with the statistical criteria used to evaluate the performance of the examined models based on these criteria the derived univariate models are compared and the corresponding results are discussed in section 5 in section 6 a short discussion on the right tail of the examined distributions is made while the last section includes the concluding remarks of this analysis 2 description of wave data long term measured wave data from four oceanographic buoys of the poseidon marine monitoring network located in the aegean sea were analysed in this work the poseidon network soukissian and chronis 2000 soukissian et al 2002 operates since 1999 under the responsibility of the hellenic centre for marine research hcmr the buoy data consist of spectral parameters time series and the buoy wave measurements have 1024 s recording period and 3 h recording interval the locations of the measured wave data latitude longitude along with their measurement periods and water depths are listed in table 1 see also fig 1 before the statistical analysis and the parameter estimation procedure the wave data were corrected and filtered and negative and stacked values were removed in addition wave data from four buoys located across the western and eastern coasts of usa and the gulf of mexico were also analysed the buoys are operated by us noaa ndbc and the wave data consist of spectral parameters time series with 1200 s recording period and 1 h recording interval the locations of the measured wave data latitude longitude along with their measurement periods and water depths are listed in table 1 see also fig 1 in table 2 the main statistical parameters of h s from the datasets of the greek seas and us coasts are presented namely sample size n mean value m minimum m i n maximum m a x and standard deviation s moreover in the same table the corresponding l moment ratios i e l c v l s k and l k u of h s are also presented as is stated in hosking 1990 l moments are defined for any random variable that has a finite mean and can be used among others to provide a summary and description of data samples under examination and to describe the shape of the underlying pdf l moments are estimated through linear functions of data sample values two main advantages of l moments compared to conventional moments are the following i they are more robust when outliers exist in the data and ii they are more resistant to the influence of sample variability for a detailed presentation of the theory of l moments see hosking and wallis 2005 the population l moments of r order according to greenwood et al 1979 are expressed through the following quantities 1 β r e x f x r 0 1 x f f x r d f where e denotes the ensemble mean value operator f x is the cumulative distribution function cdf and x f is the inverse of the distribution subsequently the population l moments for r 1 2 3 4 are defined as follows 2 λ 1 β 0 λ 2 2 β 1 β 0 λ 3 6 β 2 6 β 1 β 0 λ 4 20 β 3 30 β 2 12 β 1 β 0 see also greenwood et al 1979 sankarasubramanian and srinivasan 1999 for r 1 the conventional mean value is obtained i e λ 1 e x the first two sample l moments are denoted as l 1 l mean or l location and l 2 l scale in general the sample l moment of the r th order is defined as follows 3 l r r 1 n r 1 x 1 x j x r 1 r j r 1 j x j where n is the sample size scaled l moments or l moments ratio i e the analogous to standardized moments are defined as t r l r l 2 where r 3 4 from these moments t 3 corresponds to the l skewness and t 4 to l kurtosis note that t r 1 1 while for l kurtosis in particular t 4 1 4 1 in addition the coefficient of l variation is defined as l c v l 2 l 1 regarding the greek seas the most intense wave climate is exhibited in mykonos with the overall largest mean value of significant wave height 1 008 m and with a maximum wave height 5 764 m the largest values of l c v h is encountered in mykonos 0 404 the largest value of l s k in lesvos 0 262 and for l k u in santorini 0 161 regarding the ndbc buoys the most intense wave climate is exhibited by far in buoy 46006 with the overall largest mean value of significant wave height 2 86 m and a maximum wave height of 15 47 m the largest values of l c v h and l s k are encountered in buoy 44004 0 317 and 0 278 respectively while the largest value of l k u is encountered in buoy 44017 0 161 3 univariate probability models for significant wave height 3 1 general various parametric univariate probability distributions can be used for fitting significant wave height data the distribution that is widely suggested in the relevant literature is the 2 or 3 parameter weibull wei distribution wei distribution has been used among others in batjes 1972 soares 1986 burrows and salih 1987 mathisen and bitnergregersen 1990 teng and palao 1997 bauer and staabs 1998 repko et al 2004 vanem and bitner gregersen 2012 galanis et al 2012 shariff and hadi hafezi where a comparison between the rayleigh and the weibull distributions with respect to the modelling of h s is made bang huseby et al 2013 drago et al 2013 dong et al 2013b altunkaynak 2014 feng et al 2014 melis and bonnaffoux 2014 lucas and soares 2015 and huseby et al 2015 other distributions implemented for wave height modelling are the lognormal lgn distribution athanassoulis et al 1994 repko et al 2004 lucas

parameter fréchet and exponential distributions repko et al 2004 maximum entropy type distributions have been considered in dong et al 2013a dong et al 2013b while relevant mixtures of distributions have been elaborated in li et al 2016 for a general discussion on significant wave height modelling see e g ferreira and guedes soares 2000 since there is no theoretical justification for adopting a particular probability distribution for h s several distributions are implemented here namely 1 one parameter cdfs exponential rayleigh 2 two parameter cdfs beta gaussian erlang error gamma inverse

pearson 3 pearson 5 pearson 6 pert and 4 four parameter cdfs johnson sb in the analysis that follows most of the above distributions were considered with their translated versions by including one or more additional location parameters distributions shown in the above list in italics see the definitions of the examined distributional forms in equations 10 18 regarding the johnson sb distribution it has been used successfully in offshore wind speed modelling soukissian 2013 soukissian 2014 and is also used here for the first time for significant wave height modelling the ten distributions that provide the best fits are selected by using the non parametric kolmogorov smirnov k s and anderson darling a d goodness of fit tests the corresponding statistics were estimated and the ten best fit distributions that provide the smallest statistic values for each test were selected for further evaluation since the k s and a d tests are not equivalent they provide in principle different rankings for the distributions therefore the ten best distributions were selected from each test the final number of the examined distributions is much less than expected since there were many overlaps between the best fit results provided by the tests according to the above procedure the distributions that are examined in detail are the following burr bur fatigue life fal gamma gam generalized gamma gng

distributions is introduced here for the first time for significant wave height modelling this family is obtained as the solution of the generalized pearson differential equation that has been introduced by pearson and henrici 1895 the original form of the pearson differential equation is the following 19 d f x d x f x x a b x 2 c x d where a b c d are real parameters such that f x is a pdf based on some special cases for these parameters pearson obtained the pearson types i xii distributions see also johnson et al 1995 any continuous distribution belongs to the pearson system of distributions if the corresponding pdf f x satisfies equation 19 a generalized form of equation 19 is the following 20 d f x d x f x i 1 m a i x i j 1 n b j x j m n 1 a i b j r i 1 2 m j 1 2 n from relation 20 several families of pdfs can be obtained as corresponding solutions see for example dunning and hanson 1977 cobb et al 1983 chaudhry and ahmad 1993 for the special case m 2 p n p 1 a 1 a 2 a p 1 a p 1 a 2 p 1 0 and b 0 b 1 b 2 b p 0 shakil et al 2016 considered the following particular form of equation 20 21 d f x d x a 0 a p x p a 2 p x 2 p b p 1 x p 1 f x b p 1 0 x 0 the solution to the above equation is provided as follows 22 f x c x v 1 exp α x p β x p x 0 α 0 β 0 v r where α a 2 p p b p 1 β a 0 p b p 1 v a p b p 1 b p 1 b p 1 0 p 0 and c is the normalizing constant the same authors distinguished three different classes of the above family of distributions for different values of the constant c namely 1 class i α 0 β 0 p 0 v r 23 c p 2 α β v 2 p 1 k v p 2 α β 2 class ii α 0 β 0 p 0 v 0 24 c p α v 2 p γ v p 3 class iii α 0 β 0 p 0 v 0 25 c p β v p γ v p since class i is the most general one the corresponding pdf and cdf after some elaboration are provided respectively as follows 26 f x α β p v p 2 α β v 2 p x v 1 exp α x p β x p κ v p 2 α β p π α 2 v p β 2 v p 1 4 p x v 1 exp α x p β x p w 0 v p 4 α β 27 f x γ v p α x p α β π α β 2 v p 4 p w 0 v p 4 α β x 0 α β p 0 v r where α β are scale parameters and p v are shape parameters f x defined through equation 26 is subsequently referred to as the extended generalized inverse gaussian egig distribution and includes many well known distributions as special cases see also gupta and viles 2011 gupta and viles 2012 shakil et al 2016 yeh ching et al 2017 shakil et al 2016 provided the relations for the maximum likelihood method and the method of moments for the estimation of the parameters of 26 by including an additional location parameter γ and scale parameter s relation 26 can be written as follows 28 f x α γ b s κ λ b κ λ α 2 2 s k α 4 κ λ x γ s b α 1 exp κ x γ s b λ x γ s b in this case though the number of the parameters under estimation is higher six and the estimation procedure is more complex while overfitting issues may also arise on the other hand and since the other distributions used in this work have up to four parameters we restrict ourselves to the assessment of equation 26 with four parameters the egig distribution is positively skewed and unimodal with mode 29 x m v 1 v 1 2 4 α β p 2 2 α p p the k th order moments are provided by the following expression 30 m k 2 β α k p k

v 0 and various values for parameter p 1 2 3 4 5 right panel 4 goodness of fit testing as mentioned in section 3 the preliminary selection of the most efficient distributions for modelling significant wave height was based on k s and a d tests since the two tests are not equivalent with the latter being more sensitive to deviations in the tails of the distribution they result in different best fit distributions for this reason the first ten best fit models provided by each test are selected however the total number of the pre final distributions is much less than 20 due to many overlaps the evaluation of the univariate distributions is based on three different criteria namely the coefficient of determination r a 1 2 the bayesian information criterion bic and the average deviation of cdf r a 1 2 was adopted in similar studies such as wind speed modelling see e g zhou et al 2010 kollu et al 2012 soukissian 2013 ouarda et al 2015 soukissian and karathanasi 2017 r a 1 2 measures the degree of associat ion between the estimated predicted and observed cumulative probabilities of a selected distribution and is defined as follows 33 r a 1 2 1 i 1 n f i f ˆ i 2 i 1 n f i f 2 where f ˆ i is the estimated cumulative distribution obtained from each distribution examined f i is the empirical observed distribution function and f 1 n i 1 n f i a value of r a 1 2 close to 1 indicates that the candidate distribution provides a good fit to the observed measured data another criterion that is used for the comparative evaluation between candidate pdf models and the selection of the best fit one is bic it is based on both the likelihood function of the examined model and the number of its associated parameters evidently bic penalizes model distributions with the larger number of parameters bic has been introduced by schwarz 1978 and is defined as follows 34 b i c k log n 2 log l where k is the number of model parameters n is the sample size and l is the maximized value of the model s likelihood function a model with a lower value for bic is preferable the third criterion is the average deviation in cdf this quantity is defined as follows 35 d f 1 n i 1 n f i f ˆ i based on the above criteria the final criterion is obtained according to tofallis 2008 as follows 36 f c d f b i c r a 1 2 5 numerical results all the analytically examined distributions provide consistently good fit results with respect to k s and a d goodness of fit tests at each examined location for the final selection of the best fit distribution the statistics r a 1 2 d f b i c and f c were evaluated for each of these distributions see table 3 and table 4 where the values of these criteria for the five optimal distributions are summarized for the poseidon and ndbc buoys respectively regarding the wave data of the greek seas based on the values of f c the following conclusions can be drawn 1 egig distribution provides the first best fit for athos lesvos and mykonos while lgn provides the best fit for santorini specifically for athos lesvos and mykonos egig distribution provides the optimal values for all examined criteria 2 for athos and lesvos the second best fit is provided by jsb and the third best fit by gng for mykonos the second best fit is provided by wei and the third best fit by bur for santorini the second best fit is provided by egig and the third best fit by fal for the significant wave height data obtained from ndbc buoys the following conclusions can be drawn 1 egig distribution provides the overall best fit for all examined wave data sets obtained from all buoys 2 jsb provides the second best fit for buoys 44017 44004 and 42019 while gng provides the second best fit for buoy 46006 3 fal provides the third best fit for buoys 46006 and 44004 ing for buoy 44017 and gng for buoy 42019 the parameters for the five best fit candidate distributions according to f c for each examined location are presented in table 5 and table 6 for the poseidon and ndbc buoys respectively in fig 3 and fig 4 the five best fit distributions along with the corresponding histograms for significant wave height obtained from the poseidon and ndbc buoys are presented respectively 6 a short discussion about the right tail behavior of the examined distributions the right tail behavior of the fitted distributions plays an important role as regards the extreme value analysis of the variable under examination in the extreme value analysis context the initial distribution method idm implies the direct extrapolation of the right tail of a distribution in order to estimate extreme values and associated return periods see e g ochi 1992 soukissian and kalantzi 2006 vinoth and young 2011 however the estimation of the extreme values and corresponding return periods based on the derived distributions for the entire data set is emphatically not suggested in the relevant literature see agarwal et al 2013 vanem 2015 takbash and young 2019 katalinić and parunov 2020 the main reason for this suggestion is that the fitting of the examined distributions in the idm is based at a large extent on data available around the most probable value and therefore the extrapolation of the right tail is characterized by a major degree of uncertainty as is concluded in katalinić and parunov 2020 significant differences can occur depending on the choice of model and parameter fitting technique if the intended use of the analysis of extremes is an input for the engineering of offshore structures such variability can greatly affect cost and safety as a very preliminary assessment of the right tail behavior of the examined distributions the qq plots for quantiles above the median of the three best fit theoretical distributions are provided for athos lesvos and buoys 44004 and 46006 see fig 5 as is seen from fig 5 egig and jsb distributions are characterized by a very similar behavior at the right tail for athos lesvos and buoy 44004 moreover there is a very good agreement between theoretical and empirical quantiles in these cases on the contrary for buoy 46006 fal and gng exhibit a very similar right tail behavior that is not though in good agreement with the empirical quantiles nevertheless the extreme value analysis of data that are modelled through the egig distribution is a field for further research in this respect a simulation study is required in order to generate long term data samples from an egig population based on the simulated data well known methods of extreme value analysis should be implemented such as block maxima approach peak over thresholds method etc and the obtained results should be further compared with the results provided by the idm in that context the effects of the various parameter estimation methods for the egig distribution should be also examined 7 concluding remarks in this work different parametric models for the probabilistic description of the significant wave height are examined and evaluated the evaluation of the models is based on bic r a 1 2 d f and f c criteria the examined models were applied for eight long term significant wave height time series which were obtained from in situ measurements in very different sea areas as regards wave climate namely in four locations of the greek seas and four locations in the atlantic and pacific oceans and in the gulf of mexico a new probabilistic model the extended generalized inverse gaussian egig distribution was also introduced for the first time for the description of significant wave height moreover the jsb distribution which has been used in the modelling of wind speed was also examined from the most familiar distributions bur fal gam gng ing jsb lgn pe6 and wei seem to perform well for all examined locations however the newly introduced egig distribution provided the best fit for the overwhelming majority of significant wave height data sets specifically 1 egig distribution provided the first best fit for seven out of eight wave datasets examined athos lesvos mykonos and buoys 44017 46006 44004 and 42019 while lgn provided the best fit for santorini 2 jsb distribution provided the second best for five out of eight wave datasets athos lesvos and buoys 44017 44004 and 42019 while gng wei and egig provided the second best fit for buoy 46006 mykonos and santorini respectively 3 gng provided the third best fit for athos lesvos and buoy 42019 while fal provided the third best fit for santorini and buoys 46006 and 44004 4 finally bur and ing distributions provided the third best fit for mykonos and buoy 44017 respectively clearly egig distribution outperforms as regards the modelling of significant wave height while jsb is also a very promising candidate distribution let it be also noted that for the modelling of bimodal distributions of significant wave height mixture distributions of egig and jsb may provide satisfactory solutions credit authorship contribution

20776,it is common practice to represent wave climate and sea severity through significant wave height the development of accurate probabilistic models of wave height is paramount in ocean related activities e g offshore structures weather routing wave energy assessment studies in this work several models for the probabilistic description of the significant wave height are examined and evaluated along with a new distribution that is introduced for the first time in wave height modelling namely the extended generalized inverse gaussian model the corresponding density and the cumulative distribution function are expressed through closed forms all the examined models were applied on long term measured wave data at four different locations of the greek seas and wave height data obtained from four buoys of the us noaa national data buoy centre the coefficient of determination the bayesian information criterion and the average deviation criteria were used for the evaluation of the examined models performance the final selection is based on the multiplicative criterion that combines the above criteria into a single expression the proposed distribution

applications including the probabilistic design and assessment of marine and coastal structures interacting with sea waves therefore subjected to wave loads the estimation of the long term sediment transport and morphological changes of the nearshore area wave energy assessment etc in addition in the context of particular applications the sea state direction and or the sea state duration is also required for the efficient modelling of the wave climate see e g soukissian and theochari 2001 soukissian 2014 except for significant wave height energy period t e plays also an important role in wave energy assessment studies the knowledge and modelling of the stochastic behavior of these variables is critical since it reduces the wave flux estimation error and contributes to the optimization of a wave farm layout see for example ren et al 2014 ambühl et al 2014 valamanesh et al 2014 valamanesh et al 2015 amirinia et al 2017 an assessment for potential small scale wec development utilizing the univariate distributions of h s and peak period t p can be found in vogler and venugopal 2016 in the same context the joint modelling of significant wave height and wave period is quite often of interest various bivariate families of distributions copulas are available for that purpose the most important characteristic of the copulas is that they take explicitly into account the marginal distributions of h s and t p or t e and their dependence structure through the copula function sklar 1959 examples of copulas used in the joint modelling of h s and t p are the farlie gumbel morgenstern farlie 1960 and plackett 1965 models for applications see e g lucas and soares 2015 vanem 2016 zhang et al 2018 significant wave height h s is a random variable that exhibits variations in the spatial and temporal domain in addition to the estimation of the standard low order statistical parameters of wave height the corresponding probability density function pdf provides a better insight into wave climate properties since the selection of the appropriate pdf describes analytically the relative frequency of the intensity of sea states moreover as is also noted by lucas and soares 2015 it may be more convenient to have theoretical models to combine with other models in any further computational procedure the use of parametric probability models instead of direct use of the discrete data is also justified by the fact that a theoretical model may represent better some probability levels that are not included in the sample allowing thus data extrapolation and densification a discussion on the statistical uncertainties involved in the estimation procedures of a parametric probability distribution for significant wave height can be found in guedes soares and henriques 1996 the probabilistic description of significant wave height h s is of great importance in weather routing applications and the design of coastal and offshore structures in terms of safety stability strength etc for example wave induced loads are an essential input parameter for the design of novel ship types and classification societies provide specific wave scatter diagrams for the sea areas where the ship will operate olsen et al 2006 on the other hand a distribution that fits well the right tail of h s data can be also used in the initial distribution method idm for extreme design sea state estimation see e g alves and young 2003 soukissian and kalantzi 2006 however it should be taken into account that the distribution fit is based at a large extent on data that are concentrated around the mode of the empirical distribution therefore the extrapolation of the right tail is characterized by a major degree of uncertainty see also the interesting discussion in vanem 2015 and section 6 the main objective of this paper is to assess and evaluate different parametric distribution functions for the description of significant wave height the data used here correspond to in situ wave measurements performed at different geographical locations representing diverse wave regimes in this framework numerous univariate conventional parametric models were addressed with respect to h s the evaluation of the resulting distributions is made in detail by applying three different metrics coefficient of determination bayesian information criterion and the average deviation of the cumulative distribution function and a unique measure that combines these three measures in a single expression the structure of the present work is the following in section 2 wave data obtained from four buoy locations in the greek seas along with data obtained from four ncdc buoys in the atlantic and pacific oceans and in the gulf of mexico are described and a preliminary statistical analysis is performed the examined univariate probability models for h s are presented in section 3 along with the introduction of the rather unknown extended generalized inverse gaussian egig distribution section 4 deals with the statistical criteria used to evaluate the performance of the examined models based on these criteria the derived univariate models are compared and the corresponding results are discussed in section 5 in section 6 a short discussion on the right tail of the examined distributions is made while the last section includes the concluding remarks of this analysis 2 description of wave data long term measured wave data from four oceanographic buoys of the poseidon marine monitoring network located in the aegean sea were analysed in this work the poseidon network soukissian and chronis 2000 soukissian et al 2002 operates since 1999 under the responsibility of the hellenic centre for marine research hcmr the buoy data consist of spectral parameters time series and the buoy wave measurements have 1024 s recording period and 3 h recording interval the locations of the measured wave data latitude longitude along with their measurement periods and water depths are listed in table 1 see also fig 1 before the statistical analysis and the parameter estimation procedure the wave data were corrected and filtered and negative and stacked values were removed in addition wave data from four buoys located across the western and eastern coasts of usa and the gulf of mexico were also analysed the buoys are operated by us noaa ndbc and the wave data consist of spectral parameters time series with 1200 s recording period and 1 h recording interval the locations of the measured wave data latitude longitude along with their measurement periods and water depths are listed in table 1 see also fig 1 in table 2 the main statistical parameters of h s from the datasets of the greek seas and us coasts are presented namely sample size n mean value m minimum m i n maximum m a x and standard deviation s moreover in the same table the corresponding l moment ratios i e l c v l s k and l k u of h s are also presented as is stated in hosking 1990 l moments are defined for any random variable that has a finite mean and can be used among others to provide a summary and description of data samples under examination and to describe the shape of the underlying pdf l moments are estimated through linear functions of data sample values two main advantages of l moments compared to conventional moments are the following i they are more robust when outliers exist in the data and ii they are more resistant to the influence of sample variability for a detailed presentation of the theory of l moments see hosking and wallis 2005 the population l moments of r order according to greenwood et al 1979 are expressed through the following quantities 1 β r e x f x r 0 1 x f f x r d f where e denotes the ensemble mean value operator f x is the cumulative distribution function cdf and x f is the inverse of the distribution subsequently the population l moments for r 1 2 3 4 are defined as follows 2 λ 1 β 0 λ 2 2 β 1 β 0 λ 3 6 β 2 6 β 1 β 0 λ 4 20 β 3 30 β 2 12 β 1 β 0 see also greenwood et al 1979 sankarasubramanian and srinivasan 1999 for r 1 the conventional mean value is obtained i e λ 1 e x the first two sample l moments are denoted as l 1 l mean or l location and l 2 l scale in general the sample l moment of the r th order is defined as follows 3 l r r 1 n r 1 x 1 x j x r 1 r j r 1 j x j where n is the sample size scaled l moments or l moments ratio i e the analogous to standardized moments are defined as t r l r l 2 where r 3 4 from these moments t 3 corresponds to the l skewness and t 4 to l kurtosis note that t r 1 1 while for l kurtosis in particular t 4 1 4 1 in addition the coefficient of l variation is defined as l c v l 2 l 1 regarding the greek seas the most intense wave climate is exhibited in mykonos with the overall largest mean value of significant wave height 1 008 m and with a maximum wave height 5 764 m the largest values of l c v h is encountered in mykonos 0 404 the largest value of l s k in lesvos 0 262 and for l k u in santorini 0 161 regarding the ndbc buoys the most intense wave climate is exhibited by far in buoy 46006 with the overall largest mean value of significant wave height 2 86 m and a maximum wave height of 15 47 m the largest values of l c v h and l s k are encountered in buoy 44004 0 317 and 0 278 respectively while the largest value of l k u is encountered in buoy 44017 0 161 3 univariate probability models for significant wave height 3 1 general various parametric univariate probability distributions can be used for fitting significant wave height data the distribution that is widely suggested in the relevant literature is the 2 or 3 parameter weibull wei distribution wei distribution has been used among others in batjes 1972 soares 1986 burrows and salih 1987 mathisen and bitnergregersen 1990 teng and palao 1997 bauer and staabs 1998 repko et al 2004 vanem and bitner gregersen 2012 galanis et al 2012 shariff and hadi hafezi where a comparison between the rayleigh and the weibull distributions with respect to the modelling of h s is made bang huseby et al 2013 drago et al 2013 dong et al 2013b altunkaynak 2014 feng et al 2014 melis and bonnaffoux 2014 lucas and soares 2015 and huseby et al 2015 other distributions implemented for wave height modelling are the lognormal lgn distribution athanassoulis et al 1994 repko et al 2004 lucas

parameter fréchet and exponential distributions repko et al 2004 maximum entropy type distributions have been considered in dong et al 2013a dong et al 2013b while relevant mixtures of distributions have been elaborated in li et al 2016 for a general discussion on significant wave height modelling see e g ferreira and guedes soares 2000 since there is no theoretical justification for adopting a particular probability distribution for h s several distributions are implemented here namely 1 one parameter cdfs exponential rayleigh 2 two parameter cdfs beta gaussian erlang error gamma inverse gaussian kumaraswamy log logistic lognormal weibull 3 three parameter cdfs burr dagum fatigue life fréchet generalized extreme value generalized gamma generalized logistic generalized pareto log pearson 3 pearson 5 pearson 6 pert and 4 four parameter cdfs johnson sb in the analysis that follows most of the above distributions were considered with their translated versions by including one or more additional location parameters distributions shown in the above list in italics see the definitions of the examined distributional forms in equations 10 18 regarding the johnson sb distribution it has been used successfully in offshore wind speed modelling soukissian 2013 soukissian 2014 and is also used here for the first time for significant wave height modelling the ten distributions that provide the best fits are selected by using the non parametric kolmogorov smirnov k s and anderson darling a d goodness of fit tests the corresponding statistics were estimated and the ten best fit distributions that provide the smallest statistic values for each test were selected for further evaluation since the k s and a d tests are not equivalent they provide in principle different rankings for the distributions therefore the ten best distributions were selected from each test the final number of the examined distributions is much less than expected since there were many overlaps between the best fit results provided by the tests according to the above procedure the distributions that are examined in detail are the following burr bur fatigue life fal gamma gam generalized gamma gng

introduced by pearson and henrici 1895 the original form of the pearson differential equation is the following 19 d f x d x f x x a b x 2 c x d where a b c d are real parameters such that f x is a pdf based on some special cases for these parameters pearson obtained the pearson types i xii distributions see also johnson et al 1995 any continuous distribution belongs to the pearson system of distributions if the corresponding pdf f x satisfies equation 19 a generalized form of equation 19 is the following 20 d f x d x f x i 1 m a i x i j 1 n b j x j m n 1 a i b j r i 1 2 m j 1 2 n from relation 20 several families of pdfs can be obtained as corresponding solutions see for example dunning and hanson 1977 cobb et al 1983 chaudhry and ahmad 1993 for the special case m 2 p n p 1 a 1 a 2

authors distinguished three different classes of the above family of distributions for different values of the constant c namely 1 class i α 0 β 0 p 0 v r 23 c p 2 α β v 2 p 1 k v p 2 α β 2 class ii α

many well known distributions as special cases see also gupta and viles 2011 gupta and viles 2012 shakil et al 2016 yeh ching et al 2017 shakil et al 2016 provided the relations for the maximum likelihood method and the method of moments for the estimation of the parameters of 26 by including an additional location parameter γ and scale parameter s relation 26 can be written as follows 28 f

while overfitting issues may also arise on the other hand and since the other distributions used in this work have up to four parameters we restrict ourselves to the assessment of equation 26 with four parameters the egig distribution is positively skewed and unimodal with mode 29 x m v 1 v 1 2 4 α β p 2 2 α p p the k th order moments are provided by the following expression 30 m k 2 β α k p k

v 0 and various values for parameter p 1 2 3 4 5 right panel 4 goodness of fit testing as mentioned in section 3 the preliminary selection of the most efficient distributions for modelling significant wave height was based on k s and a d tests since the two tests are not equivalent with the latter being more sensitive to deviations in the tails of the distribution they result in different best fit distributions for this reason the first ten best fit models provided by each test are selected however the total number of the pre final distributions is much less than 20 due to many overlaps the evaluation of the univariate distributions is based on three different criteria namely the coefficient of determination r a 1 2 the bayesian information criterion bic and the average deviation of cdf r a 1 2 was adopted in similar studies such as wind speed modelling see e g zhou et al 2010 kollu et al 2012 soukissian 2013 ouarda et al 2015 soukissian and karathanasi 2017 r a 1 2 measures the degree of associat ion between the estimated predicted and observed cumulative probabilities of a selected distribution and is defined as follows 33 r a 1 2 1 i 1 n f i f ˆ i 2 i 1 n f i f 2 where f ˆ i is the estimated cumulative distribution obtained from each distribution examined f i is the empirical observed distribution function and f 1 n i 1 n f i a value of r a 1 2 close to 1 indicates that the candidate distribution provides a good fit to the observed measured data another criterion that is used for the comparative evaluation between candidate pdf models and the selection of the best fit one is bic it is based on both the likelihood function of the examined model and the number of its associated parameters evidently bic penalizes model distributions with the larger number of parameters bic has been introduced by schwarz 1978 and is defined as follows 34 b i c k log n 2 log l where k is the number of model parameters n is the sample size and l is the maximized value of the model s likelihood function a model with a lower value for bic is preferable the third criterion is the average deviation in cdf this quantity is defined as follows 35 d f 1 n i 1 n f i f ˆ i based on the above criteria the final criterion is obtained according to tofallis 2008 as follows 36 f c d f b i c r a 1 2 5 numerical results all the analytically examined distributions provide consistently good fit results with respect to k s and a d goodness of fit tests at each examined location for the final selection of the best fit distribution the statistics r a 1 2 d f b i c and f c were evaluated for each of these distributions see table 3 and table 4 where the values of these criteria for the five optimal distributions are summarized for the poseidon and ndbc buoys respectively regarding the wave data of the greek seas based on the values of f c the following conclusions can be drawn 1 egig distribution provides the first best fit for athos lesvos and mykonos while lgn provides the best fit for santorini specifically for athos lesvos and mykonos egig distribution provides the optimal values for all examined criteria 2 for athos and lesvos the second best fit is provided by jsb and the third best fit by gng for mykonos the second best fit is provided by wei and the third best fit by bur for santorini the second best fit is provided by egig and the third best fit by fal for the significant wave height data obtained from ndbc buoys the following conclusions can be drawn 1 egig distribution provides the overall best fit for all examined wave data sets obtained from all buoys 2 jsb provides the second best fit for buoys 44017 44004 and 42019 while gng provides the second best fit for buoy 46006 3 fal provides the third best fit for buoys 46006 and 44004 ing for buoy 44017 and gng for buoy 42019 the parameters for the five best fit candidate distributions according to f c for each examined location are presented in table 5 and table 6 for the poseidon and ndbc buoys respectively in fig 3 and fig 4 the five best fit distributions along with the corresponding histograms for significant wave height obtained from the poseidon and ndbc buoys are presented respectively 6 a short discussion about the right tail behavior of the examined distributions the right tail behavior of the fitted distributions plays an important role as regards the extreme value analysis of the variable under examination in the extreme value analysis context the initial distribution method idm implies the direct extrapolation of the right tail of a distribution in order to estimate extreme values and associated return periods see e g ochi 1992 soukissian and kalantzi 2006 vinoth and young 2011 however the estimation of the extreme values and corresponding return periods based on the derived distributions for the entire data set is emphatically not suggested in the relevant literature see agarwal et al 2013 vanem 2015 takbash and young 2019 katalinić and parunov 2020 the main reason for this suggestion is that the fitting of the examined distributions in the idm is based at a large extent on data available around the most probable value and therefore the extrapolation of the right tail is characterized by a major degree of uncertainty as is concluded in katalinić and parunov 2020 significant differences can occur depending on the choice of model and parameter fitting technique if the intended use of the analysis of extremes is an input for the engineering of offshore structures such variability can greatly affect cost and safety as a very preliminary assessment of the right tail behavior of the examined distributions the qq plots for quantiles above the median of the three best fit theoretical distributions are provided for athos lesvos and buoys 44004 and 46006 see fig 5 as is seen from fig 5 egig and jsb distributions are characterized by a very similar behavior at the right tail for athos lesvos and buoy 44004 moreover there is a very good agreement between theoretical and empirical quantiles in these cases on the contrary for buoy 46006 fal and gng exhibit a very similar right tail behavior that is not though in good agreement with the empirical quantiles nevertheless the extreme value analysis of data that are modelled through the egig distribution is a field for further research in this respect a simulation study is required in order to generate long term data samples from an egig population based on the simulated data well known methods of extreme value analysis should be implemented such as block maxima approach peak over thresholds method etc and the obtained results should be further compared with the results provided by the idm in that context the effects of the various parameter estimation methods for the egig distribution should be also examined 7 concluding remarks in this work different parametric models for the probabilistic description of the significant wave height are examined and evaluated the evaluation of the models is based on bic r a 1 2 d f and f c criteria the examined models were applied for eight long term significant wave height time series which were obtained from in situ measurements in very different sea areas as regards wave climate namely in four locations of the greek seas and four locations in the atlantic and pacific oceans and in the gulf of mexico a new probabilistic model the extended generalized inverse gaussian egig distribution was also introduced for the first time for the description of significant wave height moreover the jsb distribution which has been used in the modelling of wind speed was also examined from the most familiar distributions bur fal gam gng ing jsb lgn pe6 and wei seem to perform well for all examined locations however the newly introduced egig distribution provided the best fit for the overwhelming majority of significant wave height data sets specifically 1 egig distribution provided the first best fit for seven out of eight wave datasets examined athos lesvos mykonos and buoys 44017 46006 44004 and 42019 while lgn provided the best fit for santorini 2 jsb distribution provided the second best for five out of eight wave datasets athos lesvos and buoys 44017 44004 and 42019 while gng wei and egig provided the second best fit for buoy 46006 mykonos and santorini respectively 3 gng provided the third best fit for athos lesvos and buoy 42019 while fal provided the third best fit for santorini and buoys 46006 and 44004 4 finally bur and ing distributions provided the third best fit for mykonos and buoy 44017 respectively clearly egig distribution outperforms as regards the modelling of significant wave height while jsb is also a very promising candidate distribution let it be also noted that for the modelling of bimodal distributions of significant wave height mixture distributions of egig and jsb may provide satisfactory solutions credit authorship contribution

20777,being an impressive representative of gravity installed anchors gias the omni max anchor has many attractive attributes and becomes more and more a conspicuous role in recent deepwater applications however the pullout capacity property of omni max anchors has not been well understood due to their three dimensional structure and the loading way in variational seabed conditions full knowledge of the pullout capacity property is beneficial to understand not only the working performance but also the comprehensive kinematic behaviors of omni max anchors in the seabed the present

free fall to penetrate into the seabed and thus obtains the bearing capacity to withstand the pullout loading although the omni max anchor has been proven an efficient and economical solution to anchoring floating facilities in deep waters shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 the pullout capacity property has not been fully explored due to their three dimensional structure and the loading way in variational seabed conditions full knowledge of the pullout capacity property is beneficial to understand not only the working performance but also the comprehensive kinematic behaviors of omni max anchors such as keying and diving for anchors under excessive loading earlier studies on the pullout capacity of omni max anchors mainly include 1 g or centrifuge laboratory experiments shelton 2007 gaudin et al 2013 liu et al 2018a field tests shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 and small strain or large deformation numerical modeling liu et al 2014b 2016 wei et al 2015 kim and hossain 2017 han et al 2018 tian et al 2018 zhao and liu 2018 however the earlier studies only involved the cases with limited influential parameters from which the effects of the influential parameters could be assessed under specific conditions but cannot be extended generally to quantitative analytical results in practice omni max anchors may be embedded in the seabed with different soil properties at different orientations and depths while the applied loading direction to the anchor may also be variational which induces different bearing areas and therefore different pullout capacities of the anchor the designed 360 omni directional loading arm may produce different bearing areas at a specific loading angle varying between the maximum and minimum values if the loading angle changes the problem becomes more complicated and various bearing areas will be induced in such complicated conditions to accurately evaluate the pullout capacity of the anchor is not an easy task the anchor embedment depth orientation and bearing area the applied loading angle and the soil strength will all be significant factors that contribute to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors however it still lacks an in depth study that focuses on the pullout capacity of omni max anchors under multiple factors theoretically the pullout capacity of gias embedded in clay is contributed by the end bearing the shear force and the self weight of the anchor in which the shear force and the self weight only play insignificant roles while the end bearing contributes most to the pullout capacity about 65 95 of the total based on the statistical analysis of available published data medeiros 2002 de aguiar et al 2009 wang and o loughlin 2014 o beirne et al 2015 wei et al 2015 kim and hossain 2016 liu et al 2016 fu et al 2017 han et al 2018 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and present numerous numerical results on the other hand there are more uncertainties in determining the value of end bearing capacity factor n c to empirically calculate the end bearing rather than in determining the value of adhesion factor α to empirically calculate the shear force since the value of n c may vary in a large range such as 7 6 11 87 for plate anchors peng and liu 2019 while the value of α generally varies in a small range such as 0 3 0 5 for plate anchors murff et al 2005 liu et al 2012 peng and liu 2019 this is why investigating the end bearing is more important and challenging for investigating the pullout capacity of omni max anchors the omni max anchor may exhibit comprehensive behaviors in the seabed including keying diving and pulling out peng and liu 2019 full knowledge of the end bearing is helpful to accurately describe and understand the comprehensive behaviors of omni max anchors in the seabed the present work aims to investigate the complicated pullout capacity property of omni max anchors in clay under multiple factors including the anchor embedment depth the anchor orientation the bearing area the loading angle and the soil property large deformation finite element ldfe analyses are performed using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique which has been well applied to analyze the bearing capacity and kinematic behaviors of anchors liu et al 2014b zhao and liu 2015 2017 numerous cases of multiple factors are designed and analyzed to acquire the effects of different influential parameters an explicit expression of the end bearing capacity factor of omni max anchors is finally formulated in terms of multiple factors whose effectiveness and applicability are examined by orthogonal tests and available published data this expression is expected to be conveniently utilized to evaluate the pullout capacity of omni max anchors under complicated conditions 2 numerical modeling techniques 2 1 numerical model 2 1 1 cel model the concept of cel was introduced by noh 1964 and improved by benson 1992 in decades the cel technique was extensively employed to solve geotechnical problems involving large deformations zhao and liu 2016 adopted the cel approach to study the comprehensive behaviors of deepwater anchors the accuracy of the cel technique was demonstrated effective and efficient in solving quasi static problems in the present work the same technique is employed on the platform of the software abaqus explicit to obtain the finite element solution to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors compared to the small strain analyses the large deformation analyses can produce a complete load displacement response curve chatterjee et al 2014 and then rationally determine the ultimate pullout capacity upc of anchors which is an important index in designing and analyzing anchors and can be deterministically obtained from the maximum resistance criterion liu et al 2014a the definition of the pullout problem for omni max anchors is illustrated in fig 1 the anchor is embedded in the seabed at the depth h and orientation θ o under the applied loading with the loading angle θ a where θ o denotes the angle of anchor shaft to the horizontal and θ a denotes the angle of applied loading to the horizontal at the anchor shackle the cel model is built to analyze the pullout capacity of the omni max anchor under various conditions an explicit time integration scheme is adopted in the model for elastic materials the calculation stability is assured by introducing a critical increment in time step i e δ t critical min l e c d where l e is the dimension of characteristic element and c d is the dilatational wave speed of the material the flow of eulerian material among meshes is traced by calculating its eulerian volume fraction evf the nodes of elements are fixed in the space and do not follow the material movement a void layer is set upon the surface of the soil to guarantee the free flow of clay the saturated clay under undrained conditions is regarded as an elastic perfectly plastic material obeying the tresca yield criterion the geostatic stress is created by setting the coefficient of earth pressure k 0 1 both the soil and the void layer above the mudline are established by ec3d8r elements the elastic behavior is defined by young s modulus e of 500 s u and poisson s ratio μ of 0 49 where s u denotes the undrained shear strength of clay the effective soil unit weight γ is set as 7 kn m3 the user subroutine vusdfld is applied to achieve a linear strength distribution of clay where a field variable needs to be defined the field variable is associated with the undrained shear strength of clay whose initial value is set as the soil depth the field variable is updated by the subroutine code so that the soil strength with the material flow can be described during the anchor pullout process liu et al 2014a the omni max anchor is constructed as a rigid body throughout the simulation whose details are summarized in table 1 a general contact with the hard contact method is used to describe the contact between eulerian and lagrangian materials the frictional coefficient μ 0 on the interface of anchor clay is set zero for getting pure end bearing resistance the cel model is illustrated in fig 2 where l b c b and d b are the length the half width and the distance from the anchor bottom to the model bottom respectively h is the embedment depth from the anchor centroid to the seafloor h v is the height of the void layer d p is the effective diameter of anchor w f is the width of the fluke t f is the thickness of the fluke l h f denotes the length of head fluke l t f denotes the length of tail fluke l r denotes the length of loading ring l s denotes the length of anchor shaft due to complicated structural edges of the omni max anchor fine meshes have to be generated around the anchor as illustrated in fig 2 the domain scale of the model will be introduced in the following section 2 1 2 convergence study to balance the accuracy against computational efficiency a convergence study is conducted on the domain scale the mesh size and the pullout rate of the anchor the omni max anchor is positioned horizontally and applied by an upward load in weightless uniform soil with s u 2 4 kpa the scale of the model domain is investigated at first two values of embedment depth h b 1 and 3 are probed to examine the boundary effect at different embedment depths the comparative study proves that when l b b 6 c b b 3 3 and d b b 3 where b denotes the anchor length the model boundary effect can almost be eliminated it is noteworthy that the distance between the anchor and the boundary in the anchor axial direction is always guaranteed larger than 3b to avoid the boundary effect for the inclined anchor cases the minimum size of meshing is also investigated the ratio b a ranging from 45 to 113 and the ratio b a ranging from 1 to 4 are examined in detail where a and b are the mesh lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively according to the comparative results the mean relative error is 1 99 between the results of b a 85 and b a 101 while is 1 37 between the results of b a 101 and b a 113 the mean relative error is 2 41 between the results of b a 1 5 and b a 2 while is 2 02 between the results of b a 1 and b a 1 5 from the viewpoint of acceptable convergence the values b a 101 and b a 1 5 are finally determined to build the models in the subsequent study then a series of cases focusing on the pullout velocity are performed to guarantee the whole pullout process as a quasi static loading according to the comparative results as illustrated in fig 3 the end bearing factor tends to be convergent when the pullout velocity is smaller than 0 05 m s the mean relative error of the curve of 0 03 m s to that of 0 02 m s is 1 58 eventually the velocity of 0 03 m s is determined for the subsequent analyses 2 2 the criterion for determining the upc the upc is an important index in designing and analyzing anchors there are several criteria to determine the upc of anchors based on numerically obtained load displacement curves generally including the plateau criterion o neill et al 2003 yang et al 2010 sahoo and kumar 2014 the linearly increasing criterion neely et al 1973 the function fitting criterion hanna et al 2007 the double tangent intersection criterion boushehrian et al 2009 the specified displacement criterion vesic 1973 the k4 criterion rowe and davis 1982 and the maximum resistance criterion wang et al 2010 liu et al 2014a liu et al 2014a reviewed all the criteria above for determining the upc and proposed three rules to conform to a rational criterion the first a deterministic value of upc can be obtained by using the criterion the second the criterion must be rational which means that it implies clear and right physical meaning the third the criterion can be generally applied the ldfe technique with the maximum resistance criterion to determine the upc was successfully applied to plate anchors in clay by liu et al 2014a utilizing this criterion the value of upc can be derived from ldfe analyses easily and uniquely in the present work the maximum resistance criterion is adopted to acquire the upc of omni max anchors in clay 2 3 validation 2 3 1 plate anchor a series of pullout cases on the horizontally placed plate anchor are analyzed to examine the reliability and accuracy of the cel model by comparing with corresponding centrifuge tests chen et al 2016 the square plate anchor has the width of 4 m and the thickness of 0 2 m three cases with different embedment ratios of h b 0 54 1 05 and 2 86 are calculated with a pullout velocity of 0 1 m s the size of the minimum element and the scale of soil domain are set the same as those presented by liu et al 2014a which were demonstrated adequately to achieve a convergent result and are not repeated here the clay has an undrained shear strength of s u 1 34z kpa the young s modulus e 500 s u is adopted while the poisson s ratio μ is taken as 0 49 the submerged weight of soil is 6 07 kn m3 the frictional coefficient μ 0 is set zero to simulate the immediate breakaway condition between anchor and soil in the centrifuge tests the comparative results are presented in fig 4 in which d b denotes the normalized anchor displacement and q 0 a s u denotes the normalized net pullout capacity where b is the width and a is the bearing area of the plate anchor and s u is the soil strength at the initial depth of the anchor centroid the net pullout capacity q 0 is calculated by 1 q 0 q q s s w a where q is the vertical pullout capacity of the plate anchor w a is the submerged weight of the anchor and q s s denotes the soil suction and the shear force due to the immediate breakaway condition between anchor and soil employed in the centrifuge tests the term q ss can be overlooked then q 0 is simplified to 2 q 0 q w a fig 4 demonstrates that the cel model can well reflect the evolution of pullout capacity under various initial embedment depths when the anchor is pulled by the applied loading the load increases to the peak quickly and then decreases gradually the numerical curves are generally consistent with the measured ones note that the numerical peaks which represent the normalized values of upc of the anchor occur at almost the same depths as those of experiments with the relative errors of 0 69 0 65 and 1 64 for h b 0 54 1 05 and 2 86 respectively the comparative results confirm not only the ability of the cel model but also the maximum resistance criterion for determining the upc of plate anchors 2 3 2 deep penetration anchor dpa as a validation for capacity analyses of anchors with a three dimensional structure a prototype cel model is undertaken to validate against the centrifuge test on the dpa under 200g condition performed by richardson 2008 as illustrated in fig 5 a the length b and diameter d of the dpa are 15m and 1 2m respectively the anchor has four flukes separated by 90 in plane whose width w f and thickness t f are 1 8m and 0 2m respectively the embedment depth of the anchor is 21 4m the dry weight of the dpa is 753 41 kn the soil has an effective unit weight of 6 5 kn m3 with the undrained shear strength s u 0 0037z 2 0 959z kpa in the cel analysis the domain scale and the minimum size of the meshes reference the results in the convergence study of omni max anchors i e the values l b b 6 c b b 3 3 d b b 3 b a 101 and b a 1 5 the young s modulus e 500 s u is adopted while the poisson s ratio μ is taken as 0 49 the soil anchor interface is modeled as frictional contact by coulomb friction law in which the frictional factor μ 0 is set as 0 02 corresponding to the value of 0 4 for the adhesion factor α reported by richardson 2008 a quasi static pullout velocity of 0 01 m s is applied which has been investigated to ensure a convergent result fig 5 b shows the measured and calculated pullout load displacement curves it is observed that the values of upc from the cel analysis and the centrifuge test are very close with the relative error of 4 38 this confirms the effectiveness and accuracy of the cel model in deriving the upc of anchors 2 3 3 omni max anchor gaudin et al 2013 presented a centrifuge test of the omni max anchor being pulled out under an acceleration of 200g where the adopted kaolin clay had an undrained shear strength s u 3 1 1z kpa the cel analysis is conducted to validate against the test result the anchor line effects are incorporated by a chain equation zhao and liu 2017 with the user subroutine vuamp in which the cable diameter is set as 0 2m and the pullout angle at mudline is horizontal according to the centrifuge test conditions the control velocity at the mudline is set as 0 03 m s according to the previous study of quasi static velocity the young s modulus e 500 s u is adopted while the poisson s ratio μ is taken as 0 49 the interface frictional factor μ 0 is set as 0 04 corresponding to the value of 0 4 for the adhesion factor α as reported by gaudin et al 2013 fig 6 presents the measured and calculated pullout load displacement curves it is observed that the calculated pullout load grows more quickly than the measured one at the beginning during keying and diving of the anchor the pullout load gradually increases the variation of pullout load from the centrifuge is more violent than the cel analysis probably due to the pauses of loading and ramping down ramping up of the centrifuge gaudin et al 2013 in general there is a reasonable agreement between measured and calculated curves with a mean relative error of 33 3 for the cel result 3 influential parameters and analytical cases as introduced earlier the anchor embedment depth orientation and bearing area the applied loading angle or loading direction and the soil strength are all significant parameters that contribute to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors in this section the five factors are taken into account to numerically analyze their effects on the pullout capacity property of omni max anchors in the present work the end bearing capacity factor is defined by 3 n c q b a b s u where a b denotes the effective bearing area and is defined as the sum of total projected areas of the anchor on the plane perpendicular to the loading direction which is based on the assumption that the anchor will be pulled out along the loading direction and q b is the end bearing of the anchor in the loading direction defined by 4 q b q q s w a sin θ a where q denotes the pullout capacity of the anchor in the loading direction q s α a s s u denotes the shear resistance to the anchor in the loading direction in which α is the adhesion factor and a s is the effective shear area of the anchor in the loading direction θ a is the loading angle to the horizontal at the shackle of the anchor in the present numerical modelling the shear resistance q s is not existent through setting the zero value of the frictional coefficient on the anchor clay interface the calculation of effective bearing area of the anchor under multiple factors is very important as illustrated in figs 1 and 7 the omni max anchor is designed to keep the applied loading and the loading arm always coplanar attributed to the arm s 360 omni directional ability if the applied loading is perpendicular to the anchor shaft the effective bearing area will depend on the angle of loading arm relative to fins and can be expressed by a b β a f in which a f denotes the area of the coplanar fins one head and one tail fins β 2 cos π 6 θ a r m π 3 is an angle dependent coefficient and θ arm denotes the angle of loading arm relative to the nearest fin clockwise changing just between 0 and 2π 3 due to symmetry however if the applied loading is inclined to the anchor shaft with an inclination angle θ i n c π 2 θ o θ a the effective bearing area will be reduced to a b cos θ i n c in total for the anchor under the applied loading with given values of θ i n c and θ a r m the effective bearing area can be expressed by 5 a b 2 a f cos π 6 θ a r m π 3 cos θ i n c the geometric parameters of the anchor are presented in table 1 a total of six groups of analytical cases are designed to investigate the influential parameters as listed in table 2 groups 1 6 are designed to investigate the effects of the embedment ratio the heterogeneity of soil strength the anchor orientation the loading direction and the bearing area respectively the design idea is inspired by the multi level recursive algorithm which is widely applied in the field of computer science ginat 2003 najafi et al 2011 a large complex problem can be solved by transforming it layer by layer into a number of small local problems the solution to each local problem is found by a recursive function eventually by integrating these local results the final solution to the original complex problem can be derived the soil properties for different analytical groups are collected in table 3 to enhance the applicability of the present study on the pullout capacity of omni max anchors a large range of the shear strength of clay is selected values of the shear strength gradient k vary from 0 to 3 3 kpa m covering the range of normally consolidated clay from 0 to 2 kpa m as reported by poulos 1988 the degree of soil strength heterogeneity is defined as a dimensionless ratio kb s u which changes from 0 to 0 93 covering the practical range from 0 to 0 2 liu et al 2018b as reported by kim et al 2014 the soil undrained strengths at the mudline in the campos basin gjøa field and gom were typically in the range of 2 7 kpa with the strength gradient of 1 3 kpa m thus the undrained shear strength at the mudline is set as 2 4 kpa which is a reasonable value adopted by earlier studies zhao and liu 2016 2017 liu et al 2016 2018b han et al 2018 the submerged unit weight of soil is determined as γ 7 0 kn m3 which is commonly found in offshore clays hu and randolph 1998 zhao and liu 2015 2016 liu et al 2016 in group 1 a broad range of the embedment ratio h b from 1 to 10 is investigated focusing on the effect of the embedment depth on the end bearing capacity factor only this group is analyzed on weightless soil whose results lay a foundation for subsequent investigations of other factors for example the case of the soil strength gradient k 0 in this group is regarded as a benchmark for the cases in group 2 to investigate the effect of soil strength heterogeneity the horizontal and vertical cases are designed to serve the investigation of the anchor orientation effect in group 3 more cases are designed as shallow embedment conditions than deep ones because according to a common understanding the capacity factor tends to be constant if the embedment depth is deep enough to allow a local failure to happen in group 2 the effect of the shear strength gradient k of clay is investigated by setting values from 0 to 3 3 kpa m the coupling effect of the embedment ratio and the soil strength heterogeneity is involved and studied in this group for both horizontal and vertical orientations the interactional effect is enough to be reflected by setting five levels for two factors anderson and whitcomb 2000 group 3 is designed to analyze the effect of the anchor orientation the orientation of the anchor varies between the basic cases horizontal and vertical investigated in group 2 with different soil strength gradients aiming to involve the coupling effect of the two factors less deep embedment cases are investigated in this group since the coupling effect between the embedment ratio h b and the soil strength gradient k has been well investigated in group 2 in addition the influence of anchor orientation on the pullout capacity becomes quite limited in deep embedment cases in group 4 the effect of the loading direction is investigated to build a bridge between the cases of group 4 and group 3 the angle θ inc is used to reflect different loading directions which increases from π 3 to π 3 every π 6 according to the studies shelton 2007 liu et al 2016 the pullout loading angle ranges from π 8 to 5π 18 in engineering practice which is totally covered by the range of current investigations although the cases of group 4 focus on the effect of loading direction the ranges of other factors h b k and θ o investigated in previous groups still remain to analyze the coupling effects of these factors group 5 is designed to investigate the effect of the bearing area which is reflected by varying the angle of loading arm θ a r m five representative conditions θ a r m 0 π 36 π 6 π 4 and π 3 are investigated which induce both minimum and maximum bearing areas and therefore involve different bearing mechanisms group 6 is designed as a validation group with specific cases that have not appeared in previous groups there are a total of 328 cases in the six analytical groups the average calculation for one case costs almost two days on a high performance workstation with 16 central processing unit cores 3 5 ghz 4 pullout capacity analyses of omni max anchors to derive the pullout capacity factor of omni max anchors under multiple factors a procedure is designed similar to previous investigations on the pullout capacity of plate anchors das and puri 1989 merifield et al 2003 2005 song et al 2008 yu et al 2011 bhattacharya 2016 2017 2017 singh et al 2017 liu et al 2018b the end bearing factors of omni max anchors positioned horizontally and vertically in clays of both uniform and linearly increasing strengths are analyzed first the inclination cases are regarded as the intermediate state between horizontal and vertical ones then the end bearing capacity factor for omni max anchors with different orientations can be derived the loading angle factor and bearing area factor are obtained based on the results of n c h b k θ o which can be used to construct the explicit expression of the end bearing capacity factor of omni max anchors under multiple factors 4 1 pullout capacity properties under different factors 4 1 1 effect of the embedment depth on horizontal and vertical anchors in uniform clay in this section eight values of the embedment ratio h b are assumed which cover both shallow and deep embedment cases to lay a basis for the end bearing factor of omni max anchors in clay with the strength profile linearly increasing with depth the cases in clay with a uniform strength profile are studied first as presented in table 2 group 1 the clay is assumed to be weightless and two initial orientations of anchor horizontal and vertical are adopted typical load displacement curves of the anchor at different embedment depths and orientations are shown in fig 8 in which a peak can be observed for both shallow and deep embedment cases however the peak exhibits more obviously for the horizontal anchor than the vertical anchor as introduced earlier section 2 2 the ultimate pullout capacity upc of the anchor can be easily determined through the peak value by utilizing the maximum resistance criterion the effect of the embedment ratio h b on the end bearing capacity factor for the horizontal anchor in uniform weightless clay n c h b γ k θ o 0 is illustrated in fig 9 a the calculated result indicates that when h b 2 5 the end bearing capacity factor almost tends to a constant the value increases from 10 79 in the case h b 2 5 to 11 02 in the case h b 10 when h b 2 5 the end bearing capacity factor grows quickly with increasing embedment depth the result is also fitted by a boltzmann function with a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 999 6 n c h b γ k θ o 0 10 98 7 07 1 e 2 h b 2 02 in the previous studies such as from liu et al 2018 the fitting equation of capacity factor for plate anchors was always truncated by a limited value according to some design instructions dnv 2017 which led to a gradient non continuity of the fitting curves however this approach is not taken in the present study for keeping gradient continuity of the fitting curves and thus no relevant reference value is needed for the anchor the relative errors of the results from the fitting equation to the cel calculations are all less than 1 5 similarly the effect of the embedment ratio h b on the end bearing capacity factor n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 is also investigated for the vertical anchor in uniform weightless clay as illustrated in fig 9 b the calculated result shows a good fitness with the boltzmann function reaching a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 999 7 n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 11 25 4 62 1 e 3 3 h b 3 63 the expressions of n c h b γ k θ o 0 and n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 are prepared for further estimation of the end bearing capacity factor under more influential parameters 4 1 2 effect of the linear clay strength on horizontal and vertical anchors based on the results of the previous section the end bearing capacity factor of the anchor which is positioned horizontally or vertically in clay with the strength profile linearly increasing with depth under normal gravity is analyzed in this section as presented in table 2 group 2 in this section the degree of soil strength heterogeneity is defined as a dimensionless ratio k b s u the factor s k which represents the effect of the gradient of the linear clay strength is defined as 8 s k n c h b k θ o 0 n c h b γ k θ o 0 θ o 0 n c h b k θ o π 2 n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 θ o π 2 where n c h b k θ o 0 and n c h b k θ o π 2 denote the end bearing capacity factors of horizontal and vertical anchors respectively in clay with the general undrained shear strength profile s u s u 0 k z in which s u 0 is the shear strength at the seafloor k is the gradient of shear strength and z is the soil depth and n c h b γ k θ o 0 and n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 are expressed by eq 6 and eq 7 respectively the purpose of eq 8 is to construct a bridge between the end bearing capacity factors in clay with a linear strength and the end bearing capacity factors in uniform weightless clay fig 10 illustrates typical distributions of equivalent plastic strain and movement of soil for the horizontally placed anchor which are beneficial to understand the failure surface of soil and bearing mechanism of the anchor it is observed that the failure surface of shallow embedment cases expands to the soil surface fig 10 a while a local failure is evident for deep embedment cases fig 10 b when the anchor is pulled out the soil around the anchor flows overall to the soil surface with an obvious cavity formed below the anchor bottom for shallow embedment cases fig 10 c while it flows around the anchor without an evident cavity for deep embedment cases fig 10 d fig 11 shows the relationship between the degree of soil strength heterogeneity k b s u and the factor s k for the horizontal anchor it is observed that the change of s k with k b s u is quite different between the shallow embedment cases and the deep ones with the increase of embedment ratio h b the value of k b s u varies in a smaller range especially when it is smaller than 0 4 the increase of k has little effect on the degree of heterogeneity k b s u then the influence of k b s u on the value of s k also becomes smaller furthermore the end bearing capacity factor decreases with increasing value of k fig 12 illustrates the relationship between k b s u and s k for the vertical anchor it is observed that in the shallow embedment cases the influence of the degree of heterogeneity k b s u on s k is smaller than that of the horizontal anchor for the horizontal anchor it is quite reasonable because the fluke surface of the anchor directly bears the weight of the soil that moved by pullout cutting of the anchor whereas the shape and the volume of moved soil depend on the strength of clay which is determined by the gradient k to a great extent the strength heterogeneity factor s k for horizontal and vertical anchors can be fitted by the following expressions with values of r 2 of 0 994 and 0 966 respectively 9 s k c 1 h b 3 c 2 h b 2 c 3 h b c 4 c 5 γ h s u k b s u c 6 c 7 γ h s u c 8 θ o 0 c 1 h b 3 c 2 h b 2 c 3 h b c 4 k b s u c 5 γ h s u c 6 c 7 γ h s u c 8 θ o π 2 where c 1 c 8 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the horizontal or vertical anchor conditions as listed in table 4 the mean relative errors of s k estimated by eq 9 for horizontal and vertical anchors are 1 96 and 2 55 respectively then according to eq 8 by combining the strength heterogeneity factor s k with the end bearing capacity factors n c h b γ k θ o 0 and n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 the end bearing capacity factors n c h b k θ o 0 and n c h b k θ o π 2 can be obtained for horizontal and vertical anchors in clay with the strength profile linearly increasing with depth 4 1 3 effect of the anchor orientation this section aims to obtain an estimation equation for the end bearing capacity factor of inclined anchors with different orientations the cel analyses on the anchors of different orientations are performed first as presented in table 2 group 3 then the estimation equation is developed on the basis of the capacity factors for horizontal and vertical anchors fig 13 presents the end bearing capacity factors of the anchor with different orientations in the clay of various strength gradients it is observed that the anchor orientation has more influence on the shallow embedment cases than the deep ones the end bearing capacity factor of inclined anchors can be regarded as the intermediate state of horizontal and vertical anchors thus both the end bearing capacity factors n c h b k θ o 0 and n c h b k θ o π 2 derived in the previous section are introduced by further utilizing eq 8 to construct the estimation equations as 10 n c h b k θ o s k θ o 0 n c h b γ k θ o 0 1 2 θ o π s k θ o π 2 n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 2 θ o π c 1 c 2 k b s u 0 2 c 3 h b c 4 θ o c 5 θ o c 6 c 7 γ h s u 0 5 2 θ o π 2 θ o π 2 where c 1 c 7 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the embedment ratio h b as listed in table 4 comparing with the cel solution eq 10 reaches the value of r 2 of 0 972 if θ o 0 or π 2 according to eq 10 n c h b k θ o degenerates to n c h b k θ o 0 or n c h b k θ o π 2 which can be derived through eqs 6 9 4 1 4 effect of the loading angle in this section the effect of the loading angle is analyzed through the cases of group 4 where the angle of loading arm is assumed to be zero i e θ a r m 0 thus these cases can also lay a basis for further analyses of the effect of loading arm angle for the case θ a r m 0 the effective projected area a b is still adopted as 3 a f rather than 3 a f cos θ i n c to obtain more uniform nondimensionalized results the loading angle factor s i n c is introduced to reflect the effect of the loading angle which is defined by 11 s i n c n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 where n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 denotes the end bearing capacity factor of the inclined anchor under the loading direction perpendicular to the anchor shaft and the loading arm angle of zero n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 denotes the end bearing capacity factor of the inclined anchor under the loading arm angle of zero actually n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 is identical to the previously derived n c h b k θ o expressed by eq 10 eq 11 constructs a bridge between n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 and n c h b k θ o fig 14 shows the results of the loading angle factor s i n c derived from the simulation cases of group 4 as listed in table 2 the value of s i n c decreases when the angle θ i n c deviates from 0 when the orientation angle θ o rises the soil shear strength gradient k creates a larger effect on the loading angle factor s i n c especially in relatively shallow embedment cases h b 1 2 the end bearing resistance force of the anchor decreases with the angle θ i n c deviating from 0 this contributes to the effect of the loading angle that the end bearing capacity increases with the increase of the effective bearing area when θ i n c 0 it indicates the loading direction inclined to the head of the anchor while when θ i n c 0 it indicates the loading direction inclined to the tail of the anchor due to the asymmetry of the head and tail of the anchor the results of s i n c change in different patterns based on the calculation results of s i n c in group 4 the estimation equation of s i n c is constructed as 12 s i n c 1 c 1 k b s u 1 c 2 c 3 θ o h b c 4 k b s u 1 c 2 c 5 e h b c 6 h b c 7 1 c o s θ i n c where c 1 c 7 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the positive or negative values of θ i n c as listed in table 4 eq 12 reaches a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 961 by combing eqs 11 and 12 the end bearing capacity factor n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 can be predicted by s i n c n c h b k θ 0 θ i n c θ a r m 0 4 1 5 effect of the bearing area the bearing area is a significant factor to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors while few investigators paid attention to it for example most of the researchers only considered the case of the loading arm parallel to one group of coplanar fins of the omni max anchor i e θ a r m 0 this reduced the pullout problem to a simple symmetric problem about the loading plane liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 han et al 2018 in fact the bearing area directly relates to the bearing mechanism of the anchor due to the complicated three dimensional structure different bearing areas would cause different bearing mechanisms which remain great uncertainties in knowledge the difference in bearing mechanisms has a significant effect on the pullout capacity of the anchor in this section the effect of the bearing area is analyzed based on the calculation results of group 5 as listed in table 2 the effect of bearing area is represented by the factor s a r m defined by 13 s a r m n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 where n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 denotes the end bearing capacity factor of the inclined anchor under the loading arm angle of zero n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m denotes the end bearing capacity factor of the inclined anchor taking into account all the factors h b k θ o θ i n c and θ a r m n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 has been derived in the previous section fig 15 shows the values of bearing area factor s a r m with various loading angles and embedment ratios in clay with k 1 1 kpa m and k 3 3 kpa m which indicate that the effective bearing area a b has significant effects on the end bearing capacity factor the factor s a r m changes in a large range when the anchor is positioned at various depths in general the effect of the soil strength gradient k has little influence on the bearing area factor it is observed that the positive or negative values of θ inc make the bearing area factor s a r m quite different patterns especially in shallow embedment cases h b 2 based on the calculation results of s a r m the estimation equation of s a r m is constructed as 14 s a r m 1 c 1 h b θ a r m c 2 10 c 3 k b s u h b θ a r m c 4 cos θ o c 5 θ a r m c 6 8 c 7 k b s u cos 2 θ o c 8 c 9 θ i n c θ a r m θ a r m 0 017 where c 1 c 9 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the condition of the embedment ratio h b as listed in table 4 eq 14 reaches a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 933 through eqs 13 and 14 the end bearing capacity factor n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m can be directly derived 4 2 the explicit expression of end bearing capacity factor under multiple factors since the effects of all influential parameters have been derived by sequently utilizing eqs 10 11 and 13 and combing eqs 6 7 9 12 and 14 an explicit set of equations for calculating the end bearing capacity factor under multiple factors can be obtained 15 n c n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m s a r m

calculated note that the coefficients c 1 c 7 in the first equation can be found in table 4 for calculating n c h b k θ o eq 10 the coefficients c 1 c 9 in the second equation for calculating s a r m can be found in table 4 eq 14 the coefficients c 1 c 7 in the third equation for calculating θ i n c can be found in table 4 eq 12 and the coefficients c 1 c 8 in the fourth equation for calculating s k can be found in table 4 eq 9 by utilizing eqs 3 and 4 the pullout capacity of the anchor can also be easily obtained 4 2 1 validation by orthogonal tests the orthogonal test is a design method that studies multiple factors and levels it is an efficient rapid and economical test method whose results can basically reflect the whole picture of full factorial design in this section a series of orthogonal tests are employed to verify the accuracy of the explicit expression in predicting the end bearing capacity factor the orthogonal test is based on the orthogonal arrays oas of l 16 45 which suit five parameters with four levels as presented in table 5 through the application of oas accompanied by either table of interactions between two columns designing tests can be relatively simple this is the reason for the wide acceptance of taguchi s methodology bush 1952 bullington et al 1990 four different loading angles are set as θ a π 8 8π 45 17π 75 and 5π 18 based on the engineering practice suggested by shelton 2007 the orientation angle θ o increases from 0 to π 2 every π 6 to cover all the potential positions of the anchor also four different levels of θ a r m are set to verify the effect of the bearing area factor on the accuracy of the equations the cases of group 6 in table 2 are also utilized to verify the estimation equations for a wider range of parameters and uncalculated combination conditions of which the analytical results are presented in fig 16 together with the results of the orthogonal tests the mean relative error of predictions is 6 67 from a total of 28 cases and 19 cases are within the relative error of 10 4 2 2 validation by all groups all the cases of groups 1 6 in table 2 are selected to compare the predictions from the explicit expression with the cel numerical results as illustrated in fig 16 the mean relative error of predictions is 7 28 from a total of 328 cases and 302 cases are within the relative error of 10 4 2 3 validation by published data in this section all available data of omni max anchors from publications wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 han et al 2018 tian et al 2018 are collected to examine the applicability of the developed explicit equation i e eq 15 as listed in table 6 for details all the anchor geometric parameters the embedment conditions and the soil strength profiles were provided by these investigations it is then not difficult to obtain values of the input parameters in the explicit equation i e h b γ k s u θ o θ i n c and θ a r m wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 han et al 2018 and tian et al 2018 presented the pullout capacity factors which can be used to calculate the maximum resistance force then all the maximum capacity values in the above investigations are transformed into the end bearing capacity factors according to eqs 3 and 4 in calculating the shear force the value of adhesion factor α is set as 0 3 since liu et al 2016 and han et al 2018 provided the sidewall sliding capacity factor it is used to directly calculate the shear force the end bearing capacity is derived by subtracting the shear force and the effect of anchor self weight from the total capacity according to eq 4 it is observed from table 6 that the explicit expression predicts well for the omni max anchor with a mean relative error of 8 07 from 8 cases 5 concluding remarks by performing large deformation finite element analyses with the cel technique the complicated pullout capacity property of omni max anchors in clay under multiple factors including the anchor embedment depth the anchor orientation the bearing area the loading angle and the soil property are investigated systematically the effects of different influential parameters are acquired and quantified based on which an explicit expression of the end bearing capacity factor for omni max anchors is finally formulated in terms of multiple factors the orthogonal tests and available published data confirm the effectiveness and applicability of the developed expression some remarks on using the developed expression i e eq 15 are summarized as follows 1 the present explicit expression is easier in usage without requirement of any extra calculation procedure and can quickly produce the result to obtain the end bearing capacity factor just substitute values of the five parameters h b s u θ o θ i n c and θ a r m into this expression the effects of different parameters as well as the quantified expression indicate that to exactly evaluate the end bearing and pullout capacity of omni max anchors values of the five influential parameters h b s u θ o θ i n c and θ a r m must be determined in advance 2 in practice it is not easy to obtain exact values of the five parameters especially the three angles θ o θ i n c and θ a r m however by performing sensitivity analyses of the parameters effects of the five parameters on the end bearing and pullout capacity of anchors can be quantified through the present expression this is helpful to analyze the possible working performance of the anchors under complicated conditions and thus meaningful to engineering application and safety control of mooring systems 3 the application of the present expression is not only limited to calculating and analyzing the end bearing and pullout capacity of omni max anchors the anchors may exhibit comprehensive kinematic behaviors under complicated loading and seabed conditions such as keying pulling out and diving which would arise depending on the specific force components such as the shear force and the end bearing acting on the anchor since the present expression can be used to calculate the end bearing shear force and pullout capacity of anchors and takes into account complicated influential parameters it is expected to play an important role in analyzing comprehensive kinematic behaviors of omni max anchors in the seabed credit authorship contribution statement yancheng yang

20777,being an impressive representative of gravity installed anchors gias the omni max anchor has many attractive attributes and becomes more and more a conspicuous role in recent deepwater applications however the pullout capacity property of omni max anchors has not been well understood due to their three dimensional structure and the loading way in variational seabed conditions full

free fall to penetrate into the seabed and thus obtains the bearing capacity to withstand the pullout loading although the omni max anchor has been proven an efficient and economical solution to anchoring floating facilities in deep waters shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 the pullout capacity property has not been fully explored due to their three dimensional structure and the loading way in variational seabed conditions full knowledge of the pullout capacity property is beneficial to understand not only the working performance but also the comprehensive kinematic behaviors of omni max anchors such as keying and diving for anchors under excessive loading earlier studies on the pullout capacity of omni max anchors mainly include 1 g or centrifuge laboratory experiments shelton 2007 gaudin et al 2013 liu et al 2018a field tests shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 and small strain or large deformation numerical modeling liu et al 2014b 2016 wei et al 2015 kim and hossain 2017 han et al 2018 tian et al 2018 zhao and liu 2018 however the earlier studies only involved the cases with limited influential parameters from which the effects of the influential parameters could be assessed under specific conditions but cannot be extended generally to quantitative analytical results in practice omni max anchors may be embedded in the seabed with different soil properties at different orientations and depths while the applied loading direction to the anchor may also be variational which induces different bearing areas and therefore different pullout capacities of the anchor the designed 360 omni directional loading arm may produce different bearing areas at a specific loading angle varying between the maximum and minimum values if the loading angle changes the problem becomes more complicated and various bearing areas will be induced in such complicated conditions to accurately evaluate the pullout capacity of the anchor is not an easy task the anchor embedment depth orientation and bearing area the applied loading angle and the soil strength will all be significant factors that contribute to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors however it still lacks an in depth study that focuses on the pullout capacity of omni max anchors under multiple factors theoretically the pullout capacity of gias embedded in clay is contributed by the end bearing the shear force and the self weight of the anchor in which the shear force and the self weight only play insignificant roles while the end bearing contributes most to the pullout capacity about 65 95 of the total based on the statistical analysis of available published data medeiros 2002 de aguiar et al 2009 wang and o loughlin 2014 o beirne et al 2015 wei et al 2015 kim and hossain 2016 liu et al 2016 fu et al 2017 han et al 2018 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and present numerous numerical results on the other hand there are more uncertainties in determining the value of end bearing capacity factor n c to empirically calculate the end bearing rather than in determining the value of adhesion factor α to empirically calculate the shear force since the value of n c may vary in a large range such as 7 6 11 87 for plate anchors peng and liu 2019 while the value of α generally varies in a small range such as 0 3 0 5 for plate anchors murff et al 2005 liu et al 2012 peng and liu 2019 this is why investigating the end bearing is more important and challenging for investigating the pullout capacity of omni max anchors the omni max anchor may exhibit comprehensive behaviors in the seabed including keying diving and pulling out peng and liu 2019 full knowledge of the end bearing is helpful to accurately describe and understand the comprehensive behaviors of omni max anchors in the seabed the present work aims to investigate the complicated pullout capacity property of omni max anchors in clay under multiple factors including the anchor embedment depth the anchor orientation the bearing area the loading angle and the soil property large deformation finite element ldfe analyses are performed using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique which has been well applied to analyze the bearing capacity and kinematic behaviors of anchors liu et al 2014b zhao and liu 2015 2017 numerous cases of multiple factors are designed and analyzed to acquire the effects of different influential parameters an explicit expression of the end bearing capacity factor of omni max anchors is finally formulated in terms of multiple factors whose effectiveness and applicability are examined by orthogonal tests and available published data this expression is expected to be conveniently utilized to evaluate the pullout capacity of omni max anchors under complicated conditions 2 numerical modeling techniques 2 1 numerical model 2 1 1 cel model the concept of cel was introduced by noh 1964 and improved by benson 1992 in decades the cel technique was extensively employed to solve geotechnical problems involving large deformations zhao and liu 2016 adopted the cel approach to study the comprehensive behaviors of deepwater anchors the accuracy of the cel technique was demonstrated effective and efficient in solving quasi static problems in the present work the same technique is employed on the platform of the software abaqus explicit to obtain the finite element solution to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors compared to the small strain analyses the large deformation analyses can produce a complete load displacement response curve chatterjee et al 2014 and then rationally determine the ultimate pullout capacity upc of anchors which is an important index in designing and analyzing anchors and can be deterministically obtained from the maximum resistance criterion liu et al 2014a the definition of the pullout problem for omni max anchors is illustrated in fig 1 the anchor is embedded in the seabed at the depth h and orientation θ o under the applied loading with the loading angle θ a where θ o denotes the angle of anchor shaft to the horizontal and θ a denotes the angle of applied loading to the horizontal at the anchor shackle the cel model is built to analyze the pullout capacity of the omni max anchor under various conditions an explicit time integration scheme is adopted in the model for elastic materials the calculation stability is assured by introducing a critical increment in time step i e δ t critical min l e c d where l e is the dimension of characteristic element and c d is the dilatational wave speed of the material the flow of eulerian material among meshes is traced by calculating its eulerian volume fraction evf the nodes of elements are fixed in the space and do not follow the material movement a void layer is set upon the surface of the soil to guarantee the free flow of clay the saturated clay under undrained conditions is regarded as an elastic perfectly plastic material obeying the tresca yield criterion the geostatic stress is created by setting the coefficient of earth pressure k 0 1 both the soil and the void layer above the mudline are established by ec3d8r elements the elastic behavior is defined by young s modulus e of 500 s u and poisson s ratio μ of 0 49 where s u denotes the undrained shear strength of clay the effective soil unit weight γ is set as 7 kn m3 the user subroutine vusdfld is applied to achieve a linear strength distribution of clay where a field variable needs to be defined the field variable is associated with the undrained shear strength of clay whose initial value is set as the soil depth the field variable is updated by the subroutine code so that the soil strength with the material flow can be described during the anchor pullout process liu et al 2014a the omni max anchor is constructed as a rigid body throughout the simulation whose details are summarized in table 1 a general contact with the hard contact method is used to describe the contact between eulerian and lagrangian materials the frictional coefficient μ 0 on the interface of anchor clay is set zero for getting pure end bearing resistance the cel model is illustrated in fig 2 where l b c b and d b are the length the half width and the distance from the anchor bottom to the model bottom respectively h is the embedment depth from the anchor centroid to the seafloor h v is the height of the void layer d p is the effective diameter of anchor w f is the width of the fluke t f is the thickness of the fluke l h f denotes the length of head fluke l t f denotes the length of tail fluke l r denotes the length of loading ring l s denotes the length of anchor shaft due to complicated structural edges of the omni max anchor fine meshes have to be generated around the anchor as illustrated in fig 2 the domain scale of the model will be introduced in the following section 2 1 2 convergence study to balance the accuracy against computational efficiency a convergence study is conducted on the domain scale the mesh size and the pullout rate of the anchor the omni max anchor is positioned horizontally and applied by an upward load in weightless uniform soil with s u 2 4 kpa the scale of the model domain is investigated at first two values of embedment depth h b 1 and 3 are probed to examine the boundary effect at different embedment depths the comparative study proves that when l b b 6 c b b 3 3 and d b b 3 where b denotes the anchor length the model boundary effect can almost be eliminated it is noteworthy that the distance between the anchor and the boundary in the anchor axial direction is always guaranteed larger than 3b to avoid the boundary effect for the inclined anchor cases the minimum size of meshing is also investigated the ratio b a ranging from 45 to 113 and the ratio b a ranging from 1 to 4 are examined in detail where a and b are the mesh lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively according to the comparative results the mean relative error is 1 99 between the results of b a 85 and b a 101 while is 1 37 between the results of b a 101 and b a 113 the mean relative error is 2 41 between the results of b a 1 5 and b a 2 while is 2 02 between the results of b a 1 and b a 1 5 from the viewpoint of acceptable convergence the values b a 101 and b a 1 5 are finally determined to build the models in the subsequent study then a series of cases focusing on the pullout velocity are performed to guarantee the whole pullout process as a quasi static loading according to the comparative results as illustrated in fig 3 the end bearing factor tends to be convergent when the pullout velocity is smaller than 0 05 m s the mean relative error of the curve of 0 03 m s to that of 0 02 m s is 1 58 eventually the velocity of 0 03 m s is determined for the subsequent analyses 2 2 the criterion for determining the upc the upc is an important index in designing and analyzing anchors there are several criteria to determine the upc of anchors based on numerically obtained load displacement curves generally including the plateau criterion o neill et al 2003 yang et al 2010 sahoo and kumar 2014 the linearly increasing criterion neely et al 1973 the function fitting criterion hanna et al 2007 the double tangent intersection criterion boushehrian et al 2009 the specified displacement criterion vesic 1973 the k4 criterion rowe and davis 1982 and the maximum resistance criterion wang et al 2010 liu et al 2014a liu et al 2014a reviewed all the criteria above for determining the upc and proposed three rules to conform to a rational criterion the first a deterministic value of upc can be obtained by using the criterion the second the criterion must be rational which means that it implies clear and right physical meaning the third the criterion can be generally applied the ldfe technique with the maximum resistance criterion to determine the upc was successfully applied to plate anchors in clay by liu et al 2014a utilizing this criterion the value of upc can be derived from ldfe analyses easily and uniquely in the present work the maximum resistance criterion is adopted to acquire the upc of omni max anchors in clay 2 3 validation 2 3 1 plate anchor a series of pullout cases on the horizontally placed plate anchor are analyzed to examine the reliability and accuracy of the cel model by comparing with corresponding centrifuge tests chen et al 2016 the square plate anchor has the width of 4 m and the thickness of 0 2 m three cases with different embedment ratios of h b 0 54 1 05 and 2 86 are calculated with a pullout velocity of 0 1 m s the size of the minimum element and the scale of soil domain are set the same as those presented by liu et al 2014a which were demonstrated adequately to achieve a convergent result and are not repeated here the clay has an undrained shear strength of s u 1 34z kpa the young s modulus e 500 s u is adopted while the poisson s ratio μ is taken as 0 49 the submerged weight of soil is 6 07 kn m3 the frictional coefficient μ 0 is set zero to simulate the immediate breakaway condition between anchor and soil in the centrifuge tests the comparative results are presented in fig 4 in which d b denotes the normalized anchor displacement and q 0 a s u denotes the normalized net pullout capacity where b is the width and a is the bearing area of the plate anchor and s u is the soil strength at the initial depth of the anchor centroid the net pullout capacity q 0 is calculated by 1 q 0 q q s s w a where q is the vertical pullout capacity of the plate anchor w a is the submerged weight of the anchor and q s s denotes the soil suction and the shear force due to the immediate breakaway condition between anchor and soil employed in the centrifuge tests the term q ss can be overlooked then q 0 is simplified to 2 q 0 q w a fig 4 demonstrates that the cel model can well reflect the evolution of pullout capacity under various initial embedment depths when the anchor is pulled by the applied loading the load increases to the peak quickly and then decreases gradually the numerical curves are generally consistent with the measured ones note that the numerical peaks which represent the normalized values of upc of the anchor occur at almost the same depths as those of experiments with the relative errors of 0 69 0 65 and 1 64 for h b 0 54 1 05 and 2 86 respectively the comparative results confirm not only the ability of the cel model but also the maximum resistance criterion for determining the upc of plate anchors 2 3 2 deep penetration anchor dpa as a validation for capacity analyses of anchors with a three dimensional structure a prototype cel model is undertaken to validate against the centrifuge test on the dpa under 200g condition performed by richardson 2008 as illustrated in fig 5 a the length b and diameter d of the dpa are 15m and 1 2m respectively the anchor has four flukes separated by 90 in plane whose width w f and thickness t f are 1 8m and 0 2m respectively the embedment depth of the anchor is 21 4m the dry weight of the dpa is 753 41 kn the soil has an effective unit weight of 6 5 kn m3 with the undrained shear strength s u 0 0037z 2 0 959z kpa in the cel analysis the domain scale and the minimum size of the meshes reference the results in the convergence study of omni max anchors i e the values l b b 6 c b b 3 3 d b b 3 b a 101 and b a 1 5 the young s modulus e 500 s u is adopted while the poisson s ratio μ is taken as 0 49 the soil anchor interface is modeled as frictional contact by coulomb friction law in which the frictional factor μ 0 is set as 0 02 corresponding to the value of 0 4 for the adhesion factor α reported by richardson 2008 a quasi static pullout velocity of 0 01 m s is applied which has been investigated to ensure a convergent result fig 5 b shows the measured and calculated pullout load displacement curves it is observed that the values of upc from the cel analysis and the centrifuge test are very close with the relative error of 4 38 this confirms the effectiveness and accuracy of the cel model in deriving the upc of anchors 2 3 3 omni max anchor gaudin et al 2013 presented a centrifuge test of the omni max anchor being pulled out under an acceleration of 200g where the adopted kaolin clay had an undrained shear strength s u 3 1 1z kpa the cel analysis is conducted to validate against the test result the anchor line effects are incorporated by a chain equation zhao and liu 2017 with the user subroutine vuamp in which the cable diameter is set as 0 2m and the pullout angle at mudline is horizontal according to the centrifuge test conditions the control velocity at the mudline is set as 0 03 m s according to the previous study of quasi static velocity the young s modulus e 500 s u is adopted while the poisson s ratio μ is taken as 0 49 the interface frictional factor μ 0 is set as 0 04 corresponding to the value of 0 4 for the adhesion factor α as reported by gaudin et al 2013 fig 6 presents the measured and calculated pullout load displacement curves it is observed that the calculated pullout load grows more quickly than the measured one at the beginning during keying and diving of the anchor the pullout load gradually increases the variation of pullout load from the centrifuge is more violent than the cel analysis probably due to the pauses of loading and ramping down ramping up of the centrifuge gaudin et al 2013 in general there is a reasonable agreement between measured and calculated curves with a mean relative error of 33 3 for the cel result 3 influential parameters and analytical cases as introduced earlier the anchor embedment depth orientation and bearing area the applied loading angle or loading direction and the soil strength are all significant parameters that contribute to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors in this section the five factors are taken into account to numerically analyze their effects on the pullout capacity property of omni max anchors in the present work the end bearing capacity factor is defined by 3 n c q b a b s u where a b denotes the effective bearing area and is defined as the sum of total projected areas of the anchor on the plane perpendicular to the loading direction which is based on the assumption that the anchor will be pulled out along the loading direction and q b is the end bearing of the anchor in the loading direction defined by 4 q b q q s w a sin θ a where q denotes the pullout capacity of the anchor in the loading direction q s α a s s u denotes the shear resistance to the anchor in the loading direction in which α is the adhesion factor and a s is the effective shear area of the anchor in the loading direction θ a is the loading angle to the horizontal at the shackle of the anchor in the present numerical modelling the shear resistance q s is not existent through setting the zero value of the frictional coefficient on the anchor clay interface the calculation of effective bearing area of the anchor under multiple factors is very important as illustrated in figs 1 and 7 the omni max anchor is designed to keep the applied loading and the loading arm always coplanar attributed to the arm s 360 omni directional ability if the applied loading is perpendicular to the anchor shaft the effective bearing area will depend on the angle of loading arm relative to fins and can be expressed by a b β a f in which a f denotes the area of the coplanar fins one head and one tail fins β 2 cos π 6 θ a r m π 3 is an angle dependent coefficient and θ arm denotes the angle of loading arm relative to the nearest fin clockwise changing just between 0 and 2π 3 due to symmetry however if the applied loading is inclined to the anchor shaft with an inclination angle θ i n c π 2 θ o θ a the effective bearing area will be reduced to a b cos θ i n c in total for the anchor under the applied loading with given values of θ i n c and θ a r m the effective bearing area can be expressed by 5 a b 2 a f cos π 6 θ a r m π 3 cos θ i n c the geometric parameters of the anchor are presented in table 1 a total of six groups of analytical cases are designed to investigate the influential parameters as listed in table 2 groups 1 6 are designed to investigate the effects of the embedment ratio the heterogeneity of soil strength the anchor orientation the loading direction and the bearing area respectively the design idea is inspired by the multi level recursive algorithm which is widely applied in the field of computer science ginat 2003 najafi et al 2011 a large complex problem can be solved by transforming it layer by layer into a number of small local problems the solution to each local problem is found by a recursive function eventually by integrating these local results the final solution to the original complex problem can be derived the soil properties for different analytical groups are collected in table 3 to enhance the applicability of the present study on the pullout capacity of omni max anchors a large range of the shear strength of clay is selected values of the shear strength gradient k vary from 0 to 3 3 kpa m covering the range of normally consolidated clay from 0 to 2 kpa m as reported by poulos 1988 the degree of soil strength heterogeneity is defined as a dimensionless ratio kb s u which changes from 0 to 0 93 covering the practical range from 0 to 0 2 liu et al 2018b as reported by kim et al 2014 the soil undrained strengths at the mudline in the campos basin gjøa field and gom were typically in the range of 2 7 kpa with the strength gradient of 1 3 kpa m thus the undrained shear strength at the mudline is set as 2 4 kpa which is a reasonable value adopted by earlier studies zhao and liu 2016 2017 liu et al 2016 2018b han et al 2018 the submerged unit weight of soil is determined as γ 7 0 kn m3 which is commonly found in offshore clays hu and randolph 1998 zhao and liu 2015 2016 liu et al 2016 in group 1 a broad range of the embedment ratio h b from 1 to 10 is investigated focusing on the effect of the embedment depth on the end bearing capacity factor only this group is analyzed on weightless soil whose results lay a foundation for subsequent investigations of other factors for example the case of the soil strength gradient k 0 in this group is regarded as a benchmark for the cases in group 2 to investigate the effect of soil strength heterogeneity the horizontal and vertical cases are designed to serve the investigation of the anchor orientation effect in group 3 more cases are designed as shallow embedment conditions than deep ones because according to a common understanding the capacity factor tends to be constant if the embedment depth is deep enough to allow a local failure to happen in group 2 the effect of the shear strength gradient k of clay is investigated by setting values from 0 to 3 3 kpa m the coupling effect of the embedment ratio and the soil strength heterogeneity is involved and studied in this group for both horizontal and vertical orientations the interactional effect is enough to be reflected by setting five levels for two factors anderson and whitcomb 2000 group 3 is designed to analyze the effect of the anchor orientation the orientation of the anchor varies between the basic cases horizontal and vertical investigated in group 2 with different soil strength gradients aiming to involve the coupling effect of the two factors less deep embedment cases are investigated in this group since the coupling effect between the embedment ratio h b and the soil strength gradient k has been well investigated in group 2 in addition the influence of anchor orientation on the pullout capacity becomes quite limited in deep embedment cases in group 4 the effect of the loading direction is investigated to build a bridge between the cases of group 4 and group 3 the angle θ inc is used to reflect different loading directions which increases from π 3 to π 3 every π 6 according to the studies shelton 2007 liu et al 2016 the pullout loading angle ranges from π 8 to 5π 18 in engineering practice which is totally covered by the range of current investigations although the cases of group 4 focus on the effect of loading direction the ranges of other factors h b k and θ o investigated in previous groups still remain to analyze the coupling effects of these factors group 5 is designed to investigate the effect of the bearing area which is reflected by varying the angle of loading arm θ a r m five representative conditions θ a r m 0 π 36 π 6 π 4 and π 3 are investigated which induce both minimum and maximum bearing areas and therefore involve different bearing mechanisms group 6 is designed as a validation group with specific cases that have not appeared in previous groups there are a total of 328 cases in the six analytical groups the average calculation for one case costs almost two days on a high performance workstation with 16 central processing unit cores 3 5 ghz 4 pullout capacity analyses of omni max anchors to derive the pullout capacity factor of omni max anchors under multiple factors a procedure is designed similar to previous investigations on the pullout capacity of plate anchors das and puri 1989 merifield et al 2003 2005 song et al 2008 yu et al 2011 bhattacharya 2016 2017 2017 singh et al 2017 liu et al 2018b the end bearing factors of omni max anchors positioned horizontally and vertically in clays of both uniform and linearly increasing strengths are analyzed first the inclination cases are regarded as the intermediate state between horizontal and vertical ones then the end bearing capacity factor for omni max anchors with different orientations can be derived the loading angle factor and bearing area factor are obtained based on the results of n c h b k θ o which can be used to construct the explicit expression of the end bearing capacity factor of omni max anchors under multiple factors 4 1 pullout capacity properties under different factors 4 1 1 effect of the embedment depth on horizontal and vertical anchors in uniform clay in this section eight values of the embedment ratio h b are assumed which cover both shallow and deep embedment cases to lay a basis for the end bearing factor of omni max anchors in clay with the strength profile linearly increasing with depth the cases in clay with a uniform strength profile are studied first as presented in table 2 group 1 the clay is assumed to be weightless and two initial orientations of anchor horizontal and vertical are adopted typical load displacement curves of the anchor at different embedment depths and orientations are shown in fig 8 in which a peak can be observed for both shallow and deep embedment cases however the peak exhibits more obviously for the horizontal anchor than the vertical anchor as introduced earlier section 2 2 the ultimate pullout capacity upc of the anchor can be easily determined through the peak value by utilizing the maximum resistance criterion the effect of the embedment ratio h b on the end bearing capacity factor for the horizontal anchor in uniform weightless clay n c h b γ k θ o 0 is illustrated in fig 9 a the calculated result indicates that when h b 2 5 the end bearing capacity factor almost tends to a constant the value increases from 10 79 in the case h b 2 5 to 11 02 in the case h b 10 when h b 2 5 the end bearing capacity factor grows quickly with increasing embedment depth the result is also fitted by a boltzmann function with a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 999 6 n c h b γ k θ o 0 10 98 7 07 1 e 2 h b 2 02 in the previous studies such as from liu et al 2018 the fitting equation of capacity factor for plate anchors was always truncated by a limited value according to some design instructions dnv 2017 which led to a gradient non continuity of the fitting curves however this approach is not taken in the present study for keeping gradient continuity of the fitting curves and thus no relevant reference value is needed for the anchor the relative errors of the results from the fitting equation to the cel calculations are all less than 1 5 similarly the effect of the embedment ratio h b on the end bearing capacity factor n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 is also investigated for the vertical anchor in uniform weightless clay as illustrated in fig 9 b the calculated result shows a good fitness with the boltzmann function reaching a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 999 7 n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 11 25 4 62 1 e 3 3 h b 3 63 the expressions of n c h b γ k θ o 0 and n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 are prepared for further estimation of the end bearing capacity factor under more influential parameters 4 1 2 effect of the linear clay strength on horizontal and vertical anchors based on the results of the previous section the end bearing capacity factor of the anchor which is positioned horizontally or vertically in clay with the strength profile linearly increasing with depth under normal gravity is analyzed in this section as presented in table 2 group 2 in this section the degree of soil strength heterogeneity is defined as a dimensionless ratio k b s u the factor s k which represents the effect of the gradient of the linear clay strength is defined as 8 s k n c h b k θ o 0 n c h b γ k θ o 0 θ o 0 n c h b k θ o π 2 n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 θ o π 2 where n c h b k θ o 0 and n c h b k θ o π 2 denote the end bearing capacity factors of horizontal and vertical anchors respectively in clay with the general undrained shear strength profile s u s u 0 k z in which s u 0 is the shear strength at the seafloor k is the gradient of shear strength and z is the soil depth and n c h b γ k θ o 0 and n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 are expressed by eq 6 and eq 7 respectively the purpose of eq 8 is to construct a bridge between the end bearing capacity factors in clay with a linear strength and the end bearing capacity factors in uniform weightless clay fig 10 illustrates typical distributions of equivalent plastic strain and movement of soil for the horizontally placed anchor which are beneficial to understand the failure surface of soil and bearing mechanism of the anchor it is observed that the failure surface of shallow embedment cases expands to the soil surface fig 10 a while a local failure is evident for deep embedment cases fig 10 b when the anchor is pulled out the soil around the anchor flows overall to the soil surface with an obvious cavity formed below the anchor bottom for shallow embedment cases fig 10 c while it flows around the anchor without an evident cavity for deep embedment cases fig 10 d fig 11 shows the relationship between the degree of soil strength heterogeneity k b s u and the factor s k for the horizontal anchor it is observed that the change of s k with k b s u is quite different between the shallow embedment cases and the deep ones with the increase of embedment ratio h b the value of k b s u varies in a smaller range especially when it is smaller than 0 4 the increase of k has little effect on the degree of heterogeneity k b s u then the influence of k b s u on the value of s k also becomes smaller furthermore the end bearing capacity factor decreases with increasing value of k fig 12 illustrates the relationship between k b s u and s k for the vertical anchor it is observed that in the shallow embedment cases the influence of the degree of heterogeneity k b s u on s k is smaller than that of the horizontal anchor for the horizontal anchor it is quite reasonable because the fluke surface of the anchor directly bears the weight of the soil that moved by pullout cutting of the anchor whereas the shape and the volume of moved soil depend on the strength of clay which is determined by the gradient k to a great extent the strength heterogeneity factor s k for horizontal and vertical anchors can be fitted by the following expressions with values of r 2 of 0 994 and 0 966 respectively 9 s k c 1 h b 3 c 2 h b 2 c 3 h b c 4 c 5 γ h s u k b s u c 6 c 7 γ h s u c 8 θ o 0 c 1 h b 3 c 2 h b 2 c 3 h b c 4 k b s u c 5 γ h s u c 6 c 7 γ h s u c 8 θ o π 2 where c 1 c 8 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the horizontal or vertical anchor conditions as listed in table 4 the mean relative errors of s k estimated by eq 9 for horizontal and vertical anchors are 1 96 and 2 55 respectively then according to eq 8 by combining the strength heterogeneity factor s k with the end bearing capacity factors n c h b γ k θ o 0 and n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 the end bearing capacity factors n c h b k θ o 0 and n c h b k θ o π 2 can be obtained for horizontal and vertical anchors in clay with the strength profile linearly increasing with depth 4 1 3 effect of the anchor orientation this section aims to obtain an estimation equation for the end bearing capacity factor of inclined anchors with different orientations the cel analyses on the anchors of different orientations are performed first as presented in table 2 group 3 then the estimation equation is developed on the basis of the capacity factors for horizontal and vertical anchors fig 13 presents the end bearing capacity factors of the anchor with different orientations in the clay of various strength gradients it is observed that the anchor orientation has more influence on the shallow embedment cases than the deep ones the end bearing capacity factor of inclined anchors can be regarded as the intermediate state of horizontal and vertical anchors thus both the end bearing capacity factors n c h b k θ o 0 and n c h b k θ o π 2 derived in the previous section are introduced by further utilizing eq 8 to construct the estimation equations as 10 n c h b k θ o s k θ o 0 n c h b γ k θ o 0 1 2 θ o π s k θ o π 2 n c h b γ k 0 θ o π 2 2 θ o π c 1 c 2 k b s u 0 2 c 3 h b c 4 θ o c 5 θ o c 6 c 7 γ h s u 0 5 2 θ o π 2 θ o π 2 where c 1 c 7 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the embedment ratio h b as listed in table 4 comparing with the cel solution eq 10 reaches the value of r 2 of 0 972 if θ o 0 or π 2 according to eq 10 n c h b k θ o degenerates to n c h b k θ o 0 or n c h b k θ o π 2 which can be derived through eqs 6 9 4 1 4 effect of the loading angle in this section the effect of the loading angle is analyzed through the cases of group 4 where the angle of loading arm is assumed to be zero i e θ a r m 0 thus these cases can also lay a basis for further analyses of the effect of loading arm angle for the case θ a r m 0 the effective projected area a b is still adopted as 3 a f rather than 3 a f cos θ i n c to obtain more uniform nondimensionalized results the loading angle factor s i n c is introduced to reflect the effect of the loading angle which is defined by 11 s i n c n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 n c h b k θ o θ i n

of zero n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 denotes the end bearing capacity factor of the inclined anchor under the loading arm angle of zero actually n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 is identical to the previously derived n c h b k θ o expressed by eq 10 eq 11 constructs a bridge between n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 and n c h b k θ o fig 14 shows the results of the loading angle factor s i n c derived from the simulation cases of group 4 as listed in table 2 the value of s i n c decreases when the angle θ i n c deviates from 0 when the orientation angle θ o rises the soil shear strength gradient k creates a larger effect on the loading angle factor s i n c especially in relatively shallow embedment cases h b 1 2 the end bearing resistance force of the anchor decreases with the angle θ i n c deviating from 0 this contributes to the effect of the loading angle that the end bearing capacity increases with the increase of the effective bearing area when θ i n c 0 it indicates the loading direction inclined to the head of the anchor while when θ i n c 0 it indicates the loading direction inclined to the tail of the anchor due to the asymmetry of the head and tail of the anchor the results of s i n c change in different patterns based on the calculation results of s i n c in group 4 the estimation equation of s i n c is constructed as 12 s i n c 1 c 1 k b s u 1 c 2 c 3 θ o h b c 4 k b s u 1 c 2 c 5 e h b c 6 h b c 7 1 c o s θ i n c where c 1 c 7 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the positive or negative values of θ i n c as listed in table 4 eq 12 reaches a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 961 by combing eqs 11 and 12 the end bearing capacity factor n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 can be predicted by s i n c n c h b k θ 0 θ i n c θ a r m 0 4 1 5 effect of the bearing area the bearing area is a significant factor to the pullout capacity of omni max anchors while few investigators paid attention to it for example most of the researchers only considered the case of the loading arm parallel to one group of coplanar fins of the omni max anchor i e θ a r m 0 this reduced the pullout problem to a simple symmetric problem about the loading plane liu et al 2016 zhao and liu 2017 han et al 2018 in fact the bearing area directly relates to the bearing mechanism of the anchor due to the complicated three dimensional structure different bearing areas would cause different bearing mechanisms which remain great uncertainties in knowledge the difference in bearing mechanisms has a significant effect on the pullout capacity of the anchor in this section the effect of the bearing area is analyzed based on the calculation results of group 5 as listed in table 2 the effect of bearing area is represented by the factor s a r m defined by 13 s a r m n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 where n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 denotes the end bearing capacity factor of the inclined anchor under the loading arm angle of zero n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m denotes the end bearing capacity factor of the inclined anchor taking into account all the factors h b k θ o θ i n c and θ a r m n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m 0 has been derived in the previous section fig 15 shows the values of bearing area factor s a r m with various loading angles and embedment ratios in clay with k 1 1 kpa m and k 3 3 kpa m which indicate that the effective bearing area a b has significant effects on the end bearing capacity factor the factor s a r m changes in a large range when the anchor is positioned at various depths in general the effect of the soil strength gradient k has little influence on the bearing area factor it is observed that the positive or negative values of θ inc make the bearing area factor s a r m quite different patterns especially in shallow embedment cases h b 2 based on the calculation results of s a r m the estimation equation of s a r m is constructed as 14 s a r m 1 c 1 h b θ a r m c 2 10 c 3 k b s u h b θ a r m c 4 cos θ o c 5 θ a r m c 6 8 c 7 k b s u cos 2 θ o c 8 c 9 θ i n c θ a r m θ a r m 0 017 where c 1 c 9 are coefficients whose values are dependent on the condition of the embedment ratio h b as listed in table 4 eq 14 reaches a squared correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 933 through eqs 13 and 14 the end bearing capacity factor n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m can be directly derived 4 2 the explicit expression of end bearing capacity factor under multiple factors since the effects of all influential parameters have been derived by sequently utilizing eqs 10 11 and 13 and combing eqs 6 7 9 12 and 14 an explicit set of equations for calculating the end bearing capacity factor under multiple factors can be obtained 15 n c n c h b k θ o θ i n c θ a r m s a r m

calculated note that the coefficients c 1 c 7 in the first equation can be found in table 4 for calculating n c h b k θ o eq 10 the coefficients c 1 c 9 in the second equation for calculating s a r m can be found in table 4 eq 14 the coefficients c 1 c 7 in the third equation for calculating θ i n c can be found in table 4 eq 12 and the coefficients c 1 c 8 in the fourth equation for calculating s k can be found in table 4 eq 9 by utilizing eqs 3 and 4 the pullout capacity of the anchor can also be easily obtained 4 2 1 validation by orthogonal tests the orthogonal test is a design method that studies multiple factors and levels it is an efficient rapid and economical test method whose results can basically reflect the whole picture of full factorial design in this section a series of orthogonal tests are employed to verify the accuracy of the explicit expression in predicting the end bearing capacity factor the orthogonal test is based on the orthogonal arrays oas of l 16 45 which suit five parameters with four levels as presented in table 5 through the application of oas accompanied by either table of interactions between two columns designing tests can be relatively simple this is the reason for the wide acceptance of taguchi s methodology bush 1952 bullington et al 1990 four different loading angles are set as θ a π 8 8π 45 17π 75 and 5π 18 based on the engineering practice suggested by shelton 2007 the orientation angle θ o increases from 0 to π 2 every π 6 to cover all the potential positions of the anchor also four different levels of θ a r m are set to verify the effect of the bearing area factor on the accuracy of the equations the cases of group 6 in table 2 are also utilized to verify the estimation equations for a wider range of parameters and uncalculated combination conditions of which the analytical results are presented in fig 16 together with the results of the orthogonal tests the mean relative error of predictions is 6 67 from a total of 28 cases and 19 cases are within the relative error of 10 4 2 2 validation by all groups all the cases of groups 1 6 in table 2 are selected to compare the predictions from the explicit expression with the cel numerical results as illustrated in fig 16 the mean relative error of predictions is 7 28 from a total of 328 cases and 302 cases are within the relative error of 10 4 2 3 validation by published data in this section all available data of omni max anchors from publications wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 han et al 2018 tian et al 2018 are collected to examine the applicability of the developed explicit equation i e eq 15 as listed in table 6 for details all the anchor geometric parameters the embedment conditions and the soil strength profiles were provided by these investigations it is then not difficult to obtain values of the input parameters in the explicit equation i e h b γ k s u θ o θ i n c and θ a r m wei et al 2015 liu et al 2016 han et al 2018 and tian et al 2018 presented the pullout capacity factors which can be used to calculate the maximum resistance force then all the maximum capacity values in the above investigations are transformed into the end bearing capacity factors according to eqs 3 and 4 in calculating the shear force the value of adhesion factor α is set as 0 3 since liu et al 2016 and han et al 2018 provided the sidewall sliding capacity factor it is used to directly calculate the shear force the end bearing capacity is derived by subtracting the shear force and the effect of anchor self weight from the total capacity according to eq 4 it is observed from table 6 that the explicit expression predicts well for the omni max anchor with a mean relative error of 8 07 from 8 cases 5 concluding remarks by performing large deformation finite element analyses with the cel technique the complicated pullout capacity property of omni max anchors in clay under multiple factors including the anchor embedment depth the anchor orientation the bearing area the loading angle and the soil property are investigated systematically the effects of different influential parameters are acquired and quantified based on which an explicit expression of the end bearing capacity factor for omni max anchors is finally formulated in terms of multiple factors the orthogonal tests and available published data confirm the effectiveness and applicability of the developed expression some remarks on using the developed expression i e eq 15 are summarized as follows 1 the present explicit expression is easier in usage without requirement of any extra calculation procedure and can quickly produce the result to obtain the end bearing capacity factor just substitute values of the five parameters h b s u θ o θ i n c and θ a r m into this expression the effects of different parameters as well as the quantified expression indicate that to exactly evaluate the end bearing and pullout capacity of omni max anchors values of the five influential parameters h b s u θ o θ i n c and θ a r m must be determined in advance 2 in practice it is not easy to obtain exact values of the five parameters especially the three angles θ o θ i n c and θ a r m however by performing sensitivity analyses of the parameters effects of the five parameters on the end bearing and pullout capacity of anchors can be quantified through the present expression this is helpful to analyze the possible working performance of the anchors under complicated conditions and thus meaningful to engineering application and safety control of mooring systems 3 the application of the present expression is not only limited to calculating and analyzing the end bearing and pullout capacity of omni max anchors the anchors may exhibit comprehensive kinematic behaviors under complicated loading and seabed conditions such as keying pulling out and diving which would arise depending on the specific force components such as the shear force and the end bearing acting on the anchor since the present expression can be used to calculate the end bearing shear force and pullout capacity of anchors and takes into account complicated influential parameters it is expected to play an important role in analyzing comprehensive kinematic behaviors of omni max anchors in the seabed credit authorship contribution statement yancheng yang

20778,ship motion prediction is applied to the shipboard stabilized platform to keep the equipment on the platform stable all the time which is of great practical significance to the safety and efficiency of shipboard equipment operation long short term memory lstm network is a classic time series prediction method that has made remarkable achievements in this field however the dynamic frequency range of single lstm in ship motion prediction is insufficient to meet the stabilized platform with higher precision requirements to improve the performance of lstm in ship motion prediction this paper presents a novel method named as multiscale attention based lstm at first wavelet transform is employed to decompose ship motion signals into several frequency scales which makes lstm to capture the inherent law of ship motion from each frequency scale and then the weights of different scales are obtained by attention mechanism which promote the sensitivity of the whole system by paying more attention to significant information and suppress the interference of noise signals both of the steps form a multiscale attention mechanism which promote the adaptability and improve the performance of the lstm in addition to avoid being trapped in local optimization the two stage training mechanism is designed for model training based on the model structure ship motion data are used to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness the experiments show that the proposed method achieves better performance compared with other popular methods keywords ship motion prediction long short term memory multiscale attention mechanism two stage training mechanism 1 introduction the motions of six degrees of freedom dof such as roll pitch yaw sway surge and heave are generated when the ship is sailing on the sea which continuously disturbs the shipboard equipment and reduces the security and work efficiency of the operation on the sea cheng et al 2019 ship motion prediction is one of the measurements for reducing the risk by predicting the future motion trend of the ship according to the historical motion data it can provide the motion trend for shipboard stabilized platform in advance to keep the equipment on the platform stable all the time by adjusting the attitude of the platform takami et al 2021 therefore the research on ship motion prediction is of great practical significance in the traditional ship motion prediction method the linear analysis methods such as autoregression ar model and autoregressive moving average arma model based on time series analysis are fast in modeling and prediction huang et al 2014 jiang et al 2020 but the prediction accuracy of linear model cannot meet the requirements with the rapid development of computer technology the machine learning method has been employed to predict the time series of ship motion hou and zou 2015 li et al proposed a model based on support vector regression svr to improve the prediction accuracy of ship motion li et al 2016 moreover neural network has been also applied to ship motion prediction because of its ability to approximate various nonlinear mappings li et al 2017 yin et al 2013 2014 huang et al proposed a wavelet neural network for online ship roll motion prediction huang et al 2018 yao et al used long short term memory lstm network to predict the ship motion with high accuracy yao et al 2018 yin et al constructed a variable radial basis function rbf network based on sliding data window to predict ship roll dynamics online yin et al 2018b among them the recurrent neural network represented by lstm has made remarkable achievements in time series prediction fields due to its temporal structure with memory capacity karevan and suykens 2020 li et al 2019 yang et al 2019 however ship motion is affected by many factors such as navigation state sea conditions which makes its dynamics more complex bulian and francescutto 2011 fossen 2011 vidicperunovic and jensen 2009 the entanglement of various factors with different characteristics increases the difficulty of ship motion prediction li et al 2016 even though lstm has good performance for time series problems it still has the problem of frequency dynamic range for complex ship motion which makes it unable to meet the accuracy requirements of stabilized platform wang 2020 single neural network model is not enough to capture all the important features and it is very difficult to accurately predict the ship motion duan et al 2016 the hybrid prediction methods combining pre processing techniques and neural networks have become more effective cao et al 2019 hong et al 2019 wavelet analysis is a multiscale analysis method in the time domain and frequency domain mallat 2009 yu et al 2006 it can be applied to decompose the original signals into sub signals at different frequency scales and the sub signals can be analyzed to obtain the detailed information of the original signals chang et al 2019 khare and bajaj 2020 yin et al put forward a prediction method combining wavelet transform and rbf network for ship roll prediction yin et al 2018a this method predicts each decomposed component and summarizes the prediction results to get the final prediction which improves the performance among other decomposition prediction methods each component after decomposition is usually modeled and predicted separately and the final prediction results are obtained through reconstruction chang et al 2019 liu et al 2014 2017 2020a however it is difficult to accurately predict each component especially the high frequency component after the wavelet decomposition which leads to the accumulation of prediction error of each component and the increase of prediction output error moreover we think that the multiple frequency information of ship motion data contains some information that may interfere with the prediction which affects the prediction accuracy in addition neural networks based on attention mechanism have been well applied in natural language processing in recent years choi et al 2018 usama et al 2020 vaswani et al 2017 yin et al 2016 by assigning different probability weights to the hidden layer units of the neural network the hidden layer can focus on the more critical information with the wide application of attention mechanism it achieved good performance in the field of time series prediction too du et al 2020 hu and zheng 2020 liu et al 2020b the combination of wavelet analysis and attention mechanism in ship motion prediction is a method to solve the frequency disturbance in this paper a multiscale attention based lstm msa lstm model is proposed for the shipboard stabilized platform and the two stage training mechanism is designed according to the proposed model structure to train the model so as to avoid the model falling into local optimality and improve the convergence rate in this proposed model wavelet decomposition is adopted to decompose ship motion into different frequency scales to reduce the complexity which is helpful for lstm to learn the inherent laws of ship motion on the basis of wavelet multiscale analysis attention is introduced to form the multiscale attention mechanism which enables the lstm network to pay more attention to significant information for prediction and suppress the noise interference of useless information these modules are correlated and combined to improve the performance of ship motion prediction and make the proposed msa lstm model as a novel method for high precision shipboard stabilized platform in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model the msa lstm model is used to the ship motion prediction experiment by using the ship motion data collected under different sea conditions the results show that the msa lstm model can adapt to the prediction of ship motion under different sea conditions and the prediction accuracy is better than other models the rest of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 introduces the architecture and theoretical formula of the msa lstm model the optimization strategy and the two stage training mechanism is presented in section 3 in section 4 the results of ship motion prediction experiment and the analysis of prediction results are presented section 5 summarizes the results of this research 2 methodology in this section each module of the proposed msa lstm model is described in detail and then the optimization strategy and training mechanism are introduced the model architecture is shown in fig 1 it includes two main modules multiscale attention and multivariate lstm firstly wavelet transform decomposes the ship motion data to different scales which reduces the complexity of input data secondly the multiscale attention is designed to adaptively adjust weights of different scale components finally the multivariate lstm prediction network structure is constructed to predict the final predicted results in addition the two stage training mechanism designed according to the model structure is applied to the model training 2 1 problem statement in this paper we take each dimension of the six degrees of freedom ship motion as the input of the msa lstm model separate models are built for each dimension for training and prediction given one of the dimensions of the ship motion signal x x 1 x 2 x t we aim at predicting a series of future ship motion data in the method of sliding window therefore we use the historical ship motion data x t x t d 1 x t d 2 x t x at current time stamp t to predict x t q where d is the tunable window size and q is the tunable interval for prediction moreover we denote the corresponding predicted value as y ˆ t q and the target value as y t q by constantly moving the sliding window to predict the value after interval q we can obtain a series of future ship motion data in this paper according to the response time of the stabilized platform and the time of model prediction we set the prediction interval q as 1s and set the step size of the sliding window to 1 we learn a nonlinear mapping function by using the historical ship motion data x t and its corresponding target value y t q to obtain the predicted value y ˆ t q with the following formulation 1 y ˆ t q f x t y t q w b where w and b represent all the trainable weights and biases in our proposed model respectively f is the nonlinear mapping function to fit all the ship motion data by learning the appropriate w and b 2 2 model architecture 2 2 1 wavelet transform the first part of msa lstm model is multiscale analysis of ship motion signals with wavelet transform the input is one of the six dimensions of ship motion which aims to decompose the ship motion signal into different frequency scales by learning the signals of different frequency scales it is easier for our proposed model to grasp the inherent laws wavelet analysis decomposes the input ship motion signal x into approximate component and detail component with the time domain information preserved the wavelet decomposition can be calculated as 2 a n 1 k h n 2 k x k d n 1 k g n 2 k x k j 1 a n j k h n 2 k a k j 1 d n j k g n 2 k a k j 1 j 2 3 j where j presents the number of layers of decomposition h is the low pass wavelet filter coefficient and g is the high pass wavelet filter coefficient a j r 1 t is the

ship motion data the final output after wavelet decomposition is expressed as 3 x a 1 j d 1 1 a 2 j d 2 1 a t j d t 1 d 1 j d 2 j d t j 2 2 2 multiscale attention ship motion signal contains a variety of frequency information under different sea conditions different frequency scales are of different importance to the prediction some of which may cause interference to solve this issue we introduce an attention mechanism on the basis of multiscale analysis to make the proposed model adaptive to focus on more critical frequency information given the multiscale sequence x t and the original sequence x t in the sliding window at time stamp t the following attention mechanism is used 4 s x t i x t v s t t a n h w s c x t i w s o x t 5 α t i exp s x t i x t j 1 j 1 exp s x t j x t where s represents scoring function that evaluates the relevance between the multiscale components and the original sequence x t i r d is the i t h row of x t r j 1 d v s r d w s c and w s o r h d are trainable parameters h represents the size of the hidden layer and tanh is the activation function the attention weights are determined by the multiscale sequence and the original sequence which indicate the importance of each frequency scale for ship motion prediction since any scale in the sliding window under the current time stamp has its corresponding weight the output of the multiscale attention layer is defined as follows 6 x t α t 1 a t d 1 j α t 1 a t d 2 j α t 2 d t d 1 1 α t 2 d t d 2 1 α t 1 a t j α t 2 d t 1 α t j 1 d t d 1 j α t j 1 d t d 2 j α t j 1 d t j x t d 1 x t d 2 x t 2 2 3 predication with multivariate lstm in the traditional decomposition prediction method each decomposed component is predicted by a separate model the prediction results of each model will produce errors and then the prediction results of each component are reconstructed to obtain the final prediction results which will result in the accumulation of errors in this module we splicing all the components after multiscale attention into a matrix and input it into lstm layer for training and prediction in this way the cumulative prediction errors are eliminated and the cost of model parameter adjustment for each decomposed component are avoided we use a two layer lstm network for prediction so as to achieve a high prediction accuracy within a reasonable training time given a multiscale weighted ship motion signal at time stamp t x t x t d 1 x t d 2 x t where x τ r j 1 represents the input for any time step in the sliding window the formulas describing an lstm cell at time

state c τ is cell state o τ is output gate state h τ 1 and h τ are the hidden layer of the previous and current time step in addition w and b with subscript are trainable parameters is the element wise product the formulas describing two layer lstm at time step t are presented as 12 h t l s t m 2 h t d x t d 1 h t d 1 x t d 2 h t 1 x t where h t h t d 1 h t d 2 h t r r d is the output hidden layer of the two layer lstm r represents the size of lstm hidden layer we take the hidden layer of the last time step in the sliding window as the output of the lstm layer at time stamp t then the final output of the msa lstm model can be computed as 13 y ˆ t q tanh w p h t b p where y ˆ t q r is the final predicted value w p r 1 r and b r are trainable parameters q is the adjustable interval for prediction all the predicted value can be contacted a vector y ˆ r m m represents the number of testing set samples the structure of multivariate lstm is shown in fig 3 3 optimization and training mechanism 3 1 optimization problem in this paper we define a sliding window of length d and use the historical ship motion data x t x t d 1 x t d 2 x t in the window to predict the future value of x t q then through the way of sliding window to achieve the purpose of continuous prediction therefore ship motion prediction becomes a regression task and we use the mean squared error as the loss function of our proposed model the objective function is formulated as 14 w a t t n w l s t m w d e n s e b l s t m b d e n s e argmin θ j 15 j 1 2 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 where θ represents all the trainable weight matrix and bias term in the msa lstm model n is the number of training samples y and y ˆ are the sets of true and predicted values respectively in the proposed model we take the method of mini batch gradient descent with adam optimizer to iteratively update the parameters kingma and ba 2015 ruder 2016 the dropout strategy is also applied to improve the performance of our proposed model srivastava et al 2014 3 2 two stage training mechanism algorithm 1 two stage training algorithm image 1 the lstm structure with multiple inputs and single output easily makes the model fall into local optimum in addition the introduction of attention mechanism increases the computational complexity which makes the model difficult to converge to solve this issue we propose the two stage training mechanism to train the proposed model in the first stage the sets of feature value pairs x t x t y t q are input into lstm layer to train parameters the lstm layer parameters are fixed until the loss function is no longer decreasing in the second stage the parameters of the attention layer are trained until the loss function no longer decreases and the attention parameters are fixed these two stages are repeated until there is a tendency to converge and all parameters are trained two stage training mechanism is outlined in algorithm 1 and the flow chart is shown in fig 4 4 experiments 4 1 datasets in order to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the msa lstm model we use two different sea conditions of ship motion data for prediction experiments the datasets are collected by china ocean shipping company cosco and yanshan university ysu which include the ship s 6 dof motion data of roll pitch yaw sway surge and heave the specific ship parameters are shown in table 1 the conditions and environment for data collection are shown in table 2 we take 0 1s as the sampling interval dataset ⅰ samples continuously for 1 h and dataset ⅱ samples continuously for 40 min during the data collection the conditions such as course speed and external environment remain stable fig 5 and fig 6 respectively show the six degree of freedom ship motion data of 600s collected in two datasets the ship motion data are provided to the shipboard stabilized platform which enabling the platform to perform compensation control in advance these data have removed the direct current component from the ship motion signals to meet the requirements of the stabilized platform in order to train and test the msa lstm model six degree of freedom ship motion dataset needs to be divided into training set verification set and test set for each dimension in the experiment we set 70 of the ship motion dataset as the training sets 10 of the verification sets and 20 of the testing sets before the training of proposed model in order to speed up the convergence of the model we need to normalize the ship motion data in the interval 0 1 the calculation process is as follows 16 x i x i min x i max x i min x i i 1 2 t where max x i and min x i represent the maximum and minimum values of dataset t is the number of samples in the dataset after the prediction the predicted value is inversely normalized to get the final prediction result the formula is presented as 17 y ˆ i max x i min x i y ˆ i min x i where y ˆ i and y ˆ i represent the prediction values before and after the anti normalization respectively 4 2 wavelet decomposition parameters setting the ship motion data need to be preprocessed for transforming that into the format required by mas lstm model the wavelet decomposition is applied to the ship motion data through the spectrum of two datasets we get the frequency distribution of the ship motion from this we can find the optimal number of decomposition layers to ensure that the ship motion data can be decomposed in different frequency scales the decomposition level of dataset ⅰ is 5 and dataset ⅱ is 6 and the wavelet basis function is db10 fig 7 shows the effect of wavelet decomposition on the roll data of 1000 points in two datasets in addition the sliding window method is used to generate training features and labels after wavelet decomposition prediction experiments with prediction interval of 1s are performed on two datasets and the sliding window sizes were set to 10 and 15 respectively 4 3 hyper parameters setting in this section in order to achieve the optimal performance of the msa lstm model the hyper parameters of each part are optimized it includes three main parts lstm layer attention layer and training parameters these include hidden layer units dropout rate and training batch size which are hyperparameters related to model tuning the method to determine the optimal parameters is to adjust only the relevant parameters to obtain the optimal prediction performance under the condition of keeping other parameters unchanged the optimal hyper parameters of each part are given in table 3 4 4 training msa lstm model we use the proposed two stage training mechanism to train the msa lstm model in the first stage lstm layer is trained in the second stage we train the attention layer repeat these two stages until the model is about to converge we train all the parameters until loss stops falling the experiment shows that convergence can be achieved in two rounds when the curve of the training set and the curve of the verification set continue to decline until it stops falling it indicates that the model converges and the training is completed the training set loss curve and verification set loss curve of the two datasets in the training process are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 since the lstm layer has been trained in the first stage the model has a priori knowledge of multiscale data therefore the convergence speed of the second stage training is accelerated through the attention layer the proposed model can adaptively learn the degree of correlation between the sub signals of different frequency scales and the original ship motion signals and assign the attention weight according to the importance of different sub signals to the predicted results so that the model can focus on the more significant frequency scales the attention distributions of the two datasets are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively it can be found that the proposed model pays different attention to different frequency scales under different sea conditions from the perspective of the overall distribution of attention the low frequency and medium frequency components are more significant for prediction while the high frequency components have relatively less attention weights 4 5 evaluation metrics in order to evaluate the prediction performance of the model and ensure the effectiveness of the error measurement results root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape are used as the evaluation metrics of the model prediction results in this experiment the calculation is as follows 18 r m s e 1 m i 1 m y ˆ i y i 2 19 m a p e 100 m i 1 m y ˆ i y i y i where y ˆ i represents the predicted value y i is the true value and m represents the number of

the performance of proposed model in the experiment svr model prophet model lstm model wt lstm model and wt rbf model are used as comparison objects and parameters are optimized respectively among them prophet is a time series prediction framework based on time series decomposition and machine learning proposed by facebook taylor and letham 2018 wt lstm is a prediction method combining wavelet transform and lstm and wt rbf is a method proposed in reference yin et al 2018a for ship roll motion prediction in order to ensure the fairness of the prediction experiment all models are trained and tested using the same training set and test set and the model parameters are optimized according to the verification set table 4 and table 5 show the rmse and mape evaluation index values of the predicted results of the five models on the test set of two datasets fig 12 and fig 13 respectively describe the predicted value curve and true value curve of different models for the 6 dof ship

into the trained model for prediction and the predicted single value is obtained each time the prediction trajectory is formed by iterating the trained model the results of the above evaluation indexes show that the rmse and mape values of the proposed msa lstm model are smaller than the other five competing models in predicting the 6 dof ship motion of roll pitch yaw sway surge and heave on dataset ⅰ and ⅱ the prediction curve comparison results in figs 12 and 13 demonstrate that the prediction curve of proposed mas lstm model is closer to the original motion data in 6 dof motion prediction than the other five competition models the above results show that the proposed msa lstm model is effective and feasible in the accurate prediction of ship motion the detailed prediction results are analyzed as follows prophet model is based on historical data to fit directly predict the future time it has the characteristics of high modeling speed and short training time but for the complex nonlinear ship motion the prediction performance of prophet model is not as good as other models using sliding window method especially in the complex sea conditions it is difficult to fit the fast time varying ship motion resulting in the phenomenon of prediction lag compared with the prophet model the prediction results of svr model and lstm model are closer to the real value therefore svr model and lstm model have more advantages in dealing with nonlinear problems and can more accurately fit ship motion data moreover the prediction accuracy of lstm model is better than that of svr model which indicates that lstm model is more effective for ship motion prediction furthermore the rmse and mape values of the wt lstm model and wt rbf model in six dimensional motion are both smaller than those of the lstm model therefore using wavelet transform to decompose the ship motion to different frequency scales can effectively reduce the complexity of the ship motion so that the model can capture the ship motion law from simpler sub signals of different scales so as to better fit the ship motion besides the prediction accuracy of wt lstm model is better than that of wt rbf model which indicates that lstm network is more suitable for short term ship motion prediction than rbf network in addition the msa lstm model proposed in this paper further improves the prediction accuracy and proves that the prediction method combining multiscale attention mechanism and multivariable lstm can effectively make the model pay attention to more critical information in different frequency scales and suppress the interference of noise signal which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model the sea conditions of dataset ⅱ is more complex than that of dataset ⅰ and the ship motion contains more scale frequency information the prediction accuracy of all models for dataset ⅱ is significantly lower than that of dataset ⅰ which indicates that the accuracy of the prediction model will decrease with the increase of the complexity of sea condition however msa lstm model can decompose the ship motion into different frequency scales and learn the more important scales that affect the prediction results therefore the prediction accuracy of msa lstm model in complex sea condition is significantly lower than that of the other five models which shows that the proposed model can adapt to different sea conditions and still maintain the prediction performance in complex sea condition 5 conclusion a multiscale attention based lstm model for ship motion prediction is proposed which is applied to the shipboard stabilized platform to keep the equipment on the platform stable moreover the two stage training mechanism is designed for the model structure the proposed model captures the motion law of the ship from different frequency scales and can adaptively focus on the more important frequency information for the prediction so as to improve the prediction accuracy under two different sea conditions datasets the proposed method carries out the prediction experiments of ship roll pitch yaw sway surge and heave at 1s intervals respectively compared with svr model prophet model lstm model wt lstm model and wt rbf model msa lstm model has the most accurate prediction results and in complex sea conditions the proposed model can still provide the optimal prediction performance the experimental results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in the future research considering that the number of wavelet decomposition layers needs to be determined by spectral analysis an adaptive wavelet decomposition algorithm will be designed to determine the number of decomposition layers to improve the efficiency furthermore adaptive selection of sliding window size according to different sea conditions needs further study in addition longer period of time prediction for other offshore applications is also the next research direction when faced with the problem of long period of time prediction we will adopt the method of optimizing model structure and decreasing sampling of input data to avoid overfitting

20778,ship motion prediction is applied to the shipboard stabilized platform to keep the equipment on the platform stable all the time which is of great practical significance to the safety and efficiency of shipboard equipment operation long short term memory lstm network is a classic time series prediction method that has made remarkable achievements in this field however the dynamic frequency range of single lstm in ship motion prediction is insufficient to meet the stabilized platform with higher precision requirements to improve the performance of lstm in ship motion prediction this paper presents a novel method named as multiscale attention based lstm at first wavelet transform is employed to decompose ship motion signals into several frequency scales which makes lstm to capture the inherent law of ship motion from each frequency scale and then the weights of different scales are obtained by attention mechanism which promote the sensitivity of the whole system by paying more attention to significant information and suppress the interference of noise signals both of the steps form a multiscale attention mechanism which promote the adaptability and improve the performance of the lstm in addition to avoid being trapped in local optimization the two stage training mechanism is designed for model training based on the model structure ship motion data are used to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness the experiments show that the proposed method achieves better performance compared with other popular methods keywords ship motion prediction long short term memory multiscale attention mechanism two stage training mechanism 1 introduction the motions of six degrees of freedom dof such as roll pitch yaw sway surge and heave are generated when the ship is sailing on the sea which continuously disturbs the shipboard equipment and reduces the security and work efficiency of the operation on the sea cheng et al 2019 ship motion prediction is one of the measurements for reducing the risk by predicting the future motion trend of the ship according to the historical motion data it can provide the motion trend for shipboard stabilized platform in advance to keep the equipment on the platform stable all the time by adjusting the attitude of the platform takami et al 2021 therefore the research on ship motion prediction is of great practical significance in the traditional ship motion prediction method the linear analysis methods such as autoregression ar model and autoregressive moving average arma model based on time series analysis are fast in modeling and prediction huang et al 2014 jiang et al 2020 but the prediction accuracy of linear model cannot meet the requirements with the rapid development of computer technology the machine learning method has been employed to predict the time series of ship motion hou and zou 2015 li et al proposed a model based on support vector regression svr to improve the prediction accuracy of ship motion li et al 2016 moreover neural network has been also applied to ship motion prediction because of its ability to approximate various nonlinear mappings li et al 2017 yin et al 2013 2014 huang et al proposed a wavelet neural network for online ship roll motion prediction huang et al 2018 yao et al used long short term memory lstm network to predict the ship motion with high accuracy yao et al 2018 yin et al constructed a variable radial basis function rbf network based on sliding data window to predict ship roll dynamics online yin et al 2018b among them the recurrent neural network represented by lstm has made remarkable achievements in time series prediction fields due to its temporal structure with memory capacity karevan and suykens 2020 li et al 2019 yang et al 2019 however ship motion is affected by many factors such as navigation state sea conditions which makes its dynamics more complex bulian and francescutto 2011 fossen 2011 vidicperunovic and jensen 2009 the entanglement of various factors with different characteristics increases the difficulty of ship motion prediction li et al 2016 even though lstm has good performance for time series problems it still has the problem of frequency dynamic range for complex ship motion which makes it unable to meet the accuracy requirements of stabilized platform wang 2020 single neural network model is not enough to capture all the important features and it is very difficult to accurately predict the ship motion duan et al 2016 the hybrid prediction methods combining pre processing techniques and neural networks have become more effective cao et al 2019 hong et al 2019 wavelet analysis is a multiscale analysis method in the time domain and frequency domain mallat 2009 yu et al 2006 it can be applied to decompose the original signals into sub signals at different frequency scales and the sub signals can be analyzed to obtain the detailed information of the original signals chang et al 2019 khare and bajaj 2020 yin et al put forward a prediction method combining wavelet transform and rbf network for ship roll prediction yin et al 2018a this method predicts each decomposed component and summarizes the prediction results to get the final prediction which improves the performance among other decomposition prediction methods each component after decomposition is usually modeled and predicted separately and the final prediction results are obtained through reconstruction chang et al 2019 liu et al 2014 2017 2020a however it is difficult to accurately predict each component especially the high frequency component after the wavelet decomposition which leads to the accumulation of prediction error of each component and the increase of prediction output error moreover we think that the multiple frequency information of ship motion data contains some information that may interfere with the prediction which affects the prediction accuracy in addition neural networks based on attention mechanism have been well applied in natural language processing in recent years choi et al 2018 usama et al 2020 vaswani et al 2017 yin et al 2016 by assigning different probability weights to the hidden layer units of the neural network the hidden layer can focus on the more critical information with the wide application of attention mechanism it achieved good performance in the field of time series prediction too du et al 2020 hu and zheng 2020 liu et al 2020b the combination of wavelet analysis and attention mechanism in ship motion prediction is a method to solve the frequency disturbance in this paper a multiscale attention based lstm msa lstm model is proposed for the shipboard stabilized platform and the two stage training mechanism is designed according to the proposed model structure to train the model so as to avoid the model falling into local optimality and improve the convergence rate in this proposed model wavelet decomposition is adopted to decompose ship motion into different frequency scales to reduce the complexity which is helpful for lstm to learn the inherent laws of ship motion on the basis of wavelet multiscale analysis attention is introduced to form the multiscale attention mechanism which enables the lstm network to pay more attention to significant information for prediction and suppress the noise interference of useless information these modules are correlated and combined to improve the performance of ship motion prediction and make the proposed msa lstm model as a novel method for high precision shipboard stabilized platform in order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model the msa lstm model is used to the ship motion prediction experiment by using the ship motion data collected under different sea conditions the results show that the msa lstm model can adapt to the prediction of ship motion under different sea conditions and the prediction accuracy is better than other models the rest of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 introduces the architecture and theoretical formula of the msa lstm model the optimization strategy and the two stage training mechanism is presented in section 3 in section 4 the results of ship motion prediction experiment and the analysis of prediction results are presented section 5 summarizes the results of this research 2 methodology in this section each module of the proposed msa lstm model is described in detail and then the optimization strategy and training mechanism are introduced the model architecture is shown in fig 1 it includes two main modules multiscale attention and multivariate lstm firstly wavelet transform decomposes the ship motion data to different scales which reduces the complexity of input data secondly the multiscale attention is designed to adaptively adjust weights of different scale components finally the multivariate lstm prediction network structure is constructed to predict the final predicted results in addition the two stage training mechanism designed according to the model structure is applied to the model training 2 1 problem statement in this paper we take each dimension of the six degrees of freedom ship motion as the input of the msa lstm model separate models are built for each dimension for training and prediction given one of the dimensions of the ship motion signal x x 1 x 2 x t we aim at predicting a series of future ship motion data in the method of sliding window therefore we use the historical ship motion data x t x t d 1 x t d 2 x t x at current time stamp t to predict x t q where d is the tunable window size and q is the tunable interval for prediction moreover we denote the corresponding predicted value as y ˆ t q and the target value as y t q by constantly moving the sliding window to predict the value after interval q we can obtain a series of future ship motion data in this paper according to the response time of the stabilized platform and the time of model prediction we set the prediction interval q as 1s and set the step size of the sliding window to 1 we learn a nonlinear mapping function by using the historical ship motion data x t and its corresponding target value y t q to obtain the predicted value y ˆ t q with the following formulation 1 y ˆ t q f x t y t q w b where w and b represent all the trainable weights and biases in our proposed model respectively f is the nonlinear mapping function to fit all the ship motion data by learning the appropriate w and b 2 2 model architecture 2 2 1 wavelet transform the first part of msa lstm model is multiscale analysis of ship motion signals with wavelet transform the input is one of the six dimensions of ship motion which aims to decompose the ship motion signal into different frequency scales by learning the signals of different frequency scales it is easier for our proposed model to grasp the inherent laws wavelet analysis decomposes the input ship motion signal x into approximate component and detail component with the time domain information preserved the wavelet decomposition can be calculated as 2 a n 1 k h n 2 k x k d n 1 k g n 2 k x k j 1 a n j k h n 2 k a k j 1 d n j k g n 2 k a k j 1 j 2 3 j where j presents the number of layers of decomposition h is the low pass wavelet filter coefficient and g is the high pass wavelet filter coefficient a j r 1 t is the wavelet coefficient of the approximate component of the signal at layer j and d j r 1 t is the wavelet coefficient of the detail component fig 2 shows the effect of wavelet decomposition of partial ship motion data the final output after wavelet decomposition is expressed as 3 x a 1 j d 1 1 a 2 j d 2 1 a t j d t 1 d 1 j d 2 j d t j 2 2 2 multiscale attention ship motion signal contains a variety of frequency information under different sea conditions different frequency scales are of different importance to the prediction some of which may cause interference to solve this issue we introduce an attention mechanism on the basis of multiscale analysis to make the proposed model adaptive to focus on more critical frequency information given the multiscale sequence x t and the original sequence x t in the sliding window at time stamp t the following attention mechanism is used 4 s x t i x t v s t t a n h w s c x t i w s o x t 5 α t i exp s x t i x t j 1 j 1 exp s x t j x t where s represents scoring function that evaluates the relevance between the multiscale components and the original sequence x t i r d is the i t h row of x t r j 1 d v s r d w s c and w s o r h d are trainable parameters h represents the size of the hidden layer and tanh is the activation function the attention weights are determined by the multiscale sequence and the original sequence which indicate the importance of each frequency scale for ship motion prediction since any scale in the sliding window under the current time stamp has its corresponding weight the output of the multiscale attention layer is defined as follows 6 x t α t 1 a t d 1 j α t 1 a t d 2 j α t 2 d t d 1 1 α t 2 d t d 2 1 α t 1 a t j α t 2 d t 1 α t j 1 d t d 1 j α t j 1 d t d 2 j α t j 1 d t j x t d 1 x t d 2 x t 2 2 3 predication with multivariate lstm in the traditional decomposition prediction method each decomposed component is predicted by a separate model the prediction results of each model will produce errors and then the prediction results of each component are reconstructed to obtain the final prediction results which will result in the accumulation of errors in this module we splicing all the components after multiscale attention into a matrix and input it into lstm layer for training and prediction in this way the cumulative prediction errors are eliminated and the cost of model parameter adjustment for each decomposed component are avoided we use a two layer lstm network for prediction so as to achieve a high prediction accuracy within a reasonable training time given a multiscale weighted ship motion signal at time stamp t x t x t d 1 x t d 2 x t where x τ r j 1 represents the input for any time step in the sliding window the formulas describing an lstm cell at time step τ are presented as 7 i τ σ w x i α t 1 a τ j α t 2 d τ 1 α t j 1 d τ j w h i h τ 1 b i 8 f τ σ w x f α t 1 a τ j α t 2 d τ 1 α t j 1 d τ j w h f h τ 1 b f 9 c τ f τ c τ 1 i τ tan h w x c α t 1 a

state c τ is cell state o τ is output gate state h τ 1 and h τ are the hidden layer of the previous and current time step in addition w and b with subscript are trainable parameters is the element wise product the formulas describing two layer lstm at time step t are presented as 12 h t l s t m 2 h t d x t d 1 h t d 1 x t d 2 h t 1 x t where h t h t d 1 h t d 2 h t r r d is the output hidden layer of the two layer lstm r represents the size of lstm hidden layer we take the hidden layer of the last time step in the sliding window as the output of the lstm layer at time stamp t then the final output of the msa lstm model can be computed as 13 y ˆ t q tanh w p h t b p where y ˆ t q r is the final predicted value w p r 1 r and b r are trainable parameters q is the adjustable interval for prediction all the predicted value can be contacted a vector y ˆ r m m represents the number of testing set samples the structure of multivariate lstm is shown in fig 3 3 optimization and training mechanism 3 1 optimization problem in this paper we define a sliding window of length d and use the historical ship motion data x t x t d 1 x t d 2 x t in the window to predict the future value of x t q then through the way of sliding window to achieve the purpose of continuous prediction therefore ship motion prediction becomes a regression task and we use the mean squared error as the loss function of our proposed model the objective function is formulated as 14 w a t t n w l s t m w d e n s e b l s t m b d e n s e argmin θ j 15 j 1 2 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 where θ represents all the trainable weight matrix and bias term in the msa lstm model n is the number of training samples y and y ˆ are the sets of true and predicted values respectively in the proposed model we take the method of mini batch gradient descent with adam optimizer to iteratively update the parameters kingma and ba 2015 ruder 2016 the dropout strategy is also applied to improve the performance of our proposed model srivastava et al 2014 3 2 two stage training mechanism algorithm 1 two stage training algorithm image 1 the lstm structure with multiple inputs and single output easily makes the model fall into local optimum in addition the introduction of attention mechanism increases the computational complexity which makes the model difficult to converge to solve this issue we propose the two stage training mechanism to train the proposed model in the first stage the sets of feature value pairs x t x t y t q are input into lstm layer to train parameters the lstm layer parameters are fixed until the loss function is no longer decreasing in the second stage the parameters of the attention layer are trained until the loss function no longer decreases and the attention parameters are fixed these two stages are repeated until there is a tendency to converge and all parameters are trained two stage training mechanism is outlined in algorithm 1 and the flow chart is shown in fig 4 4 experiments 4 1 datasets in order to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the msa lstm model we use two different sea conditions of ship motion data for prediction experiments the datasets are collected by china ocean shipping company cosco and yanshan university ysu which include the ship s 6 dof motion data of roll pitch yaw sway surge and heave the specific ship parameters are shown in table 1 the conditions and environment for data collection are shown in table 2 we take 0 1s as the sampling interval dataset ⅰ samples continuously for 1 h and dataset ⅱ samples continuously for 40 min during the data collection the conditions such as course speed and external environment remain stable fig 5 and fig 6 respectively show the six degree of freedom ship motion data of 600s collected in two datasets the ship motion data are provided to the shipboard stabilized platform which enabling the platform to perform compensation control in advance these data have removed the direct current component from the ship motion signals to meet the requirements of the stabilized platform in order to train and test the msa lstm model six degree of freedom ship motion dataset needs to be divided into training set verification set and test set for each dimension in the experiment we set 70 of the ship motion dataset as the training sets 10 of the verification sets and 20 of the testing sets before the training of proposed model in order to speed up the convergence of the model we need to normalize the ship motion data in the interval 0 1 the calculation process is as follows 16 x i x i min x i max x i min x i i 1 2 t where max x i and min x i represent the maximum and minimum values of dataset t is the number of samples in the dataset after the prediction the predicted value is inversely normalized to get the final prediction result the formula is presented as 17 y ˆ i max x i min x i y ˆ i min x i where y ˆ i and y ˆ i represent the prediction values before and after the anti normalization respectively 4 2 wavelet decomposition parameters setting the ship motion data need to be preprocessed for transforming that into the format required by mas lstm model the wavelet decomposition is applied to the ship motion data through the spectrum of two datasets we get the frequency distribution of the ship motion from this we can find the optimal number of decomposition layers to ensure that the ship motion data can be decomposed in different frequency scales the decomposition level of dataset ⅰ is 5 and dataset ⅱ is 6 and the wavelet basis function is db10 fig 7 shows the effect of wavelet decomposition on the roll data of 1000 points in two datasets in addition the sliding window method is used to generate training features and labels after wavelet decomposition prediction experiments with prediction interval of 1s are performed on two datasets and the sliding window sizes were set to 10 and 15 respectively 4 3 hyper parameters setting in this section in order to achieve the optimal performance of the msa lstm model the hyper parameters of each part are optimized it includes three main parts lstm layer attention layer and training parameters these include hidden layer units dropout rate and training batch size which are hyperparameters related to model tuning the method to determine the optimal parameters is to adjust only the relevant parameters to obtain the optimal prediction performance under the condition of keeping other parameters unchanged the optimal hyper parameters of each part are given in table 3 4 4 training msa lstm model we use the proposed two stage training mechanism to train the msa lstm model in the first stage lstm layer is trained in the second stage we train the attention layer repeat these two stages until the model is about to converge we train all the parameters until loss stops falling the experiment shows that convergence can be achieved in two rounds when the curve of the training set and the curve of the verification set continue to decline until it stops falling it indicates that the model converges and the training is completed the training set loss curve and verification set loss curve of the two datasets in the training process are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 since the lstm layer has been trained in the first stage the model has a priori knowledge of multiscale data therefore the convergence speed of the second stage training is accelerated through the attention layer the proposed model can adaptively learn the degree of correlation between the sub signals of different frequency scales and the original ship motion signals and assign the attention weight according to the importance of different sub signals to the predicted results so that the model can focus on the more significant frequency scales the attention distributions of the two datasets are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively it can be found that the proposed model pays different attention to different frequency scales under different sea conditions from the perspective of the overall distribution of attention the low frequency and medium frequency components are more significant for prediction while the high frequency components have relatively less attention weights 4 5 evaluation metrics in order to evaluate the prediction performance of the model and ensure the effectiveness of the error measurement results root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percent error mape are used as the evaluation metrics of the model prediction results in this experiment the calculation is as follows 18 r m s e 1 m i 1 m y ˆ i y i 2 19 m a p e 100 m i 1 m y ˆ i y i y i where y ˆ i represents the predicted value y i is the true value and m represents the number of

introduction after the construction and commissioning of deep dam reservoirs and deep hydropower stations the water temperature has an obvious stratification in the vertical direction which causes the water to have low temperatures at the intake throughout the year wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 he et al 2019 if a hydropower station discharges low temperature water downstream for a long time it will bring problems in the ecological environment such as the impact on fish reproduction and growth in the river matsuura et al 2015 and irrigated crop failure zhang et al 2016 for the outflow low temperature water experts and scholars have proposed a series of schemes such as multi level intake wu et al 2011 ding et al 2019 and stop log gate ren et al 2020 zheng et al 2017 freckleton et al 2011 these traditional schemes are rigid hydraulic structures made of cement concrete and steel so that they have high strength strong corrosion resistance and long service life however such structures need to be completed before the reservoir is put into operation and they are also expensive in terms of cost and maintenance which affects the benefits of hydropower stations for reservoirs that have been put into operation but without such structures new approaches should be taken to solve the problem of outflow low temperature water compared to the traditional treatment methods flexible tcc is relatively simple and there is no need to empty the reservoir during the construction process in addition the curtain can be replaced at any time so it is easy to operate and maintain the flexible tcc has been used in many water temperature control projects such as the lewiston reservoir the holston river and the whiskeytown reservoir vermeyen 2000 boles 1985 bohac 1989 for tcc and similar structures scholars have done a lot of experimental and simulation studies wang et al 2014 performed a number of flume experimental tests and the results showed that a flexible dam can maintain stability in some flow conditions lian et al 2016 showed that the outflow water temperature is influenced by the flow height of the curtain and the vertical temperature distribution before the dam he et al 2017a investigated the effect of tcc on the thermal structure in the deep reservoir they also analyzed the laws of variation of the pressure difference and thrust of the water retaining curtain wrc based on flume experimental tests and numerical simulations he et al 2017b 2017c lian et al 2020 studied the effects of water blocking rate area ratio inclination ratio and water temperature stratification ratio on the tcc drag coefficient song et al 2020 showed that the factors influencing the outflow temperature are temperature distribution submerged depth outflow discharge and installation position in turn in summary since previous tcc schemes have different functions and most studies have focused mainly on the thermal effect and experiments there have been relatively few researchers who have paid much attention to structural system design and structural safety structural failure especially at large tcc ranges directly affects the operation of hydropower stations and even results in damage to generator equipment tcc is supported by a flexible single layer cable net system and its mechanical motion and deformation are quite complex the rigid body displacement and the elastic deformation of the structure coexist under the influence of water pressure showing strong nonlinearity moreover the water level can vary greatly so the displacement coordination problem is very pronounced which is a great test for the stability of the structural system traditional finite element analysis methods such as the force density method linkwitz and schek 1971 schek 1974 cai et al 2018 the dynamic relaxation method day 1965 namadchi and alamatian 2016 and some other nonlinear finite element methods branam et al 2019 nie et al 2017 cannot solve such nonlinear problems with large deformation well this paper presents an effective analysis approach based on the vector form intrinsic finite element vfife it is a new numerical analysis method proposed by ting et al 2004a 2004b and shih et al 2014 li et al 2018a 2018b analyzed the space nonlinear behaviors of marine risers wang et al 2017 applied this method to the form finding analysis of cytoskeletal networks guo et al 2018 used vfife to simulate the member fracture of a negative gaussian curvature cable dome samy et al 2021 investigated the rupture mechanism of membrane structures using vfife the above mentioned research proved that vfife has good adaptability and reliability in working with strongly nonlinear problems so this paper applied vfife to the structural analysis of tcc this paper first presents a new flexible tcc scheme from the point of view of structural stability structural safety and construction convenience then using the vfife method the form finding and force analysis of the tcc structure are conducted and the influence of key parameters on different tcc layout schemes is compared in detail finally this paper analyzes the form evolution and force distribution of tcc under different water levels 2 a new type of flexible tcc 2 1 scheme of the new flexible tcc tcc is a flexible and impermeable structure built in a certain position in front of the dam the evolution of the tcc scheme is shown in table 1 this paper proposes a new tcc scheme as shown in fig 1 which has five main parts including towers combined floating tanks cable net curtain and anchorage a towers and combined floating tanks many previous schemes did not have towers and their main cables were mostly anchored directly to the ground he et al 2017 designed a fixed height tower while this paper presents a new type of tower that is hollow with floating tanks inside it most of the body of the tower is under water during the period of high water level the main cable extends from the towers on both sides and its two ends are connected to the floating tanks inside the towers all previous schemes had a buoyancy system combined floating tanks that are attached along the main cable fig 2 a are also designed in this paper when the water level changes the position of the combined floating tanks changes and floating tanks inside the towers can also change their position through the chute fig 2 a so that the main cable can stay on the water surface and this system can automatically adjust the tcc form under different water levels this can avoid complex lifting operations and improve flexibility and adaptability b anchorage as fixed supports at the bottom sand bags or gravity anchors used in the previous schemes are unstable and weak so we choose underwater anchor piles fig 2 b to ensure that no movement occurs when water is impacted c cable net and curtain in the previous schemes there are few cables along the curtain but we emphasize the cable net as the main supporting component therefore more interlaced cables are arranged the upper end of the vertical cables is connected to the floating tanks while the lower end is connected to the anchor piles the horizontal cables are connected with vertical cables and the curtain is connected by cables through sleeve holes forming a flexible wall that blocks water the distance from the top of the curtain to the main cable is outflow height which directly affects the effect of improving the water temperature the overall force transferring path of this tcc scheme is shown in fig 3 the water load is first applied to the curtain and then transferred to the horizontal cables and vertical cables vertical cables are the main load bearing components while horizontal cables are auxiliary load bearing components and mainly have the role of a structural connection after that when the load is transferred upwards the horizontal component of the force is borne by the main cable and the vertical component of the force is borne by floating tanks when the load is transferred downwards it is borne by the anchor piles in addition curtain extends further in space than the cables after design the curtain can only bear the water load in the corresponding grid and is used only as a force transferring component therefore the structural design and mechanical analysis are focused on the cable net structure key safety parameters include the internal force of the main cable and vertical cables the buoyancy force of the floating tanks and the reaction force of the anchor piles 2 2 innovative cable net layout schemes previous studies including experiments lian et al 2019 have mostly used the plane curtain no one has thought about how to design a structural system with a more reasonable stress distribution in terms of spatial configuration taking into account the structural safety and construction convenience this paper presents three types of cable net layout schemes namely the plane tcc the elliptic paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc the plane tcc fig 4 a is the simplest scheme and its most obvious advantage is the flat curtain however its vertical cables withstand greater internal force in the load bearing state to overcome this disadvantage the curtain can be lengthened in advance so that the structure can drum out in operation to improve mechanical performance for the elliptic paraboloid tcc fig 4 b the cable net is placed in a spatially curved surface form the main cable is laid with a certain rise span ratio and its mechanical performance is better however the curtain of this scheme is not flat and the construction is really difficult taking into account the advantages of the above two schemes the conical surface tcc fig 4 c is presented its unfolding shape of the curtain is a plane sector instead of a curved surface and can make the cable net drum out in operation 3 nonlinear structural analysis method 3 1 structural discretization and description of motion the structure of the tcc cable net is discretized into mass particles and massless elements as shown in fig 5 the mass of the structure is distributed on the particles and the internal and external forces of the structure are represented by the internal and external forces on the particles taking for example space particle no 3 internal force f on particle no 3 comes from the elements ② and ③ that are connected to it f can be obtained using the internal force calculation formula of the tension and compression rob in material mechanics the external force p on particle no 3 comes from water pressure under the influence of water pressure rigid body displacement and elastic deformation coexist in the tcc cable net structure showing extremely strong nonlinearity to simplify the problem we divide the time history into a finite number of tiny time steps δ t the motion of finite space particles in a small time step is used to approximate the actual trajectory of the structure thus making it closer to reality as shown in fig 6 it is assumed that the entire analysis time history is t 0 t f and a series of time points t α t β t γ t f are used to divide the total time into a certain number of time periods if the motion of a space particle in a certain period of time t α t β satisfies the standard governing equation the calculation trajectory of the space particle in this period is called the path element in the path element the deformation of the structure is small but there can be a large displacement in addition the properties of the material and the stress state of the space particles can be considered approximately unchanged therefore many geometrically nonlinear problems can be simplified to problems of large displacement and small deformation 3 2 principles for solving static equilibrium the essence of vfife is structural dynamic analysis if based on dynamic analysis a virtual damping force f d can be added the amplitude of the space particles will gradually decrease under the influence of the energy dissipation mechanism and will eventually converge to an almost stationary state until equilibrium is reached the motion of space particles follows newton s second law and the generalized equations of motion are shown in equations 1 and 2 1 f d ζ m i x 2 m i x f n f d p f f d where ζ denotes an arbitrary damping coefficient the damping coefficient is used only as an energy dissipation mechanism it does not need to be the actual damping of a material and it can be a positive number assumed for numerical calculation the damping coefficient has no effect on the final convergence result but it will affect the convergence speed x x and x denote the displacement vector the velocity vector and the acceleration vector of space particles respectively f n denotes the resultant force vector of the particle excluding the virtual damping force f n f x f y f z there are many ways to solve equation 2 in this paper an explicit time integral method is adopted both x and f n are functions of time t t t n n h n 0 h is the step size of the time increment which is assumed to be constant and n 0 is the initial step the velocity vector x n and the acceleration vector x n of the particle are obtained by the central difference method as shown in equations 3 and 4 3 x n x n 1 x n 1 2 h 4 x n x n 1 2 x n x n 1 h 2 where x n 1 x n and x n 1 denote the displacement vectors of the particle at the time steps n 1 n and n 1 respectively equations from 1 to 4 can be used together to obtain the particle motion difference equation 5 and the relevant coefficients are shown in equations 6 and 7 5 x 1 h 2 f 0 2 m i h 1 ζ h 2 x 0 x 0 n 0 x n 1 h 2 f n m i 2 x n c 2 x n 1 c 1 n 1 6 c 1 1 ζ h 2 7 c 2 1 ζ h 2 3 3 the basic solving flow of vfife the basic flow of the vfife method for solving such a tcc cable net structure with large displacement is shown in fig 7 first the structure was discretized after modeling after that the external force p is applied to the structure so there is a displacement and deformation the internal force of the structure can be calculated by structural deformation then is necessary to determine whether the unbalanced force consisting of external and internal forces is less than the error limit δ if it is not less than δ the unbalanced force is returned to keep the structure moving if it is less than δ it is considered that the structure has reached equilibrium and thus the simulation results are obtained 3 4 numerical model of tcc fig 8 shows the numerical model of tcc taking the conical surface tcc as an example in this paper an arc with a depth of 40 m and a span of l 100 m is used as the rough boundary of the riverbed topography the bottom water level of riverbed is 0 m and the top is 40 m the towers on both banks are 10 m high and the top water level of them is 50 m as high as the highest water level of the river when the water level changes the water level of the floating tanks can be synchronously changed in the range of 40 50 m ensuring that the main cable is always on the water the tcc consists of 19 vertical cables numbered as shown in fig 8 and the corresponding anchor piles and floating tanks are also numbered in this order there are eight horizontal cables that have the role of a structural connection and their internal force is not the basis for the design for the elliptic paraboloid or conical surface their apexes are at the bottom of the riverbed and the base radius is r there is also rise of the main cable s for the elliptic paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc schemes in the numerical simulation it is assumed that the connections between the main cable and the towers on both sides as well as between the vertical cables and the underwater anchor piles are articulated vertical supports are provided on floating tanks to limit vertical displacement and keep them floating on the water surface the required buoyancy for floating tanks is obtained through vertical supports based on the hydrological data this paper assumes that the water pressure does not change with the change of water level and structural form and applies the most unfavorable water pressure of 200 pa along the water flow the pressure is first applied to the curtain and then redistributed to the cable nodes the material properties and design parameters of the main cable horizontal cables vertical cables and anchor piles are shown in table 2 it is assumed that the structural deformation is always within the limits of elasticity deenyma has lower strength than steel so steel was chosen for the main cable as for vertical and horizontal cables we chose deenyma instead of steel because steel cables are apt to rust in water and steel cables are so heavy that they add to the structural burden the cross section of cables was selected according to the breaking force and safety factor when this paper evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various schemes the expected goal is to achieve a higher load for the main cable and a lower load for vertical cables and floating tanks this idea is to design the main cable to be the strong enough component and even if the curtain or anchor is damaged in operation the curtain would not be washed away by the current thus avoiding the negative effect on the hydropower station also it is easy to replace the curtain in this conceptual design 3 5 numerical example a numerical example of the conical surface tcc is given in order to verify the feasibility and correctness of the simulation results obtained by the vfife method the water level is 50 m r 11 m and s 10 m the simulation results are imported into the general finite element analysis software ansys fig 9 shows the further displacement of the structure under the influence of the final balanced force system the maximum displacement is only 3 44 10 3 mm which means that the structure is no longer deformed and hooke s law is satisfied so the final balanced state of the structure is verified 4 mechanical analysis and comparison of schemes in order to obtain a more reasonable internal force distribution this section analyzes three tcc layout schemes with different parameters and under different water levels in order to evaluate the mechanical properties and make reasonable suggestions 4 1 parameter analysis for the plane tcc this section optimizes the plane tcc cable net structure by changing the length of the curtain the overall height l of the tcc can also be changed so that the structure can easily drum out in operation and the distribution of internal force is optimized for the overall height l in order to envelope different lengths of central vertical cable in other schemes 10 heights are set at every 1 m in the range from 51 m to 60 m fig 10 a shows the parameter settings and fig 10 b shows the internal force of the main cable f m at each height with increasing l f m gradually decreases and the maximum f m is 1679 6 kn when l 51 m the maximum internal force of each vertical cable f v under different parameters and the required buoyancy of each floating tank f b under different parameters are shown in fig 11 as f v appears at the bottom it is the same as the reaction force of each anchor pile f a which is not given for the sake of brevity as l increases f v and f b gradually decrease however when l 59 60 m the local stress concentration occurs in the vertical cables on the tcc edge the maximum f v and f b are 54 1 kn and 100 4 kn respectively which appear in the central vertical cable and floating tank no 10 when l 51 m the minimum f v and f b are 32 3 kn and 71 9 kn respectively which appear in the same place but when l 60 m although f m decreases with increasing l both f v and f b decrease which are more difficult to meet the requirements the optimal parameter is l 60 m 4 2 parameter analysis for the elliptical paraboloid tcc for the elliptical paraboloid tcc the parameter analysis is firstly done for the base radius r ten types of r ranging from 11 m to 20 m are set every 1 m as r increases the angle α between the vertical cables and the main cable will decrease so that the main cable can bear more load and the vertical cables and floating tanks can bear less load fig 12 a shows the parameter settings and fig 12 b shows f m with different r with increasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 278 3 kn when r 20 m f v and f b are shown in fig 13 as r increases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 62 2 kn and the minimum is 33 9 kn they appear in the vertical cable no 7 no 13 when r 11 m and r 20 m respectively the maximum f b is 104 9 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 6 no 14 when r 11 m the minimum f b is 71 9 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 3 no 17 when r 20 m in summary as r increases f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which fulfills the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m by reducing the rise of the main cable s the angle α can be further reduced in order not to make f m higher we keep r 20 m and six types of s ranging from 5 m to 10 m are set every 1 m fig 14 a shows the parameter settings and fig 14 b shows f m with different s with decreasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 590 8 kn when s 5 m f v and f b are shown in fig 15 as s decreases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 33 9 kn and the minimum is 30 4 kn they appear in the vertical cable no 7 no 13 when s 10 m and s 5 m respectively the maximum f b is 71 9 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 3 no 17 when s 10 m the minimum f b is 68 6 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 2 no 18 when s 5 m in summary with decreasing s f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which meets the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m and s 5 m 4 3 parameter analysis for the conical surface tcc for the conical surface tcc the parameter analysis is also firstly done for the base radius r fig 16 a shows the parameter settings that are the same as for the elliptical paraboloid tcc and fig 16 b shows f m with different r with increasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 253 4 kn when r 20 m f v and f b are shown in fig 17 as r increases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 71 5 kn and appears in the central vertical cable no 10 when r 11 m the minimum f v is 35 4 kn and appears in the vertical cable no 8 or no 12 when r 20 m the maximum f b is 114 5 kn and the minimum is 72 8 kn they appear in the central floating tank no 10 when r 11 m and r 20 m respectively in summary as r increases f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which meets the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m fig 18 a shows the parameter settings for s which are the same as for the elliptical paraboloid tcc and fig 18 b shows f m with different s with decreasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 545 8 kn when s 5 m f v and f b are shown in fig 19 as s decreases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 35 4 kn and appears in the vertical cable no 8 no 12 when s 10 m the minimum f v is 31 6 kn and appears in the vertical cable no 7 no 13 when s 5 m the maximum f b is 72 8 kn and the minimum is 68 1 kn they appear in the central floating tank no 10 when s 10 m and s 5 m respectively in summary with decreasing s f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which fulfills the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m and s 5 m 4 4 comparison of schemes the optimal parameters and internal force extremum of the three schemes are shown in table 3 comparative analysis can determine that the difference of f v and f b obtained after optimization is small between the three schemes and that the main difference lies in the rise of the main cable s the plane tcc has a much higher f m than the other two schemes and f v and f b are also the largest among the three schemes when l 59 60 m the local stress concentration occurs in the edge vertical cables of the plane tcc which is not suitable for the structure the difference between the internal force extremum of the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc is small so these two schemes are better than the plane tcc further taking into account the construction convenience the conical surface tcc was chosen as the final scheme because its unfolding shape of the curtain is flat instead of curved 4 5 change in internal force under different water levels for the final scheme conical surface tcc this section shows the internal force change under different water levels due to the limit of tower height and the terrain 11 water levels h ranging from 40 m to 50 m are set every 1 m the optimal parameters in section 4 4 are used in the numerical model r 20 m and s 5 m fig 20 shows the structural forms under three typical test conditions and changes of different internal force ratios the ratio of f m between each water level and h 50 m is defined as e m similarly the ratio of f v is e v and the ratio of f b is e b with decreasing h e m e v and e b gradually decrease and reach the extremum value when h 40 m which is 0 972 0 902 and 0 895 respectively it is also proved that the nonlinear structural analysis method proposed in this paper is very effective for the force and form analysis of the flexible tcc structure 5 conclusions the flexible tcc is an effective way to treat the outflow low temperature water this paper proposes a new type of the flexible tcc and a nonlinear structural analysis method for the tcc structure the mechanical properties of different schemes are also evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the main components and the force transferring path of the new type of flexible tcc have been introduced the structure mainly consists of towers combined floating tanks cable net curtain and anchorage all parts of the tcc adopt a safer and more stable design than previous schemes 2 the nonlinear structural analysis method is proposed for the force and form analysis of the tcc structure it can solve the large displacement problem of this type of flexible structure more effectively than traditional methods the principle and basic flow of the static equilibrium solution are also described this provides a theoretical basis for the scientific research of tcc 3 three cable net layout schemes have been proposed the plane tcc the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc for the plane tcc with increasing l f m gradually decreases while f v and f b gradually decrease for the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc when the base radius r increases and the rise of the main cable s decreases f m increases and f v and f b decrease which meets the idea of achieving a higher load for the main cable and a lower load for vertical cables and floating tanks 4 the main cable force of the plane tcc is far greater than other schemes and local stress concentration occurs easily the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc have similar mechanical properties by further considering the construction convenience the latter is better for application 5 under different water levels in the range of 40 m 50 m the structural forms and internal force change of the conical surface tcc are obtained as h decreases f m f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum change rate of key internal force is about 10 tcc is an effective measure for the treatment of the low temperature water for deep reservoirs and hydropower stations its simple construction and low cost show the potential for application in other similar engineering projects due to the special working environment the design criteria and code provisions especially the safety design are quite different from the current ones in the future it is necessary to determine the safety design criteria of each load bearing structure and to present the corresponding design method according to the severity of the damage to each part credit authorship

the main supporting component therefore more interlaced cables are arranged the upper end of the vertical cables is connected to the floating tanks while the lower end is connected to the anchor piles the horizontal cables are connected with vertical cables and the curtain is connected by cables through sleeve holes forming a flexible wall that blocks water the distance from the top of the curtain to the main cable is outflow height which directly affects the effect of improving the water temperature the overall force transferring path of this tcc scheme is shown in fig 3 the water load is first applied to the curtain and then transferred to the horizontal cables and vertical cables vertical cables are the main load bearing components while horizontal cables are auxiliary load bearing components and mainly have the role of a structural connection after that when the load is transferred upwards the horizontal component of the force is borne by the main cable and the vertical component of the force is borne by floating tanks when the load is transferred downwards it is borne by the anchor piles in addition curtain extends further in space than the cables after design the curtain can only bear the water load in the corresponding grid and is used only as a force transferring component therefore the structural design and mechanical analysis are focused on the cable net structure key safety parameters include the internal force of the main cable and vertical cables the buoyancy force of the floating tanks and the reaction force of the anchor piles 2 2 innovative cable net layout schemes previous studies including experiments lian et al 2019 have mostly used the plane curtain no one has thought about how to design a structural system with a more reasonable stress distribution in terms of spatial configuration taking into account the structural safety and construction convenience this paper presents three types of cable net layout schemes namely the plane tcc the elliptic paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc the plane tcc fig 4 a is the simplest scheme and its most obvious advantage is the flat curtain however its vertical cables withstand greater internal force in the load bearing state to overcome this disadvantage the curtain can be lengthened in advance so that the structure can drum out in operation to improve mechanical performance for the elliptic paraboloid tcc fig 4 b the cable net is placed in a spatially curved surface form the main cable is laid with a certain rise span ratio and its mechanical performance is better however the curtain of this scheme is not flat and the construction is really difficult taking into account the advantages of the above two schemes the conical surface tcc fig 4 c is presented its unfolding shape of the curtain is a plane sector instead of a curved surface and can make the cable net drum out in operation 3 nonlinear structural analysis method 3 1 structural discretization and description of motion the structure of the tcc cable net is discretized into mass particles and massless elements as shown in fig 5 the mass of the structure is distributed on the particles and the internal and external forces of the structure are represented by the internal and external forces on the particles taking for example space particle no 3 internal force f on particle no 3 comes from the elements ② and ③ that are connected to it f can be obtained using the internal force calculation formula of the tension and compression rob in material mechanics the external force p on particle no 3 comes from water pressure under the influence of water pressure rigid body displacement and elastic deformation coexist in the tcc cable net structure showing extremely strong nonlinearity to simplify the problem we divide the time history into a finite number of tiny time steps δ t the motion of finite space particles in a small time step is used to approximate the actual trajectory of the structure thus making it closer to reality as shown in fig 6 it is assumed that the entire analysis time history is t 0 t f and a series of time points t α t β t γ t f are used to divide the total time into a certain number of time periods if the motion of a space particle in a certain period of time t α t β satisfies the standard governing equation the calculation trajectory of the space particle in this period is called the path element in the path element the deformation of the structure is small but there can be a large displacement in addition the properties of the material and the stress state of the space particles can be considered approximately unchanged therefore many geometrically nonlinear problems can be simplified to problems of large displacement and small deformation 3 2 principles for solving static equilibrium the essence of vfife is structural dynamic analysis if based on dynamic analysis a virtual damping force f d can be added the amplitude of the space particles will gradually decrease under the influence of the energy dissipation mechanism and will eventually converge to an almost stationary state until equilibrium is reached the motion of space particles follows newton s second law and the generalized equations of motion are shown in equations 1 and 2 1 f d ζ m i x 2 m i x f n f d p f f d where ζ denotes an arbitrary damping coefficient the damping coefficient is used only as an energy dissipation mechanism it does not need to be the actual damping of a material and it can be a positive number assumed for numerical calculation the damping coefficient has no effect on the final convergence result but it will affect the convergence speed x x and x denote the displacement vector the velocity vector and the acceleration vector of space particles respectively f n denotes the resultant force vector of the particle excluding the virtual damping force f n f x f y f z there are many ways to solve equation 2 in this paper an explicit time integral method is adopted both x and f n are functions of time t t t n n h n 0 h is the step size of the time increment which is assumed to be constant and n 0 is the initial step the velocity vector x n and the acceleration vector x n of the particle are obtained by the central difference method as shown in equations 3 and 4 3 x n x n 1 x n 1 2 h 4 x n x n 1 2 x n x n 1 h 2 where x n 1 x n and x n 1 denote the displacement vectors of the particle at the time steps n 1 n and n 1 respectively equations from 1 to 4 can be used together to obtain the particle motion difference equation 5 and the relevant coefficients are shown in equations 6 and 7 5 x 1 h 2 f 0 2 m i h 1 ζ h 2 x 0 x 0 n 0 x n 1 h 2 f n m i 2 x n c 2 x n 1 c 1 n 1 6 c 1 1 ζ h 2 7 c 2 1 ζ h 2 3 3 the basic solving flow of vfife the basic flow of the vfife method for solving such a tcc cable net structure with large displacement is shown in fig 7 first the structure was discretized after modeling after that the external force p is applied to the structure so there is a displacement and deformation the internal force of the structure can be calculated by structural deformation then is necessary to determine whether the unbalanced force consisting of external and internal forces is less than the error limit δ if it is not less than δ the unbalanced force is returned to keep the structure moving if it is less than δ it is considered that the structure has reached equilibrium and thus the simulation results are obtained 3 4 numerical model of tcc fig 8 shows the numerical model of tcc taking the conical surface tcc as an example in this paper an arc with a depth of 40 m and a span of l 100 m is used as the rough boundary of the riverbed topography the bottom water level of riverbed is 0 m and the top is 40 m the towers on both banks are 10 m high and the top water level of them is 50 m as high as the highest water level of the river when the water level changes the water level of the floating tanks can be synchronously changed in the range of 40 50 m ensuring that the main cable is always on the water the tcc consists of 19 vertical cables numbered as shown in fig 8 and the corresponding anchor piles and floating tanks are also numbered in this order there are eight horizontal cables that have the role of a structural connection and their internal force is not the basis for the design for the elliptic paraboloid or conical surface their apexes are at the bottom of the riverbed and the base radius is r there is also rise of the main cable s for the elliptic paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc schemes in the numerical simulation it is assumed that the connections between the main cable and the towers on both sides as well as between the vertical cables and the underwater anchor piles are articulated vertical supports are provided on floating tanks to limit vertical displacement and keep them floating on the water surface the required buoyancy for floating tanks is obtained through vertical supports based on the hydrological data this paper assumes that the water pressure does not change with the change of water level and structural form and applies the most unfavorable water pressure of 200 pa along the water flow the pressure is first applied to the curtain and then redistributed to the cable nodes the material properties and design parameters of the main cable horizontal cables vertical cables and anchor piles are shown in table 2 it is assumed that the structural deformation is always within the limits of elasticity deenyma has lower strength than steel so steel was chosen for the main cable as for vertical and horizontal cables we chose deenyma instead of steel because steel cables are apt to rust in water and steel cables are so heavy that they add to the structural burden the cross section of cables was selected according to the breaking force and safety factor when this paper evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various schemes the expected goal is to achieve a higher load for the main cable and a lower load for vertical cables and floating tanks this idea is to design the main cable to be the strong enough component and even if the curtain or anchor is damaged in operation the curtain would not be washed away by the current thus avoiding the negative effect on the hydropower station also it is easy to replace the curtain in this conceptual design 3 5 numerical example a numerical example of the conical surface tcc is given in order to verify the feasibility and correctness of the simulation results obtained by the vfife method the water level is 50 m r 11 m and s 10 m the simulation results are imported into the general finite element analysis software ansys fig 9 shows the further displacement of the structure under the influence of the final balanced force system the maximum displacement is only 3 44 10 3 mm which means that the structure is no longer deformed and hooke s law is satisfied so the final balanced state of the structure is verified 4 mechanical analysis and comparison of schemes in order to obtain a more reasonable internal force distribution this section analyzes three tcc layout schemes with different parameters and under different water levels in order to evaluate the mechanical properties and make reasonable suggestions 4 1 parameter analysis for the plane tcc this section optimizes the plane tcc cable net structure by changing the length of the curtain the overall height l of the tcc can also be changed so that the structure can easily drum out in operation and the distribution of internal force is optimized for the overall height l in order to envelope different lengths of central vertical cable in other schemes 10 heights are set at every 1 m in the range from 51 m to 60 m fig 10 a shows the parameter settings and fig 10 b shows the internal force of the main cable f m at each height with increasing l f m gradually decreases and the maximum f m is 1679 6 kn when l 51 m the maximum internal force of each vertical cable f v under different parameters and the required buoyancy of each floating tank f b under different parameters are shown in fig 11 as f v appears at the bottom it is the same as the reaction force of each anchor pile f a which is not given for the sake of brevity as l increases f v and f b gradually decrease however when l 59 60 m the local stress concentration occurs in the vertical cables on the tcc edge the maximum f v and f b are 54 1 kn and 100 4 kn respectively which appear in the central vertical cable and floating tank no 10 when l 51 m the minimum f v and f b are 32 3 kn and 71 9 kn respectively which appear in the same place but when l 60 m although f m decreases with increasing l both f v and f b decrease which are more difficult to meet the requirements the optimal parameter is l 60 m 4 2 parameter analysis for the elliptical paraboloid tcc for the elliptical paraboloid tcc the parameter analysis is firstly done for the base radius r ten types of r ranging from 11 m to 20 m are set every 1 m as r increases the angle α between the vertical cables and the main cable will decrease so that the main cable can bear more load and the vertical cables and floating tanks can bear less load fig 12 a shows the parameter settings and fig 12 b shows f m with different r with increasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 278 3 kn when r 20 m f v and f b are shown in fig 13 as r increases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 62 2 kn and the minimum is 33 9 kn they appear in the vertical cable no 7 no 13 when r 11 m and r 20 m respectively the maximum f b is 104 9 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 6 no 14 when r 11 m the minimum f b is 71 9 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 3 no 17 when r 20 m in summary as r increases f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which fulfills the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m by reducing the rise of the main cable s the angle α can be further reduced in order not to make f m higher we keep r 20 m and six types of s ranging from 5 m to 10 m are set every 1 m fig 14 a shows the parameter settings and fig 14 b shows f m with different s with decreasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 590 8 kn when s 5 m f v and f b are shown in fig 15 as s decreases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 33 9 kn and the minimum is 30 4 kn they appear in the vertical cable no 7 no 13 when s 10 m and s 5 m respectively the maximum f b is 71 9 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 3 no 17 when s 10 m the minimum f b is 68 6 kn and it appears in the floating tank no 2 no 18 when s 5 m in summary with decreasing s f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which meets the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m and s 5 m 4 3 parameter analysis for the conical surface tcc for the conical surface tcc the parameter analysis is also firstly done for the base radius r fig 16 a shows the parameter settings that are the same as for the elliptical paraboloid tcc and fig 16 b shows f m with different r with increasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 253 4 kn when r 20 m f v and f b are shown in fig 17 as r increases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 71 5 kn and appears in the central vertical cable no 10 when r 11 m the minimum f v is 35 4 kn and appears in the vertical cable no 8 or no 12 when r 20 m the maximum f b is 114 5 kn and the minimum is 72 8 kn they appear in the central floating tank no 10 when r 11 m and r 20 m respectively in summary as r increases f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which meets the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m fig 18 a shows the parameter settings for s which are the same as for the elliptical paraboloid tcc and fig 18 b shows f m with different s with decreasing r f m gradually increases and the maximum f m is 545 8 kn when s 5 m f v and f b are shown in fig 19 as s decreases f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum f v is 35 4 kn and appears in the vertical cable no 8 no 12 when s 10 m the minimum f v is 31 6 kn and appears in the vertical cable no 7 no 13 when s 5 m the maximum f b is 72 8 kn and the minimum is 68 1 kn they appear in the central floating tank no 10 when s 10 m and s 5 m respectively in summary with decreasing s f m gradually increases while f v and f b gradually decrease which fulfills the design objectives the optimal parameter is r 20 m and s 5 m 4 4 comparison of schemes the optimal parameters and internal force extremum of the three schemes are shown in table 3 comparative analysis can determine that the difference of f v and f b obtained after optimization is small between the three schemes and that the main difference lies in the rise of the main cable s the plane tcc has a much higher f m than the other two schemes and f v and f b are also the largest among the three schemes when l 59 60 m the local stress concentration occurs in the edge vertical cables of the plane tcc which is not suitable for the structure the difference between the internal force extremum of the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc is small so these two schemes are better than the plane tcc further taking into account the construction convenience the conical surface tcc was chosen as the final scheme because its unfolding shape of the curtain is flat instead of curved 4 5 change in internal force under different water levels for the final scheme conical surface tcc this section shows the internal force change under different water levels due to the limit of tower height and the terrain 11 water levels h ranging from 40 m to 50 m are set every 1 m the optimal parameters in section 4 4 are used in the numerical model r 20 m and s 5 m fig 20 shows the structural forms under three typical test conditions and changes of different internal force ratios the ratio of f m between each water level and h 50 m is defined as e m similarly the ratio of f v is e v and the ratio of f b is e b with decreasing h e m e v and e b gradually decrease and reach the extremum value when h 40 m which is 0 972 0 902 and 0 895 respectively it is also proved that the nonlinear structural analysis method proposed in this paper is very effective for the force and form analysis of the flexible tcc structure 5 conclusions the flexible tcc is an effective way to treat the outflow low temperature water this paper proposes a new type of the flexible tcc and a nonlinear structural analysis method for the tcc structure the mechanical properties of different schemes are also evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the main components and the force transferring path of the new type of flexible tcc have been introduced the structure mainly consists of towers combined floating tanks cable net curtain and anchorage all parts of the tcc adopt a safer and more stable design than previous schemes 2 the nonlinear structural analysis method is proposed for the force and form analysis of the tcc structure it can solve the large displacement problem of this type of flexible structure more effectively than traditional methods the principle and basic flow of the static equilibrium solution are also described this provides a theoretical basis for the scientific research of tcc 3 three cable net layout schemes have been proposed the plane tcc the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc for the plane tcc with increasing l f m gradually decreases while f v and f b gradually decrease for the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc when the base radius r increases and the rise of the main cable s decreases f m increases and f v and f b decrease which meets the idea of achieving a higher load for the main cable and a lower load for vertical cables and floating tanks 4 the main cable force of the plane tcc is far greater than other schemes and local stress concentration occurs easily the elliptical paraboloid tcc and the conical surface tcc have similar mechanical properties by further considering the construction convenience the latter is better for application 5 under different water levels in the range of 40 m 50 m the structural forms and internal force change of the conical surface tcc are obtained as h decreases f m f v and f b gradually decrease the maximum change rate of key internal force is about 10 tcc is an effective measure for the treatment of the low temperature water for deep reservoirs and hydropower stations its simple construction and low cost show the potential for application in other similar engineering projects due to the special working environment the design criteria and code provisions especially the safety design are quite different from the current ones in the future it is necessary to determine the safety design criteria of each load bearing structure and to present the corresponding design method according to the severity of the damage to each part credit authorship
