5850,years of slash and burn activities across the tropics have led to very a patchy land cover with vegetation in various stages of regrowth but the associated effects on runoff generation remain under studied we analysed soil moisture perched water level and overland flow of dynamics during two periods 15 february 2 november 2015 and 20 december 2015 2 march 2016 for plots in a small catchment in eastern madagascar where slash and burn agriculture has been practiced for more than 50 years a 1 58 ha tree fallow tf2 a 1 93 ha terraced shrub fallow tsf and a 0 08 ha degraded grassland plot with regularly coppiced and burned eucalypt trees euc near surface saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k sat was distinctly lower beneath tf2 compared to tsf and euc leading to distinctly different perched water level responses and of occurrence of was highest for tf2 and lowest for tsf soil moisture content was lowest for euc resulting in the lowest antecedent moisture plus precipitation threshold for of occurrence 82 mm compared to 129 mm for tsf and 137 mm for tf2 of was generally in the form of saturation overland flow sof and reflected perched water level dynamics except at euc where the occurrence of a perched water level was rare during the first measurement period soil moisture responses to rainfall at euc were highly variable and became larger after harvesting and burning the plot prior to the second measurement period these results show that soil physical properties and runoff generation processes in areas with a long history of slash and burn agriculture can vary markedly over small spatial scales and need to be taken into account if catchment scale runoff responses are to be simulated or predicted 1 introduction slash and burn agriculture also referred to as swidden cultivation brady 1996 is considered to be responsible for up to 60 of past tropical forest loss geist and lambin 2002 lawrence et al 2010 and is still the main driver of deforestation across africa curtis et al 2018 although in many areas slash and burn cultivation is being replaced by more intensive forms of agriculture after improved access to local and regional markets it remains important in many forest agriculture frontier areas ziegler et al 2009 van vliet et al 2012 slash and burn agriculture typically results in a very patchy land cover with vegetation in various stages of regrowth present alongside cultivated fields malmer et al 2005 styger et al 2007 repeated cycles of burning and cultivation generally cause a decrease in soil organic carbon rooting density and soil faunal diversity and activity fragoso et al 1997 lavelle et al 2001 rossi and blanchart 2005 ziegler et al 2012 andriamananjara et al 2016 as well as in preferential flow paths shougrakpam et al 2010 zwartendijk et al 2017 in turn these changes often lead to a decrease in topsoil infiltration capacity ziegler et al 2004 hairiah et al 2006 zwartendijk et al 2017 thereby increasing overland flow surface runoff amounts and frequency mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 ziegler et al 2004 giertz et al 2005 however soil hydraulic and biotic characteristics typically improve again during vegetation regrowth ziegler et al 2004 colloff et al 2010 hassler et al 2011 zwartendijk et al 2017 lozano baez et al 2018 with concurrent decreases in overland flow of mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 chandler and walter 1998 patin et al 2012 thus the coexistence of degrading and recovering land cover types associated with slash and burn agriculture results in landscapes with highly variable soil physical characteristics and by implication potentially equally variable hydrological responses to rainfall ziegler et al 2004 patin et al 2012 however despite the importance of slash and burn agriculture and vegetation regrowth across the humid tropics fao 2016 mukul and herbohn 2016 quantitative studies of the processes and factors underlying the associated hydrological responses remain very limited ziegler et al 2004 measured near surface saturated soil hydraulic conductivities k sat for cultivated fields and various stages of regrowth in vietnam and compared these with prevailing rainfall intensities to infer the dominant runoff patterns cf bonell et al 2010 but the inferences were not checked by actual measurements of of at the plot or hillslope scale mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 measured very high amounts of of 36 40 of wet season rainfall during the cultivation phase and a gradual reduction during subsequent fallow regrowth down to 16 after 10 years in north east india but the lack of supporting information on soil moisture and or shallow groundwater dynamics precluded confirmation of the nature of the of i e infiltration excess iof or saturation excess sof dunne 1978 based on measurements on very small plots 2 m2 in brazil thomaz 2013 suggested that of and sediment loss decreased exponentially during the early stages of regrowth and were similar to those in the forest after 4 5 years of regeneration other studies have focused on small catchment responses to rainfall gafur et al 2003 compared streamflow from three 0 8 1 0 ha catchments in bangladesh for two years during which one basin was cultivated for a year although the wet season runoff coefficient for the cultivated basin was slightly higher than that of the nearby micro catchment under semi mature vegetation runoff for an adjacent basin with 5 7 year old regrowth was distinctly higher due to the shallower soils this rendered the experiment inconclusive in terms of the influence of land cover on storm runoff gafur et al 2003 fritsch 1993 studied the runoff response of ten micro catchments 1 0 1 6 ha under undisturbed lowland rainforest in french guyana that were to be subjected to various treatments after an inter catchment calibration period of two years stormflow runoff coefficients sensu hewlett and hibbert 1967 varied substantially between the catchments 7 34 due to differences in soil characteristics two years of traditional slash and burn cultivation increased stormflow relative to that for the undisturbed forest by 23 30 while mechanized logging increased stormflow by 26 during the first year and windrowing plus burning of the logging debris increased stormflow by 40 however stormflow ratios were no longer enhanced during the natural regeneration phase in subsequent years fritsch 1993 these previous studies have shown that slash and burn cultivation can temporarily increase of and the amounts of stormflow and that these increases typically decline rapidly during the subsequent fallow period however the hydrological mechanisms and interactions underlying such changes remain poorly understood and therefore difficult to predict the effects of slash and burn agriculture are likely to differ between sites depending on the surface conditions e g hydrophobicity after burning crusting and slaking during cultivation debano 2000 patin et al 2012 the drainage situation fritsch 1993 godsey et al 2004 bonell et al 2010 rainfall seasonality and intensity bonell 2005 krishnaswamy et al 2012 as well as the initial degree of degradation and time since abandonment the age of the vegetation not only governs the recovery of soil infiltration capacity through macropore development shougrakpam et al 2010 colloff et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 but also determines vegetation water use hölscher et al 1997 giambelluca et al 2000 ghimire et al 2018 these factors and processes interact in a complex manner but soil moisture content is affected by both processes and thus constitutes a key variable the relationship between soil moisture content and runoff is usually non linear cf coenders gerritsen et al 2013 zabaleta and antigüedad 2013 penna et al 2015 and often threshold like western and grayson 1998 noguchi et al 2005 detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 saffarpour et al 2016 similar findings have been reported for plots and micro catchments under contrasting vegetation types in the humid tropics chandler and walter 1998 godsey et al 2004 fu et al 2013 here we focus on the dynamics of soil moisture perched water tables and of for large plots with contrasting vegetation in the 31 7 ha marolaona catchment in upland eastern madagascar to better understand the hydrological processes in tropical catchments undergoing slash and burn agriculture the catchment has been used for slash and burn agriculture for at least 50 years a french research team measured of amounts between 1963 and 1972 bailly et al 1974 and observed higher of for a slash and burn agricultural site 5 8 of precipitation than a contour cropped site 2 6 and semi mature fallow vegetation 1 9 they interpreted these differences solely in terms of land cover and or soil management without considering possible differences in soil physical characteristics and related hydrological processes between sites we therefore measured the soil physical characteristics as well as the soil moisture and perched water level responses to rainfall and relate these to of occurrence for four of the former plots two zero order catchments and two former runoff plots for which results were not described by bailly et al 1974 specifically our objectives were to i examine the effects of land cover natural regrowth coppiced and burned eucalypt plantation and young regrowth on formerly terraced agricultural land on a soil water dynamics during rainfall events and b rainfall runoff thresholds and to ii relate differences in of amounts and frequency and soil moisture and perched water level responses between the plots to differences in soil physical characteristics as well as land use history 2 research area 2 1 study catchment the 31 7 ha marolaona catchment central coordinates 18 970 s 48 422 e is located in the southern part of the ankeniheny zahamena corridor an especially biodiverse area on the eastern escarpment of madagascar conservation international 2011 le saout et al 2013 fig 1 slash and burn agriculture has been practiced in the region for many generations and is the main driver of deforestation styger et al 2007 tabor et al 2017 after clearing and burning rain fed rice is typically grown for one or two seasons followed by a root crop mostly cassava after which the fields are left fallow until the vegetation is cleared and burned again to start the next cultivation cycle the duration of the typical fallow period in the region was 8 15 years in the 1970 s but has declined to as little as 3 5 years due to increased population pressure styger et al 2007 bailly et al 1974 described the land use in the catchment as a mixture of young fallow vegetation at varying stages of regrowth but generally 15 years and agricultural fields the current land use is equally patchy representing a mosaic of tree fallows 15 years old shrub fallows 5 years old regularly coppiced and burned eucalypt plantations for charcoal production and fire climax grasslands a single patch of older 25 years forest on a very steep slope and irrigated rice cultivation in the valley bottom fig 1 the fallows are dominated by the fern pteridium aquilinum the native early successional tree species psiadia altissima and harungana madagascariensis and the invasive shrubs lantana camara and rubus moluccanus clidemia hirta is the dominant native understory shrub table 1 the dominant grasses in the degraded land and below the coppiced eucalypt plantation are imperata cylindrica and aristida similis the elevation of the catchment ranges between 940 and 1000 m a s l the slopes are relatively short 60 300 m but moderate to steep 10 35 and generally convexo concave the bedrock consists of precambrian metamorphic and igneous basement rocks mostly granites and migmatites bailly et al 1974 du puy and moat 1996 on top of which tropudults have developed hervieu and randrianaridera 1956 andriamananjara et al 2016 with unconsolidated c horizon material extending to at least 3 m depth based on manual augering at four locations down to 5 m depth and information given by bailly et al 1974 the texture of the soils in the region varies between sandy clay loam and clay up to 45 clay at the surface increasing slightly at a depth of 60 70 cm andriamananjara et al 2016 the climate is tropical monsoonal köppen type am

section 4 2 2 2 research plots for this study two of the former zero order basins and two of the research plots that were established by bailly et al 1974 and were still in relatively good condition were re instrumented the current land covers are young tree fallow plots tf1 and tf2 a mixture of annually coppiced and burned eucalypt trees and degraded fire climax grassland euc and a shrub fallow on a formerly terraced slope tsf table 1 fig 1 the tf2 and tsf zero order basins and the euc plot were refurbished in february 2015 to measure soil moisture perched water levels and of amounts the tree fallow plot tf1 was refurbished in december 2015 because less data are available for tf1 and because of measurements at this plot are likely to have been affected by return flow based on the longer duration of flow at this site the present focus is on the results obtained for the tf2 tsf and euc plots although the data for tf1 are shown in the figures and tables for completeness plot tf1 consists of a rectangular plot 10 m wide 50 m long located about two thirds from the valley towards the ridge fig 1 and table 1 on a straight slope 25 it was bound by 10 20 cm wide and 5 15 cm deep furrows during the 1960s the plot was used for traditional slash and burn agriculture followed by regrowth bailly et al 1974 according to local inhabitants the plot was used for slash and burn cultivation during at least six five year cycles after the early 1970s and was last burned during an uncontrolled fire in 2010 the vegetation was circa five years old at the start of the study the dominant tree species was psiadia altissima 131 trees 100 m 2 average height and diameter at breast height dbh 3 2 m and 1 7 cm respectively table 1 and fig 2 a tf2 1 58 ha is a zero order micro catchment located on a convexo concave slope 10 35 fig 1 and table 1 and is drained by a v shaped rill that starts below the ridge and terminates 25 m above the runoff measurement structure at the end of the rill the hillslope is less steep due to sedimentation according to local inhabitants the plot underwent at least eight slash and burn cycles after 1972 the last cycle started in 1997 but the plot was last burned also during an uncontrolled fire in 2010 the circa 5 year old trees in the plot had an average height of 3 4 m and an average dbh of 2 8 cm depending on the species table 1 fig 2b the rectangular euc plot 10 m wide 80 m long is located about two thirds from the valley to the ridge fig 1 table 1 on a convex slope 15 25 the plot is a mixture of eucalypt trees and degraded fire climax grassland in the early 1970s a french forestry company replaced the shrubs and trees by eucalyptus robusta trees local residents have used the stand for charcoal production since 1994 before or after the wet season the branches are taken from the trees and burned in pits although it remains unclear whether the entire plot is burned each time during this process the trees were coppiced and burned at least once during the 2015 2016 study period thus tree height dbh and density could not be determined for this plot table 1 fig 2c at the tsf 1 93 ha zero order micro catchment slopes 15 25 fig 1 and table 1 low bunds were constructed to reduce overland flow and surface erosion during the investigations of bailly et al 1974 the site was used at that time for contour cropping along with the cultivation of fruit trees like banana since then the site was used for at least eight slash and burn cycles during which the bunds were allegedly not maintained however deposition of eroded material behind the bunds led to the formation of gently forward sloping terraces the last fire occurred in 2010 the vegetation at the time of this study consisted of a mixture of invasive notably lantana and indigenous mostly clidemia shrubs and grasses with scattered trees near the edges of the plot table 1 and fig 2d 3 methods 3 1 soil physical characteristics samples for soil texture analysis were taken at three depths 2 5 7 5 cm 12 5 17 5 cm and 22 5 27 5 cm at five equally spaced points along an upslope to downslope transect in the middle of each of the four plots fig 1 and combined into one bulk sample per depth for each transect the particle size distributions for the tf2 and euc plots were analysed at the vu university in amsterdam using a quixel helium neon laser optical system sympatec gmbh clausthal zellerfeld germany the particle size distributions for plots tf1 and tsf were analysed at the university of zürich switzerland using sieves and a sedigraph particle size analyzer micromeritics instrument corporation norcross usa two different samples from the euc plot were analysed at the university of zurich as well suggesting that the combined uncertainty from taking different samples and the two different measurement methods for the sand fraction is about 5 7 soil cores 100 cm3 were taken at the same five locations and depths along the transects as the samples for the determination of the soil texture the samples were weighed after five days of saturation after three days of gravity drainage and after 24 h of oven drying at 105 c to obtain the porosity based on the saturated and oven dried weights cf klute 1986 the moisture content at field capacity based on the difference between the weight after gravity drainage and the oven dry sample weight cf koorevaar et al 1983 and the bulk density based on the oven dry weight of the samples the rosetta model schaap et al 2001 was used to estimate the moisture content at permanent wilting point for each transect based on the soil texture and the median values of bulk density porosity and moisture content at field capacity the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k sat was measured at the same five locations along each transect as well measurements were taken at the surface using a portable double ring infiltrometer inner and outer ring diameters of 15 and 21 cm respectively constant head of 10 3 cm inner ring inserted 8 3 cm into the soil it is assumed that these measurements represent the k sat for the top 10 cm of soil the k sat at 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depths was measured using a constant head well permeameter amoozegar 1989 these measurement depths corresponded to the main soil horizons in the study area and allowed comparison of the results with other studies godsey and elsenbeer 2002 zimmermann et al 2006 2010 zhang et al 2019 further details on the sampling scheme and soil physical measurements can be found in zwartendijk et al 2017 3 2 rainfall rainfall was measured between 3 february 2015 and 3 march 2016 at two locations in the catchment fig 1 using tipping bucket rain gauges rain collector ii davis instruments hayward usa 0 2 mm per tip connected to hobo pendant event loggers onset computer corporation bourne usa a manual rain gauge skyview cm1016 sudbury uk 10 cm orifice diameter was placed next to the lower gauge and was read daily around 8 00 am as a back up the orifices of all rain gauges were located at 1 m above the soil surface to avoid ground splash effects total rainfall between 3 february 2015 and 3 march 2016 was 1522 mm for the downstream tipping bucket and 1534 mm for the upstream tipping bucket the difference 0 8 was considered negligible and therefore only the rainfall data from the lower tipping bucket gauge were used in the analyses no corrections were made for wind induced errors in the rainfall measurements because these were assumed negligible in view of the prevailing low wind speeds as measured at the nearby andasibe weather station ghimire et al 2017 3 3 soil moisture content volumetric soil moisture content was measured in the tf2 euc and tsf plots fig 1 using echo ec tm sensors at 5 cm and 15 cm depth and echo tm 5 sensors at 30 cm depth capacitance frequency domain reflectometry sensors accuracy 3 resolution 0 1 decagon devices inc pullman usa in the tf2 and tsf plots the soil moisture sensors were installed 10 m upslope from the lower plot boundary where of was measured in the euc plot the sensors were installed 5 m upslope from the lower boundary fig 1 the sensors were installed horizontally and pointed in the upslope direction measurements were taken each minute and 5 min averages were stored in a decagon em50 data logger due to logger malfunctioning and sensor replacement at the euc plot the soil moisture data were analysed for two separate periods period i 12 february 6 october 2015 236 days and period ii 20 december 2015 19 january 2016 30 days see also supplementary materials 1 3 4 perched water levels based on the low k sat values in the study region at 20 30 cm depth median of 0 9 mm h 1 for fifteen tree fallows shrub fallows and degraded fire climax grassland sites zwartendijk et al 2017 perched water tables were expected to develop at 30 cm below the soil surface hence a fully screened well 0 30 cm below the soil surface was installed 1 m from the soil moisture sensors in the tf2 euc and tsf plots to monitor perched water level dynamics fig 1 the water levels were measured each minute using a decagon ctd 10 sensor corrected automatically for atmospheric pressure and 5 min averages were stored on the em50 logger two additional screened wells were installed in each plot in december 2015 to allow measurements along the slope downslope mid slope and upslope fig 1 in these additional wells water levels were measured every 5 min using absolute or relative dcx 18 sensors keller ag winterthur switzerland the perched water level data were analysed for the same periods as the soil moisture data periods i and ii supplementary materials 1 3 5 overland flow in the 1960 s bailly et al 1974 constructed low concrete lined gutters tf1 and euc in combination with guiding walls tf2 and tsf at the downslope end of the plots to guide overland flow of into a collection basin where the outflow was measured due to damage to the original collection basins it was not possible to re use them in the same manner instead the concrete constructions were used to guide the of via a 7 5 cm diameter pvc pipe 11 cm in the case of tf2 into one or more 250 l drums supplementary materials 2 the depth of water in the drums was measured every day at 8 00 am and converted to a volume based on a calibrated relationship between water level and volume for each drum daily of amounts were corrected for direct rainfall into the of collecting system based on measurements with manual rain gauges installed next to the drums supplementary materials 2 due to repeated theft of the drums the number of drums used for the measurements varied over time therefore the of data were divided into two data sets supplementary materials 1 period a 15 february 3 november 2015 with a long data gap between 24 april and 18 july 177 days of data and period b 20 december 2015 3 march 2016 74 days during period a the drum set up changed multiple times but during period b it remained the same overland flow data representing multiple rainfall events were excluded from the analyses 3 6 data analysis 3 6 1 event response analysis the rainfall data were divided into events that had a minimum of 5 mm of rainfall and were separated by a rain free period of at least 3 h cf ghimire et al 2013 negishi et al 2006 antecedent wetness conditions prior to the event were estimated using three different proxies the total rainfall during the three api3 and seven days api7 before an event and the antecedent soil moisture index asi the asi is the sum of the product of the volumetric water content and the depth of each soil layer in this case 0 10 cm 10 22 5 cm and 22 5 30 cm and thus describes the total amount of soil water stored in the upper 30 cm of soil in mm prior to the event koorevaar et al 1983 detty and mcguire 2010 because soil moisture data were not available at 5 cm depth in the euc plot during period ii values measured at 15 cm were used to represent the first 22 5 cm of soil in the calculation of asi for period ii similarly soil moisture data at 30 cm depth were missing for the tsf plot during period ii and values measured at 15 cm were used to represent the lower 20 cm of soil in the calculation of the asi the soil moisture increase was defined as the difference between the volumetric moisture content at the start of the event and peak soil moisture during the event similarly the perched water level increase was defined as the difference between the perched water level at the start of the event and the peak water level during the event the response lag time was defined as the time between the start of the rainfall and the first increase in either the soil moisture content or perched water level the time to peak was defined as the time between the start of the response and the time of peak soil moisture or peak water level during an event the time that soil moisture contents exceeded 95 of the maximum measured soil moisture content was used to represent the duration of field saturated conditions a value of 95 of the maximum value was adopted rather than the core based porosity to define saturated conditions because the locations of the soil moisture sensors differed from those of the core samples and visual inspection of the soil moisture time series suggested that field saturation was reached at this threshold the duration of the response describes the time between the start and the end of the response the constant k method blume et al 2007 is frequently used to determine the end of the stormflow response but was used here to similarly determine the end of the soil moisture or perched water level response the sequence of soil moisture responses was classified for each measurement location and event following wiekenkamp et al 2016 1 sequential response the sensor at 5 cm responded first and the sensor at 30 cm responded last 2 concurrent response all sensors responded within the same 5 min measurement interval 3 non sequential response the deeper sensor responded before the shallower sensor s indicating the occurrence of preferential flow 4 not all depths responded volumetric soil moisture content did not increase at all depths 5 no response no increase in soil moisture content at any of the sensors 3 6 2 relations between soil moisture perched water level and overland flow the perched water levels were plotted against soil moisture at 15 and 30 cm depths to check whether the soils were indeed saturated when the pressure sensors indicated the presence of a perched water table supplementary materials s3 1 to examine the relation between overland flow occurrence and amount and the height of the perched water level the daily of amount was plotted as a function of the maximum perched water level supplementary materials s3 2 the soil moisture and perched water level responses were also plotted as a function of rainfall amount and intensity threshold values for the relation between asi p and of were identified using piecewise regression analysis following the method of oswald et al 2011 piecewise regression was not used to determine the thresholds for soil moisture or perched water level responses because the thresholds obtained using this method did not always agree with the visually determined thresholds instead we determined the rainfall thresholds for soil saturation or perched water table occurrence based on the requirement that a measurable response occurred for all events above the threshold this means that a response may have occurred also for some but not all events below the threshold for example the total rainfall threshold value for saturation to occur at 15 cm below the soil surface is the rainfall amount above which all events caused saturation at the 15 cm probe 3 6 3 statistical analysis we used the kruskal wallis analysis of variance on ranks kruskal and wallis 1952 with pairwise multiple comparison based on tukey s hsd test tukey 1949 to determine if the differences in the median values of the soil physical parameters per depth as well as differences in the median soil moisture and perched water level response time characteristics between the plots were statistically different differences in the median soil physical characteristics for the different depths and differences in the rainfall characteristics notably amounts and intensities between the different study periods were assessed similarly spearman rank order correlation r s was used to determine the relations between the event characteristics api3 api7 total rainfall amount maximum median and mean rainfall intensities event duration and event total of amount as well as the relation between of amount and the soil moisture increase and or perched water level increase we used spearman rank correlation also to determine the relation between asi plus rainfall asi p and of amounts we used a significance level of p 0 05 for all analyses 4 results 4 1 soil physical characteristics the texture of the topsoil 0 30 cm varied between clay and sandy clay loam fig 3 a clay content was similar for the tf1 tf2 and tsf

30 cm depth were similarly low 0 6 mm h 1 the k sat values of the soil beneath tsf and euc at this depth were higher 7 5 and 7 0 mm h 1 respectively but there was only a significant difference between tsf and either tf1 or tf2 p 0 01 fig 4 e k sat was not correlated to any of the soil physical characteristics except for a weak correlation with bulk density r s 0 30 p 0 02 and porosity r s 0 31 p 0

seasonality in rainfall supplementary material 4 1 the median 95th percentile and maximum 5 min rainfall intensities for the entire study period were 2 4 12 and 124 mm h 1 respectively corresponding values for the 1 hour rainfall intensities were 0 4 5 0 and 33 4 mm h 1 respectively of the total measured rainfall 1522 mm 39 597 mm fell at a 5 min intensity 10 mm h 1 while 26 401 mm fell at a 5

medians 30 40 and the terraced shrub fallow tsf medians 34 38 but note the limited data availability for tsf fig 4 soil moisture responded quickly to rainfall see fig 5 for an example the median soil moisture response lag time at 15 cm depth during period ii was 60 min for tf2 65 min for euc and 80 min for tsf supplementary material s5b the median response lag time and time to peak did not differ significantly between the plots and depths p 0 21 for the response lag time and p 0 37 for the time to peak supplementary material 5f non sequential soil moisture responses were common in tf2 59 and 60 of the events in periods i and ii respectively sequential responses were dominant at the euc plot during period i 86 of the events but were much less common during period ii 40 table 2 sequential responses were also common at the tsf plot 47 during period ii but other response types occurred frequently in the tsf as well table 2 there were no differences in the analysed rainfall characteristics for the different soil moisture response types probably due to the limited number of events per response type however visual comparisons suggested that for the tf2 plot non sequential responses were more common for large events of the 19 events larger than 20 mm eight had a sequential response ten had a non sequential response and one event a concurrent response this trend was different for the euc plot period i where sequential responses were common during larger rainfall events 14 out of 15 events with 20 mm of rainfall a concurrent response was noted for the other event as well as during events with a high rainfall intensity 10 out of 11 events with a maximum hourly rainfall intensity 10 mm h 1 the other event resulted in a concurrent response response types 4 not all depths responding and 5 no response at any depth were only common for events with low rainfall intensities and low api3 during period i soil moisture storage changes were larger in the euc plot than the other plots possibly due to the lower initial pre event soil moisture conditions at euc fig 6 a the soil moisture increase was also correlated with the 1 hour maximum rainfall intensity period i r s 0 39 period ii r s 0 60 p 0 03 table 3 and fig 6b the hourly rainfall intensity above which soil moisture did not increase markedly any more was 13 mm h 1 for tf2 but much higher for euc during period i 20 mm h 1 fig 6b there was no significant correlation r s ranging from 0 18 to 0 32 with p values ranging from 0 29 to 0 95 between the magnitude of the soil moisture storage change and the amount of rainfall during the preceding three to seven days i e api3 and api7 table 3 the total time that the soil was near saturation at 15 cm depth during period ii was largest for tsf 2 3 of the time and intermediate for tf2 0 3 the soil at 15 cm depth in the euc plot did not reach near saturated conditions during period ii table 4 there are no data for tsf for period i in this regard but near saturated conditions at 15 cm depth occurred for 0 8 of the time in both tf2 and euc during period i table 4 as expected near saturation occurred more frequently at 30 cm depth but again less frequently in the eucalypt and degraded grassland plot than in the tree fallow plot 0 4 1 4 of total time for euc and 2 4 5 1 for tf2 table 4 4 4 perched water level responses perched water tables occurred relatively frequently in plot tf2 22 out of 37 events 59 and nine out of 15 events 60 during periods i and ii respectively but infrequently at euc four events 11 and six events 40 during periods i and ii respectively in addition the water tables at euc did not rise within 17 cm and 13 cm from the surface at the mid slope location during periods i and ii respectively see fig 7 and supplementary materials 6 at the tsf plot a perched water table occurred during six events 40 during period ii fig 7 and supplementary material 6 likewise the total duration of perched water table occurrence in the top 30 cm of the soil during period i was much longer at tf2 than at the euc plot 11 7 of total time for the downslope slope well at tf2 versus 0 1 of total time for the mid slope well at euc fig 7 and table 4 during period ii the total duration of perched water occurrence was longest for the downslope well of the tsf plot 25 6 of the time and lowest for the mid slope well in the euc plot 3 4 fig 7 and table 4 the duration of near surface perched water table occurrence i e within 15 cm of the soil surface during period ii was also longest at tsf downslope well 2 3 of the time and lowest for euc mid slope well 0 1 of the time within a given plot the duration of the occurrence of a perched water table during an event was longest for the downslope wells median values 325 min except in the tsf plot where the perched water table lasted longest in the upslope well median duration 640 min versus 195 and 470 min in the mid and downslope wells respectively table 4 and supplementary materials 5k l in terms of rainfall thresholds during period i perched water levels increased by at least 100 mm for rainfall events 21 mm in plot tf2 and for events 39 mm in the euc plot similar threshold values were observed in period ii 24 mm for tf2 and 38 mm for euc for the tsf plot the threshold values were 24 mm for the downslope well and 38 mm for the mid and upslope wells fig 8 and table 5 however perched water tables also occurred occasionally before these rainfall threshold values were reached fig 8 the perched water level increase was relatively strongly correlated with event rainfall total and the maximum hourly rainfall intensity r s 0 70 and r s 0 68 respectively p 0 01 except for the mid slope well in the euc plot r s 0 40 p 0 01 and r s 0 36 p 0 03 respectively table 6 and fig 8 4 5 overland flow during period a 15 february 24 april 2015 and 18 july 2 november 2015 total rainfall of 390 mm 24 of the 44 rainfall events resulted in an overland flow response on at least one of the plots we excluded events for which of measurements could have included the response to more than one event during nine of these events representing 45 of the total rainfall and at least 60 of all measured of during this period some runoff collection drums overflowed fig 9 during period b 20 december 2015 2 march 2016 total rainfall of 388 mm all 25 events generated of on at least one of the plots but for five of these events representing 48 of the total rainfall and at least 83 of all measured of for this period some drums overflowed fig 9 as such the of amounts and associated runoff coefficients are significantly underestimated and cannot be compared however the data do suggest that event total of including the events for which the drums overflowed was correlated with event rainfall amount r s 0 60 p 0 01 the maximum and mean 1 hour rainfall intensities r s 0 50 p 0 01 table 7 and fig 9a h and api3 and api7 r s 0 35 p 0 09 table 7 and fig 9i l there appears to be a threshold in the relation between of amount and event rainfall total maximum rainfall intensity and antecedent rainfall conditions fig 9a l during period a events with more than 24 mm of rainfall caused of at tf2 the threshold was slightly lower for the euc and tsf plots 16 mm with the exception of one event of 34 mm which did not result in measurable of at tsf during period b of was observed during all rainfall events larger than 16 mm except at tsf where a 24 mm event did not cause any of fig 9a d a maximum hourly rainfall intensity 15 4 mm h 1 caused of in the tf2 and euc plots during period a the threshold appears to be smaller 6 4 mm h 1 for the tsf plot except for two events with hourly maximum intensities of 13 6 and 33 4 mm h 1 that did not cause of during period b all events with a maximum hourly rainfall intensity 10 mm h 1 caused of except for an event with a maximum intensity of 22 6 mm h 1 that did not cause of at the tsf plot fig 9e h there was no clear threshold for the maximum 5 min rainfall intensity for of to occur during period a but there appears to be a threshold of 43 mm h 1 during period b except for the tsf plot for which the threshold appears to be 58 mm h 1 the event total of amount was correlated with asi p r s 0 97 p 0 01 and r s 0 93 p 0 01 and r s 0 57 p 0 05 for the tf2 euc and tsf plots respectively fig 10 c for period i there appears to be an asi p threshold of 60 mm for of occurrence for the euc plot but there was no clear threshold for tf2 note that soil moisture data were lacking for tsf to determine asi p during period i during period ii the asi p thresholds for of occurrence were 137 mm for tf2 87 mm for euc and 129 mm for tsf fig 10a c the increase in of with increasing rainfall after the threshold was very small for all plots 0 5 of amounts were also strongly correlated with the duration of soil saturation table 7 for plot tf2 the correlation was stronger for period b than for period a r s 0 65 p 0 02 for all depths for period b vs r s 0 05 p 0 83 for 5 cm and r s 0 71 p 0 01 for 15 and 30 cm for period a for the euc plot the correlations at 15 and 30 cm depth were stronger during period a r s 0 70 p 0 01 for period a and r s 0 65 p 0 02 at 30 cm no saturation at 15 cm for period b table 7 fig 10e there was no correlation between the amount of of and the duration of saturated conditions at 5 cm depth during period a at either tf2 or euc table 7 the correlations became weaker or not significant especially for tsf after excluding events for which the drums overflowed supplementary materials 7 5 discussion 5 1 differences in soil physical characteristics between land covers the soil beneath the coppiced eucalypt and degraded grassland euc plot was distinctly sandier and denser than that of the other plots especially the top layer fig 3a this may reflect selective erosion of the topsoil particularly in the form of rain splash of clay particles because the ground cover especially litter was sparse and the topsoil possibly more water repellent after burning leading to a residual enrichment of sand particles alternatively it may also be caused by compaction by humans during the repeated coppicing activities cf ghimire et al 2014 and the frequent use of fire at this site cf doerr et al 2000 debano 2000 hirko diriba 2016 reported increased surface erosion in older eucalypt plantations in ethiopia and attributed this to repeated harvesting activities and surface compaction by human traffic similarly adverse surface conditions were observed by zhou et al 2002 in a coppiced but not burned eucalypt plantation in south china where the local population harvested the litter for fuel conversely application of herbicides and fire in a coppiced eucalypt plantation in vietnam did not have a negative effect on runoff production despite a major reduction in surface cover this somewhat surprising finding was ascribed to the presence of numerous earthworms creating abundant macropores podwojewski et al 2008 there was no statistically significant relation between soil texture and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k sat for the plots in the marolaona catchment similar to nearby within 10 km sites with vegetation in various stages of regrowth zwartendijk et al 2017 based on a review of 753 individual data sets for 144 different locations world wide jarvis et al 2013 did not find a clear relation between soil texture and top soil k sat either due to the presence of macropores the k sat of clayey soils can be just as high as that for non structured sandy soils jarvis et al 2013 found that the three most important predictors of k sat are bulk density land cover and soil organic carbon content based on a global set of tension infiltrometer data jorda et al 2015 found a small effect of clay content on k sat but the effects of land use and bulk density were much larger however for the studied plots the relation between k sat and bulk density was weak r s 0 31 p 0 02 and although the bulk density for the euc plot was extremely high fig 3d the k sat was not significantly lower than for the other plots except for tf2 fig 3e 5 2 soil moisture response to rainfall non sequential soil moisture responses to rainfall i e when the deeper soil moisture sensors respond before shallower ones were much more common in the tree fallow tf2 than in either the coppiced eucalyptus and degraded grassland euc or terraced shrub fallow tsf plots table 2 although soil moisture was only measured at one location in each plot this suggests that infiltration via preferential flow pathways bypassing the matrix may be more common in tf2 than beneath the regularly burned eucalypt plantation or the young shrub vegetation of the tsf site based on blue dye infiltration experiments at nearby sites zwartendijk et al 2017 demonstrated that infiltration in tree fallows and relatively undisturbed forest sites was dominated by macropore flow with limited interaction with the soil matrix while for degraded grass land sites infiltration was relatively homogeneous and less deep 0 15 cm similar differences have been reported for fire climax grassland versus regenerating vegetation in north east india by shougrakpam et al 2010 who further stated that macropores were typically destroyed during the cultivation phase of the slash and burn cycle the soil moisture responses in the euc plot were mostly sequential i e shallower sensors responded before deeper ones during period i suggesting that despite the likely presence of deep tree roots given the age and coppiced nature of the trees cf sikka et al 2003 preferential flow was less common here than in the tree and shrub fallows this is in line with the higher bulk density and greater degree of soil compaction for this site fig 3d however sequential soil moisture responses were less common during period ii despite the fact that the soil moisture content was higher figs 4 and 6 table 4 because the frequency of the different soil moisture response patterns did not differ for the two periods for tf2 table 2 it is likely that the changes in soil moisture responses in the euc plot are related to differences in runoff pathways possibly iof during period i cf burch et al 1989 scott and van wyk 1990 although an effect of sensor reinstallation cannot be ruled out either stoof et al 2014 showed that fire can increase preferential flow through increased spatial variability in post fire soil moisture content which might be an additional factor explaining the more frequent perched water table occurrence in the euc plot during period ii fig 7c we could not determine a clear effect of rainfall characteristics on the type of soil moisture response probably due to the small number of events for each response type however the results suggest that non sequential responses were more common during larger rainfall events for tf2 but not for euc wiekenkamp et al 2016 studied the spatial and temporal occurrence of preferential flow in a forested headwater catchment with predominantly silty clay loam soils in germany and found that catchment wide non sequential soil moisture responses and thus preferential flow were most common during large rainfall events demand et al 2019 found for sites in luxembourg that rainfall intensity and initial moisture conditions determined the occurrence of non sequential soil moisture responses and that these effects were particularly pronounced for clay rich soils 5 3 rainfall thresholds for overland flow occurrence despite the differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 3e the precipitation thresholds for of occurrence did not differ much between the plots 16 24 mm the thresholds together with the correlation between of occurrence and soil saturation suggest that of in the study plots was mainly of the saturation excess type sof the rainfall thresholds are comparable to the ones reported for annually burned imperata grassland 16 mm jasmin 1976 or pasture fallow with contour hedgerows in the philippines 21 mm chandler and walter 1998 and for shrub fallows in sub humid ethiopia after several years of exclusion of animal grazing up to 27 mm descheemaeker et al 2008 however they are substantially larger than the values 3 4 mm derived for wet season infiltration excess of generation on very degraded pastures in the philippines chandler and walter 1998 ethiopia descheemaeker et al 2008 and nepal ghimire et al 2013 for grazed eucalypt woodlands in queensland scanlan et al 1996 and disturbed himalayan pine plantations ghimire et al 2013 perched water tables occurred infrequently beneath euc during period i fig 7 hence the of measured at the euc plot was likely partly also of the infiltration excess type rather than solely sof some support for this contention comes from the mostly sequential soil moisture responses observed beneath the eucalypts during period i table 4 the lower rainfall threshold for of in period ii 16 versus 24 mm is in line with the generally higher perched water levels fig 7 during period ii further the site was burned for charcoal production shortly before the start of period ii which must have caused a temporary but marked reduction in soil water uptake until the trees re foliated again cf sikka et al 2003 thereby causing the soils to be wetter the fire also burned the grasses and litter cf fig 2c and heated the top soil the exposure of bare soil to erosive rainfall burch et al 1989 podwojewski et al 2008 possibly together with topsoil hydrophobicity debano 2000 doerr et al 2000 may have favoured infiltration excess of during the post fire period in the euc plot 5 4 runoff processes in the marolaona catchment the physical characteristics of the soils fig 3 and the frequency distribution of rainfall intensities in the marolaona catchment are such that rapid infiltration of rainfall is likely in at least the top 10 cm of soil median k sat 160 mm h 1 and locally down to 20 cm as well fig 3e however below 20 cm depth the median k sat was 7 5 mm h 1 in the coppiced eucalypt and degraded grassland plot and the terraced shrub fallow plot both located on the right hand hillside of the catchment fig 1 and 1 0 mm h 1 for the two investigated tree fallows located on the left hand hillside during the one year study period february 2015 february 2016 45 of all rainfall fell at 5 min intensities of 7 5 mm h 1 or more while 82 of the rainfall had hourly intensities larger than 0 6 mm h 1 supplementary materials s4 2 as such ponding of water at 20 30 cm depth during large and intense rainfall events will likely result in saturation of the soil and lateral subsurface stormflow ssf at shallow depth and sof for shorter periods during large or intense events cf godsey et al 2004 this is reflected in the correlation between the increases in soil moisture content and event rainfall total or one hour maximum rainfall intensity table 3 as well as the correlations between the increases in perched water levels and the 5 min maximum rainfall intensity table 6 and to a lesser extent the amount of of table 7 this general pattern was modulated somewhat by land cover type however the differences in the runoff responses for the investigated young tree fallow plot tf2 the coppiced and burned eucalypt and degraded grassland euc and the terraced shrub fallow tsf were smaller than expected based on the rapid decline in runoff and surface erosion observed on 2 m2 plots during a five year slash and burn cycle by thomaz 2013 in brazil this could be due to the fact that the vegetation in the marolaona plots was older than that studied by thomaz 2013 but the difference in plot size may have played a role as well cf woolhiser et al 1996 vigiak et al 2006 as discussed above the much less frequent occurrence of saturated conditions in the euc plot fig 7c the generally low moisture content fig 4 due to the high soil water uptake rates of the coppiced trees cf sikka et al 2003 and the possibly water repellent surface layers after burning cf doerr et al 2000 made iof important there the longer duration of measurable perched water level responses on the tf1 plot table 4 and fig 7 may indicate that the of included a certain amount of return flow here cf chandler and walter 1998 therefore the results for of amounts for tf1 cannot be compared directly however the respective thresholds for perched water table and of occurrence were similar to those obtained for the other plots suggesting that similar conditions were needed to produce sof at tf1 although perched water levels in the terraced shrub plot were generally high fig 7d the mid slope water table response was the slowest supporting materials s5h and 5p while of amounts were the lowest fig 10 these differences may be caused by the smaller topographic gradients and the greater soil moisture storage afforded by the low contour bunds bailly et al 1974 p 67 that gradually developed into forward sloping terraces through deposition of eroded soil material during successive slash and burn cycles cf mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 liniger and critchley 2007 similar moderating changes in storm runoff response after reforesting and terracing eroded hillslopes have been reported by tani et al 2011 and lana renault et al 2018 for sites in japan and the spanish pyrenees respectively 5 5 comparison of the current results with those reported by bailly et al 1974 because the continued slash and burn activities in the marolaona catchment may have affected the runoff generation processes it is of interest to compare the current results for of with those obtained by bailly et al 1974 for some of the same sites between 1963 64 and 1971 72 bailly et al 1974 measured of from three zero order catchments bv71 young regenerating forest control 1 36 ha bv72 managed terraced agriculture 1 77 ha our tsf plot and bv73 slash and burn agricultural plot burned before the start of measurements 1 73 ha our tf2 plot no observations were made in 2015 16 in the former bv71 site because the runoff gauging structure could not be found any more possibly because it was buried by eroded material in the course of time annual of totals during the wet year 1971 72 2141 mm of rainfall for the terraced agriculture plot bv72 tsf 187 mm 8 7 of p and the adjacent regenerating plot bv71 141 mm 6 6 of p were rather similar but much smaller than the 14 9 318 mm for the fallow plot bv73 tf2 supplementary material 8 despite the fact that the vegetation in the fallow plot was approximately six years old by then bailly et al 1974 interpreted these differences entirely in terms of land cover and management without taking differences in subsoil hydraulic characteristics into account cf fritsch 1993 infiltration excess of occurrence is normally much reduced after a few years of forest regrowth in the tropics thomaz 2013 patin et al 2012 2018 cf ziegler et al 2004 and one would thus expect of for the fallow plot bv73 tf2 to be less rather than more as was observed than for the terraced agricultural plot bv72 tsf our measurements of k sat and perched water levels at the tf2 site suggest adverse near surface drainage conditions fig 3e but surface saturation was not measured by the fully screened wells fig 7b while the degree of soil saturation measured by the soil moisture sensors at 5 cm was not larger than for the other plots table 4 this suggests that the high of amount from bv73 tf2 in the past may have represented a mixture of shallow subsurface stormflow and foot slope return flow imposed by the retaining walls of the runoff gauging structure at the time however by 2015 16 the old retaining walls had been damaged by roots of the surrounding trees and were likely much less effective at blocking any subsurface flow which would then have been recorded as of as such of amounts measured at tf2 in 2015 16 may have contained less return flow compared to the 1960s the relative difference in of amounts between the terraced plot bv72 tsf and the young shrub fallow bv73 tf2 was maintained in 2015 16 despite the multiple slash and burn cycles after 1970 this finding both confirms the importance of subsoil drainage conditions cf fritsch 1993 godsey et al 2004 which were less favourable for tf2 and the moderating influence that even rudimentary terraces may exert on runoff production cf tani et al 2011 lana renault et al 2018 bailly et al 1974 also showed that annual stormflow totals from the zero order catchments increased with annual rainfall least under regenerating forest bv71 and most for the fallow plot bv73 tf2 but during and after dry years p 1600 mm y 1 very little of was measured regardless of land cover type supplementary material 8 this may be interpreted as a confirmation of the dominance of sof in the past because appreciable amounts of of should have been recorded during occasional high intensity storms in dry years if iof would have been the dominant form of of our measurement period february 2015 march 2016 included two wet seasons but most rainfall fell in the first wet season total rainfall between march 2015 and february 2016 was 1089 mm representing 72 of the 1522 mm of rainfall recorded for the entire 13 month study period the lowest annual rainfall measured by bailly et al 1974 was very similar total of 1510 mm y 1 thus it is likely that of generation in the marolaona catchment was limited during most of our study period due to the relatively low rainfall differences in both of amounts and responses between the different vegetation covers might have been more pronounced if the measurements would have been made in a wetter year 6 conclusions we determined soil moisture and perched water level dynamics as well as thresholds for overland flow of occurrence in a small upland catchment in madagascar that has been used for slash and burn agriculture for more than 50 years measurements were made on plots in young tree fallows tf1 and tf2 a degraded grassland with regularly coppiced and burned eucalypt trees euc and a regenerating shrub fallow on formerly terraced land tsf to better understand how runoff generation processes may be affected by land cover and soil hydraulic characteristics the low saturated soil hydraulic conductivities k sat at 20 30 cm depth caused regular saturation of the soil above this depth and resulted in saturation excess overland flow sof for all investigated land cover types due to the lower subsoil k sat in the tree fallow plot tf2 soil saturation and shallow perched water tables occurred more frequently in tf2 60 of events led to perched water level increases median event duration of 340 min compared to the euc plot 27 of events with perched water level increases median event duration of 325 min for downslope well and the tsf plot 40 of events with perched water level increases median event duration of 470 min for downslope well there was a soil moisture index plus rainfall asi p threshold for the occurrence of of of was less for the terraced shrub fallow than for the degraded grassland and coppiced eucalypt plot even though their subsoil characteristics were similar this could be caused by the greater soil moisture storage afforded by the terraces on the tsf despite a lack of formal maintenance over the 50 year period since construction or reflect the occurrence of infiltration excess overland flow at euc due to the regular burning overall these results show that even though land use history can be highly variable over short distances in slash and burn affected tropical catchments the dominant runoff process notably saturation above an impeding layer and subsequent occurrence of sof may be similar however actual amounts of of from different plots will differ depending on the depth of the impeding layer due to contrasts in the erosion history it is thus important to include such small scale variations in drainage conditions and hydrological responses when simulating catchment scale runoff responses the amount of overland flow and the frequency of occurrence of a perched water table in the eucalypt plot varied between two measurement periods suggesting that the continued cutting and burning for charcoal production increased the temporal variation in hydrological response thus temporal changes in soil properties and thus likelihood of of occurrence are important as well and need to be considered when interpreting catchment scale runoff responses credit authorship contribution statement b w zwartendijk investigation conceptualization methodology formal analysis software

5850,years of slash and burn activities across the tropics have led to very a patchy land cover with vegetation in various stages of regrowth but the associated effects on runoff generation remain under studied we analysed soil moisture perched water level and overland flow of dynamics during two periods 15 february 2 november 2015 and 20 december 2015 2 march 2016 for plots in a small catchment in eastern madagascar where slash and burn agriculture has been practiced for more than 50 years a 1 58 ha tree fallow tf2 a 1 93 ha terraced shrub fallow tsf and a 0 08 ha degraded grassland plot with regularly coppiced and burned eucalypt trees euc near surface saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k sat was distinctly lower beneath tf2 compared to tsf and euc leading to distinctly different perched water level responses and of occurrence of was highest for tf2 and lowest for tsf soil moisture content was lowest for euc resulting in the lowest antecedent moisture plus precipitation threshold for of occurrence 82 mm compared to 129 mm for tsf and 137 mm for tf2 of was generally in the form of saturation overland flow sof and reflected perched water level dynamics except at euc where the occurrence of a perched water level was rare during the first measurement period soil moisture responses to rainfall at euc were highly variable and became larger after harvesting and burning the plot prior to the second measurement period these results show that soil physical properties and runoff generation processes in areas with a long history of slash and burn agriculture can vary markedly over small spatial scales and need to be taken into account if catchment scale runoff responses are to be simulated or predicted 1 introduction slash and burn agriculture also referred to as swidden cultivation brady 1996 is considered to be responsible for up to 60 of past tropical forest loss geist and lambin 2002 lawrence et al 2010 and is still the main driver of deforestation across africa curtis et al 2018 although in many areas slash and burn cultivation is being replaced by more intensive forms of agriculture after improved access to local and regional markets it remains important in many forest agriculture frontier areas ziegler et al 2009 van vliet et al 2012 slash and burn agriculture typically results in a very patchy land cover with vegetation in various stages of regrowth present alongside cultivated fields malmer et al 2005 styger et al 2007 repeated cycles of burning and cultivation generally cause a decrease in soil organic carbon rooting density and soil faunal diversity and activity fragoso et al 1997 lavelle et al 2001 rossi and blanchart 2005 ziegler et al 2012 andriamananjara et al 2016 as well as in preferential flow paths shougrakpam et al 2010 zwartendijk et al 2017 in turn these changes often lead to a decrease in topsoil infiltration capacity ziegler et al 2004 hairiah et al 2006 zwartendijk et al 2017 thereby increasing overland flow surface runoff amounts and frequency mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 ziegler et al 2004 giertz et al 2005 however soil hydraulic and biotic characteristics typically improve again during vegetation regrowth ziegler et al 2004 colloff et al 2010 hassler et al 2011 zwartendijk et al 2017 lozano baez et al 2018 with concurrent decreases in overland flow of mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 chandler and walter 1998 patin et al 2012 thus the coexistence of degrading and recovering land cover types associated with slash and burn agriculture results in landscapes with highly variable soil physical characteristics and by implication potentially equally variable hydrological responses to rainfall ziegler et al 2004 patin et al 2012 however despite the importance of slash and burn agriculture and vegetation regrowth across the humid tropics fao 2016 mukul and herbohn 2016 quantitative studies of the processes and factors underlying the associated hydrological responses remain very limited ziegler et al 2004 measured near surface saturated soil hydraulic conductivities k sat for cultivated fields and various stages of regrowth in vietnam and compared these with prevailing rainfall intensities to infer the dominant runoff patterns cf bonell et al 2010 but the inferences were not checked by actual measurements of of at the plot or hillslope scale mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 measured very high amounts of of 36 40 of wet season rainfall during the cultivation phase and a gradual reduction during subsequent fallow regrowth down to 16 after 10 years in north east india but the lack of supporting information on soil moisture and or shallow groundwater dynamics precluded confirmation of the nature of the of i e infiltration excess iof or saturation

similar to those in the forest after 4 5 years of regeneration other studies have focused on small catchment responses to rainfall gafur et al 2003 compared streamflow from three 0 8 1 0 ha catchments in bangladesh for two years during which one basin was cultivated for a year although the wet season runoff coefficient for the cultivated basin was slightly higher than that of the nearby micro catchment under semi mature vegetation runoff for an adjacent basin with 5 7 year old regrowth was distinctly higher due to the shallower soils this rendered the experiment inconclusive in terms of the influence of land cover on storm runoff gafur et al 2003 fritsch 1993 studied the runoff response of ten micro catchments 1 0 1 6 ha under undisturbed lowland rainforest in french guyana that were to be subjected to various treatments after an inter catchment calibration period of two years stormflow runoff coefficients sensu hewlett and hibbert 1967 varied substantially between the catchments 7 34 due to differences in soil characteristics two years of traditional slash and burn cultivation increased stormflow relative to that for the undisturbed forest by 23 30 while mechanized logging increased stormflow by 26 during the first year and windrowing plus burning of the logging debris increased stormflow by 40 however stormflow ratios were no longer enhanced during the natural regeneration phase in subsequent years fritsch 1993 these previous studies have shown that slash and burn cultivation can temporarily increase of and the amounts of stormflow and that these increases typically decline rapidly during the subsequent fallow period however the hydrological mechanisms and interactions underlying such changes remain poorly understood and therefore difficult to predict the effects of slash and burn agriculture are likely to differ between sites depending on the surface conditions e g hydrophobicity after burning crusting and slaking during cultivation debano 2000 patin et al 2012 the drainage situation fritsch 1993 godsey et al 2004 bonell et al 2010 rainfall seasonality and intensity bonell 2005 krishnaswamy et al 2012 as well as the initial degree of degradation and time since abandonment the age of the vegetation not only governs the recovery of soil infiltration capacity through macropore development shougrakpam et al 2010 colloff et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 but also determines vegetation water use hölscher et al 1997 giambelluca et al 2000 ghimire et al 2018 these factors and processes interact in a complex manner but soil moisture content is affected by both processes and thus constitutes a key variable the relationship between soil moisture content and runoff is usually non linear cf coenders gerritsen et al 2013 zabaleta and antigüedad 2013 penna et al 2015 and often threshold like western and grayson 1998 noguchi et al 2005 detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 saffarpour et al 2016 similar findings have been reported for plots and micro catchments under contrasting vegetation types in the humid tropics chandler and walter 1998 godsey et al 2004 fu et al 2013 here we focus on the dynamics of soil moisture perched water tables and of for large plots with contrasting vegetation in the 31 7 ha marolaona catchment in upland eastern madagascar to better understand the hydrological processes in tropical catchments undergoing slash and burn agriculture the catchment has been used for slash and burn agriculture for at least 50 years a french research team measured of amounts between 1963 and 1972 bailly et al 1974 and observed higher of for a slash and burn agricultural site 5 8 of precipitation than a contour cropped site 2 6 and semi mature fallow vegetation 1 9 they interpreted these differences solely in terms of land cover and or soil management without considering possible differences in soil physical characteristics and related hydrological processes between sites we therefore measured the soil physical characteristics as well as the soil moisture and perched water level responses to rainfall and relate these to of occurrence for four of the former plots two zero order catchments and two former runoff plots for which results were not described by bailly et al 1974 specifically our objectives were to i examine the effects of land cover natural regrowth coppiced and burned eucalypt plantation and young regrowth on formerly terraced agricultural land on a soil water dynamics during rainfall events and b rainfall runoff thresholds and to ii relate differences in of amounts and frequency and soil moisture and perched water level responses between the plots to differences in soil physical characteristics as well as land use history 2 research area 2 1 study catchment the 31 7 ha marolaona catchment central coordinates 18 970 s 48 422 e is located in the southern part of the ankeniheny zahamena corridor an especially biodiverse area on the eastern escarpment of madagascar conservation international 2011 le saout et al 2013 fig 1 slash and burn agriculture has been practiced in the region for many generations and is the main driver of deforestation styger et al 2007 tabor et al 2017 after clearing and burning rain fed rice is typically grown for one or two seasons followed by a root crop mostly cassava after which the fields are left fallow until the vegetation is cleared and burned again to start the next cultivation cycle the duration of the typical fallow period in the region was 8 15 years in the 1970 s but has declined to as little as 3 5 years due to increased population pressure styger et al 2007 bailly et al 1974 described the land use in the catchment as a mixture of young fallow vegetation at varying stages of regrowth but generally 15 years and agricultural fields the current land use is equally patchy representing a mosaic of tree fallows 15 years old shrub fallows 5 years old regularly coppiced and burned eucalypt plantations for charcoal production and fire climax grasslands a single patch of older 25 years forest on a very steep slope and irrigated rice cultivation in the valley bottom fig 1 the fallows are dominated by the fern pteridium aquilinum the native early successional tree species psiadia altissima and harungana madagascariensis and the invasive shrubs lantana camara and rubus moluccanus clidemia hirta is the dominant native understory shrub table 1 the dominant grasses in the degraded land and below the coppiced eucalypt plantation are imperata cylindrica and aristida similis the elevation of the catchment ranges between 940 and 1000 m a s l the slopes are relatively short 60 300 m but moderate to steep 10 35 and generally convexo concave the bedrock consists of precambrian metamorphic and igneous basement rocks mostly granites and migmatites bailly et al 1974 du puy and moat 1996 on top of which tropudults have developed hervieu and randrianaridera 1956 andriamananjara et al 2016 with unconsolidated c horizon material extending to at least 3 m depth based on manual augering at four locations down to 5 m depth and information given by bailly et al 1974 the texture of the soils in

section 4 2 2 2 research plots for this study two of the former zero order basins and two of the research plots that were established by bailly et al 1974 and were still in relatively good condition were re instrumented the current land covers are young tree fallow plots tf1 and tf2 a mixture of annually coppiced and burned eucalypt trees and degraded fire climax grassland euc and a shrub fallow on a formerly terraced slope tsf table 1 fig 1 the tf2 and tsf zero order basins and the euc plot were refurbished in february 2015 to measure soil moisture perched water levels and of amounts the tree fallow plot tf1 was refurbished in december 2015 because less data are available for tf1 and because of measurements at this plot are likely to have been affected by return flow based on the longer duration of flow at this site the present focus is on the results obtained for the tf2 tsf and euc plots although the data for tf1 are shown in the figures and tables for completeness plot tf1 consists of a rectangular plot 10 m wide 50 m long located about two thirds from the valley towards the ridge fig 1 and table 1 on a straight slope 25 it was bound by 10 20 cm wide and 5 15 cm deep furrows during the 1960s the plot was used for traditional slash and burn agriculture followed by regrowth bailly et al 1974 according to local inhabitants the plot was used for slash and burn cultivation during at least six five year cycles after the early 1970s and was last burned during an uncontrolled fire in 2010 the vegetation was circa five years old at the start of the study the dominant tree species was psiadia altissima 131 trees 100 m 2 average height and diameter at breast height dbh 3 2 m and 1 7 cm respectively table 1 and fig 2 a tf2 1 58 ha is a zero order micro catchment located on a convexo concave slope 10 35 fig 1 and table 1 and is drained by a v shaped rill that starts below the ridge and terminates 25 m above the runoff measurement structure at the end of the rill the hillslope is less steep due to sedimentation according to local inhabitants the plot underwent at least eight slash and burn cycles after 1972 the last cycle started in 1997 but the plot was last burned also during an uncontrolled fire in 2010 the circa 5 year old trees in the plot had an average height of 3 4 m and an average dbh of 2 8 cm depending on the species table 1 fig 2b the rectangular euc plot 10 m wide 80 m long is located about two thirds from the valley to the ridge fig 1 table 1 on a convex slope 15 25 the plot is a mixture of eucalypt trees and degraded fire climax grassland in the early 1970s a french forestry company replaced the shrubs and trees by eucalyptus robusta trees local residents have used the stand for charcoal production since 1994 before or after the wet season the branches are taken from the trees and burned in pits although it remains unclear whether the entire plot is burned each time during this process the trees were coppiced and burned at least once during the 2015 2016 study period thus tree height dbh and density could not be determined for this plot table 1 fig 2c at the tsf 1 93 ha zero order micro catchment slopes 15 25 fig 1 and table 1 low bunds were constructed to reduce overland flow and surface erosion during the investigations of bailly et al 1974 the site was used at that time for contour cropping along with the cultivation of fruit trees like banana since then the site was used for at least eight slash and burn cycles during which the bunds were allegedly not maintained however deposition of eroded material behind the bunds led to the formation of gently forward sloping terraces the last fire occurred in 2010 the vegetation at the time of this study consisted of a mixture of invasive notably lantana and indigenous mostly clidemia shrubs and grasses with scattered trees near the edges of the plot table 1 and fig 2d 3 methods 3 1 soil physical characteristics samples for soil texture analysis were taken at three depths 2 5 7 5 cm 12 5 17 5 cm and 22 5 27 5 cm at five equally spaced points along an upslope to downslope transect in the middle of each of the four plots fig 1 and combined into one bulk sample per depth for each transect the particle size distributions for the tf2 and euc plots were analysed at the vu university in amsterdam using a quixel helium neon laser optical system sympatec gmbh clausthal zellerfeld germany the particle size distributions for plots tf1 and tsf were analysed at the university of zürich switzerland using sieves and a sedigraph particle size analyzer micromeritics instrument corporation norcross usa two different samples from the euc plot were analysed at the university of zurich as well suggesting that the combined uncertainty from taking different samples and the two different measurement methods for the sand fraction is about 5 7 soil cores 100 cm3 were taken at the same five locations and depths along the transects as the samples for the determination of the soil texture the samples were weighed after five days of saturation after three days of gravity drainage and after 24 h of oven drying at 105 c to obtain the porosity based on the saturated and oven dried weights cf klute 1986 the moisture content at field capacity based on the difference between the weight after gravity drainage and the oven dry sample weight cf koorevaar et al 1983 and the bulk density based on the oven dry weight of the samples the rosetta model schaap et al 2001 was used to estimate the moisture content at permanent wilting point for each transect based on the soil texture and the median values of bulk density porosity and moisture content at field capacity the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k sat was measured at the same five locations along each transect as well measurements were taken at the surface using a portable double ring infiltrometer inner and outer ring diameters of 15 and 21 cm respectively constant head of 10 3 cm inner ring inserted 8 3 cm into the soil it is assumed that these measurements represent the k sat for the top 10 cm of soil the k sat at 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depths was measured using a constant head well permeameter amoozegar 1989 these measurement depths corresponded to the main soil horizons in the study area and allowed comparison of the results with other studies godsey and elsenbeer 2002 zimmermann et al 2006 2010 zhang et al 2019 further details on the sampling scheme and soil physical measurements can be found in zwartendijk et al 2017 3 2 rainfall rainfall was measured between 3 february 2015 and 3 march 2016 at two locations in the catchment fig 1 using tipping bucket rain gauges rain collector ii davis instruments hayward usa 0 2 mm per tip connected to hobo pendant event loggers onset computer corporation bourne usa a manual rain gauge skyview cm1016 sudbury uk 10 cm orifice diameter was placed next to the lower gauge and was read daily around 8 00 am as a back up the orifices of all rain gauges were located at 1 m above the soil surface to avoid ground splash effects total rainfall between 3 february 2015 and 3 march 2016 was 1522 mm for the downstream tipping bucket and 1534 mm for the upstream tipping bucket the difference 0 8 was considered negligible and therefore only the rainfall data from the lower tipping bucket gauge were used in the analyses no corrections were made for wind induced errors in the rainfall measurements because these were assumed negligible in view of the prevailing low wind speeds as measured at the nearby andasibe weather station ghimire et al 2017 3 3 soil moisture content volumetric soil moisture content was measured in the tf2 euc and tsf plots fig 1 using echo ec tm sensors at 5 cm and 15 cm depth and echo tm 5 sensors at 30 cm depth capacitance frequency domain reflectometry sensors accuracy 3 resolution 0 1 decagon devices inc pullman usa in the tf2 and tsf plots the soil moisture sensors were installed 10 m upslope from the lower plot boundary where of was measured in the euc plot the sensors were installed 5 m upslope from the lower boundary fig 1 the sensors were installed horizontally and pointed in the upslope direction measurements were taken each minute and 5 min averages were stored in a decagon em50 data logger due to logger malfunctioning and sensor replacement at the euc plot the soil moisture data were analysed for two separate periods period i 12 february 6 october 2015 236 days and period ii 20 december 2015 19 january 2016 30 days see also supplementary materials 1 3 4 perched water levels based on the low k sat values in the study region at 20 30 cm depth median of 0 9 mm h 1 for fifteen tree fallows shrub fallows and degraded fire climax grassland sites zwartendijk et al 2017 perched water tables were expected to develop at 30 cm below the soil surface hence a fully screened well 0 30 cm below the soil surface was installed 1 m from the soil moisture sensors in the tf2 euc and tsf plots to monitor perched water level dynamics fig 1 the water levels were measured each minute using a decagon ctd 10 sensor corrected automatically for atmospheric pressure and 5 min averages were stored on the em50 logger two additional screened wells were installed in each plot in december 2015 to allow measurements along the slope downslope mid slope and upslope fig 1 in these additional wells water levels were measured every 5 min using absolute or relative dcx 18 sensors keller ag winterthur switzerland the perched water level data were analysed for the same periods as the soil moisture data periods i and ii supplementary materials 1 3 5 overland flow in the 1960 s bailly et al 1974 constructed low concrete lined gutters tf1 and euc in combination with guiding walls tf2 and tsf at the downslope end of the plots to guide overland flow of into a collection basin where the outflow was measured due to damage to the original collection basins it was not possible to re use them in the same manner instead the concrete constructions were used to guide the of via a 7 5 cm diameter pvc pipe 11 cm in the case of tf2 into one or more 250 l drums supplementary materials 2 the depth of water in the drums was measured every day at 8 00 am and converted to a volume based on a calibrated relationship between water level and volume for each drum daily of amounts were corrected for direct rainfall into the of collecting system based on measurements with manual rain gauges installed next to the drums supplementary materials 2 due to repeated theft of the drums the number of drums used for the measurements varied over time therefore the of data were divided into two data sets supplementary materials 1 period a 15 february 3 november 2015 with a long data gap between 24 april and 18 july 177 days of data and period b 20 december 2015 3 march 2016 74 days during period a the drum set up changed multiple times but during period b it remained the same overland flow data representing multiple rainfall events were excluded from the analyses 3 6 data analysis 3 6 1 event response analysis the rainfall data were divided into events that had a minimum of 5 mm of rainfall and were separated by a rain free period of at least 3 h cf ghimire et al 2013 negishi et al 2006 antecedent wetness conditions prior to the event were estimated using three different proxies the total rainfall during the three api3 and seven days api7 before an event and the antecedent soil moisture index asi the asi is the sum of the product of the volumetric water content and the depth of each soil layer in this case 0 10 cm 10 22 5 cm and 22 5 30 cm and thus describes the total amount of soil water stored in the upper 30 cm of soil in mm prior to the event koorevaar et al 1983 detty and mcguire 2010 because soil moisture data were not available at 5 cm depth in the euc plot during period ii values measured at 15 cm were used to represent the first 22 5 cm of soil in the calculation of asi for period ii similarly soil moisture data at 30 cm depth were missing for the tsf plot during period ii and values measured at 15 cm were used to represent the lower 20 cm of soil in the calculation of the asi the soil moisture increase was defined as the difference between the volumetric moisture content at the start of the event and peak soil moisture during the event similarly the perched water level increase was defined as the difference between the perched water level at the start of the event and the peak water level during the event the response lag time was defined as the time between the start of the rainfall and the first increase in either the soil moisture content or perched water level the time to peak was defined as the time between the start of the response and the time of peak soil moisture or peak water level during an event the time that soil moisture contents exceeded 95 of the maximum measured soil moisture content was used to represent the duration of field saturated conditions a value of 95 of the maximum value was adopted rather than the core based porosity to define saturated conditions because the locations of the soil moisture sensors differed from those of the core samples and visual inspection of the soil moisture time series suggested that field saturation was reached at this threshold the duration of the response describes the time between the start and the end of the response the constant k method blume et al 2007 is frequently used to determine the end of the stormflow response but was used here to similarly determine the end of the soil moisture or perched water level response the sequence of soil moisture responses was classified for each measurement location and event following wiekenkamp et al 2016 1 sequential response the sensor at 5 cm responded first and the sensor at 30 cm responded last 2 concurrent response all sensors responded within the same 5 min measurement interval 3 non sequential response the deeper sensor responded before the shallower sensor s indicating the occurrence of preferential flow 4 not all depths responded volumetric soil moisture content did not increase at all depths 5 no response no increase in soil moisture content at any of the sensors 3 6 2 relations between soil moisture perched water level and overland flow the perched water levels were plotted against soil moisture at 15 and 30 cm depths to check whether the soils were indeed saturated when the pressure sensors indicated the presence of a perched water table supplementary materials s3 1 to examine the relation between overland flow occurrence and amount and the height of the perched water level the daily of amount was plotted as a function of the maximum perched water level supplementary materials s3 2 the soil moisture and perched water level responses were also plotted as a function of rainfall amount and intensity threshold values for the relation between asi p and of were identified using piecewise regression analysis following the method of oswald et al 2011 piecewise regression was not used to determine the thresholds for soil moisture or perched water level responses because the thresholds obtained using this method did not always agree with the visually determined thresholds instead we determined the rainfall thresholds for soil saturation or perched water table occurrence based on the requirement that a measurable response occurred for all events above the threshold this means that a response may have occurred also for some but not all events below the threshold for example the total rainfall threshold value for saturation to occur at 15 cm below the soil surface is the rainfall amount above which all events caused saturation at the 15 cm probe 3 6 3 statistical analysis we used the kruskal wallis analysis of variance on ranks kruskal and wallis 1952 with pairwise multiple comparison based on tukey s hsd test tukey 1949 to determine if the differences in the median values of the soil physical parameters per depth as well as differences in the median soil moisture and perched water level response time characteristics between the plots were statistically different differences in the median soil physical characteristics for the different depths and differences in the rainfall characteristics notably amounts and intensities between the different study periods were assessed similarly spearman rank order correlation r s was used to determine the relations between the event characteristics api3 api7 total rainfall amount maximum median and mean rainfall intensities event duration and event total of amount as well as the relation between of amount and the soil moisture increase and or perched water level increase we used spearman rank correlation also to determine the relation between asi plus rainfall asi p and of amounts we used a significance level of p 0 05 for all analyses 4 results 4 1 soil physical characteristics the texture of the topsoil 0 30 cm varied between clay and sandy clay loam fig 3 a clay content was similar for the tf1 tf2 and tsf

capacity was significantly correlated with porosity r s 0 76 p 0 01 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat was generally high to very high at the surface median for all four plots 850 mm h 1 but was an order of magnitude lower at 10 20 cm depth overall median 24 mm h 1 and yet another order of magnitude lower at 20 30 cm depth overall median 2 mm h 1 fig 3e additional measurements n 14 at 30 40 cm and 40 50 cm below the surface suggested an even lower k sat value of 0 4 mm h 1 although median surface k sat in the tree fallows differed markedly tf1 1250 mm h 1 tf2 160 mm h 1 values at 20 30 cm depth were similarly low 0 6 mm h 1 the k sat values of the soil beneath tsf and euc at this depth were higher 7 5 and 7 0 mm h 1 respectively but there was only a significant difference between

data were available i e 37 events and 343 h for period i 12 february 5 october 2015 and 15 events and 103 h for period ii 25 december 2015 19 january 2016 reflected the length of the periods and the seasonality in rainfall supplementary material 4 1 the median 95th percentile and maximum 5 min rainfall intensities for the entire study period were 2 4 12 and 124 mm h 1 respectively corresponding values for the 1 hour rainfall intensities were 0 4 5 0 and 33 4 mm h 1 respectively of the total measured rainfall 1522 mm 39 597 mm fell at a 5 min intensity 10 mm h 1 while 26 401 mm fell at a 5 min intensity 20 mm h 1 about one quarter of the measured rainfall 26 393 mm fell at a 1 hour rainfall intensity 10 mm h 1 and 10 151 mm at a 1 hour intensity 20 mm h 1 supplementary materials 4 2 about 82 and 32 of all rainfall fell at 1 hour intensities exceeding the median saturated soil hydraulic conductivities at 30 cm depth in the tree fallows 0 6 mm h 1 and in the euc and tsf plots 7 5 mm h 1 respectively fig 3e and supplementary material 4 2 suggesting more frequent ponding i e development of a perched water table at 30 cm depth in the tf1 and tf2 than in the euc and tsf plots see section 4 4 4 3 soil moisture responses soil moisture contents were invariably lower in the eucalypt and degraded grassland euc medians 18 29 depending on measurement depth than in the tree fallow tf2 medians 30 40 and the terraced shrub fallow tsf medians 34 38 but note the limited data availability for tsf fig 4 soil moisture responded quickly to rainfall see fig 5 for an example the median soil moisture response lag time at 15 cm depth during period ii was 60 min for tf2 65 min for euc and 80 min for tsf supplementary material s5b the median response lag time and time to peak did not differ significantly between the plots and depths p 0 21 for the response lag time and p 0 37 for the time to peak supplementary material 5f non sequential soil moisture responses were common in tf2 59 and 60 of the events in periods i and ii respectively sequential responses were dominant at the euc plot during period i 86 of the events but were much less common during period ii 40 table 2 sequential responses were also common at the tsf plot 47 during period ii but other response types occurred frequently in the tsf as well table 2 there were no differences in the analysed rainfall characteristics for the different soil moisture response types probably due to the limited number of events per response type however visual comparisons suggested that for the tf2 plot non sequential responses were more common for large events of the 19 events larger than 20 mm eight had a sequential response ten had a non sequential response and one event a concurrent response this trend was different for the euc plot period i where sequential responses were common during larger rainfall events 14 out of 15 events with 20 mm of rainfall a concurrent response was noted for the other event as well as during events with a high rainfall intensity 10 out of 11 events with a maximum hourly rainfall intensity 10 mm h 1 the other event resulted in a concurrent response response types 4 not all depths responding and 5 no response at any depth were only common for events with low rainfall intensities and low api3 during period i soil moisture storage changes were larger in the euc plot than the other plots possibly due to the lower initial pre event soil moisture conditions at euc fig 6 a the soil moisture increase was also correlated with the 1 hour maximum rainfall intensity period i r s 0 39 period ii r s 0 60 p 0 03 table 3 and fig 6b the hourly rainfall intensity above which soil moisture did not increase markedly any more was 13 mm h 1 for tf2 but much higher for euc during period i 20 mm h 1 fig 6b there was no significant correlation r s ranging from 0 18 to 0 32 with p values ranging from 0 29 to 0 95 between the magnitude of the soil moisture storage change and the amount of rainfall during the preceding three to seven days i e api3 and api7 table 3 the total time that the soil was near saturation at 15 cm depth during period ii was largest for tsf 2 3 of the time and intermediate for tf2 0 3 the soil at 15 cm depth in the euc plot did not reach near saturated conditions during period ii table 4 there are no data for tsf for period i in this regard but near saturated conditions at 15 cm depth occurred for 0 8 of the time in both tf2 and euc during period i table 4 as expected near saturation occurred more frequently at 30 cm depth but again less

occurred relatively frequently in plot tf2 22 out of 37 events 59 and nine out of 15 events 60 during periods i and ii respectively but infrequently at euc four events 11 and six events 40 during periods i and ii respectively in addition the water tables at euc did not rise within 17 cm and 13 cm from the surface at the mid slope location during periods i and ii respectively see fig 7 and supplementary materials 6 at the tsf plot a perched water table occurred during six events 40 during period ii fig 7 and supplementary material 6 likewise the total duration of perched water table occurrence in the top 30 cm of the soil during period i was much longer at tf2 than at the euc plot 11 7 of total time for the downslope slope well at tf2 versus 0 1 of total time for the mid slope well at euc fig 7 and table 4 during period ii the total duration of perched water occurrence was longest for the downslope well of the tsf plot 25 6 of the time and lowest for the mid slope well in

time and lowest for euc mid slope well 0 1 of the time within a given plot the duration of the occurrence of a perched water table during an event was longest for the downslope wells median values 325 min except in the tsf plot where the perched water table lasted longest in the upslope well median duration 640 min versus 195 and 470 min in the mid and downslope wells respectively table 4 and supplementary materials 5k l in terms of rainfall thresholds during period i perched water levels increased by at least 100 mm for rainfall events 21 mm in plot tf2 and for events 39 mm in the euc plot similar threshold values were observed in period ii 24 mm for tf2 and 38 mm for euc for the tsf plot the threshold values were 24 mm for the downslope well and 38 mm for the mid and upslope wells fig 8 and table 5 however perched water tables also occurred occasionally before these rainfall threshold values were reached fig 8 the perched water level increase was relatively strongly correlated with event rainfall total and the maximum hourly rainfall intensity r s 0 70 and r s 0 68 respectively p 0 01 except for the mid slope well in the euc plot r s 0 40 p 0 01 and r s 0 36 p 0 03 respectively table 6 and fig 8 4 5 overland flow during period a 15 february 24 april 2015 and 18 july 2 november 2015 total rainfall of 390 mm 24 of the 44 rainfall events resulted in an overland flow response on at least one of the plots we excluded events for which of measurements could have included the response to more than one event during nine of these events representing 45 of the total rainfall and at least 60 of all measured of during this period some runoff collection drums overflowed fig 9 during period b 20 december 2015 2 march 2016 total rainfall of 388 mm all 25 events generated of on at least one of the plots but for five of these events representing 48 of the total rainfall and at least 83 of all measured of for this period some drums overflowed fig 9 as such the of amounts and associated runoff coefficients are significantly underestimated and cannot be compared however the data do suggest that event total of including the events for which the drums overflowed was correlated with event rainfall amount r s 0 60 p 0 01 the maximum and mean 1 hour rainfall intensities r s 0 50 p 0 01 table 7 and fig 9a h and api3 and api7 r s 0 35 p 0 09 table 7 and

more than 24 mm of rainfall caused of at tf2 the threshold was slightly lower for the euc and tsf plots 16 mm with the exception of one event of 34 mm which did not result in measurable of at tsf during period b of was observed during all rainfall events larger than 16 mm except at tsf where a 24 mm event did not cause any of fig 9a d a maximum hourly rainfall intensity 15 4 mm h 1 caused of in the tf2 and euc plots during period a the threshold appears to be smaller 6 4 mm h 1 for the tsf plot except for two events with hourly maximum intensities of 13 6 and 33 4 mm h 1 that did not cause of during period b all events with a maximum hourly rainfall intensity 10 mm h 1 caused of except for an event with a maximum intensity of 22 6 mm h 1 that did not cause of at the tsf plot fig 9e h there was no clear threshold for the maximum 5 min rainfall intensity for of to occur during period a but there appears to be a threshold of 43 mm h 1 during period b except for the tsf plot for which the threshold appears to be 58 mm h 1 the event total of amount was correlated with asi p r s 0 97 p 0 01 and r s 0 93 p 0 01 and r s 0 57 p 0 05 for the tf2 euc and tsf plots respectively fig 10 c for period i there appears to be an asi p threshold of 60 mm for of occurrence for the euc plot but there was no clear threshold for tf2 note that soil moisture data were lacking for tsf to determine asi p during period i during period ii the asi p thresholds for of occurrence were 137 mm for tf2 87 mm for euc and 129 mm for tsf fig 10a c the increase in of with increasing rainfall after the threshold was very small for all plots 0 5 of amounts were also strongly correlated with the duration of soil saturation table 7 for plot tf2 the correlation was stronger for period b than for period a r s 0 65 p 0 02 for all depths for period b vs r s 0 05 p 0 83 for 5 cm and r s 0 71 p 0 01 for 15 and 30 cm for period a for the euc plot the correlations at 15 and 30 cm depth were stronger during period a r s 0 70 p 0 01 for period a and r s 0 65 p 0 02 at 30 cm no saturation at 15 cm for period b table 7 fig 10e there was no correlation between the amount of of and the duration of saturated conditions at 5 cm depth during period a at either tf2 or euc table 7 the correlations became weaker or not significant especially for tsf after excluding events for which the drums overflowed supplementary materials 7 5 discussion 5 1 differences in soil physical characteristics between land covers the soil beneath the coppiced eucalypt and degraded grassland euc plot was distinctly sandier and denser than that of the other plots especially the top layer fig 3a this may reflect selective erosion of the topsoil particularly in the form of rain splash of clay particles because the ground cover especially litter was sparse and the topsoil possibly more water repellent after burning leading to a residual enrichment of sand particles alternatively it may also be caused by compaction by humans during the repeated coppicing activities cf ghimire et al 2014 and the frequent use of fire at this site cf doerr et al 2000 debano 2000 hirko diriba 2016 reported increased surface erosion in older eucalypt plantations in ethiopia and attributed this to repeated harvesting activities and surface compaction by human traffic similarly adverse surface conditions were observed by zhou et al 2002 in a coppiced but not burned eucalypt plantation in south china where the local population harvested the litter for fuel conversely application of herbicides and fire in a coppiced eucalypt plantation in vietnam did not have a negative effect on runoff production despite a major reduction in surface cover this somewhat surprising finding was ascribed to the presence of numerous earthworms creating abundant macropores podwojewski et al 2008 there was no statistically significant relation between soil texture and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k sat for the plots in the marolaona catchment similar to nearby within 10 km sites with vegetation in various stages of regrowth zwartendijk et al 2017 based on a review of 753 individual data sets for 144 different locations world wide jarvis et al 2013 did not find a clear relation between soil texture and top soil k sat either due to the presence of macropores the k sat of clayey soils can be just as high as that for non structured sandy soils jarvis et al 2013 found that the three most important predictors of k sat are bulk density land cover and soil organic carbon content based on a global set of tension infiltrometer data jorda et al 2015 found a small effect of clay content on k sat but the effects of land use and bulk density were much larger however for the studied plots the relation between k sat and bulk density was weak r s 0 31 p 0 02 and although the bulk density for the euc plot was extremely high fig 3d the k sat was not significantly lower than for the other plots except for tf2 fig 3e 5 2 soil moisture response to rainfall non sequential soil moisture responses to rainfall i e when the deeper soil moisture sensors respond before shallower ones were much more common in the tree fallow tf2 than in either the coppiced eucalyptus and degraded grassland euc or terraced shrub fallow tsf plots table 2 although soil moisture was only measured at one location in each plot this suggests that infiltration via preferential flow pathways bypassing the matrix may be more common in tf2 than beneath the regularly burned eucalypt plantation or the young shrub vegetation of the tsf site based on blue dye infiltration experiments at nearby sites zwartendijk et al 2017 demonstrated that infiltration in tree fallows and relatively undisturbed forest sites was dominated by macropore flow with limited interaction with the soil matrix while for degraded grass land sites infiltration was relatively homogeneous and less deep 0 15 cm similar differences have been reported for fire climax grassland versus regenerating vegetation in north east india by shougrakpam et al 2010 who further stated that macropores were typically destroyed during the cultivation phase of the slash and burn cycle the soil moisture responses in the euc plot were mostly sequential i e shallower sensors responded before deeper ones during period i suggesting that despite the likely presence of deep tree roots given the age and coppiced nature of the trees cf sikka et al 2003 preferential flow was less common here than in the tree and shrub fallows this is in line with the higher bulk density and greater degree of soil compaction for this site fig 3d however sequential soil moisture responses were less common during period ii despite the fact that the soil moisture content was higher figs 4 and 6 table 4 because the frequency of the different soil moisture response patterns did not differ for the two periods for tf2 table 2 it is likely that the changes in soil moisture responses in the euc plot are related to differences in runoff pathways possibly iof during period i cf burch et al 1989 scott and van wyk 1990 although an effect of sensor reinstallation cannot be ruled out either stoof et al 2014 showed that fire can increase preferential flow through increased spatial variability in post fire soil moisture content which might be an additional factor explaining the more frequent perched water table occurrence in the euc plot during period ii fig 7c we could not determine a clear effect of rainfall characteristics on the type of soil moisture response probably due to the small number of events for each response type however the results suggest that non sequential responses were more common during larger rainfall events for tf2 but not for euc wiekenkamp et al 2016 studied the spatial and temporal occurrence of preferential flow in a forested headwater catchment with predominantly silty clay loam soils in germany and found that catchment wide non sequential soil moisture responses and thus preferential flow were most common during large rainfall events demand et al 2019 found for sites in luxembourg that rainfall intensity and initial moisture conditions determined the occurrence of non sequential soil moisture responses and that these effects were particularly pronounced for clay rich soils 5 3 rainfall thresholds for overland flow occurrence despite the differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 3e the precipitation thresholds for of occurrence did not differ much between the plots 16 24 mm the thresholds together with the correlation between of occurrence and soil saturation suggest that of in the study plots was mainly of the saturation excess type sof the rainfall thresholds are comparable to the ones reported for annually burned imperata grassland 16 mm jasmin 1976 or pasture fallow with contour hedgerows in the philippines 21 mm chandler and walter 1998 and for shrub fallows in sub humid ethiopia after several years of exclusion of animal grazing up to 27 mm descheemaeker et al 2008 however they are substantially larger than the values 3 4 mm derived for wet season infiltration excess of generation on very degraded pastures in the philippines chandler and walter 1998 ethiopia descheemaeker et al 2008 and nepal ghimire et al 2013 for grazed eucalypt woodlands in queensland scanlan et al 1996 and disturbed himalayan pine plantations ghimire et al 2013 perched water tables occurred infrequently beneath euc during period i fig 7 hence the of measured at the euc plot was likely partly also of the infiltration excess type rather than solely sof some support for this contention comes from the mostly sequential soil moisture responses observed beneath the eucalypts during period i table 4 the lower rainfall threshold for of in period ii 16 versus 24 mm is in line with the generally higher perched water levels fig 7 during period ii further the site was burned for charcoal production shortly before the start of period ii which must have caused a temporary but marked reduction in soil water uptake until the trees re foliated again cf sikka et al 2003 thereby causing the soils to be wetter the fire also burned the grasses and litter cf fig 2c and heated the top soil the exposure of bare soil to erosive rainfall burch et al 1989 podwojewski et al 2008 possibly together with topsoil hydrophobicity debano 2000 doerr et al 2000 may have favoured infiltration excess of during the post fire period in the euc plot 5 4 runoff processes in the marolaona catchment the physical characteristics of the soils fig 3 and the frequency distribution of rainfall intensities in the marolaona catchment are such that rapid infiltration of rainfall is likely in at least the top 10 cm of soil median k sat 160 mm h 1 and locally down to 20 cm as well fig 3e however below 20 cm depth the median k sat was 7 5 mm h 1 in the coppiced eucalypt and degraded grassland plot and the terraced shrub fallow plot both located on the right hand hillside of the catchment fig 1 and 1 0 mm h 1 for the two investigated tree fallows located on the left hand hillside during the one year study period february 2015 february 2016 45 of all rainfall fell at 5 min intensities of 7 5 mm h 1 or more while 82 of the rainfall had hourly intensities larger than 0 6 mm h 1 supplementary materials s4 2 as such ponding of water at 20 30 cm depth during large and intense rainfall events will likely result in saturation of the soil and lateral subsurface stormflow ssf at shallow depth and sof for shorter periods during large or intense events cf godsey et al 2004 this is reflected in the correlation between the increases in soil moisture content and event rainfall total or one hour maximum rainfall intensity table 3 as well as the correlations between the increases in perched water levels and the 5 min maximum rainfall intensity table 6 and to a lesser extent the amount of of table 7 this general pattern was modulated somewhat by land cover type however the differences in the runoff responses for the investigated young tree fallow plot tf2 the coppiced and burned eucalypt and degraded grassland euc and the terraced shrub fallow tsf were smaller than expected based on the rapid decline in runoff and surface erosion observed on 2 m2 plots during a five year slash and burn cycle by thomaz 2013 in brazil this could be due to the fact that the vegetation in the marolaona plots was older than that studied by thomaz 2013 but the difference in plot size may have played a role as well cf woolhiser et al 1996 vigiak et al 2006 as discussed above the much less frequent occurrence of saturated conditions in the euc plot fig 7c the generally low moisture content fig 4 due to the high soil water uptake rates of the coppiced trees cf sikka et al 2003 and the possibly water repellent surface layers after burning cf doerr et al 2000 made iof important there the longer duration of measurable perched water level responses on the tf1 plot table 4 and fig 7 may indicate that the of included a certain amount of return flow here cf chandler and walter 1998 therefore the results for of amounts for tf1 cannot be compared directly however the respective thresholds for perched water table and of occurrence were similar to those obtained for the other plots suggesting that similar conditions were needed to produce sof at tf1 although perched water levels in the terraced shrub plot were generally high fig 7d the mid slope water table response was the slowest supporting materials s5h and 5p while of amounts were the lowest fig 10 these differences may be caused by the smaller topographic gradients and the greater soil moisture storage afforded by the low contour bunds bailly et al 1974 p 67 that gradually developed into forward sloping terraces through deposition of eroded soil material during successive slash and burn cycles cf mishra and ramakrishnan 1983 liniger and critchley 2007 similar moderating changes in storm runoff response after reforesting and terracing eroded hillslopes have been reported by tani et al 2011 and lana renault et al 2018 for sites in japan and the spanish pyrenees respectively 5 5 comparison of the current results with those reported by bailly et al 1974 because the continued slash and burn activities in the marolaona catchment may have affected the runoff generation processes it is of interest to compare the current results for of with those obtained by bailly et al 1974 for some of the same sites between 1963 64 and 1971 72 bailly et al 1974 measured of from three zero order catchments bv71 young regenerating forest control 1 36 ha bv72 managed terraced agriculture 1 77 ha our tsf plot and bv73 slash and burn agricultural plot burned before the start of measurements 1 73 ha our tf2 plot no observations were made in 2015 16 in the former bv71 site because the runoff gauging structure could not be found any more possibly because it was buried by eroded material in the course of time annual of totals during the wet year 1971 72 2141 mm of rainfall for the terraced agriculture plot bv72 tsf 187 mm 8 7 of p and the adjacent regenerating plot bv71 141 mm 6 6 of p were rather similar but much smaller than the 14 9 318 mm for the fallow plot bv73 tf2 supplementary material 8 despite the fact that the vegetation in the fallow plot was approximately six years old by then bailly et al 1974 interpreted these differences entirely in terms of land cover and management without taking differences in subsoil hydraulic characteristics into account cf fritsch 1993 infiltration excess of occurrence is normally much reduced after a few years of forest regrowth in the tropics thomaz 2013 patin et al 2012 2018 cf ziegler et al 2004 and one would thus expect of for the fallow plot bv73 tf2 to be less rather than more as was observed than for the terraced agricultural plot bv72 tsf our measurements of k sat and perched water levels at the tf2 site suggest adverse near surface drainage conditions fig 3e but surface saturation was not measured by the fully screened wells fig 7b while the degree of soil saturation measured by the soil moisture sensors at 5 cm was not larger than for the other plots table 4 this suggests that the high of amount from bv73 tf2 in the past may have represented a mixture of shallow subsurface stormflow and foot slope return flow imposed by the retaining walls of the runoff gauging structure at the time however by 2015 16 the old retaining walls had been damaged by roots of the surrounding trees and were likely much less effective at blocking any subsurface flow which would then have been recorded as of as such of amounts measured at tf2 in 2015 16 may have contained less return flow compared to the 1960s the relative difference in of amounts between the terraced plot bv72 tsf and the young shrub fallow bv73 tf2 was maintained in 2015 16 despite the multiple slash and burn cycles after 1970 this finding both confirms the importance of subsoil drainage conditions cf fritsch 1993 godsey et al 2004 which were less favourable for tf2 and the moderating influence that even rudimentary terraces may exert on runoff production cf tani et al 2011 lana renault et al 2018 bailly et al 1974 also showed that annual stormflow totals from the zero order catchments increased with annual rainfall least under regenerating forest bv71 and most for the fallow plot bv73 tf2 but during and after dry years p 1600 mm y 1 very little of was measured regardless of land cover type supplementary material 8 this may be interpreted as a confirmation of the dominance of sof in the past because appreciable amounts of of should have been recorded during occasional high intensity storms in dry years if iof would have been the dominant form of of our measurement period february 2015 march 2016 included two wet seasons but most rainfall fell in the first wet season total rainfall between march 2015 and february 2016 was 1089 mm representing 72 of the 1522 mm of rainfall recorded for the entire 13 month study period the lowest annual rainfall measured by bailly et al 1974 was very similar total of 1510 mm y 1 thus it is likely that of generation in the marolaona catchment was limited during most of our study period due to the relatively low rainfall differences in both of amounts and responses between the different vegetation covers might have been more pronounced if the measurements would have been made in a wetter year 6 conclusions we determined soil moisture and perched water level dynamics as well as thresholds for overland flow of occurrence in a small upland catchment in madagascar that has been used for slash and burn agriculture for more than 50 years measurements were made on plots in young tree fallows tf1 and tf2 a degraded grassland with regularly coppiced and burned eucalypt trees euc and a regenerating shrub fallow on formerly terraced land tsf to better understand how runoff generation processes may be affected by land cover and soil hydraulic characteristics the low saturated soil hydraulic conductivities k sat at 20 30 cm depth caused regular saturation of the soil above this depth and resulted in saturation excess overland flow sof for all investigated land cover types due to the lower subsoil k sat in the tree fallow plot tf2 soil saturation and shallow perched water tables occurred more frequently in tf2 60 of events led to perched water level increases median event duration of 340 min compared to the euc plot 27 of events with perched water level increases median event duration of 325 min for downslope well and the tsf plot 40 of events with perched water level increases median event duration of 470 min for downslope well there was a soil moisture index plus rainfall asi p threshold for the occurrence of of of was less for the terraced shrub fallow than for the degraded grassland and coppiced eucalypt plot even though their subsoil characteristics were similar this could be caused by the greater soil moisture storage afforded by the terraces on the tsf despite a lack of formal maintenance over the 50 year period since construction or reflect the occurrence of infiltration excess overland flow at euc due to the regular burning overall these results show that even though land use history can be highly variable over short distances in slash and burn affected tropical catchments the dominant runoff process notably saturation above an impeding layer and subsequent occurrence of sof may be similar however actual amounts of of from different plots will differ depending on the depth of the impeding layer due to contrasts in the erosion history it is thus important to include such small scale variations in drainage conditions and hydrological responses when simulating catchment scale runoff responses the amount of overland flow and the frequency of occurrence of a perched water table in the eucalypt plot varied between two measurement periods suggesting that the continued cutting and burning for charcoal production increased the temporal variation in hydrological response thus temporal changes in soil properties and thus likelihood of of occurrence are important as well and need to be considered when interpreting catchment scale runoff responses credit authorship contribution statement b w zwartendijk investigation conceptualization methodology formal analysis software

5851,extreme rainfall is becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change and increasing human activity changes in rainfall will increase the risks and uncertainty of water erosion from orchards groundcover management is an important factor affecting hydrological and erosive processes of orchards however the roles of different groundcover managements for controlling soil water erosion caused by extreme rainfall are not fully understood in this study four groundcover managements i e control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with grass cover and orchard with cover crops were used to analyze runoff and erosion characteristics related to extreme and ordinary rainfalls in the red soil region of china based on the rainfall runoff data measured on runoff plots 356 natural rainfall events from 2001 to 2012 were analyzed and rainfall depths and maximum 30 min rainfall intensities were used to select extreme rainfall events according to the criteria of the world meteorological organization for extreme rainfall there were 25 extreme rainfall events with a probability of 7 0 during the study period extreme rainfall events played the destructive role in inducing soil loss the average extreme runoff coefficient and soil loss amount were 2 8 and 11 1 times higher than the values from ordinary rainfall respectively the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield was 44 2 which far higher than those to runoff generation 15 8 moreover the runoff coefficients and erosion amounts varied greatly among the different groundcover managements under extreme rainfall and were ranked in the following order control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with cover crops orchard with grass cover however the highest percentage of soil loss amount caused by extreme rainfalls were 59 0 in orchard with cover crops and the lowest in orchard with grass cover 26 0 therefore extreme rainfall should cause more attention in improving the groundcover management strategy for orchard soil erosion control and groundcover like grass cover was extremely needed even after interplanting crops for the serious soil loss keywords water erosion extreme

2017 bonetti et al 2019 for a long period the red soil region of southern china has been facing severe soil and water loss due to high precipitation hilly landforms and unsustainable farming practices barton et al 2004 liang et al 2010 shi et al 2014 fang et al 2017 in recent decades with the rapid growth of human population 40 of china s population and heavy pressure on productive soil resources increasing amounts of barren land with a secondary community on the slopes have been transformed into orchards zuazo et al 2005 xu et al 2012 li et al 2014 chen et al 2019 hilly citrus orchards are widely distributed in this region due to their additional economic benefits meanwhile citrus orchard lands are exposed to serious risks of soil and water loss due to the intense soil disturbances from large scale mechanized excavation and the lack of surface vegetation cover durán zuazo et al 2005 prosdocimi et al 2016 comino et al 2018 soil and water conservation measures on soil surfaces are rarely implemented for orchard production relevant groundcover measures are very infrequent and further research is necessary to assess the sustainable groundcover management strategies groundcover management is an important factor that affects water erosion processes in orchards vegetation free groundcover management such as herbicides spraying and mechanical weeding have been widely implemented to maximize commercial production in conventional orchards novara et al 2011 keesstra et al 2016 prosdocimi et al 2016 the management method with bare soil year round decreased soil infiltration and favored runoff production and sediment yields francia martinez et al 2006 cerdà et al 2009 in contrast groundcover vegetation provided mechanical soil protection by increasing water infiltration and by reducing splash erosion and concentrated flow erosion kinnell 2005 martinez raya et al 2006 novara et al 2011 ferreira et al 2018 although the effects of groundcover management on runoff and erosion have been discussed in previous studies comparisons between different groundcover management strategies in citrus orchards have yet to be examined soil and water loss processes are strongly influenced by factors other than groundcover among these factors rainfall characteristics are expected to be the most frequently mentioned kinnell 2005 ran et al 2012 nearing et al 2017 huang

chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 as a consequence the severe water erosion and disaster caused by extreme precipitation have gained widespread attention however the responses of runoff and sediment loss to extreme rainfall events in the hilly citrus orchards remain scarce in southern china especially for different groundcover management systems the principal objectives of this study are as follows a to study the effects of different groundcover managements on runoff and erosion from citrus orchards b to analyze the responses of water erosion characteristics to extreme rainfall events in citrus orchards and c to determine the role of different groundcover managements for control of soil and water loss during extreme rainfall events the results derived from this study will be helpful for improving groundcover management measures for extreme water erosion control in citrus orchards of the red soil region southern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the jiangxi ecological park of soil and water conservation in the yangou watershed 29 16 n to 29 17 n 115 42 e to 115 43 e which is the part of poyang lake watershed and is located in de an county jiangxi province fig 1 this region is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 7 the mean annual precipitation is 1 469 mm of which more than 70 occurs from april to september i e mainly in the spring and summer and the average annual sunshine ranges from 1 700 to 2 100 h the frost free period of the region is between 245 and 260 d the altitude within this watershed ranges from 30 to 90 m the dominant soil type in the watershed is the red clay soil produced by the weathering of quaternary sediments the soil depth in the study area is about 100 cm consisting of approximately 15 32 3 24 sand 68 28 3 12 silt and 16 40 2 23 clay liu et al 2016 dai et al 2018 natural resources land use types and population densities in the yangou watershed are typical of the hilly mountain regions in southern china the local landscape is characterized by ranges of hilly mountains in which sloping fields are common the slopes of the fields within the watershed range from 8 to 15 and have been mostly planted with citrus because these fruit trees generate additional economic benefits for the local farmers these citrus orchards are the main type of agricultural activity in the studied watershed 2 2 experimental plot design four in situ runoff plots were constructed in the study watershed each with a size 20 m 5 m length width on a grassland slope with a 12 gradient and the soil conditions among the four runoff plots were similar the plots were adjacent and parallel to the slope and cement ridges were inserted vertically 50 cm into the soil and were 20 cm above the ground at the borders of each plot there were constructed to separate adjacent plots and to restrict hydrological interference two year seedlings of citrus reticulate were planted with a spacing of 3 0 m 2 5 m in the runoff plots except for the control bare land the treatments for the four runoff plots were control bare land blck orchard with grass cover ocgc orchard with cover crops occc and orchard with no cover ocnc fig 1 in this study bare land was employed as the control treatment and the weeds in the runoff plot were manually removed every month without tillage and loosen on the plot for the orchard with grass cover treatment a local grass cynodon dactylon was strip contour planted between the citrus trees with a strip width of 0 5 m and the grass remained without reseeding or cutting during the study period this grass is a perennial grass species with a typical height of 0 3 m and is widely used for soil erosion control in the red soil region interplanting crops beneath the fruit trees is an economical treatment to improve orchard income and furthermore the crops provided some surface cover which was beneficial for soil erosion control especially for the young orchards where the fruit trees were small for this research soybeans summer and radishes winter were contour cultivated between the citrus trees the harvest time of soybeans and radishes were conducted on every august and march respectively during the crops harvest processes the soybeans roots and radishes tubers were manually exported from the field and were shaken gently to remove excess soil the crop residues were removed from the orchards after each harvest weeds grow easily in the red soil region due to the high precipitation and are harmful to the fruit trees and herbicide spraying is widely used in orchard management by local farmers resulting in a bare land surface and heavy soil erosion during the rainy season to test the generation soil loss and runoff under such orchard management practices herbicides were sprayed bimonthly on the plot to remove weeds and the tillage and loose soil were absent from the plot ocnc to collect the surface runoff and sediments from the red soil with different groundcover managements runoff gathering trenches and storage containers were constructed at the bottoms of the runoff plots and the storage containers were connected to the trenches by plastic pipes fig 2 the construction and experimental measures for runoff plots were accomplished in 2000 and the runoff and sediment measurements began in 2001 2 3 in situ measurements the surface runoff and soil loss from each plot were collected and measured after each rainfall event from 2001 to 2012 the runoff and sediment yield of each plot were collected and transferred to their corresponding runoff storage containers a water level gauge was installed in each container to record runoff levels from each rainfall event the runoff volumes of each rainfall event were calculated by taking the product of the container water level and its base area and the runoff depth was measured by dividing the runoff volume by the plot area an erosional rainfall event was not considered independent unless the intervals between other rainfall events exceeded 6 h after each rainfall water level measurement the sediment grains in the runoff gathering trench were washed with the clear liquid deposited from the surface runoff collections and then transferred into the runoff storage containers through plastic pipes five runoff samples mixed sediment were then collected in 1 000 ml measuring flasks after thoroughly mixing runoff water and sediment in each runoff container and were then transported to the laboratory for measuring the sediment concentrations by oven drying at 105 c to a constant weight the amount of soil loss for each rainfall event was measured by calculating the product of the runoff volume and the sediment concentration after each runoff and sediment sampling episode all runoff storage containers were washed completely with clean water and were then used to collect runoff and sediment from the next rainfall event several rainfall variables including rainfall depth maximum rainfall intensity in 30 min and rainfall duration of each event were automatically recorded at 5 min intervals by a meteorological station located near the plots in this study area 2 4 definition of extreme rainfall extreme rainfall events generally refer to the occurrence of lower probability rainfall events compared with the same period which are characterized by high hazard and sudden occurrences in this study the criteria of the world meteorological organization wmo were chosen to define the extreme rainfall if the difference between the rainfall variables and corresponding multiyear average were greater than the double variance of variable the rainfall events were defined as being extreme rainfall events cccin 2002 wei et al 2009b in addition rainfall depths and maximum intensities in 30 min i 30 were used to define extreme rainfall and the corresponding calculation formula was as follows φ ϖ 2 θ where φ refers to the specific value of rainfall variable such as depth or i 30 and ϖ and θ are the multiyear mean value and variance of the relevant variable respectively according to the equation mentioned above the extreme rainfall was determined by two specific criteria 1 rainfall depth was greater than its multiyear average and the i 30 value exceeded the sum of its perennial average value and the double variance 2 if i 30 failed to meet the wmo criterion the rainfall depth must exceed the relevant wmo requirements rainfall events satisfying either of the above two criteria belong to an extreme rainfall event 2 5 statistical analysis in situ observations of runoff and sediment data from twelve consecutive years 2001 2012 were used to analyze the runoff and erosional characteristics of the red soil in this study the runoff coefficient roc and soil loss amount sla mg ha 1 were determined by following formulae roc rd pd 100 where rd was the runoff depth mm and pd was the precipitation depth mm sla sl pa where sl was the sediment loss amount mg and pa was the and runoff plot area ha one way anova was performed to determine the significance of groundcover managements and rainfall patterns extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall for the runoff coefficients and soil loss amounts duncan s tests were used to separate the means at a probability level of 5 the pearson correlations between the runoff coefficients and the soil loss amounts and rainfall variables were analyzed statistical analyses of all data were performed using spss version 17 0 for windows and all graphics were created using origin pro 9 0 software 3 results 3 1 rainfall patterns according to the continuous observation data and the wmo criteria the minimum thresholds of extreme rainfall depth and i 30 were 84 2 mm and 46 2 mm h 1 in this study respectively on the basis of the threshold criteria 25 extreme rainfall events were selected from 356 erosive rainfall events in the study area from 2001 to 2012 and the remaining rainfall events were assigned to the ordinary rainfall category table 1 the occurrences of extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall had the probabilities of 7 0 and 93 0 respectively as shown in table 1 the mean depth 87 5 mm and i 30 51 4 mm h 1 of extreme rainfall were far greater than the values 25 7 mm and 13 3 mm h 1 respectively from ordinary rainfall the minimum and maximum values of i 30 for extreme rainfall were 9 6 and 90 6 mm h 1 respectively the extreme rainfall durations ranged from 48 to 3 478 min with a highest variable coefficient of 1 02 considering seasonal distributions extreme rainfall events occurred 14 times in summer from june to august with the highest probability of 56 0 6 times in spring from march to may with a probability of 24 0 and 4 and 1 times in autumn and winter with probabilities of 16 0 and 4 0 respectively these findings indicated that the spring and summer were the periods of high frequency of occurrence of extreme rainfall events 3 2 average runoff coefficients and erosion amounts for different groundcover managements significant differences in the average runoff coefficients were identified between the different plots f 167 25 p 0 001 on average the runoff coefficients were significantly higher on the blck plot 22 57 than for the ocnc plot 11 99 the occc plot 5 36 and the ocgc plot 2 38 fig 3 a the values ranged from 2 39 to 65 70 in the blck plot from 1 63 to 44 71 in the ocnc plot from 1 20 to 16 63 in the occc plot and from 0 77 to 4 46 in the ocgc plot likewise significant differences among treatments were also observed in the average soil loss amounts f 23 30 p 0 001 these were highest in blck plot 1 09 mg ha 1 followed by the ocnc plot 0 36 mg ha 1 and the occc plot 0 18 mg ha 1 and were lowest in the ocgc plot 0 003 mg ha 1 fig 3b the blck plot values ranged between 1 2 10 3 and 21 25 mg ha 1 the values for the ocnc plot ranged between 5 0 10 4 and 8 84 mg ha 1 the occc plot values ranged between 1 0 10 4 and 9 45 mg ha 1 and the ocgc plot values ranged between 4 0 10 5 and 0 14 mg ha 1 the soil and water losses for orchards with no cover grass cover and cover crops were sharply lower compared to the control bare land the ocgc occc and ocnc plots had the lower runoff and soil loss compared with the blck plot with a reduction of 89 4 76 3 and 46 9 in runoff coefficient 99 7 83 5 and 66 8 in soil loss amount 3 3 runoff and erosion characteristics under different rainfall patterns the runoff and erosion characteristics for all groundcover managements under different rainfall patterns are shown in fig 4 significant differences were observed in the runoff coefficients f 131 14 p 0 001 and soil loss amounts f 278 38 p 0 001 between the extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall events fig 4 clearly shows that the extreme rainfall events produced far more runoff and sediment than ordinary rainfall events under all groundcover managements the average runoff coefficients under extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall ranked in the order of blck 58 92 and 19 82 respectively ocnc 30 28 and 10 65 respectively occc 14 66 and 4 69 respectively ocgc 2 52 and 2 42 respectively the average soil loss amounts under extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall events were highest in the blck plot 6 75 and 0 66 mg ha 1 respectively followed by the ocnc plot 2 45 and 0 20 mg ha 1 respectively the occc plot 1 47 and 0 08 mg ha 1 respectively and the ocgc plot 0 01 and 0 002 mg ha 1 respectively the ratios of the extreme runoff coefficients and the erosion amounts to the mean ordinary runoff coefficients and erosion amounts are shown in fig 5 the differences in magnitude of the erosion amounts were far higher than those of the runoff coefficients between the extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall events the average ratios of the extreme erosion amounts to the mean ordinary erosion amounts were highest in the occc plot 18 73 followed by the ocnc plot 12 04 the blck plot 10 19 and the ocgc plot 4 39 whereas the average ratios of the extreme runoff coefficients to the ordinary runoff coefficients ranged from 1 04 to 3 13 the ratios of the extreme erosion amounts to the mean ordinary erosion amounts ranged from 0 10 to 54 76 in the occc plot 0 27 to 32 81 in the ocnc plot 0 81 to 23 40 in the blck plot and 0 53 to 6 36 in the ocgc plot these findings indicate that orchard erosion with cover crops showed high sensitivity to extreme rainfall whereas orchard erosion with grass cover showed lower sensitivity to extreme rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 effects of groundcover management on water erosion orchard lands are important land use types in red soil region due to increases in vegetation coverage runoff generation and soil losses were reduced significantly 46 9 and 66 8 respectively in orchards compared to the case of bare land fig 3 however there currently exist serious risks of soil and water losses in the orchards that often have extensive areas of bare soil due to unreasonable management practices such as the extensive use of herbicides experimental results have shown that the multiyear average of the soil erosion rate in orchards with no cover was 11 40 mg ha 1 a 1 these results were consistent with other research results in the red soil region durán zuazo et al 2005 measured an average annual soil loss of 9 1 mg ha 1 a 1 from orchard terraces fang et al 2017 measured average annual erosion amounts of 15 33 and 10 20 mg ha 1 a 1 for bare land and orchard land respectively the erosion rates for orchards with no cover in this study were much higher than the tolerable erosion rate of 5 00 mg ha 1 a 1 in the red soil region according to the soil erosion standards for classification and gradation given by the ministry of water resources of china sl190 2007 bare soil surfaces with soil compaction might be responsible for the high erosion rate for orchards with unprotected soil which means that such soil management practices are unsustainable groundcover vegetation is a good soil conservation practice for orchards because of raindrop interception and runoff energy absorption on the soil surface roce et al 2003 francia martinez et al 2006 feng et al 2018 in this study the runoff coefficients and soil loss amounts differed significantly between the orchards with and without vegetation cover the multi year average runoff coefficients and soil erosion rates were significantly lower 2 38 and 5 36 0 06 and 2 25 mg ha 1 a 1 respectively in the orchards with grass cover and cover crops than those with no cover the experimental results indicated that the erosion rates in orchards with vegetation cover were far lower than the tolerable erosion rate for this region the differences in runoff and erosion among the different groundcover managements were similar to those reported in previous studies francia martinez et al 2006 reported that cover barley hordeum vulgare in olive orchards on a 30 slope substantially decreased soil and water loss amounts 19 8 mm a 1 and 2 1 mg ha 1 a 1 respectively keesstra et al 2016 found that the lowest runoff and erosion amounts were identified in covered plots and the highest values were seen in uncovered plots gómez et al 2009 determined that cover crops effectively reduced runoff and erosion to tolerable levels while atucha et al 2013 found that the runoff and erosion were reduced in a hillside avocado orchard with grass striped or as a complete cover compared to orchards with no cover these findings confirmed that groundcover vegetation treatments reduced runoff and erosion more efficiently than for the case of no cover in orchards fig 6 shows the annual runoff coefficients and soil erosion amounts under different groundcover managements from 2001 to 2012 the interannual variations in the runoff coefficients and erosion amounts were significantly affected by the annual rainfall changes for the control bare land however the runoff and erosion variations in different years were significantly lower in the other orchard plots compared with grass cover the cover crops had higher annual variations in runoff and erosion due to rotation tillage practices overall the vulnerability of water erosion to rainfall was mitigated by orchard development tree cover and surface vegetation cover this is explained by the sharp reduction or halting of rainfall erosivity with increasing vegetation coverage francia martinez et al 2006 feng et al 2018 as shown in fig 6b the highest erosion rates were seen in the first year for the control bare land and the orchard with no cover 69 18 and 65 00 mg ha 1 a 1 respectively accounting for 20 0 and 55 8 respectively of the total erosion over 12 years the erosion rates in the first year reached the criterion of intense erosion and similar observations were reported by cerdà et al 2009 and atucha et al 2013 for new orchards this was explained by the serious disturbance of the surface soil by large scale mechanized excavation that caused a lack of vegetation cover in this period and by the low tree coverage in the newly planted hillside orchards the severe soil erosion rates from newly planted orchards are not sustainable under current farming practices where the use of groundcover vegetation is completely avoided in this study the average erosion rate reductions in the first year were 64 81 and 64 52 mg ha 1 in orchards with grass cover and cover crops compared to orchards with no cover respectively fig 6b these results confirmed that severe water erosion is easily induced in the initial stage of orchard establishment groundcover vegetation once established reduced runoff and sediment yield more efficiently than a no cover treatment in young orchards 4 2 effects of extreme rainfall on water erosion many studies have shown that rainfall variables such as depth and intensity were confirmed as the main drivers of the degree of surface hydrology and soil erosion ran et al 2012 liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2017 as shown in table 1 the mean rainfall depths and maximum rainfall intensities during 30 min of extreme rainfall were 3 4 and 3 9 times those of ordinary rainfall respectively extreme rainfall with high intensity exceeded the soil infiltration capacity and much rainfall was lost as surface runoff as a consequence the extreme rainfall events with large magnitudes and low frequencies were assumed to dominate with respect to soil loss compared to ordinary rainfall events in this study the mean extreme runoff coefficients and erosion amounts for all treatments were 2 8 and 11 1 times the values from ordinary rainfall respectively fig 4 the results were similar to those reported in previous studies solano rivera et al 2019 also showed that extreme precipitation events have an overriding impact on surface runoff and erosion wei et al 2009b reported that the mean runoff amounts and erosion rates of extreme rainfall were 2 7 and 53 2 times those of ordinary rainfall respectively in a semiarid hilly loess area in nw china the lower erodibility of loess was responsible for the greater extreme erosion rates in the research results of wei et al 2009b fig 5 clearly shows that sediment yields were more sensitive to extreme rainfall compared to runoff production the ratios of extreme erosion to ordinary erosion were 3 6 times the values of extreme runoff to ordinary runoff in all plots meanwhile the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield 44 2 is far higher than this to runoff production 15 8 fig 7 the reason for these results is that higher sediment concentrations were found during heavy rainfall aksoy and kavvas 2005 dai et al 2018 and were mainly because of higher soil detachment capacities under strong rainfall erosivity and runoff energy fan et al 2010 furthermore the pearson correlation analysis shows the different effects of the rainfall variables on the runoff coefficients and on the soil loss amounts between extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall table 2 for example the maximum intensity in 30 min had a more significant correlation with soil erosion amounts than with rainfall depth whereas the rainfall depth had a significantly stronger relationship with the runoff coefficient the results confirmed that the maximum intensity in 30 min contributed more to soil erosion than did the rainfall depth 4 3 role of various groundcover managements on extreme water erosion control the extreme runoff coefficients and soil loss amounts varied significantly among the different groundcover managements fig 4 vegetation covers effectively reduced extreme runoff and erosion compared to those orchards with no cover the differences in runoff and sediment reduction rate between grass cover and cover crops were very clear especially for control of sediment loss sediment reduction rate for the grass cover treatment 99 6 was two orders of magnitude greater than that measured for the cover crops treatment 40 0 fig 4b the literature shows that concentrated flow was easily generated on sloping land under extreme rainfall with high intensity and depth boardman 2015 wang et al 2018 compared to the cover crops treatment the denser stems and higher biomass of grass cover on the soil surface provided a more effective buffer which decreased the overland flow velocity and energy and decreased soil erosion roce et al 2003 pan et al 2010 mu et al 2019 and the stem parts of the grass intercepted a portion of the sediment particles carried by the runoff dunkerley et al 2001 the accumulated contribution rates of extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall to the runoff and erosion are shown in fig 7 the highest erosion contribution of 59 0 was found in orchard with cover crops followed by orchard with no cover 47 9 bare land 43 8 and orchard with grass cover 26 0 the results indicated that 59 0 of the total soil erosion was caused by a few extreme rainfall events with a probability of 7 0 table 1 in orchards with cover crops and the lowest soil erosion occurred in orchards with grass cover during the study period the results were similar to the research of martı nez casasnovas et al 2002 who reported that soil erosion caused by a few extreme rainfall events often accounted for 60 90 of the total annual erosion amount this was because the grass used on the grass cover plots with high vegetation coverage was cynodon dactylon a warm season perennial grass species grown without reseeding and cutting and the soil erosion for the cover crop plots was especially vulnerable to tillage measures with yearly crop rotations due to the low grass strip the grass cover without cutting did not affect the orchard production management but for other more tall grass species the groundcover should be suitably mowed and the cutting residues mulch on soil surface during winter for the least precipitation and low soil erosion cover crops with rotation have usually been viewed as the primary cause of soil erosion ramos et al 2010 keesstra et al 2016 fang et al 2017 o neal et al 2005 determined that lower soil losses were found for continuous crop cultivation than for crop rotation in this study crop rotations with soybeans and radishes were used in the orchards the soybeans were grown from april to august and the radishes were grown from september to march in each year the crops harvest season occurred in spring and summer with high occurrence frequencies of extreme rainfall events 80 in the study area severe soil erosion amounts were easily induced due to the high rainfall erosivity and low surface vegetation coverage loose soil and soil adhering to the crops were exported from field together with these crops during crops harvesting processes ruysschaert et al 2004 indicated that soil losses due to crop harvesting may rise from a few mg to a few tens of mg per hectare per harvest moreover the frequent tillage with crop rotation increased soil erodibility and the probability of severe erosion in the crop growth season from the perspective of soil and water conservation the severe soil erosion caused by extreme rainfall should receive more attention when interplanting crops beneath fruit trees the crop straw mulch and no till or minimum tillage after harvesting were recommended as effective strategy to prevent extreme soil erosion in citrus orchard with cover crops 5 conclusions in this paper based on rainfall depth and i 30 extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall were determined by the continuous observation data and criterion of wmo the minimum thresholds for rainfall depths and i 30 values for extreme rainfall were determined to be 84 2 mm and 46 2 mm h 1 respectively 25 extreme rainfall events were selected from 356 erosive rainfall events from 2001 to 2012 the mean rainfall depth and i 30 of extreme rainfall were threefold more than those of ordinary rainfall events extreme rainfall events caused severer soil and water loss compared with ordinary events the average extreme runoff and erosion amount were 2 8 and 11 1 times higher than the values from ordinary rainfall respectively meanwhile the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield 44 2 was far higher than the contribution of extreme rainfall to runoff production 15 8 obviously extreme rainfall events played the destructive role in inducing sediment loss runoff coefficient and soil loss amount differed significant among the groundcover managements under extreme rainfall the size order was as follow control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with cover crops orchard with grass cover however the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield differed greatly from the above rule the highest erosion contribution was found in orchard with cover crops and the lowest in orchard with grass cover under extreme rainfall for orchards with cover crops and grass cover 59 0 and 26 0 of total soil loss amount were caused by a few extreme rainfalls with a probability of 7 0 these findings are meaning for controlling water erosion caused by extreme rainfall in citrus orchards of southern china the soil and water losses caused by extreme rainfall should deserve more attention when interplanting crops beneath fruit trees grass cover between crops is recommended as a groundcover management strategy to effectively fight against extreme water erosion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5851,extreme rainfall is becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change and increasing human activity changes in rainfall will increase the risks and uncertainty of water erosion from orchards groundcover management is an important factor affecting hydrological and erosive processes of orchards however the roles of different groundcover managements for controlling soil water erosion caused by extreme rainfall are not fully understood in this study four groundcover managements i e control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with grass cover and orchard with cover crops were used to analyze runoff and erosion characteristics related to extreme and ordinary rainfalls in the red soil region of china based on the rainfall runoff data measured on runoff plots 356 natural rainfall events from 2001 to 2012 were analyzed and rainfall depths and maximum 30 min rainfall intensities were used to select extreme rainfall events according to the criteria of the world meteorological organization for extreme rainfall there were 25 extreme rainfall events with a probability of 7 0 during the study period extreme rainfall events played the destructive role in inducing soil loss the average extreme runoff coefficient and soil loss amount were 2 8 and 11 1 times higher than the values from ordinary rainfall respectively the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield was 44 2 which far higher than those to runoff generation 15 8 moreover the runoff coefficients and erosion amounts varied greatly among the different groundcover managements under extreme rainfall and were ranked in the following order control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with cover crops orchard with grass cover however the highest percentage of soil loss amount caused by extreme rainfalls were 59 0 in orchard with cover crops and the lowest in orchard with grass cover 26 0 therefore extreme rainfall should cause more attention in improving the groundcover management strategy for orchard soil erosion control and groundcover like grass cover was extremely needed even after interplanting crops for the serious soil loss keywords water erosion extreme rainfall groundcover management citrus orchards red soil region 1 introduction water erosion is mainly responsible for global land degradation and productivity declines rodrigo et al 2016 wei et al 2017 bonetti et al 2019 for a long period the red soil region of southern china has been facing severe soil and water loss due to high precipitation hilly landforms and unsustainable farming practices barton et al 2004 liang et al 2010 shi et al 2014 fang et al 2017 in recent decades with the rapid growth of human population 40 of china s population and heavy pressure on productive soil resources increasing amounts of barren land with a secondary community on the slopes have been transformed into orchards zuazo et al 2005 xu et al 2012 li et al 2014 chen et al 2019 hilly citrus orchards are widely distributed in this region due to their additional economic benefits meanwhile citrus orchard lands are exposed to serious risks of soil and water loss due to the intense soil disturbances from large scale mechanized excavation and the lack of surface vegetation cover durán zuazo et al 2005 prosdocimi et al 2016 comino et al 2018 soil and water conservation measures on soil surfaces are rarely implemented for orchard production relevant groundcover measures are very infrequent and further research is necessary to assess the sustainable groundcover management strategies groundcover management is an important factor that affects water erosion processes in orchards vegetation free groundcover management such as herbicides spraying and mechanical weeding have been widely implemented to maximize commercial production in conventional orchards novara et al 2011 keesstra et al 2016 prosdocimi et al 2016 the management method with bare soil year round decreased soil infiltration and favored runoff production and sediment yields francia martinez et al 2006 cerdà et al 2009 in contrast groundcover vegetation provided mechanical soil protection by increasing water infiltration and by reducing splash erosion and concentrated flow erosion kinnell 2005 martinez raya et al 2006 novara et al 2011 ferreira et al 2018 although the effects of groundcover management on runoff and erosion have been discussed in previous studies comparisons between different groundcover management strategies in citrus orchards have yet to be examined soil and water loss processes are strongly influenced by factors other than groundcover among these factors rainfall characteristics are expected to be the most frequently mentioned kinnell 2005 ran et al 2012 nearing et al 2017 huang et al 2018 rainfall is the initial and essential driving force resulting for water erosion variations in rainfall parameters such as depth intensity and erosivity significantly influence the occurrence and intensity of soil erosion liu et al 2016 higley and conroy 2019 due to global climate change and environmental change an important consequence of rainfall change has been the increased frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall easterling et al 2000 wei et al 2009a westra et al 2014 vallebona et al 2015 sarhadi and soulis 2017 sharma and mujumdar 2019 the increase in extreme rainfall events will aggravate the uncertainty and complexity of the water erosion processes and their control wei et al 2009b wang et al 2018 farsi and mahjouri 2019 solano rivera et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 many studies have shown that runoff and erosion amounts due to extreme rainfall are far greater than those arising from ordinary rainfall coppus and imeson 2002 xu et al 2007 wei et al 2009b chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 as a consequence the severe water erosion and disaster caused by extreme precipitation have gained widespread attention however the responses of runoff and sediment loss to extreme rainfall events in the hilly citrus orchards remain scarce in southern china especially for different groundcover management systems the principal objectives of this study are as follows a to study the effects of different groundcover managements on runoff and erosion from citrus orchards b to analyze the responses of water erosion characteristics to extreme rainfall events in citrus orchards and c to determine the role of different groundcover managements for control of soil and water loss during extreme rainfall events the results derived from this study will be helpful for improving groundcover management measures for extreme water erosion control in citrus orchards of the red soil region southern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the jiangxi ecological park of soil and water conservation in the yangou watershed 29 16 n to 29 17 n 115 42 e to 115 43 e which is the part of poyang lake watershed and is located in de an county jiangxi province fig 1 this region is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 7 the mean annual precipitation is 1 469 mm of which more than 70 occurs from april to september i e mainly in the spring and summer and the average annual sunshine ranges from 1 700 to 2 100 h the frost free period of the region is between 245 and 260 d the altitude within this watershed ranges from 30 to 90 m the dominant soil type in the watershed is the red clay soil produced by the weathering of quaternary sediments the soil depth in the study area is about 100 cm consisting of approximately 15 32 3 24 sand 68 28 3 12 silt and 16 40 2 23 clay liu et al 2016 dai et al 2018 natural resources land use types and population densities in the yangou watershed are typical of the hilly mountain regions in southern china the local landscape is characterized by ranges of hilly mountains in which sloping fields are common the slopes of the fields within the watershed range from 8 to 15 and have been mostly planted with citrus because these fruit trees generate additional economic benefits for the local farmers these citrus orchards are the main type of agricultural activity in the studied watershed 2 2 experimental plot design four in situ runoff plots were constructed in the study watershed each with a size 20 m 5 m length width on a grassland slope with a 12 gradient and the soil conditions among the four runoff plots were similar the plots were adjacent and parallel to the slope and cement ridges were inserted vertically 50 cm into the soil and were 20 cm above the ground at the borders of each plot there were constructed to separate adjacent plots and to restrict hydrological interference two year seedlings of citrus reticulate were planted with a spacing of 3 0 m 2 5 m in the runoff plots except for the control bare land the treatments for the four runoff plots were control bare land blck orchard with grass cover ocgc orchard with cover crops occc and orchard with no cover ocnc fig 1 in this study bare land was employed as the control treatment and the weeds in the runoff plot were manually removed every month without tillage and loosen on the plot for the orchard with grass cover treatment a local grass cynodon dactylon was strip contour planted between the citrus trees with a strip width of 0 5 m and the grass remained without reseeding or cutting during the study period this grass is a perennial grass species with a typical height of 0 3 m and is widely used for soil erosion control in the red soil region interplanting crops beneath the fruit trees is an economical treatment to improve orchard income and furthermore the crops provided some surface cover which was beneficial for soil erosion control especially for the young orchards where the fruit trees were small for this research soybeans summer and radishes winter were contour cultivated between the citrus trees the harvest time of soybeans and radishes were conducted on every august and march respectively during the crops harvest processes the soybeans roots and radishes tubers were manually exported from the field and were shaken gently to remove excess soil the crop residues were removed from the orchards after each harvest weeds grow easily in the red soil region due to the high precipitation and are harmful to the fruit trees and herbicide spraying is widely used in orchard management by local farmers resulting in a bare land surface and heavy soil erosion during the rainy season to test the generation soil loss and runoff under such orchard management practices herbicides were sprayed bimonthly on the plot to remove weeds and the tillage and loose soil were absent from the plot ocnc to collect the surface runoff and sediments from the red soil with different groundcover managements runoff gathering trenches and storage containers were constructed at the bottoms of the runoff plots and the storage containers were connected to the trenches by plastic pipes fig 2 the construction and experimental measures for runoff plots were accomplished in 2000 and the runoff and sediment measurements began in 2001 2 3 in situ measurements the surface runoff and soil loss from each plot were collected and measured after each rainfall event from 2001 to 2012 the runoff and sediment yield of each plot were collected and transferred to their corresponding runoff storage containers a water level gauge was installed in each container to record runoff levels from each rainfall event the runoff volumes of each rainfall event were calculated by taking the product of the container water level and its base area and the runoff depth was measured by dividing the runoff volume by the plot area an erosional rainfall event was not considered independent unless the intervals between other rainfall events exceeded 6 h after each rainfall water level measurement the sediment grains in the runoff gathering trench were washed with the clear liquid deposited from the surface runoff collections and then transferred into the runoff storage containers through plastic pipes five runoff samples mixed sediment were then collected in 1 000 ml measuring flasks after thoroughly mixing runoff water and sediment in each runoff container and were then transported to the laboratory for measuring the sediment concentrations by oven drying at 105 c to a constant weight the amount of soil loss for each rainfall event was measured by calculating the product of the runoff volume and the sediment concentration after each runoff and sediment sampling episode all runoff storage containers were washed completely with clean water and were then used to collect runoff and sediment from the next rainfall event several rainfall variables including rainfall depth maximum rainfall intensity in 30 min and rainfall duration of each event were automatically recorded at 5 min intervals by a meteorological station located near the plots in this study area 2 4 definition of extreme rainfall extreme rainfall events generally refer to the occurrence of lower probability rainfall events compared with the same period which are characterized by high hazard and sudden occurrences in this study the criteria of the world meteorological organization wmo were chosen to define the extreme rainfall if the difference between the rainfall variables and corresponding multiyear average were greater than the double variance of variable the rainfall events were defined as being extreme rainfall events cccin 2002 wei et al 2009b in addition rainfall depths and maximum intensities in 30 min i 30 were used to define extreme rainfall and the corresponding calculation formula was as follows φ ϖ 2 θ where φ refers to the specific value of rainfall variable such as depth or i 30 and ϖ and θ are the multiyear mean value and variance of the relevant variable respectively according to the equation mentioned above the extreme rainfall was determined by two specific criteria 1 rainfall depth was greater than its multiyear average and the i 30 value exceeded the sum of its perennial average value and the double variance 2 if i 30 failed to meet the wmo criterion the rainfall depth must exceed the relevant wmo requirements rainfall events satisfying either of the above two criteria belong to an extreme rainfall event 2 5 statistical analysis in situ observations of runoff and sediment data from twelve consecutive years 2001 2012 were used to analyze the runoff and erosional characteristics of the red soil in this study the runoff coefficient roc and soil loss amount sla mg ha 1 were determined by following formulae roc rd pd 100 where rd was the runoff depth mm and pd was the precipitation depth mm sla sl pa where sl was the sediment loss amount mg and pa was the and runoff plot area ha one way anova was performed to determine the significance of groundcover managements and rainfall patterns extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall for the runoff coefficients and soil loss amounts duncan s tests were used to separate the means at a probability level of 5 the pearson correlations between the runoff coefficients and the soil loss amounts and rainfall variables were analyzed statistical analyses of all data were performed using spss version 17 0 for windows and all graphics were created using origin pro 9 0 software 3 results 3 1 rainfall patterns according to the continuous observation data and the wmo criteria the minimum thresholds of extreme rainfall depth and i 30 were 84 2 mm and 46 2 mm h 1 in this study respectively on the basis of the threshold criteria 25 extreme rainfall events were selected from 356 erosive rainfall events in the study area from 2001 to 2012 and the remaining rainfall events were assigned to the ordinary rainfall category table 1 the occurrences of extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall had the probabilities of 7 0 and 93 0 respectively as shown in table 1 the mean depth 87 5 mm and i 30 51 4 mm h 1 of extreme rainfall were far greater than the values 25 7 mm and 13 3 mm h 1 respectively from ordinary rainfall the minimum and maximum values of i 30 for extreme rainfall were 9 6 and 90 6 mm h 1 respectively the extreme rainfall durations ranged from 48 to 3 478 min with a highest variable coefficient of 1 02 considering seasonal distributions extreme rainfall events occurred 14 times in summer from june to august with the highest probability of 56 0 6 times in spring from march to may with a probability of 24 0 and 4 and 1 times in autumn and winter with probabilities of 16 0 and 4 0 respectively these findings indicated that the spring and summer were the periods of high frequency of occurrence of extreme rainfall events 3 2 average runoff coefficients and erosion amounts for different groundcover managements significant differences in the average runoff coefficients were identified between the different plots f 167 25 p 0 001 on average the runoff coefficients were significantly higher on the blck plot 22 57 than for the ocnc plot 11 99 the occc plot 5 36 and the ocgc plot 2 38 fig 3 a the values ranged from 2 39 to 65 70 in the blck plot from 1 63 to 44 71 in the ocnc plot from 1 20 to 16 63 in the occc plot and from 0 77 to 4 46 in the ocgc plot likewise significant differences among treatments were also observed in the average soil loss amounts f 23 30 p 0 001 these were highest in blck plot 1 09 mg ha 1 followed by the ocnc plot 0 36 mg ha 1 and the occc plot 0 18 mg ha 1 and were lowest in the ocgc plot 0 003 mg ha 1 fig 3b the blck plot values ranged between 1 2 10 3 and 21 25 mg ha 1 the values for the ocnc plot ranged between 5 0 10 4 and 8 84 mg ha 1 the occc plot values ranged between 1 0 10 4 and 9 45 mg ha 1 and the ocgc plot values ranged between 4 0 10 5 and 0 14 mg ha 1 the soil and water losses for orchards with no cover grass cover and cover crops were sharply lower compared to the control bare land the ocgc occc and ocnc plots had the lower runoff and soil loss compared with the blck plot with a reduction of 89 4 76 3 and 46 9 in runoff coefficient 99 7 83 5 and 66 8 in soil loss amount 3 3 runoff and erosion characteristics under different rainfall patterns the runoff and erosion characteristics for all groundcover managements under different rainfall patterns are shown in fig 4 significant differences were observed in the runoff coefficients f 131 14 p 0 001 and soil loss amounts f 278 38 p 0 001 between the extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall events fig 4 clearly shows that the extreme rainfall events produced far more runoff and sediment than ordinary rainfall events under all groundcover managements the average runoff coefficients under extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall ranked in the order of blck 58 92 and 19 82 respectively ocnc 30 28 and 10 65 respectively occc 14 66 and 4 69 respectively ocgc 2 52 and 2 42 respectively the average soil loss amounts under extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall events were highest in the blck plot 6 75 and 0 66 mg ha 1 respectively followed by the ocnc plot 2 45 and 0 20 mg ha 1 respectively the occc plot 1 47 and 0 08 mg ha 1 respectively and the ocgc plot 0 01 and 0 002 mg ha 1 respectively the ratios of the extreme runoff coefficients and the erosion amounts to the mean ordinary runoff coefficients and erosion amounts are shown in fig 5 the differences in magnitude of the erosion amounts were far higher than those of the runoff coefficients between the extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall events the average ratios of the extreme erosion amounts to the mean ordinary erosion amounts were highest in the occc plot 18 73 followed by the ocnc plot 12 04 the blck plot 10 19 and the ocgc plot 4 39 whereas the average ratios of the extreme runoff coefficients to the ordinary runoff coefficients ranged from 1 04 to 3 13 the ratios of the extreme erosion amounts to the mean ordinary erosion amounts ranged from 0 10 to 54 76 in the occc plot 0 27 to 32 81 in the ocnc plot 0 81 to 23 40 in the blck plot and 0 53 to 6 36 in the ocgc plot these findings indicate that orchard erosion with cover crops showed high sensitivity to extreme rainfall whereas orchard erosion with grass cover showed lower sensitivity to extreme rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 effects of groundcover management on water erosion orchard lands are important land use types in red soil region due to increases in vegetation coverage runoff generation and soil losses were reduced significantly 46 9 and 66 8 respectively in orchards compared to the case of bare land fig 3 however there currently exist serious risks of soil and water losses in the orchards that often have extensive areas of bare soil due to unreasonable management practices such as the extensive use of herbicides experimental results have shown that the multiyear average of the soil erosion rate in orchards with no cover was 11 40 mg ha 1 a 1 these results were consistent with other research results in the red soil region durán zuazo et al 2005 measured an average annual soil loss of 9 1 mg ha 1 a 1 from orchard terraces fang et al 2017 measured average annual erosion amounts of 15 33 and 10 20 mg ha 1 a 1 for bare land and orchard land respectively the erosion rates for orchards with no cover in this study were much higher than the tolerable erosion rate of 5 00 mg ha 1 a 1 in the red soil region according to the soil erosion standards for classification and gradation given by the ministry of water resources of china sl190 2007 bare soil surfaces with soil compaction might be responsible for the high erosion rate for orchards with unprotected soil which means that such soil management practices are unsustainable groundcover vegetation is a good soil conservation practice for orchards because of raindrop interception and runoff energy absorption on the soil surface roce et al 2003 francia martinez et al 2006 feng et al 2018 in this study the runoff coefficients and soil loss amounts differed significantly between the orchards with and without vegetation cover the multi year average runoff coefficients and soil erosion rates were significantly lower 2 38 and 5 36 0 06 and 2 25 mg ha 1 a 1 respectively in the orchards with grass cover and cover crops than those with no cover the experimental results indicated that the erosion rates in orchards with vegetation cover were far lower than the tolerable erosion rate for this region the differences in runoff and erosion among the different groundcover managements were similar to those reported in previous studies francia martinez et al 2006 reported that cover barley hordeum vulgare in olive orchards on a 30 slope substantially decreased soil and water loss amounts 19 8 mm a 1 and 2 1 mg ha 1 a 1 respectively keesstra et al 2016 found that the lowest runoff and erosion amounts were identified in covered plots and the highest values were seen in uncovered plots gómez et al 2009 determined that cover crops effectively reduced runoff and erosion to tolerable levels while atucha et al 2013 found that the runoff and erosion were reduced in a hillside avocado orchard with grass striped or as a complete cover compared to orchards with no cover these findings confirmed that groundcover vegetation treatments reduced runoff and erosion more efficiently than for the case of no cover in orchards fig 6 shows the annual runoff coefficients and soil erosion amounts under different groundcover managements from 2001 to 2012 the interannual variations in the runoff coefficients and erosion amounts were significantly affected by the annual rainfall changes for the control bare land however the runoff and erosion variations in different years were significantly lower in the other orchard plots compared with grass cover the cover crops had higher annual variations in runoff and erosion due to rotation tillage practices overall the vulnerability of water erosion to rainfall was mitigated by orchard development tree cover and surface vegetation cover this is explained by the sharp reduction or halting of rainfall erosivity with increasing vegetation coverage francia martinez et al 2006 feng et al 2018 as shown in fig 6b the highest erosion rates were seen in the first year for the control bare land and the orchard with no cover 69 18 and 65 00 mg ha 1 a 1 respectively accounting for 20 0 and 55 8 respectively of the total erosion over 12 years the erosion rates in the first year reached the criterion of intense erosion and similar observations were reported by cerdà et al 2009 and atucha et al 2013 for new orchards this was explained by the serious disturbance of the surface soil by large scale mechanized excavation that caused a lack of vegetation cover in this period and by the low tree coverage in the newly planted hillside orchards the severe soil erosion rates from newly planted orchards are not sustainable under current farming practices where the use of groundcover vegetation is completely avoided in this study the average erosion rate reductions in the first year were 64 81 and 64 52 mg ha 1 in orchards with grass cover and cover crops compared to orchards with no cover respectively fig 6b these results confirmed that severe water erosion is easily induced in the initial stage of orchard establishment groundcover vegetation once established reduced runoff and sediment yield more efficiently than a no cover treatment in young orchards 4 2 effects of extreme rainfall on water erosion many studies have shown that rainfall variables such as depth and intensity were confirmed as the main drivers of the degree of surface hydrology and soil erosion ran et al 2012 liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2017 as shown in table 1 the mean rainfall depths and maximum rainfall intensities during 30 min of extreme rainfall were 3 4 and 3 9 times those of ordinary rainfall respectively extreme rainfall with high intensity exceeded the soil infiltration capacity and much rainfall was lost as surface runoff as a consequence the extreme rainfall events with large magnitudes and low frequencies were assumed to dominate with respect to soil loss compared to ordinary rainfall events in this study the mean extreme runoff coefficients and erosion amounts for all treatments were 2 8 and 11 1 times the values from ordinary rainfall respectively fig 4 the results were similar to those reported in previous studies solano rivera et al 2019 also showed that extreme precipitation events have an overriding impact on surface runoff and erosion wei et al 2009b reported that the mean runoff amounts and erosion rates of extreme rainfall were 2 7 and 53 2 times those of ordinary rainfall respectively in a semiarid hilly loess area in nw china the lower erodibility of loess was responsible for the greater extreme erosion rates in the research results of wei et al 2009b fig 5 clearly shows that sediment yields were more sensitive to extreme rainfall compared to runoff production the ratios of extreme erosion to ordinary erosion were 3 6 times the values of extreme runoff to ordinary runoff in all plots meanwhile the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield 44 2 is far higher than this to runoff production 15 8 fig 7 the reason for these results is that higher sediment concentrations were found during heavy rainfall aksoy and kavvas 2005 dai et al 2018 and were mainly because of higher soil detachment capacities under strong rainfall erosivity and runoff energy fan et al 2010 furthermore the pearson correlation analysis shows the different effects of the rainfall variables on the runoff coefficients and on the soil loss amounts between extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall table 2 for example the maximum intensity in 30 min had a more significant correlation with soil erosion amounts than with rainfall depth whereas the rainfall depth had a significantly stronger relationship with the runoff coefficient the results confirmed that the maximum intensity in 30 min contributed more to soil erosion than did the rainfall depth 4 3 role of various groundcover managements on extreme water erosion control the extreme runoff coefficients and soil loss amounts varied significantly among the different groundcover managements fig 4 vegetation covers effectively reduced extreme runoff and erosion compared to those orchards with no cover the differences in runoff and sediment reduction rate between grass cover and cover crops were very clear especially for control of sediment loss sediment reduction rate for the grass cover treatment 99 6 was two orders of magnitude greater than that measured for the cover crops treatment 40 0 fig 4b the literature shows that concentrated flow was easily generated on sloping land under extreme rainfall with high intensity and depth boardman 2015 wang et al 2018 compared to the cover crops treatment the denser stems and higher biomass of grass cover on the soil surface provided a more effective buffer which decreased the overland flow velocity and energy and decreased soil erosion roce et al 2003 pan et al 2010 mu et al 2019 and the stem parts of the grass intercepted a portion of the sediment particles carried by the runoff dunkerley et al 2001 the accumulated contribution rates of extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall to the runoff and erosion are shown in fig 7 the highest erosion contribution of 59 0 was found in orchard with cover crops followed by orchard with no cover 47 9 bare land 43 8 and orchard with grass cover 26 0 the results indicated that 59 0 of the total soil erosion was caused by a few extreme rainfall events with a probability of 7 0 table 1 in orchards with cover crops and the lowest soil erosion occurred in orchards with grass cover during the study period the results were similar to the research of martı nez casasnovas et al 2002 who reported that soil erosion caused by a few extreme rainfall events often accounted for 60 90 of the total annual erosion amount this was because the grass used on the grass cover plots with high vegetation coverage was cynodon dactylon a warm season perennial grass species grown without reseeding and cutting and the soil erosion for the cover crop plots was especially vulnerable to tillage measures with yearly crop rotations due to the low grass strip the grass cover without cutting did not affect the orchard production management but for other more tall grass species the groundcover should be suitably mowed and the cutting residues mulch on soil surface during winter for the least precipitation and low soil erosion cover crops with rotation have usually been viewed as the primary cause of soil erosion ramos et al 2010 keesstra et al 2016 fang et al 2017 o neal et al 2005 determined that lower soil losses were found for continuous crop cultivation than for crop rotation in this study crop rotations with soybeans and radishes were used in the orchards the soybeans were grown from april to august and the radishes were grown from september to march in each year the crops harvest season occurred in spring and summer with high occurrence frequencies of extreme rainfall events 80 in the study area severe soil erosion amounts were easily induced due to the high rainfall erosivity and low surface vegetation coverage loose soil and soil adhering to the crops were exported from field together with these crops during crops harvesting processes ruysschaert et al 2004 indicated that soil losses due to crop harvesting may rise from a few mg to a few tens of mg per hectare per harvest moreover the frequent tillage with crop rotation increased soil erodibility and the probability of severe erosion in the crop growth season from the perspective of soil and water conservation the severe soil erosion caused by extreme rainfall should receive more attention when interplanting crops beneath fruit trees the crop straw mulch and no till or minimum tillage after harvesting were recommended as effective strategy to prevent extreme soil erosion in citrus orchard with cover crops 5 conclusions in this paper based on rainfall depth and i 30 extreme rainfall and ordinary rainfall were determined by the continuous observation data and criterion of wmo the minimum thresholds for rainfall depths and i 30 values for extreme rainfall were determined to be 84 2 mm and 46 2 mm h 1 respectively 25 extreme rainfall events were selected from 356 erosive rainfall events from 2001 to 2012 the mean rainfall depth and i 30 of extreme rainfall were threefold more than those of ordinary rainfall events extreme rainfall events caused severer soil and water loss compared with ordinary events the average extreme runoff and erosion amount were 2 8 and 11 1 times higher than the values from ordinary rainfall respectively meanwhile the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield 44 2 was far higher than the contribution of extreme rainfall to runoff production 15 8 obviously extreme rainfall events played the destructive role in inducing sediment loss runoff coefficient and soil loss amount differed significant among the groundcover managements under extreme rainfall the size order was as follow control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with cover crops orchard with grass cover however the contribution of extreme rainfall to sediment yield differed greatly from the above rule the highest erosion contribution was found in orchard with cover crops and the lowest in orchard with grass cover under extreme rainfall for orchards with cover crops and grass cover 59 0 and 26 0 of total soil loss amount were caused by a few extreme rainfalls with a probability of 7 0 these findings are meaning for controlling water erosion caused by extreme rainfall in citrus orchards of southern china the soil and water losses caused by extreme rainfall should deserve more attention when interplanting crops beneath fruit trees grass cover between crops is recommended as a groundcover management strategy to effectively fight against extreme water erosion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5852,hydraulic geometry is used to describe spatio temporal variations in wetted width mean depth and mean velocity with discharge in stream reaches models describing downstream spatial variations and at a station temporal variations hydraulic geometry are required for efficient and effective management of flow regimes sediment and nutrient transport and physical habitats at catchment to global scales data describing observed hydraulic conditions at 1327 stream reaches in france and new zealand were compiled alongside reach descriptors and upstream catchments extracted from available gis databases with nationwide coverage three contrasting empirical methods were developed to predict hydraulic geometry at unvisited sites the first method applied basic models in which downstream hydraulic geometry parameters depend on discharge only the second method applied separate country specific models whose predictors were selected from the available nationwide gis data from country the third method applied an intercontinental model in which all observed hydraulic data were lumped together and predictors were selected from those available across both countries flexible regression models that account for interactions were used to parameterize second and third methods cross validation tests showed that downstream parameters were well predicted for independent sites regardless of country model performance was higher for width than for depth at a station parameters were less well predicted than downstream parameters but the models provided satisfactory predictions of observed reach hydraulics importantly the lumped intercontinental model performance was comparable to that of the country specific models this suggests that our approach can be applied in other regions where

spatially explicit catchment scale models will be increasingly needed for guiding management actions given the expected modifications of the hydrological regime due to climate change milly et al 2005 marx et al 2018 large scale variations in river hydraulics are often represented by two types of hydraulic geometry relationships leopold and maddock 1953 at a station hydraulic geometry describes how hydraulic characteristics change with discharge rate over time at a given location downstream hydraulic geometry describes how hydraulic characteristics change longitudinally in space at a characteristic reference flow such as the median or the bankfull flow e g lee and julien 2006 most hydraulic geometry models have been developed and applied at the scale of individual river cross sections knighton 1998 however some recent studies have considered reach scale hydraulic geometry where a river reach corresponds to approximately 10 20 channel widths in length and includes several sequences of geomorphic units such as pools and riffles jowett 1998 lamouroux and capra 2002 stewardson 2005 lamouroux 2008 navratil and albert 2010 reach scale hydraulic geometry may be easier to understand and to predict than cross section scale hydraulic geometry because the reach scale averaging of cross section data smooths out complicated local variations stewardson 2005 following the formulations of leopold and maddock 1953 many authors have expressed variations in reach average hydraulic characteristics as a function of discharge rate as 1 w a q b 2 h c q f for at a station relationships and 3 w 50 a d q 50 b d 4 h 50 c d q 50 f d for downstream relationships where w and h are respectively the reach averaged wetted width and water depth at instantaneous discharge q w50 and h50 are reach averaged wetted width and water depth at reference discharge here chosen as the median daily discharge q50 parameters a b c f and ad bd cd fd are the hydraulic geometry coefficients and exponents because w and h increase monotonously with q at a station eqs 1 2 w w50 and h h50 when q q50 therefore eqs 1 2 can be reparametrized as 5 w w 50 q q 50 b 6 h h 50 q q 50 f it is notable that the reach averaged velocity can be approximated from discharge average depth and wetted width lamouroux 2008 stewardson 2005 by 7 v q w h where v is the reach averaged velocity at a given discharge q and associated width and depth exponents of hydraulic geometry relationships vary over similar ranges in different geomorphic contexts e g knighton 1998 mean exponents values across locations approximate b 0 14 f 0 3 bd 0 5 and fd 0 36 knighton 1998 however large variations occur between locations due to the influence of factors other than discharge rate alone dingman 2007 downstream hydraulic geometry variations have been well documented in the literature e g de rose et al 2008 eaton 2013 gleason 2015 huang and nanson 1998 and have been related to factors such as bed material size texture and strength of bank materials stream slope or the nature of the riparian vegetation at a station hydraulic geometry is generally more difficult to predict but should theoretically depend on cross section shape bankfull geometry and flow resistance dingman 2007 this is consistent with morel et al 2019 who found that the at a station reach scale exponent for width was well explained by longitudinal and lateral channel shape descriptors the depth exponent was less explained and related to both lateral channel shape and roughness several empirical studies have attempted to model the hydraulic characteristics w h and v of stream reaches across large areas i e over national hydrographic networks or large catchments by relating observed hydraulic patterns to discharge and a series of physical variables available from geographic information system gis with national coverage for example booker and dunbar 2008 developed a method for predicting cross sectional wetted width water depth and current velocity in england and wales booker 2010 proposed a method to predict wetted width at any discharge across the hydrographic network of new zealand from several nationally available variables describing landscape settings however these empirical studies did not clearly report the ability of the models to explain at a station and downstream variations and models have not been tested on international data sets where the correlations between explanatory variables of hydraulic geometry can be more varied and complex empirical methods used to model hydraulic geometry from gis variables were often based on statistical regressions e g linear regression model multilevel models such models are not able to describe flexible response forms due to constraints associated with mathematical linearity moreover such models may be sensitive to outliers and make implicit assumptions on data distributions that are not always verified the use of recent machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks hornik et al 1989 support vector machines vapnik 1998 and random forests rf breiman 2001 can provide more flexible predictive models with good predictive performance in particular rf comprises groups of regression trees that produce robust ensemble predictions they have been successfully applied for classification and regression studies in many different fields for example to predict grain size distributions in rivers e g haddadchi et al 2018 or habitat suitabilities for aquatic species snelder et al 2011a booker 2016 rf provides a measure of the relative importance of each predictor variable in this study we use rf models to develop and test international empirical models of reach scale hydraulic geometries that can be applied across entire stream networks we develop several models of w and h based on eqs 5 6 using unique hydraulic data collected in 1202 stream reaches in france and 125 in new zealand all models are two step models that first estimate b and f exponents in eqs 5 6 then estimate reach hydraulic characteristics h50 w50 at median flow q50 our first basic method considers b and f exponents as constants i e neglects at a station variations and uses q50 as the unique explanatory variable in our second country specific method hydraulic geometry parameters depend on different gis derived explanatory variables available in each country our third intercontinental method uses similar gis variables available in both countries we compare how these alternative methods explain observed width and depth and at a station vs downstream variations this comparison aims to 1 assess the added value of complex models i e country specific and intercontinental methods compared to simple ones i e basic method 2 assess the possibility to develop general models that can be applied intercontinentally 3 infer the dominant variables explaining hydraulic geometry parameters across a wide range of climates and topographies using data on velocity in part of our reaches we also test how our models for width and depth can predict reach averaged velocities with eq 7 2 method 2 1 hydraulic data reach hydraulic measurements were collected in continental france and in new zealand and spread over the entire territory in both countries fig 1 providing wide variations in terms of geomorphic contexts table 1 hydraulic data come from four distinct sources french data come from applications of the river statistical habitat model estimhab n 415 reaches lamouroux 2002 based on lamouroux and capra 2002 applications of the french national tool for characterization of the river hydromorphology carhyce n 764 reaches gob et al 2014 and applications of the numerical habitat model evha n 23 ginot 1998 lamouroux et al 1995 new zealand data came essentially from application of the river habitat model rhyhabsim n 125 reaches see jowett et al 2008 booker 2016 for further details estimhab is mainly used to predict availability of suitable physical habitat for different fish species within stream reaches and requires the measurement of reach depth and width at two contrasting discharge rates generally below q50 carhyce baudoin et al 2017 is a tool designed for the implementation of the european water framework directive wfd regarding the geomorphic quality of rivers it has been applied at a large number of river reaches in france its application also includes measurements of average depth and width at reach scale in most cases n 685 764 carhyce has been applied at a single discharge rate however some reaches carhyce reaches n 79 764 have been surveyed at two different discharges generally below q50 evha is a numerical habitat model containing a one dimensional hydraulic model mainly used to evaluate the physical habitat of fish species its application requires detailed measurements of point depth width and water column velocity across the reach at one discharge similar to evha rhyhabsim is used for predicting the availability of suitable physical habitat for different fish species its application requires measurement of point depth width and depth averaged velocity across the reach at one discharge however with rhyhabsim data repeated surveys of water surface level at several cross sections and for several discharge rates make it possible to construct stage discharge relationships for each cross section and to extrapolate reach width and depth at several discharges following booker 2016 reach averaged hydraulics was extrapolated from these measurements for 20 increments of flow between the percentile q90 i e daily discharges exceeded 90 of the time and q50 as estimated from the ungauged site flow duration curves developed and tested by booker and woods 2014 all sources of data concerned reaches whose morphology was not directly altered e g by channelization reshaping or embankment according to the expertise of the data collectors although such expertise is always debatable in european rivers that all have some degree of historical alteration see discussion section below by contrast data sources had varying degrees of hydrological regulation from no alteration carhyce reaches to moderate alteration i e no influence of abstraction according to the expertise of data collectors other carhyce reaches to undocumented but potentially high alteration most estimhab rhyhabsim and evha reaches were downstream of hydropower dams we used these groups to test a posteriori if our results were influenced by different degrees of hydrological regulation all four sources of data share similarities in field measurement protocols for all sources c a 15 cross sections were placed along the reach with a regularly spacing for carhyce and estimhab at spacings equal to average bankfull width and larger than average wetted width respectively but not necessary regular for evha and rhyhabsim cross section locations were selected in order to best represent the reach morphology in view of the hydraulic modelling at each cross section wetted width was measured and water depths were measured along the cross section at regularly spaced points along the cross section except for evha and rhyhabsim protocols in which water depths are generally regularly spaced with extra points placed to represent rapid changes in bed height evha and rhyhabsim also include measurements of water velocity in their protocols for reaches without regularly spaced cross sections and or water depths spacings each point depth and width measurement was weighted by wetted area it represented as appropriate for estimating reach average hydraulics surveys at different discharge rates were associated with data of estimhab and rhyhasim as well as carhyce applications for all sources of data surveyed discharges were generally below q50 and the reach measurement provided on average of 15 wetted widths and 120 water depths details of four sources of data are given in table 2 2 2 gis data stream networks of france and new zealand have been digitalized into national geographic information databases rht réseau hydrographique théorique pella et al 2012 and rec river environment classification snelder and biggs 2002 respectively both river networks have a similar construction rec was derived from a 30 m digital elevation model dem and comprises 560 000 stream segments with a mean length of 700 m in the same way rht was created from a 50 m dem and comprises about 115 000 stream segments with a mean length of 2 5 km both databases include environmental descriptors for all river segments in both countries available descriptors include hydrological indices sauquet and catalogne 2011 booker and woods 2014 for the rht and the rec respectively produced from hydrological models that utilise catchment characteristics such as catchment area segment slope landcover and geology and tested against observations from dense gauging station networks however uncertainties are associated with the attributes of the databases see discussion section below potential predictors of the hydraulic geometry parameters were derived from rht and rec over 36 variables in new zealand and 16 variables in france were associated to each reach see table 3 for a list of variables selected for each country both databases have their own variables describing climate i e precipitation hydrology and temperature characteristics geomorphology land cover and bedrock geology however catchment area usca mean average catchment slope usaveslope segment slope segslope segment average altitude segaltitude specific median flow speq50 strahler stream ordination strahler and a geological index describing substrate hardness ushard were all described in the same form in france and new zealand see snelder et al 2008 leathwick et al 2003 2 3 modelling approach 2 3 1 estimation of observed w50 h50 b and f our predictions of reach hydraulics w h and v were derived from estimations of the four parameters of eqs 5 and 6 w50 h50 b and f field observations were used to derive estimates of these parameters noted w50 h50 b and f in reaches with data at several discharge rates b and f were estimated by separately regressing width and depth against discharge eqs 1 2 for the reaches with measurements at only one discharge n 685 764 carhyce reaches at a station exponents were approximated by assigning the mean b and f values observed in reaches with multiple measurements then in all reaches we estimated w50 and h50 using 8 w 50 w s q 50 q s b 9 h 50 h s q 50 q s f where qs was the measurement discharge closest to q50 ws and hs are reach average wetted width and water depth at qs at a station hydraulic geometry relationships are sensitive to sampling error and to the values of the survey discharge rates especially when relationships have been established from few surveys stewardson 2005 navratil and albert 2010 prior checks were applied on our data sets for the reaches with multiple measurements we removed reaches with less than a 66 difference in flow between surveys furthermore we removed sites with suspicious at a station exponents values i e not in the range 0 1 we also excluded reaches without known locations and sites with suspicious rht rec flow attributes e g when the measured discharge is greater than the estimated high flow percentile q05 or less than the low flow percentile q95 i e daily discharges exceeded 5 and 95 of the time respectively which can be induced by sampling errors wrong estimations of flow duration curves in the rht rec segment or incorrect location of the site on the river network finally 1304 reaches were collected for downstream hydraulic geometry analyses 764 carhyce reaches 415 estimhab reaches and 125 rhyhabsim reaches comprising 619 reaches in which at a station hydraulic geometry was known 79 carhyce reaches 415 estimhab reaches and 125 rhyhabsim reaches the additional 23 evha reaches were not considered in the modelling stage and were only used as independent data set to quantify model performance 2 3 2 model formulations in this study three methods using different model formulations for predicting the four estimated hydraulic geometry parameters w50 h50 b and f were applied and compared for both french and new zealand datasets see fig 2 for the general analytical logic the three methods were the first basic method modelled w50 and h50 as a function of q50 and at a station exponents b and f were considered as constant and their values were the respective mean of the whole dataset the second country specific method was based on a model of w50 h50 b f from country specific gis data table 3 the third intercontinental method fitted each parameter as a function of a selection of environmental variables similar in both databases table 3 this modelling strategy aims to assess the improvement of complex models i e country specific and intercontinental methods in prediction of reach water depth and wetted width compared to a basic and general hydraulic geometry model i e basic method the intercontinental method represented a universal method for the intercontinental method we made the assumption that the common variables were calculated in the same way and preliminary checks were made to ensure that these variables were defined on the same scale national estimations of sediment grain size were calculated as a geometric mean of local field measurement for france segdmean snelder et al 2011b and on 50th percentile of local measurement in new zealand segd50 haddadchi et al 2018 for the intercontinental method we considered that both descriptors were similar and we labelled them segd50 as in new zealand also intercontinental method was performed on an unbalanced data set table 2 because more sites were available from france that new zealand which can potentially affect the fitting and testing procedure fig 2 shows a flow chart outlining the strategy used to predict hydraulic characteristics the basic method was implemented using simple linear regression between both parameters w50 h50 and q50 in logarithmic scale the country specific and intercontinental methods were implemented using rf breiman 2001 an rf model comprises an ensemble of individual classification and regression trees a forest from which a final prediction is based on the predictions averaged over all trees breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 a rf model is created by drawing several bootstrap samples from the original training data and fitting a single classification tree to each sample independent predictions i e independent of the model fitting procedure are made for each tree from the observations that were excluded from the bootstrap sample the out of bag oob samples these predictions are aggregated over all trees the oob predictions and provide an estimate of the predictive performance of the model for new cases statistical analyses were performed on r r core team 2017 and rfs were performed using the package randomforest vsurf variable selection procedure from the vsurf package was applied for rf genuer et al 2010 2015 to obtain the best performing and parsimonious models vsurf reduces the number of explanatory variables by applying a step wise ascendant strategy designed to decrease error rate see genuer et al 2015 for a detailed description of the tool for each method natural logarithmic and square root transformations were applied to data with highly skewed distributions transformations applied to each variable are given in table 3 w50 and h50 were log transformed and square root transformation was applied on b for all data sets we used several methods to assess the performance of the different hydraulic geometry parameters models first we performed a leave one out loo cross validation procedure by leaving out each observation in turn fitting a model with all remaining data and then predicting the value of the left out observation this procedure provides an assessment of model performance for unvisited sites second we examined how well our models predicted w and h at any discharge by applying the eqs 5 and 6 in the same way we examined how well our models predicted v using equation 7 for data with velocity measurement 11 of our reaches i e 125 rhyhabsim and 23 evha reaches we quantified model predictive performance of our loo predictions using three performance metrics nash sutcliffe coefficient of model efficiency nse measures residual variance of model predictions relative to the total variance in the observed data nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse values can range from negative infinity to 1 nse values of 1 indicate a perfect match between observed and predicted values nse values less than 0 indicate that the observed mean is more accurate than model predictions nse values of 0 indicate that model predictions is as accurate as the mean of the observed data percent bias pbias is the ratio of the sum of the hydraulic parameters residual to the sum of the observed hydraulic geometry parameters and was used to estimate the tendency of the models to overpredict negative pbias or underpredict positive pbias the observed data gupta et al 2009 as error index we used the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr which standardises root mean square error rmse using the observations standard deviation lower rsr values indicate better model performance with zero indicating perfect correspondence between estimates and observations see moriasi et al 2007 for further details about calculation and complementarity of these metrics when comparing observed and predicted values in order to examine the nature of the rf models we used partial dependence plots and importance measures partial dependence plots show the marginal effect of an individual explanatory variable on the response after fixing the other explanatory variables at their average value partial dependence plots are designed to demonstrate the influence of each explanatory variable independent of changes in all other explanatory variables whilst these graphs are not a perfect representation of the effects of each variable particularly if there are strong interactions or explanatory variables are correlated they do provide useful information for interpretation friedman and meulman 2003 importance of a specific explanatory variable is evaluated by randomly permuting explanatory variable values in turn and predicting the response of oob observations booker and whitehead 2018 ellis et al 2012 in order to check the consistency in the contribution of the explanatory variables to model accuracy and the response of each hydraulic geometry parameter to the explanatory variables we inspected the importance measures and the partial plots for each of these models 3 results 3 1 hydraulic geometry parameters models summary statistics describing the loo cross validation performance of the three methods for the four hydraulic geometry parameters were presented in fig 3 for w50 and h50 performance metrics were calculated between log transformed observed vs predicted values fig 3 and fig 4 and between the square root transformed observed vs predicted values for the b parameter for w50 models nse values of french and new zealand models were both high i e 0 80 nse 0 90 and represented strong ability of the models to represent observed patterns at unvisited sites nse values of the country specific and intercontinental methods were comparable and presented relatively small increase from the basic method lowest rsr values were observed on w50 models 0 32 rsr 0 44 regardless of the method rsr values were relatively lowest for new zealand models regardless of method both countries presented a highest value of rsr for the basic method french and new zealand models of h50 shared similarities in terms of nse values 0 42 nse 0 67 and both country specific and intercontinental methods presented higher values than the basic method as for w50 the country specific and intercontinental methods had comparable values of nse h50 models shared relatively correct rsr values 0 57 rsr 0 76 without particular distinction between french and new zealand models the basic method presented higher rsr values than the two others methods for both countries in comparison with the previous downstream parameters at a station exponent models presented low nse values nse values of exponent b models ranged between 0 01 and 0 34 representing relative poor explanatory power higher values were observed in models of country specific and intercontinental methods for new zealand models nse value was higher when the country specific method was applied in comparison to when the intercontinental method was applied i e 0 28 and 0 17 respectively for france nse values remained constant between both methods i e 0 34 and 0 31 for the basic and country specific methods respectively nse values of f models ranged between 0 01 and 0 13 and global results shared the same pattern as that for b models i e nse values are higher for models of the country specific and intercontinental methods new zealand models presented higher value in the country specific method than the intercontinental method and french models of both country specific and intercontinental methods were similar both exponents models also presented rsr values close to one 0 81 rsr 1 00 and 0 93 rsr 1 00 for b and f respectively globally both exponents shared a similar pattern with a decrease of rsr values for models of the country specific and intercontinental methods compared to the basic method no important between country differences in rsr values were observed although relatively smaller rsr values for b and f exponents models of the country specific method were evident for new zealand negligible biases were observed in our models regardless of the method and the country for all four parameters 2 1 pbias 2 2 generally pbias values close to zero indicate that the average tendencies of simulated variables estimated by the models were close to the respective observed hydraulic geometry parameters however high rsr values of b and f models demonstrate large variance in predicted variables variable importance was calculated for each explanatory variable for each response that was generalised using random forests fig 5 q50 was the most important explanatory variable for both french and new zealand models of w50 when the country specific method was applied the hydrological descriptors speq50 or speannualfloodfr and the climatic descriptors usrainmean and usrain1d presented similar importance values indicating that their overall influence on the french model of w50 was comparable for the new zealand model of w50 catchment size descriptor usca was also an important variable the variables q50 usca and to a lesser extent segslope and usraindays25 are the variables which contributed the most to the country specific new zealand model of h50 a similar pattern was found for the french model of h50 in which q50 and segslope were the strongest variables followed by segaltitude usaveslope and speq50 for the at a station exponents similarities in variable importance were not as evident as for the downstream parameters for the new zealand model of exponent b segd50 segriffle and usbare were the only variables selected in the preliminary variable selection procedure more variables were retained for the french model of exponent b although usaveslope and segaltitude were the most important the variable selection procedure retained only three variables for the new zealand model of f usca seggrainsorting and usbare a similar pattern was not found for the french model of f for which usrain1d and usdraindens had the higher importance variable importance displayed a high level of generality and agreement with the intercontinental models q50 segd50 and speq50 had high importance for the w50 model q50 segslope and usaveslope were the most important variables for the h50 model such similarities were not found for the f exponent model for which only q50 usaveslope and usca were pre selected for the b exponent model no particular similarity with the country specific models was found in terms of variable importance except for the contribution of segslope and segd50 despite the specificities in terms of importance of explanatory variables of french and new zealand models downstream hydraulic geometry parameters showed similar responses to the explanatory variables fig 6 and fig 7 partial dependence plots suggested that relationships between w50 and the 3 most important variables were frequently linear after variable transformation and similar in form both models for example the partial dependence plots indicated that w50 increased with increasing of hydrological descriptors q50 speq50 and speannualfloodfr and with increasing of catchment size usca furthermore these relationships were also observed in the intercontinental model fig 8 in the same way h50 had also positive relationships with catchment size usca and hydrological q50 descriptors and declined with morphological descriptors such as segslope usaveslope or segaltitude in both country specific models and also in the intercontinental model no such relationships were observed regarding the at a station exponents it was notable that b showed a similar response to the variable describing the average bed sediment grain size segd50 in new zealand and the intercontinental model this response was characterized by an increase of b as grain size increase fig 6 and fig 8 also partial dependence plots indicated that b was positively related to the mean slope of upstream catchment usaveslope in french country specific model and intercontinental model concerning f partial dependence plots did not indicate similar relationships between our models 3 2 models testing we assessed the effectiveness of our three different methods for predicting w h and v at each reach on each survey cross validated performance metrics between observed and predicted log transformed w h and v were calculated for each method summaries of the performance of these models are shown in fig 3 predictions of w performed well regardless of the method and the country nse values ranged between 0 78 and 0 89 rsr values ranged between 0 33 and 0 46 and biases were negligible 1 5 pbias 1 0 intercontinental and country specific models provide slightly better performance than the basic model h predictions performances were variable between countries and methods nse values obtained from new zealand models were substantially lower than french values regardless of method values ranged from 0 40 to 0 50 for new zealand models and from 0 48 to 0 65 for french models similarly rsr ranged from 0 78 to 0 71 for new zealand and from 0 72 to 0 59 for france notable biases were observed on new zealand predictions for the country specific and intercontinental methods pbias values of 5 5 and 7 0 for country specific and intercontinental method respectively compared to the basic method pbias value of 2 0 inversely pbias values obtained on french predictions were negligible v predictions presented similar performance to that of the h predictions performance was better for rf based models although new zealand predictions were less well predicted than french predictions globally predictions obtained with the country specific and intercontinental methods corresponded better with observations than when the basic method was applied especially for h and v predictions although predictions for new zealand sites were less well predicted and presented more bias and errors than for french sites when extrapolating our models to the national scale for example with french country specific models our models predict that 17 of rivers are larger than 10 m 14 are deeper than 0 5 m and 47 have velocity higher than 0 2 m s across french river network at median flow q50 fig 9 w and h predictions were comparable among the groups of reaches with different degrees of hydrological alterations in detail regressions of log transformed observed vs predicted w and h demonstrated the robustness of our predictions to the degree of alteration performances for each group are presented in table 4 4 discussion although several previous hydraulic geometry studies have used combinations of gis based explanatory variables for hydraulic geometry modelling e g booker and dunbar 2008 booker 2010 the present study is the first to separately investigate at a station and downstream hydraulic geometry from a large intercontinental data set of reach scale hydraulic geometry parameters in the present study we derived at a station and downstream hydraulic geometry models aiming to predict reach averaged water depth wetted width and current velocity across france and new zealand river networks these models are based on the respective digital river network of each country and readily derived explanatory variables we also combined both data sets in order to test the potentiality for model generalization by using explanatory variables common to both data sets we applied our models across the entire river networks of france and new zealand to produce maps of predicted hydraulics w h and v e g fig 9 and fig 10 our tests to predict the hydraulic geometry at the surveyed instantaneous discharge indicated that the predictions were good representations of reach averaged width depth and velocity for both countries and that models were consistent and unbiased even when cross validation was applied unsurprisingly the basic method performed less well than the rf based methods for both countries however the intercontinental method provided equally good performance as the country specific method wetted widths were well predicted regardless of method and country this is mainly the result of good predictions of the w50 parameter overriding weak performance of our b exponent models only minor improvements of w50 predictions were obtained with the rf based methods for both countries underlying the strong relationships between w50 and q50 of the basic method furthermore the variables having the highest contribution in w50 models of country specific and intercontinental methods were mainly q50 and other hydrological and catchment size descriptors such as speq50 speannualfloodfr and usca and for both countries these results suggest that w50 is essentially related to catchment size and hydrology and that descriptions of climate landcover and geomorphology e g usrainmean usbare segd50 provide surprisingly minor contribution to our models despite the purely empirical approach used in this study results are consistent with previous downstream hydraulic geometry studies for example faustini et al 2009 rawlins et al 2014 and wilkerson et al 2014 reported strong influences of catchment size and hydrological descriptors on width booker 2010 also noted minor contribution of climatic land cover or other catchment attributes when modelling cross sectional wetted width as function of catchment area across new zealand although an empirical approach was applied patterns in modelled results did have physical explanations globally for the same discharge rivers with larger catchments wetter climates or larger flood events tend to be wider than rivers with smaller catchment dryer climates or smaller flood events land cover and grain size also exerts control on the strength and stability of channel banks and therefore on the adjustment of channel width millar 2000 piégay et al 2005 exponent b models perform poorly but the rf based models performed better than a null model in which b was a constant mean of the whole dataset i e basic method moreover similarities in explanatory variable contributions were observed between the country specific models and the intercontinental model especially with the sediment grain size descriptors and average slope of the upstream catchment i e segd50 and usaveslope respectively width exponent tends to increase in reaches with largest sediment grain size and steepest slopes similar relationships with both variables is coherent because of the strong relationships between grain size and catchment slope snelder et al 2011b curiously this result is inconsistent with previous studies ridenour and giardino 1994 david et al 2010 morel et al 2019 that tried to relate grain size descriptors with at a station width exponent and did not reveal significant relationships reaches with high slope and high sediment grain size may also be interpreted as reaches with important sediment delivery and non cohesive banks in that case channel shape is mostly wide with shallow banks and presents high capacity to widen with increasing discharge lateral channel shape has been reported as the main control on exponent in analytical studies e g dingman 2007 unlike w the predictions of h obtained by the country specific and intercontinental methods were more effective than the basic method this is mostly due to the best performance of the rf based models for predicting h50 parameter in comparison with the basic method this suggests that besides q50 other explanatory variables are required for predicting reach water depth our analyses indicated that catchment size and geomorphic descriptors especially segslope contributed well to our models this suggests that reach water depth is also related to reach scale features in general for the same discharge rivers in small and steep catchments tend to be shallower this is consistent with previous studies on downstream hydraulic geometry arguing that discharge information is not enough for predicting water depth for example lee and julien 2006 proposed equations of water depth based on hydraulic geometry relationships using variables describing bed sediment grain size or stream slope in addition to the discharge exponent f is largely unexplained in our analyses and no strong relationships with explanatory variables and similarities between both countries have been identified new zealand models of h performed less well than french models despite similar performance of h50 and f models one possible explanation is that our new zealand data set contained reaches with a broad range of depths in comparison to our french data set reach averaged velocity v is well estimated by eq 7 therefore we predicted mean velocity with our models well globally for both countries the country specific and intercontinental models performed better than the basic models and french models were relatively more effective than the new zealand models these results are mainly the consequence of the h predictions because of the dependency of eq 7 with w and h at a station exponents were predicted weakly and contained some bias our rf based models however performed better than a model with constant average values of exponents i e basic method furthermore these results revealed consistencies with theoretical analyses e g dingman 2007 ferguson 1986 that argued that at a station exponents are mainly related to channel form and flow resistance rather than catchment scale attributes it is also consistent with descriptive approaches as in morel et al 2019 who found that exponents are more related to local features and channel form such as relative bedform submergence fluvial pattern or ratio of reach average median wetted width to bankfull width than catchment scale attributes as used in our analyses unexpectedly the intercontinental method almost performed better than the country specific method despite restriction in available explanatory variables that suggests that hydraulic characteristics can be well predicted with common and very general gis variables such as catchment area stream slope and hydrological descriptors these results also demonstrate the potential generality of our models at international scale this could also suggest that rf models perform better when provided with larger data sets this makes sense because many data points are needed to characterise flexible relationships and interactions that can be represented by an rf model several limitations should be taken in account in our modelling approaches first hydraulic and flow measurements are subject to considerable uncertainty that may be a source of the overall model uncertainties in particular at a station hydraulic geometry is sensitive to observation uncertainties especially when stage discharge relationship are fitted using observations at only a small number of discharges morel et al 2019 navratil and albert 2010 uncertainties can also be related to a possible non linearity in hydraulic discharge relationships at some sites although the at a station relationships are generally linear for the range of the studied flows navratil and albert 2010 moreover the hydraulic geometry relationships have their own uncertainties especially the at a station hydraulic geometry which are not static and do change over time due to perturbations in river channel characteristics phillips 1990 1991 the use of reach averaged hydraulic geometry in our study should smooth possible sampling errors stewardson 2005 and reduce these uncertainties and we attempted to reduce at a station hydraulic geometry uncertainties by selecting only reaches with contrasted surveyed flows in addition we selected reaches with a priori low morphological alteration however all reaches especially in europe were likely influenced by a long history of land and water uses e g undocumented flow abstraction groundwater withdrawals change in land use and riparian vegetation urbanisation of the catchment area gravel mining unknown in channel modifications and documenting these influences at the scale of our study would be challenging we demonstrated that our results were comparable among groups of reaches with various degrees of hydrological alterations suggesting some robustness to these undocumented potential alterations nevertheless an improved knowledge of the alteration of morphologies may improve our understanding of hydraulic geometry furthermore the explanatory variables derived from the gis databases have their own often large uncertainties lamouroux et al 2014 for example estimates of discharge statistics at ungauged sites in such databases have uncertainties around 100 for low discharge rates 1 m3 s lamouroux et al 2014 it is unlikely that these uncertainties affect our main results given the large range of environmental gradients considered in our study for example median discharges in our reaches spans three orders of magnitude table 1 nevertheless we expect that reduced uncertainties in gis databases will improve the models random forest predictions can never fall outside the range of the training data booker and whitehead 2018 for this reason predictions of our models beyond the range of the training data i e 1 45 m for wetted width and 0 09 1 20 m for water depth should not be considered however the reaches involved in our study are representative of a large proportion of hydrographic river networks for example only 1 75 of the length of the french hydrographic network and 1 31 of new zealand hydrographic network have q50 values above the maximum observed in our data sets pella et al 2012 booker and woods 2014 finally our w h and v models have been performed using reach measurements in a range of flows generally below q50 consequently these models cover frequently occurring flows and their ability to predict hydraulic characteristics at extremes flows is questionable 5 conclusions three alternative methods were tested for predicting reach average wetted width water depth and velocity across france and new zealand river networks these methods represent varying approaches to modelling the downstream and at a station parameters depending on explanatory variables availability and model complexity results from cross validation tests indicated that predictive performances of rf based methods performed better when predicting at unvisited sites overall our methods did well at predicting downstream parameters but were less efficient for at a station parameters best performing method will be used to derive the most accurate predictions of the hydraulic geometry across the river networks fig 9 and fig 10 these national predictions will be useful for a wide range of national and or catchment scale

5852,hydraulic geometry is used to describe spatio temporal variations in wetted width mean depth and mean velocity with discharge in stream reaches models describing downstream spatial variations and at a station temporal variations hydraulic geometry are required for efficient and effective management of flow regimes sediment and nutrient transport and physical habitats at catchment to global scales data describing observed hydraulic conditions at 1327 stream reaches in france and new zealand were compiled alongside reach descriptors and upstream catchments extracted from available gis databases with nationwide coverage three contrasting empirical methods were developed to predict hydraulic geometry at unvisited sites the first method applied basic models in which downstream hydraulic geometry parameters depend on discharge only the second method applied separate country specific models whose predictors were selected from the available nationwide gis data from country the third method applied an intercontinental model in which all observed hydraulic data were lumped together and predictors were selected from those available across both countries flexible regression models that account for interactions were used to parameterize second and third methods cross validation tests showed that downstream parameters were well predicted for independent sites regardless of country model performance was higher for width than for depth at a station parameters were less well predicted than downstream parameters but the models provided satisfactory predictions of observed reach hydraulics importantly the lumped intercontinental model performance was comparable to that of the country specific models this suggests that our approach can be applied in other regions where similar explanatory environmental variables are available keywords reach hydraulic geometry river modelling river hydraulics random forests catchment management 1 introduction river hydraulics

statzner et al 1988 quantitative spatial and temporal variations in river hydraulic characteristics e g wetted width water depth current velocity across stream networks is therefore a key input for

fishes malcolm et al 2012 invertebrates dolédec et al 2007 macrophytes riis and biggs 2003 and periphyton hoyle et al 2017 several studies have used estimations of river hydraulics distributed over

spatially explicit catchment scale models will be increasingly needed for guiding management actions given the expected modifications of the hydrological regime due to climate change milly et al 2005 marx et al 2018 large scale variations in river hydraulics are often represented by two types of hydraulic geometry relationships leopold and maddock 1953 at a station hydraulic geometry describes how hydraulic characteristics change with discharge rate over time at a given location downstream hydraulic geometry describes how hydraulic characteristics change longitudinally in space at a characteristic reference flow such as the median or the bankfull flow e g lee and julien 2006 most hydraulic geometry models have been developed and applied at the scale of individual river cross sections knighton 1998 however some recent studies have considered reach scale hydraulic geometry where a river reach corresponds to approximately 10 20 channel widths in length and includes several sequences of geomorphic units such as pools and riffles jowett 1998 lamouroux and capra 2002 stewardson 2005 lamouroux 2008 navratil and albert 2010 reach scale hydraulic geometry may be easier to understand and to predict than cross section scale hydraulic geometry because the reach scale averaging of cross section data smooths out complicated local variations stewardson 2005 following the formulations of leopold and maddock 1953 many authors have expressed variations in reach average hydraulic characteristics as a function of discharge rate as 1 w a q b 2 h c q f for at a station relationships and 3 w 50 a d q 50 b d 4 h 50 c d q 50 f d for downstream relationships where w and h are respectively the reach averaged wetted width and water depth at instantaneous discharge q w50 and h50 are reach averaged wetted width and water depth at reference discharge here chosen as the median daily discharge q50 parameters a b c f and ad bd cd fd are the hydraulic geometry coefficients and exponents because w and h increase monotonously with q at a station eqs 1 2 w w50 and h h50 when q q50 therefore eqs 1 2 can be reparametrized as 5 w w 50 q q 50 b 6 h h 50 q q 50 f it is notable that the reach averaged velocity can be approximated from discharge average depth and wetted width lamouroux 2008 stewardson 2005 by 7 v q w h where v is the reach averaged velocity at a given discharge q and associated width and depth exponents of hydraulic geometry relationships vary over similar ranges in different geomorphic contexts e g knighton 1998 mean exponents values across locations approximate b 0 14 f 0 3 bd 0 5 and fd 0 36 knighton 1998 however large variations occur between locations due to the influence of factors other than discharge rate alone dingman 2007 downstream hydraulic geometry variations have been well documented in the literature e g de rose et al 2008 eaton 2013 gleason 2015 huang and nanson 1998 and have been related to factors such as bed material size texture and strength of bank materials stream slope or the nature of the riparian vegetation at a station hydraulic geometry is generally more difficult to predict but should theoretically depend on cross section shape bankfull geometry and flow resistance dingman 2007 this is consistent with morel et al 2019 who found that the at a station reach scale exponent for width was well explained by longitudinal and lateral channel shape descriptors the depth exponent was less explained and related to both lateral channel shape and roughness several empirical studies have attempted to model the hydraulic characteristics w h and v of stream reaches across large areas i e over national hydrographic networks or large catchments by relating observed hydraulic patterns to discharge and a series of physical variables available from geographic information system gis with national coverage for example booker and dunbar 2008 developed a method for predicting cross sectional wetted width water depth and current velocity in england and wales booker 2010 proposed a method to predict wetted width at any discharge across the hydrographic network of new zealand from several nationally available variables describing landscape settings however these empirical studies did not clearly report the ability of the models to explain at a station and downstream variations and models have not been tested on international data sets where the correlations between explanatory variables of hydraulic geometry can be more varied and complex empirical methods used to model hydraulic geometry from gis variables were often based on statistical regressions e g linear regression model multilevel models such models are not able to describe flexible response forms due to constraints associated with mathematical linearity moreover such models may be sensitive to outliers and make implicit assumptions on data distributions that are not always verified the use of recent machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks hornik et al 1989 support vector machines vapnik 1998 and random forests rf breiman 2001 can provide more flexible predictive models with good predictive performance in particular rf comprises groups of regression trees that produce robust ensemble predictions they have been successfully applied for classification and regression studies in many different fields for example to predict grain size distributions in rivers e g haddadchi et al 2018 or habitat suitabilities for aquatic species snelder et al 2011a booker 2016 rf provides a measure of the relative importance of each predictor variable in this study we use rf models to develop and test international empirical models of reach scale hydraulic geometries that can be applied across entire stream networks we develop several models of w and h based on eqs 5 6 using unique hydraulic data collected in 1202 stream reaches in france and 125 in new zealand all models are two step models that first estimate b and f exponents in eqs 5 6 then estimate reach hydraulic characteristics h50 w50 at median flow q50 our first basic method considers b and f exponents as constants i e neglects at a station variations and uses q50 as the unique explanatory variable in our second country specific method hydraulic geometry parameters depend on different gis derived explanatory variables available in each country our third intercontinental method uses similar gis variables available in both countries we compare how these alternative methods explain observed width and depth and at a station vs downstream variations this comparison aims to 1 assess the added value of complex models i e country specific and intercontinental methods compared to simple ones i e basic method 2 assess the possibility to develop general models that can be applied intercontinentally 3 infer the dominant variables explaining hydraulic geometry parameters across a wide range of climates and topographies using data on velocity in part of our reaches we also test how our models for width and depth can predict reach averaged velocities with eq 7 2 method 2 1 hydraulic data reach hydraulic measurements were collected in continental france and in new zealand and spread over the entire territory in both countries fig 1 providing wide variations in terms of geomorphic contexts table 1 hydraulic data come from four distinct sources french data come from applications of the river statistical habitat model estimhab n 415 reaches lamouroux 2002 based on lamouroux and capra 2002 applications of the french national tool for characterization of the river hydromorphology carhyce n 764 reaches gob et al 2014 and applications of the numerical habitat model evha n 23 ginot 1998 lamouroux et al 1995 new zealand data came essentially from application of the river habitat model rhyhabsim n 125 reaches see jowett et al 2008 booker 2016 for further details estimhab is mainly used to predict availability of suitable physical habitat for different fish species within stream reaches and requires the measurement of reach depth and width at two contrasting discharge rates generally below q50 carhyce baudoin et al 2017 is a tool designed for the implementation of the european water framework directive wfd regarding the geomorphic quality of rivers it has been applied at a large number of river reaches in france its application also includes measurements of average depth and width at reach scale in most cases n 685 764 carhyce has been applied at a single discharge rate however some reaches carhyce reaches n 79 764 have been surveyed at two different discharges generally below q50 evha is a numerical habitat model containing a one dimensional hydraulic model mainly used to evaluate the physical habitat of fish species its application requires detailed measurements of point depth width and water column velocity across the reach at one discharge similar to evha rhyhabsim is used for predicting the availability of suitable physical habitat for different fish species its application requires measurement of point depth width and depth averaged velocity across the reach at one discharge however with rhyhabsim data repeated surveys of water surface level at several cross sections and for several discharge rates make it possible to construct stage discharge relationships for each cross section and to extrapolate reach width and depth at several discharges following booker 2016 reach averaged hydraulics was extrapolated from these measurements for 20 increments of flow between the percentile q90 i e daily discharges exceeded 90 of the time and q50 as estimated from the ungauged site flow duration curves developed and tested by booker and woods 2014 all sources of data concerned reaches whose morphology was not directly altered e g by channelization reshaping or embankment according to the expertise of the data collectors although such expertise is always debatable in european rivers that all have some degree of historical alteration see discussion section below by contrast data sources had varying degrees of hydrological regulation from no alteration carhyce reaches to moderate alteration i e no influence of abstraction according to the expertise of data collectors other carhyce reaches to undocumented but potentially high alteration most estimhab rhyhabsim and evha reaches were downstream of hydropower dams we used these groups to test a posteriori if our results were influenced by different degrees of hydrological regulation all four sources of data share similarities in field measurement protocols for all sources c a 15 cross sections were placed along the reach with a regularly spacing for carhyce and estimhab at spacings equal to average bankfull width and larger than average wetted width respectively but not necessary regular for evha and rhyhabsim cross section locations were selected in order to best represent the reach morphology in view of the hydraulic modelling at each cross section wetted width was measured and water depths were measured along the cross section at regularly spaced points along the cross section except for evha and rhyhabsim protocols in which water depths are generally regularly spaced with extra points placed to represent rapid changes in bed height evha and rhyhabsim also include measurements of water velocity in their protocols for reaches without regularly spaced cross sections and or water depths spacings each point depth and width measurement was weighted by wetted area it represented as appropriate for estimating reach average hydraulics surveys at different discharge rates were associated with data of estimhab and rhyhasim as well as carhyce applications for all sources of data surveyed discharges were generally below q50 and the reach measurement provided on average of 15 wetted widths and 120 water depths details of four sources of data are given in table 2 2 2 gis data stream networks of france and new zealand have been digitalized into national geographic information databases rht réseau hydrographique théorique pella et al 2012 and rec river environment classification snelder and biggs 2002 respectively both river networks have a similar construction rec was derived from a 30 m digital elevation model dem and comprises 560 000 stream segments with a mean length of 700 m in the same way rht was created from a 50 m dem and comprises about 115 000 stream segments with a mean length of 2 5 km both databases include environmental descriptors for all river segments in both countries available descriptors include hydrological indices sauquet and catalogne 2011 booker and woods 2014 for the rht and the rec respectively produced from hydrological models that utilise catchment characteristics such as catchment area segment slope landcover and geology and tested against observations from dense gauging station networks however uncertainties are associated with the attributes of the databases see discussion section below potential predictors of the hydraulic geometry parameters were derived from rht and rec over 36 variables in new zealand and 16 variables in france were associated to each reach see table 3 for a list of variables selected for each country both databases have their own variables describing climate i e precipitation hydrology and temperature characteristics geomorphology land cover and bedrock geology however catchment area usca mean average catchment slope usaveslope segment slope segslope segment average altitude segaltitude specific median flow speq50 strahler stream ordination strahler and a geological index describing substrate hardness ushard were all described in the same form in france and new zealand see snelder et al 2008 leathwick et al 2003 2 3 modelling approach 2 3 1 estimation of observed w50 h50 b and f our predictions of reach hydraulics w h and v were derived from estimations of the four parameters of eqs 5 and 6 w50 h50 b and f field observations were used to derive estimates of these parameters noted w50 h50 b and f in reaches with data at several discharge rates b and f were estimated by separately regressing width and depth against discharge eqs 1 2 for the reaches with measurements at only one discharge n 685 764 carhyce reaches at a station exponents were approximated by assigning the mean b and f values observed in reaches with multiple measurements then in all reaches we estimated w50 and h50 using 8 w 50 w s q 50 q s b 9 h 50 h s q 50 q s f where qs was the measurement discharge closest to q50 ws and hs are reach average wetted width and water depth at qs at a station hydraulic geometry relationships are sensitive to sampling error and to the values of the survey discharge rates especially when relationships have been established from few surveys stewardson 2005 navratil and albert 2010 prior checks were applied on our data sets for the reaches with multiple measurements we removed reaches with less than a 66 difference in flow between surveys furthermore we removed sites with suspicious at a station exponents values i e not in the range 0 1 we also excluded reaches without known locations and sites with suspicious rht rec flow attributes e g when the measured discharge is greater than the estimated high flow percentile q05 or less than the low flow percentile q95 i e daily discharges exceeded 5 and 95 of the time respectively which can be induced by sampling errors wrong estimations of flow duration curves in the rht rec segment or incorrect location of the site on the river network finally 1304 reaches were collected for downstream hydraulic geometry analyses 764 carhyce reaches 415 estimhab reaches and 125 rhyhabsim reaches comprising 619 reaches in which at a station hydraulic geometry was known 79 carhyce reaches 415 estimhab reaches and 125 rhyhabsim reaches the additional 23 evha reaches were not considered in the modelling stage and were only used as independent data set to quantify model performance 2 3 2 model formulations in this study three methods using different model formulations for predicting the four estimated hydraulic geometry parameters w50 h50 b and f were applied and compared for both french and new zealand datasets see fig 2 for the general analytical logic the three methods were the first basic method modelled w50 and h50 as a function of q50 and at a station exponents b and f were considered as constant and their values were the respective mean of the whole dataset the second country specific method was based on a model of w50 h50 b f from country specific gis data table 3 the third intercontinental method fitted each parameter as a function of a selection of environmental variables similar in both databases table 3 this modelling strategy aims to assess the improvement of complex models i e country specific and intercontinental methods in prediction of reach water depth and wetted width compared to a basic and general hydraulic geometry model i e basic method the intercontinental method represented a universal method for the intercontinental method we made the assumption that the common variables were calculated in the same way and preliminary checks were made to ensure that these variables were defined on the same scale national estimations of sediment grain size were calculated as a geometric mean of local field measurement for france segdmean snelder et al 2011b and on 50th percentile of local measurement in new zealand segd50 haddadchi et al 2018 for the intercontinental method we considered that both descriptors were similar and we labelled them segd50 as in new zealand also intercontinental method was performed on an unbalanced data set table 2 because more sites were available from france that new zealand which can potentially affect the fitting and testing procedure fig 2 shows a flow chart outlining the strategy used to predict hydraulic characteristics the basic method was implemented using simple linear regression between both parameters w50 h50 and q50 in logarithmic scale the country specific and intercontinental methods were implemented using rf breiman 2001 an rf model comprises an ensemble of individual classification and regression trees a forest from which a final prediction is based on the predictions averaged over all trees breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 a rf model is created by drawing several bootstrap samples from the original training data and fitting a single classification tree to each sample independent predictions i e independent of the model fitting procedure are made for each tree from the observations that were excluded from the bootstrap sample the out of bag oob samples these predictions are aggregated over all trees the oob predictions and provide an estimate of the predictive performance of the model for new cases statistical analyses were performed on r r core team 2017 and rfs were performed using the package randomforest vsurf variable selection procedure from the vsurf package was applied for rf genuer et al 2010 2015 to obtain the best performing and parsimonious models vsurf reduces the number of explanatory variables by applying a step wise ascendant strategy designed to decrease error rate see genuer et al 2015 for a detailed description of the tool for each method natural logarithmic and square root transformations were applied to data with highly skewed distributions transformations applied to each variable are given in table 3 w50 and h50 were log transformed and square root transformation was applied on b for all data sets we used several methods to assess the performance of the different hydraulic geometry parameters models first we performed a leave one out loo cross validation procedure by leaving out each observation in turn fitting a model with all remaining data and then predicting the value of the left out observation this procedure provides an assessment of model performance for unvisited sites second we examined how well our models predicted w and h at any discharge by applying the eqs 5 and 6 in the same way we examined how well our models predicted v using equation 7 for data with velocity measurement 11 of our reaches i e 125 rhyhabsim and 23 evha reaches we quantified model predictive performance of our loo predictions using three performance metrics nash sutcliffe coefficient of model efficiency nse measures residual variance of model predictions relative to the total variance in the observed data nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse values can range from negative infinity to 1 nse values of 1 indicate a perfect match between observed and predicted values nse values less than 0 indicate that the observed mean is more accurate than model predictions nse values of 0 indicate that model predictions is as accurate as the mean of the observed data percent bias pbias is the ratio of the sum of the hydraulic parameters residual to the sum of the observed hydraulic geometry parameters and was used to estimate the tendency of the models to overpredict negative pbias or underpredict positive pbias the observed data gupta et al 2009 as error index we used the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr which standardises root mean square error rmse using the observations standard deviation lower rsr values indicate better model performance with zero indicating perfect correspondence between estimates and observations see moriasi et al 2007 for further details about calculation and complementarity of these metrics when comparing observed and predicted values in order to examine the nature of the rf models we used partial dependence plots and importance measures partial dependence plots show the marginal effect of an individual explanatory variable on the response after fixing the other explanatory variables at their average value partial dependence plots are designed to demonstrate the influence of each explanatory variable independent of changes in all other explanatory variables whilst these graphs are not a perfect representation of the effects of each variable particularly if there are strong interactions or explanatory variables are correlated they do provide useful information for interpretation friedman and meulman 2003 importance of a specific explanatory variable is evaluated by randomly permuting explanatory variable values in turn and predicting the response of oob observations booker and whitehead 2018 ellis et al 2012 in order to check the consistency in the contribution of the explanatory variables to model accuracy and the response of each hydraulic geometry parameter to the explanatory variables we inspected the importance measures and the partial plots for each of these models 3 results 3 1 hydraulic geometry parameters models summary statistics describing the loo cross validation performance of the three methods for the four hydraulic geometry parameters were presented in fig 3 for w50 and h50 performance metrics were calculated between log transformed observed vs predicted values fig 3 and fig 4 and between the square root transformed observed vs predicted values for the b parameter for w50 models nse values of french and new zealand models were both high i e 0 80 nse 0 90 and represented strong ability of the models to represent observed patterns at unvisited sites nse values of the country specific and intercontinental methods were comparable and presented relatively small increase from the basic method lowest rsr values were observed on w50 models 0 32 rsr 0 44 regardless of the method rsr values were relatively lowest for new zealand models regardless of method both countries presented a highest value of rsr for the basic method french and new zealand models of h50 shared similarities in terms of nse values 0 42 nse 0 67 and both country specific and intercontinental methods presented higher values than the basic method as for w50 the country specific and intercontinental methods had comparable values of nse h50 models shared relatively correct rsr values 0 57 rsr 0 76 without particular distinction between french and new zealand models the basic method presented higher rsr values than the two others methods for both countries in comparison with the previous downstream parameters at a station exponent models presented low nse values nse values of exponent b models ranged between 0 01 and 0 34 representing relative poor explanatory power higher values were observed in models of country specific and intercontinental methods for new zealand models nse value was higher when the country specific method was applied in comparison to when the intercontinental method was applied i e 0 28 and 0 17 respectively for france nse values remained constant between both methods i e 0 34 and 0 31 for the basic and country specific methods respectively nse values of f models ranged between 0 01 and 0 13 and global results shared the same pattern as that for b models i e nse values are higher for models of the country specific and intercontinental methods new zealand models presented higher value in the country specific method than the intercontinental method and french models of both country specific and intercontinental methods were similar both exponents models also presented rsr values close to one 0 81 rsr 1 00 and 0 93 rsr 1 00 for b and f respectively globally both exponents shared a similar pattern with a decrease of rsr values for models of the country specific and intercontinental methods compared to the basic method no important between country differences in rsr values were observed although relatively smaller rsr values for b and f exponents models of the country specific method were evident for new zealand negligible biases were observed in our models regardless of the method and the country for all four parameters 2 1 pbias 2 2 generally pbias values close to zero indicate that the average tendencies of simulated variables estimated by the models were close to the respective observed hydraulic geometry parameters however high rsr values of b and f models demonstrate large variance in predicted variables variable importance was calculated for each explanatory variable for each response that was generalised using random forests fig 5 q50 was the most important explanatory variable for both french and new zealand models of w50 when the country specific method was applied the hydrological descriptors speq50 or speannualfloodfr and the climatic descriptors usrainmean and usrain1d presented similar importance values indicating that their overall influence on the french model of w50 was comparable for the new zealand model of w50 catchment size descriptor usca was also an important variable the variables q50 usca and to a lesser extent segslope and usraindays25 are the variables which contributed the most to the country specific new zealand model of h50 a similar pattern was found for the french model of h50 in which q50 and segslope were the strongest variables followed by segaltitude usaveslope and speq50 for the at a station exponents similarities in variable importance were not as evident as for the downstream parameters for the new zealand model of exponent b segd50 segriffle and usbare were the only variables selected in the preliminary variable selection procedure more variables were retained for the french model of exponent b although usaveslope and segaltitude were the most important the variable selection procedure retained only three variables for the new zealand model of f usca seggrainsorting and usbare a similar pattern was not found for the french model of f for which usrain1d and usdraindens had the higher importance variable importance displayed a high level of generality and agreement with the intercontinental models q50 segd50 and speq50 had high importance for the w50 model q50 segslope and usaveslope were the most important variables for the h50 model such similarities were not found for the f exponent model for which only q50 usaveslope and usca were pre selected for the b exponent model no particular similarity with the country specific models was found in terms of variable importance except for the contribution of segslope and segd50 despite the specificities in terms of importance of explanatory variables of french and new zealand models downstream hydraulic geometry parameters showed similar responses to the explanatory variables fig 6 and fig 7 partial dependence plots suggested that relationships between w50 and the 3 most important variables were frequently linear after variable transformation and similar in form both models for example the partial dependence plots indicated that w50 increased with increasing of hydrological descriptors q50 speq50 and speannualfloodfr and with increasing of catchment size usca furthermore these relationships were also observed in the intercontinental model fig 8 in the same way h50 had also positive relationships with catchment size usca and hydrological q50 descriptors and declined with morphological descriptors such as segslope usaveslope or segaltitude in both country specific models and also in the intercontinental model no such relationships were observed regarding the at a station exponents it was notable that b showed a similar response to the variable describing the average bed sediment grain size segd50 in new zealand and the intercontinental model this response was characterized by an increase of b as grain size increase fig 6 and fig 8 also partial dependence plots indicated that b was positively related to the mean slope of upstream catchment usaveslope in french country specific model and intercontinental model concerning f partial dependence plots did not indicate similar relationships between our models 3 2 models testing we assessed the effectiveness of our three different methods for predicting w h and v at each reach on each survey cross validated performance metrics between observed and predicted log transformed w h and v were calculated for each method summaries of the performance of these models are shown in fig 3 predictions of w performed well regardless of the method and the country nse values ranged between 0 78 and 0 89 rsr values ranged between 0 33 and 0 46 and biases were negligible 1 5 pbias 1 0 intercontinental and country specific models provide slightly better performance than the basic model h predictions performances were variable between countries and methods nse values obtained from new zealand models were substantially lower than french values regardless of method values ranged from 0 40 to 0 50 for new zealand models and from 0 48 to 0 65 for french models similarly rsr ranged from 0 78 to 0 71 for new zealand and from 0 72 to 0 59 for france notable biases were observed on new zealand predictions for the country specific and intercontinental methods pbias values of 5 5 and 7 0 for country specific and intercontinental method respectively compared to the basic method pbias value of 2 0 inversely pbias values obtained on french predictions were negligible v predictions presented similar performance to that of the h predictions performance was better for rf based models although new zealand predictions were less well predicted than french predictions globally predictions obtained with the country specific and intercontinental methods corresponded better with observations than when the basic method was applied especially for h and v predictions although predictions for new zealand sites were less well predicted and presented more bias and errors than for french sites when extrapolating our models to the national scale for example with french country specific models our models predict that 17 of rivers are larger than 10 m 14 are deeper than 0 5 m and 47 have velocity higher than 0 2 m s across french river network at median flow q50 fig 9 w and h predictions were comparable among the groups of reaches with different degrees of hydrological alterations in detail regressions of log transformed observed vs predicted w and h demonstrated the robustness of our predictions to the degree of alteration performances for each group are presented in table 4 4 discussion although several previous hydraulic geometry studies have used combinations of gis based explanatory variables for hydraulic geometry modelling e g booker and dunbar 2008 booker 2010 the present study is the first to separately investigate at a station and downstream hydraulic geometry from a large intercontinental data set of reach scale hydraulic geometry parameters in the present study we derived at a station and downstream hydraulic geometry models aiming to predict reach averaged water depth wetted width and current velocity across france and new zealand river networks these models are based on the respective digital river network of each country and readily derived explanatory variables we also combined both data sets in order to test the potentiality for model generalization by using explanatory variables common to both data sets we applied our models across the entire river networks of france and new zealand to produce maps of predicted hydraulics w h and v e g fig 9 and fig 10 our tests to predict the hydraulic geometry at the surveyed instantaneous discharge indicated that the predictions were good representations of reach averaged width depth and velocity for both countries and that models were consistent and unbiased even when cross validation was applied unsurprisingly the basic method performed less well than the rf based methods for both countries however the intercontinental method provided equally good performance as the country specific method wetted widths were well predicted regardless of method and country this is mainly the result of good predictions of the w50 parameter overriding weak performance of our b exponent models only minor improvements of w50 predictions were obtained with the rf based methods for both countries underlying the strong relationships between w50 and q50 of the basic method furthermore the variables having the highest contribution in w50 models of country specific and intercontinental methods were mainly q50 and other hydrological and catchment size descriptors such as speq50 speannualfloodfr and usca and for both countries these results suggest that w50 is essentially related to catchment size and hydrology and that descriptions of climate landcover and geomorphology e g usrainmean usbare segd50 provide surprisingly minor contribution to our models despite the purely empirical approach used in this study results are consistent with previous downstream hydraulic geometry studies for example faustini et al 2009 rawlins et al 2014 and wilkerson et al 2014 reported strong influences of catchment size and hydrological descriptors on width booker 2010 also noted minor contribution of climatic land cover or other catchment attributes when modelling cross sectional wetted width as function of catchment area across new zealand although an empirical approach was applied patterns in modelled results did have physical explanations globally for the same discharge rivers with larger catchments wetter climates or larger flood events tend to be wider than rivers with smaller catchment dryer climates or smaller flood events land cover and grain size also exerts control on the strength and stability of channel banks and therefore on the adjustment of channel width millar 2000 piégay et al 2005 exponent b models perform poorly but the rf based models performed better than a null model in which b was a constant mean of the whole dataset i e basic method moreover similarities in explanatory variable contributions were observed between the country specific models and the intercontinental model especially with the sediment grain size descriptors and average slope of the upstream catchment i e segd50 and usaveslope respectively width exponent tends to increase in reaches with largest sediment grain size and steepest slopes similar relationships with both variables is coherent because of the strong relationships between grain size and catchment slope snelder et al 2011b curiously this result is inconsistent with previous studies ridenour and giardino 1994 david et al 2010 morel et al 2019 that tried to relate grain size descriptors with at a station width exponent and did not reveal significant relationships reaches with high slope and high sediment grain size may also be interpreted as reaches with important sediment delivery and non cohesive banks in that case channel shape is mostly wide with shallow banks and presents high capacity to widen with increasing discharge lateral channel shape has been reported as the main control on exponent in analytical studies e g dingman 2007 unlike w the predictions of h obtained by the country specific and intercontinental methods were more effective than the basic method this is mostly due to the best performance of the rf based models for predicting h50 parameter in comparison with the basic method this suggests that besides q50 other explanatory variables are required for predicting reach water depth our analyses indicated that catchment size and geomorphic descriptors especially segslope contributed well to our models this suggests that reach water depth is also related to reach scale features in general for the same discharge rivers in small and steep catchments tend to be shallower this is consistent with previous studies on downstream hydraulic geometry arguing that discharge information is not enough for predicting water depth for example lee and julien 2006 proposed equations of water depth based on hydraulic geometry relationships using variables describing bed sediment grain size or stream slope in addition to the discharge exponent f is largely unexplained in our analyses and no strong relationships with explanatory variables and similarities between both countries have been identified new zealand models of h performed less well than french models despite similar performance of h50 and f models one possible explanation is that our new zealand data set contained reaches with a broad range of depths in comparison to our french data set reach averaged velocity v is well estimated by eq 7 therefore we predicted mean velocity with our models well globally for both countries the country specific and intercontinental models performed better than the basic models and french models were relatively more effective than the new zealand models these results are mainly the consequence of the h predictions because of the dependency of eq 7 with w and h at a station exponents were predicted weakly and contained some bias our rf based models however performed better than a model with constant average values of exponents i e basic method furthermore these results revealed consistencies with theoretical analyses e g dingman 2007 ferguson 1986 that argued that at a station exponents are mainly related to channel form and flow resistance rather than catchment scale attributes it is also consistent with descriptive approaches as in morel et al 2019 who found that exponents are more related to local features and channel form such as relative bedform submergence fluvial pattern or ratio of reach average median wetted width to bankfull width than catchment scale attributes as used in our analyses unexpectedly the intercontinental method almost performed better than the country specific method despite restriction in available explanatory variables that suggests that hydraulic characteristics can be well predicted with common and very general gis variables such as catchment area stream slope and hydrological descriptors these results also demonstrate the potential generality of our models at international scale this could also suggest that rf models perform better when provided with larger data sets this makes sense because many data points are needed to characterise flexible relationships and interactions that can be represented by an rf model several limitations should be taken in account in our modelling approaches first hydraulic and flow measurements are subject to considerable uncertainty that may be a source of the overall model uncertainties in particular at a station hydraulic geometry is sensitive to observation uncertainties especially when stage discharge relationship are fitted using observations at only a small number of discharges morel et al 2019 navratil and albert 2010 uncertainties can also be related to a possible non linearity in hydraulic discharge relationships at some sites although the at a station relationships are generally linear for the range of the studied flows navratil and albert 2010 moreover the hydraulic geometry relationships have their own uncertainties especially the at a station hydraulic geometry which are not static and do change over time due to perturbations in river channel characteristics phillips 1990 1991 the use of reach averaged hydraulic geometry in our study should smooth possible sampling errors stewardson 2005 and reduce these uncertainties and we attempted to reduce at a station hydraulic geometry uncertainties by selecting only reaches with contrasted surveyed flows in addition we selected reaches with a priori low morphological alteration however all reaches especially in europe were likely influenced by a long history of land and water uses e g undocumented flow abstraction groundwater withdrawals change in land use and riparian vegetation urbanisation of the catchment area gravel mining unknown in channel modifications and documenting these influences at the scale of our study would be challenging we demonstrated that our results were comparable among groups of reaches with various degrees of hydrological alterations suggesting some robustness to these undocumented potential alterations nevertheless an improved knowledge of the alteration of morphologies may improve our understanding of hydraulic geometry furthermore the explanatory variables derived from the gis databases have their own often large uncertainties lamouroux et al 2014 for example estimates of discharge statistics at ungauged sites in such databases have uncertainties around 100 for low discharge rates 1 m3 s lamouroux et al 2014 it is unlikely that these uncertainties affect our main results given the large range of environmental gradients considered in our study for example median discharges in our reaches spans three orders of magnitude table 1 nevertheless we expect that reduced uncertainties in gis databases will improve the models random forest predictions can never fall outside the range of the training data booker and whitehead 2018 for this reason predictions of our models beyond the range of the training data i e 1 45 m for wetted width and 0 09 1 20 m for water depth should not be considered however the reaches involved in our study are representative of a large proportion of hydrographic river networks for example only 1 75 of the length of the french hydrographic network and 1 31 of new zealand hydrographic network have q50 values above the maximum observed in our data sets pella et al 2012 booker and woods 2014 finally our w h and v models have been performed using reach measurements in a range of flows generally below q50 consequently these models cover frequently occurring flows and their ability to predict hydraulic characteristics at extremes flows is questionable 5 conclusions three alternative methods were tested for predicting reach average wetted width water depth and velocity across france and new zealand river networks these methods represent varying approaches to modelling the downstream and at a station parameters depending on explanatory variables availability and model complexity results from cross validation tests indicated that predictive performances of rf based methods performed better when predicting at unvisited sites overall our methods did well at predicting downstream parameters but were less efficient for at a station parameters best performing method will be used to derive the most accurate predictions of the hydraulic geometry across the river networks fig 9 and fig 10 these national predictions will be useful for a wide range of national and or catchment scale

5853,we recently addressed data driven monthly streamflow forecasting using a decomposition based model that relies on fourier transform ft to decompose the monthly streamflow time series into 4 components with each component comprising of contiguous frequencies and being forecasted independently by support vector regression svr the model called ft svr is capable of achieving near perfect monthly inflow forecasting for china s three gorges dam tgd in this paper we adapt ft svr to 10 day streamflow forecasting and the tgd is still taken as the case for study the 10 day inflow time series is decomposed into 7 components and each component contains an appropriate small number of contiguous frequencies we also investigate forecasting each decomposed component by extreme gradient boosting xgboost and the investigated model is accordingly named as ft xgboost xgboost uses an ensemble of trees as the input output mapping the maximum number of iterations for solving convex quadratic programming in svr is considerably reduced and the parameter calibration process to develop each independent svr or xgboost model is enhanced we compare ft svr and ft xgboost on three different decomposition strategies the centered 10 day inflow time series 4 decomposed components like our previous work and 7 components experimental results on the tgd case study demonstrate that ft svr with the decomposition strategy of 7 components is able to derive again near perfect 10 day streamflow forecasting results significantly better than ft svr with the other decomposition strategies and ft xgboost with all the decomposition strategies while with parameter calibration being performed as efficiently as ft xgboost on each decomposition strategy keywords data driven streamflow

of streamflow in a watershed system is affected by a variety of factors such as precipitation evapotranspiration topography and human activities hence the process is very complex and hasn t been well understood instead of explicitly modeling the physical streamflow formation process many researchers have studied adopting time series analysis regression analysis and machine learning models to forecast future streamflow based on a long collection of historical streamflow records and historical meteorological records these two perspectives are respectively referred to as process driven and data driven wang 2006 for data driven streamflow forecasting the mapping relationship between the input features and the output streamflow value is usually strongly nonlinear time series analysis

signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process the signal and then signal additional connected artificial neurons the artificial neurons are typically aggregated into layers anfis combines the strengths of ann and fuzzy logic the inference system of anfis is a set of fuzzy conditional rules svr transforms the original feature space to a high dimensional space and tries to find a linear mapping in the transformed space the linear mapping turns out to be expressed as a sum of nonlinear kernel functions in the original space gp encodes a population of candidate mappings as genes and evolves the genes using genetic algorithm each candidate mapping is structured as a tree with leaf nodes being operands and non leaf nodes being operator functions the final mapping found is the optimum among the candidate mappings in terms of a certain performance metric sca constructs a cluster tree with an iterative cutting and merging process the cluster tree classifies the original set of input vectors into a lot of statistically irrelevant subsets i e clusters the leaf cluster that an input vector belongs to on the cluster tree

regression analysis and machine learning models with decomposition preprocessing i e dividing the streamflow time series into multiple subseries by a decomposition preprocessing technique such as seasonal trend analysis jain and kumar 2007 luo et al 2019 variational mode decomposition fang et al 2019 empirical mode decomposition emd bai et al 2014 2016 fang 2019 li et al 2019 meng 2019 yu et

accurately forecast each subseries by an independent time series regression analysis or machine learning model according to the characteristics of the subseries and sum the forecasting results of the subseries to reach the final mapping the decomposition based combination can lead to considerably better streamflow forecasting accuracy than simply fit the original streamflow time series by an advanced regression analysis or machine learning model in yu et al 2018 we proposed a decomposition based model called ft svr for monthly streamflow forecasting and the three gorges dam tgd in china was taken as the case for study ft svr employs ft to decompose the monthly streamflow time series into 4 different components based on frequency domain analysis with each component comprising of contiguous frequencies and exhibiting a clear physical meaning each decomposed component is independently forecasted by svr ft svr is able to derive near perfect forecasting results for the monthly inflow into the tgd but the time spent is rather consuming emd and ssa were also investigated in yu et al 2018 for decomposition preprocessing and cannot lead to streamflow forecasting results as accurate as ft in this paper we study adapting ft svr for 10 day streamflow forecasting and we still use the tgd for case study we aim to address four issues for the adaptation i e understanding the similarities and differences between the frequency domain of the 10 day streamflow time series and that of the monthly series appropriately decomposing the 10 day streamflow time series based on ft frequency domain analysis reducing the time consumed by each separate svr model for the forecasting of a decomposed component and generalizing ft svr for streamflow forecasting with other time scales we compare the adapted ft svr model with another model called ft xgboost ft xgboost also takes advantage of ft for decomposition preprocessing each decomposed component of ft xgboost is independently forecasted by extreme gboost xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 chen and he 2015 fan et al 2018a b which is a state of the art gboost model the implementation of xgboost is very efficient as a number of improvements including multithread parallelization awareness of sparse data and cache access have been integrated into xgboost the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews ft svr and xgboost the frameworks of the ft svr and ft xgboost models are described in section 3 section 4 presents the case study of the tgd our adaptation of ft svr as well as the performance comparison of ft svr and ft xgboost are elaborated in section 5 section 6 concludes the paper 2 methodologies 2 1 fourier transform ft bracewell 1965 yu et al 2018 converts a signal of time into frequencies ft can deal with a discrete time series let the discrete time series be s s t 0 s t 1 s t n 1 where n is an integer number no less than 1 tj jδ with j 0 1 n 1 and δ is the time step granularity s is converted into a spectrum of n equidistant contiguous frequencies i e 1 f k k n δ k 0 1 n 1 ft is given by eq 2 2 s f k j 0 n 1 exp i 2 π f k t j s t j k 0 1 n 1 remember that i 1 and exp i 2 π f k t j cos 2 π f k t j i sin 2 π f k t j s is thus a complex valued function of frequency inverse ft ift is the inverse operation of ft ift recovers the original time series s by synthesizing the contributions of all the n frequencies according to eq 3 3 s t j k 0 n 1 exp i 2 π f k t j s f k n j 0 1 n 1 n is usually an even number note that for k 1 2 n 2 1 4 exp i 2 π f k t j exp i 2 π kj n exp i 2 π exp i 2 π kj n exp i 2 π n k j n exp i 2 π f n k t j i e exp i 2 π f k t j is the complex conjugate of exp i 2 π f n k t j and furthermore based on eq 2 s f k is the complex conjugate of s f n k eq 3 is rewritten as 5 s t j exp i 2 π f 0 t j s f 0 n exp i 2 π f n 2 t j s f n 2 n k 1 n 2 1 exp i 2 π f k t j s f k n exp i 2 π f n k t j s f n k n s f 0 n cos j π s f n 2 n k 1 n 2 1 cos 2 π kj n s f k real sin 2 π kj n s f k image 2 n s f 0 n cos j π s f n 2 n k 1 n 2 1 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n where s f k real and s f k image are respectively the real and image parts of s f k the original time series s can be considered as being made up of n 2 1 cosine waves corresponding to frequencies f 0 f 1 and fn 2 with s f 0 n being the single sided amplitude of the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 0 s f n 2 n being the single sided amplitude of the cosine wave corresponding to frequency fn 2 and 2 s f k n being the single sided amplitude of any other cosine wave eqs 4 and 5 indicate that ft and ift just need to take into account the n 2 1 frequencies including f 0 f 1 and fn 2 fast implementations of ft and ift were proposed by van loan in 1992 van loan 1992 2 2 support vector regression svr vapnik 2013 yu et al 2018 is trained from a collection of observed data let x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 xm ym be the training data samples where m is the number of samples xm with m 1 2 m is the mth input vector and ym is the corresponding output svr aims to find a mapping g x a ϕ x b to fit the training data samples where ϕ is the function projecting the input vector x to a higher dimensional feature space such that the samples can be linearly modeled in the higher dimensional space a is the slope vector b is the intercept and is an inner product operator rather than simply minimizing the summed mapping error of the training data samples svr introduces a generalized loss function as expressed in eq 6 and minimizes eq 7 that incorporates the loss function in order to avoid overfitting overfitting means that the mapping is too closely related to the particular set of training data samples and may thus fail to fit additional data reliably 6 l g x m y m g x m y m ε if g x m y m ε 0 else m 1 2 m 7 min 1 2 a a β m m 1 m l g x m y m in eq 6 ε is a nonnegative error threshold g x m y m is the mapping error of the mth training data sample and is ignored if it is equivalent to or less than ε and l g x m y m is the loss of the mth training data sample in eq 7 β is a nonnegative penalty factor the term a a represents the model s complexity while the term m 1 m l g x m y m stands for the empirical accumulative loss adjusting the value of β makes a tradeoff between the model s complexity and the empirical accumulative loss eq 7 is transformed to a constrained form as given in eq 8 8 min 1 2 a a β m 1 m ξ m ξ m s t a ϕ x m b y m ε ξ m y m a ϕ x m b ε ξ m ξ m 0 ξ m 0 m 1 2 m where ξ m and ξ m are used to measure the slack deviations of the mth training data sample from ε the dual lagrangian relaxation formulation of eq 8 is 9 max 1 2 m 1 m n 1 m η m η m η n η n ϕ x m ϕ x n ε m 1 m η m η m m 1 m y m η m η m s t m 1 m η m η m 0 η m 0 β η m 0 β m 1 2 m with

m ϕ x b it can be seen from eq 11 that only the training data samples with η m η m contribute to the mapping and these samples are accordingly termed as support vectors the input vector x is often projected to a feature space with very many dimensions therefore the terms ϕ x m ϕ x n in eq 9 and ϕ x m ϕ x in eq 11 require a lot of time to calculate the kernel function technique is usually leveraged for the purpose of overcoming such a dimensional curse for a kernel function p x m x n p x m x n is implicitly equivalent to ϕ x m ϕ x n the most frequently used kernel function is the radial basis function i e 12 p x m x n exp δ x m x n 2 where δ is a nonnegative radius coefficient here radius refers to the distance between xm and xn 2 3 extreme gradient boosting xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 chen and he 2015 fan et al 2018a b uses an ensemble of classification and regression trees carts as the mapping to fit the training data samples each cart has an independent binary tree decision rule structure and contains a continuous score on each leaf node for a given input the output is the sum of the corresponding leaves scores fig 1 illustrates an example xgboost model let the input x be a young male at the age of 16 and uses a computer daily then the mapping result according to the ensemble model shown in fig 1 is g x 2 0 9 2 9 xgboost determines the carts through minimizing the following regularized objective 13 min m 1 m h g x m y m u γ k u 1 2 λ w u 2 where h is a differentiable convex loss function that measures the difference between the mapping result g x m and the observed output ym ku is the number of leaves in the uth cart wu is the vector of scores of the uth cart s leaves and γ and λ are two coefficients the regularization term u γ k u 1 2 λ w u 2 penalizes the complexity of the ensemble model to avoid overfitting the ensemble model is trained in an iterative manner with each cart added at a separate iteration at the uth iteration g xm with m 1 2 m is the present mapping result of each training data sample and the uth cart is added for the objective of minimizing the function as expressed in eq 14 14 m 1 m h g x m q u x m y m γ k u 1 2 λ w u

m 2 γ k u 1 2 λ w u 2 the constant terms h g xm ym with m 1 2 m are removed from eq 15 and the objective reduces to a simplified form moreover let ω e m q u x m w u e be the set of training data samples associated with leaf node e in the uth cart where wu e is the score of e eq 15 is transformed to 16 e 1 k u m ω e g x m h g x m y m w u e 1 2 m ω e g x m 2 h g x m y m λ w u e 2 γ k u the optimal value for wu e is calculated by eq 17 17 w u e m ω e g x m h g x m y m m ω e g x m 2 h g x m y m λ a greedy algorithm is used to find the tree structure of the uth cart the algorithm starts from a single leaf node and iteratively adds splits to the tree when a leaf node e is considered for split let ω e left and ω e right respectively contain the training data samples associated with e s left child node and e s right child node the loss reduction after the split is 18 1 2 m ω e left g x m h g x m y m 2 m ω e left g x m 2 h g x m y m λ m ω e right g x m h g x m y m 2 m ω e right g x m

further combat overfitting shrinkage refers to scaling newly added scores by a nonnegative factor θ that is less than 1 after each iteration of tree boosting and column subsampling means just using a ratio σ of the training data samples for determining the xgboost model 3 10 day streamflow forecasting based on fourier transform decomposition preprocessing and machine learning by support vector regression or extreme gradient boosting 3 1 framework two decomposition based models i e ft svr and ft xgboost are studied in this paper for 10 day streamflow forecasting ft svr and ft xgboost follow the same framework stated in yu et al 2018 the framework is described step by step as follows step 1 the 10 day streamflow time series is s s t 0 s t 1 s t n 1 with s tj being the streamflow in the j 1 th 10 day center s through subtracting the streamflow in each 10 day s tj by the mean of s normalize the centered series in case the model used is ft svr divide the centered and normalized series into a training data set and a test data set step 2 decompose the training and test data sets into multiple components based on ft preprocessing step 3 develop an independent svr in case of ft svr or xgboost in case of ft xgboost machine learning model for each decomposed component of the training data set the final mapping g is the addition of the independently developed machine learning models and the mean of s step 4 apply each independently developed svr or xgboost model on the corresponding decomposed component of the test data set validate the performance of ft svr or ft xgboost on the test data set 3 2 development of each independent support vector regression or extreme gradient boosting model cross validation is adopted for developing a svr or xgboost model on each decomposed component of the training data set because an optimistically biased svr or xgboost model that is overly dependently on the training data set might be obtained if the model was simply trained by the single group of training data samples for o fold cross validation the training data set is randomly segmented into o subsets comprising approximately equivalent number of training data samples o rounds of validation are then performed one separate subset is tested in each round with the svr or xgboost model trained on all the remaining training data samples yu et al 2018 the development of ft svr involves data normalization as well as input selection and parameter calibration of each independent svr model data normalization linearly scales the centered 10 day streamflow time series to the range 0 1 yu et al 2018 input selection selects an appropriate lag of past consecutive values of each decomposed component as the input vector of the black box mapping to forecast future component value based on autocorrelation function acf and partial acf pacf analyses yu et al 2018 data normalization unifies different numerical ranges of the input features and addresses numerical difficulties that may occur during calculation the development of ft xgboost doesn t require data normalization and just involves input selection and parameter calibration of each independent xgboost model because xgboost judges one input feature in each node of a cart whereas svr projects all the input features onto a higher dimensional space and processes the features in an integrated way 3 parameters i e the error threshold ε in eq 6 the penalty factor β in eq 7 and the radius coefficient δ in eq 12 need to be determined for a svr model an xgboost model is affected by 4 parameters including the maximum number of leaf nodes in a cart k max the regularization coefficient λ in eq 13 the shrinkage factor θ and the column subsampling ratio σ a state of the art variant of particle swarm optimization pso called enhanced comprehensive learning pso eclpso yu and zhang 2014 yu et al 2018 is invoked to calibrate the parameters of each independent svr or xgboost model pso is a class of metaheuristics simulating the natural food searching behavior of a bird flock poli et al 2007 in pso the flock of birds is represented by a swarm of particles and the particles search for the optimum like the birds search for the food each particle flies in the search space and is thus associated with a velocity a position and a fitness indicating the particle s search performance pso iteratively adjusts the flight trajectories of the particles trying to let the particles gradually moving towards the optimum eclpso encourages each particle to learn from different exemplars on different dimensions of the search space for the flight trajectory update and is powerful at preserving the particles diversity for each particle the particle s position is encoded as a 3 dimensional vector log2 ε log2 β log2 δ for svr and a 4 dimensional vector log2 k max log2 λ log2 θ log2 σ for xgboost owing to cross validation each particle s fitness value is the mean of the corresponding model s root mean squared error rmse values on all the subsets rmse is calculated according to eq 19 19 rmse 1 m m 1 m y m z m 2 where zm is the forecasted output of the mth input vector a small rmse value indicates accurate forecasted outputs and the mapping is perfect when rmse equals to 0 all the particles positions are initialized randomly in the search space when eclpso ends the iterations or generations the position with the best fitness value among all the positions traversed so far by the swarm of particles gives the calibrated parameters compared with the traditional brute force grid search method taken for parameter calibration wang et al 2014 metaheuristics have been demonstrated to be significantly more efficient and can also give high quality parameters fang et al 2019 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2009 xing et al 2015 yu et al 2018 as metaheuristics quickly intentionally guide the search around promising regions whereas the grid search method has to inflexibly scan the entire search space the eclpso algorithm used in this paper has been evaluated with a number of metaheuristics on various benchmark global optimization functions yu and zhang 2014 and realworld multi reservoir hydropower systems optimal operation case studies zhang et al 2016 and exhibit excellent search performance 4 case study 4 1 the yangtze river drainage basin and the three gorges dam fig 2 shows china s yangtze river drainage basin and the tgd constructed on the yangtze river as the mother river of the chinese nationality the yangtze river sources from the tanggula mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau zigzags eastward with a length of 6397 km by traversing 11 provinces and independent municipalities and pours into the east china sea at the independent municipality of shanghai the drainage area of the yangtze river is about 1 8 million km2 nearly 20 of china s territory the tgd is upstream from and very close i e 44 km to the city of yichang the river section above yichang is the upper reach of the yangtze river the yangtze river is embodied with huge hydropower potential particularly on the upper reach the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are the most populated and economically developed regions of china and were often harassed by floods before the tgd was put into use the tgd is a critical hydraulic complex as it develops and harnesses the water resources of the yangtze river through hydropower generation flood control navigation sediment control and water provisioning the long term operation of the tgd is usually done at a 10 day time step yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 e g as the flood season of the tgd is from june to september the tgd s forebay elevation decreases to the flood control limit level 145 m during june 1 and june 10 and the tgd maintains its forebay elevation at the limit level so as to vacate enough storage for incoming floods until september 10 4 2 training data set and test data set long series of observed inflow data were recorded for the tgd the 10 day inflow records of the tgd from year 1990 to 2009 are used as the training data set and the records during the period from year 2010 to 2015 are treated as the test data set to validate the performance of ft svr and ft xgboost for 10 day streamflow forecasting on the studied case the training data set and the test data set contain totally n 936 records the 936 10 day inflow records are depicted in fig 3 the mean of the 936 records is 13084 m3 s fig 4 shows the ft frequency domain analysis of the centered 10 day inflow time series with the frequency index k 0 1 468 and the single sided amplitude i e s f 0 n for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 0 s f n 2 n for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 468 and 2 s f k n for all the other cosine waves respectively being the horizontal axis and the vertical axis the time domain and frequency domain analyses of the tgd s centered monthly inflow time series from year 1990 to 2015 were studied in yu et al 2018 similar to the centered monthly series it can be seen from fig 4 that the centered 10 day series also exhibit two striking single sided amplitudes in the frequency domain the champion striking single sided amplitude 8601 for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 26 and the runner up striking single sided amplitude 2873 for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 52 the single sided amplitudes of all the other cosine waves are significantly smaller than the two striking amplitudes the centered 10 day series are different from the centered monthly series mainly in that the frequency spectrum of the centered 10 day series is much larger than i e 3 times of that of the centered monthly series based on the similarities and differences between the 10 day and monthly streamflow time series we can infer that for a streamflow time series with an in between time step e g half monthly or a shorter time step e g daily and hourly the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies fd and f 2 d are also associated with two striking single sided amplitudes the single sided amplitude of the cosine wave corresponding to frequency fd is the largest and all the other cosine waves single sided amplitudes are much smaller than the two striking amplitudes with d being the number of years in addition the frequency spectrum of the series with a shorter time step is far larger than that of the monthly series e g the frequency spectrum of the tgd s daily inflow time series and that of the tgd s hourly series with the same period from year 1990 to 2015 respectively contain 4749 and 113 953 frequencies 5 experimental studies 5 1 performance metrics besides the rmse metric 4 other metrics including mean absolute percentage error mape nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsec relative error of maximum 10 day streamflow remax and relative error of minimum 10 day streamflow remin yu et al 2018 are also used for evaluating the performance of ft svr and ft xgboost mape nsec remax and remin are calculated respectively by eq 20 eq 21 eq 22 and eq 23 20 mape 1 m m 1 m y m z m z m 100 21 nsec 1 m 1 m y m z m 2 m 1 m y m y mean 2 22 remax 1 d d 1 d 1 y d max

10 day streamflow values in the dth year and y d min and z d min are respectively the minimum observed and forecasted 10 day streamflow values in the dth year mape quantifies the mean of the absolute relative errors between the observed and forecasted output values in a percentage form an accurate forecasting model is associated with a mape value close to 0 nsec measures the relationship of the accumulative squared error over the accumulative observed data variance a nsec value at 1 means a perfect match between the forecasted and observed output values remax and remin values around 0 indicate accurate forecasted extreme streamflow values 5 2 decomposition strategies ft transforms the centered 10 day inflow time series with 936 records into 469 cosine waves corresponding to different frequencies we investigate 3 strategies namely degenerated 4 component and 7 component for decomposing the centered 10 day series the degenerated decomposition strategy same as the strategy adopted by only svr in yu et al 2018 doesn t decompose the centered 10 day series and can be considered as a degenerated case of decomposition with only 1 decomposed component the 4 component decomposition strategy is like the strategy employed by ft svr in yu et al 2018 based on the two striking single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies f 26 and f 52 all the cosine waves are naturally grouped into 4 decomposed components c 1 1 c 1 2 c 1 3 and c 1 4 c 1 1 is the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies smaller than f 26 c 1 2 is the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around f 26 c 1 3 is the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around f 52 and c 1 4 is the addition of the remaining cosine waves i e corresponding to frequencies greater than f 52 to be more specific 24 c 1 1 t j s f 0 n k 1 u 1 1 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n 25 c 1 2 t j k u 1 1 1 u 1 2 cos 2 π kj n arctan

smaller than 26 u 1 2 is a frequency index smaller than 52 and greater than 26 and u 1 3 is a frequency index greater than 52 here u 1 1 u 1 2 and u 1 3 are chosen such that the number of cosine waves in c 1 1 c 1 2 and c 1 3 are about the same as 23 accordingly the number of cosine waves in c 1 4 is about 400 the 4 components have clear physical meanings c 1 1 represents long term trend and cyclic changes c 1 2 features yearly seasonality c 1 3 is half yearly periodical and c 1 4 reflects stochastic influences the frequency spectrum of c 1 4 contains too many frequencies and is much larger than that of the fourth decomposed component forecasted by ft svr in yu et al 2018 we propose to further decompose c 1 4 into 4 smaller subseries consisting of contiguous frequencies in the 7 component

c 2 7 c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 are constructed by about the same number of contiguous frequencies i e 100 with the frequency spectrum sizes about 4 times of those of c 2 1 c 2 2 and c 2 3 c 2 4 c 2

decomposition strategy can be generalized and is easy to use given a e g monthly half monthly 10 day daily or hourly streamflow time series s with d years and n records s is decomposed into multiple at least 4 components with the first component being the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies smaller than fd the second component being the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around fd the third component being the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around f 2 d and the other components containing the remaining contiguous frequencies the three decomposed components containing frequencies smaller than and around f 2 d are about the same in terms of the frequency spectrum size and each other component is comprised of about the same and about 100 contiguous frequencies 5 3 experimental settings and our adaptation open source software toolkits of svr and xgboost are available the toolkit of svr is called libsvm chang and lin 2011 in our experiments the java versions of libsvm and xgboost are used our hardware platform is a laptop computer with an intel core i7 6500 cpu at the clock rate of 2 5 ghz 8 gb double data rate internal memory and 256 gb solid state disk external memory the operating system is windows 7 an inappropriately small value for the error threshold ε or an inappropriately large value for the penalty factor β might give rise to numerical instability when solving the cqp formulation of a svr model the numerical instability causes libsvm to terminate cqp calculation only after the default maximum number of iterations i e 10 000 000 in yu et al 2018 we addressed the numerical instability by reducing the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation to 40000 in this paper we try to compare the performance of ft svr and ft xgboost xgboost has been claimed to be very efficient chen and guestrin 2016 chen and he 2015 fan et al 2018a b what is more we propose to decompose the centered 10 day inflow time series into 7 components whereas we decomposed the centered monthly series into just 4 components in yu et al 2018 we therefore further reduce the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation to 3000 which is significantly smaller than 40 000 making the adapted ft svr model consuming less time for development and similar to the time consumed by ft xgboost such that we can understand which of the two models can achieve better forecasting accuracy while with similar amount of time spent eclpso yu and zhang 2014 yu et al 2018 is applied to calibrate the parameters of each independent svr or xgboost model in yu et al 2018 we introduced some strategies to improve the parameter calibration performance of eclpso including 1 a particle s position on a dimension is randomly reset to a value between the overstepped boundary and the previous feasible value of the dimensional position when the particle moves outside the search space on the corresponding dimension 2 the number of particles is set as 10 and the number of generations is set as 40 in order to render reasonable calibration time 3 the perturbation based exploitation enhancement isn t invoked 4 the maximum learning probability is fixed at 0 75 to facilitate convergence and 5 the refreshing gap is reduced to 3 refreshing gap is the number of consecutive generations that each particle learns from the same combination of dimensional exemplars for flight velocity update in this paper we reduce the parameter calibration time of each independent svr or xgboost model by setting the number of generations as 25 in addition we waive the refreshing gap concept and let each particle re determine the dimensional exemplars in each generation thereby contributing to exploring more diverse regions of the search space and being more likely to locate the true optimum or a near optimum solution the search spaces for log2 ε log2 β log2 δ log2 k max log2 λ log2 θ and log2 σ are respectively 10 0 6 10 6 1 0 15 8 0 8 0 and 4 0 the number of iterations for xgboost is fixed at 100 i e 100 carts are constructed to constitute the ensemble each independent svr or xgboost model is developed on each decomposed component of the training data set based on 9 fold cross validation 5 4 experimental results and discussions a time lag is determined for selecting the input features of each independent svr or xgboost model based on the acf and pacf analyses of the corresponding decomposed component of the training data set and according to the principles stated in yu et al 2018 with a maximum lag of 72 table 1 lists the time lag values determined for the independent svr or xgboost models the parameters obtained by eclpso the parameter calibration time consumed by eclpso the best cross validation rmse value or fitness value among all the particles of eclpso and the rmse values validated on the training and test data sets for each independent svr or xgboost model are also given in table 1 the parameter calibration time of ft svr and ft xgboost as well as the final rmse mape nsec remax and remin values of the models with different decomposition strategies on the training data set i e 10 day inflow records from year 1990 and 2009 and the test data set i e 10 day records between year 2000 and 2015 are presented in table 2 as can be seen from table 1 the parameter calibration time of the independent svr model is around the same with that of the independent xgboost model on the centered 10 day inflow time series several seconds more on c 1 1 and c 1 3 tens of seconds more on c 2 4 and tens of seconds less on all the other decomposed components as a result the parameter calibration time of ft svr according to table 2 is almost equivalent to that of ft xgboost for the degenerated decomposition strategy about 39 less for the 4 component strategy and about 81 s less for the 7 component strategy the relative difference between the parameter calibration time of ft svr and that of ft xgboost is just about 10 for the 4 component strategy and 11 for the 7 component strategy for either ft svr or ft xgboost the degenerated decomposition strategy consumes the least parameter calibration time followed by the 4 component strategy and the 7 component strategy is the most time consuming indicating that the parameter calibration time of ft svr or ft xgboost increases with the number of decomposed components as each component needs to be forecasted independently in terms of the cross validation rmse values listed in table 1 the independent svr model differs little from the independent xgboost model on the centered series and c 1 4 and significantly outperforms the independent xgboost model on all the other decomposed components the observation verifies that svr is able to better address strong nonlinearity than xgboost the training and test rmse values of the independent svr model and the test rmse value of the independent xgboost are similar to the cross validation rmse value of the same model on each decomposed component meaning that it is appropriate to take the cross validation rmse metric for evaluating the fitness value of each particle in eclpso in addition with respect to the independently developed xgboost models the training rmse values are similar to the corresponding test rmse values on c 1 1 and c 1 3 however are significantly worse than the corresponding test rmse values on all the other decomposed components svr is good at overcoming overfitting while xgboost is still challenged by overfittting as it often fits well on the training data set but fits much worse on the test data set a look at the calibrated parameters of the independent svr and xgboost models developed on each decomposed component in table 1 reveal that an accurate svr model tends to be complex with a small ε value and a large β value in contrast the forecasting accuracy of an xgboost model doesn t have straightforward connections with the values of k max λ θ and σ we can see from table 2 that on the test data set the rmse and mape values of ft svr are similar to those of ft xgboost with the degenerated decomposition strategy slightly better with the 4 component strategy and significantly better with the 7 component strategy with respect to ft svr the rmse mape nsec remax and remin values on the training data set differ little from those on the test data set with all the decomposition strategies except the remax value with the 4 component strategy the rmse values of ft xgboost differ notably on the training and test data sets with all the decomposition strategies fig 9 plots the forecasted and observed 10 day inflow values of ft svr and ft xgboost on the test data set with different decomposition strategies as reflected from the rmse mape nsec remax and remin values given in table 2 and the forecasted observed inflow values illustrated in fig 9 1 both ft svr and ft xgboost perform slightly better with the 4 component decomposition strategy than with the degenerated strategy for the forecasting of the entire test data set and significantly better with the 7 component strategy than with the 4 component strategy 2 the forecasted 10 day inflow values of ft svr almost perfectly match the observed inflow records with the 7 component strategy and the forecasted values of ft xgboost also fit the observed records well with the 7 component strategy whereas the forecasted values of ft svr and ft xgboost aren t satisfactory with all the other decomposition strategies and 3 ft svr isn t good at forecasting the extreme streamflow values with the degenerated and 4 component decomposition strategies and ft xgboost is bad at forecasting the minimum streamflow values with the 7 component strategy the maximum streamflow values with the 4 component strategy and both the maximum and minimum streamflow values with the degenerated strategy the forecasting accuracy performance of ft svr and ft xgboost with different decomposition strategies can be explained by the fact that the forecasting accuracy of an independent svr or xgboost model developed on a decomposed component is affected by the number of contiguous frequencies included in the component and the single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves according to eq 5 the signal of time s t j s f 0 n cos j π s f n 2 n k 1 n 2 1 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n it can be observed from figs 4 and 8 that the single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves contained in c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 don t differ much in each of the components and are much smaller compared with the two striking amplitudes in addition for each component of c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 the number of contiguous frequencies included in the component is appropriately small the cosine waves fluctuate in terms of similar frequency scales and we can accurately model all the cosine waves by a single svr or xgboost model as shown in fig 7 c1 2 and c 1 3 each features a striking single sided amplitude and the striking amplitude is considerably larger than the single sided amplitudes of most other cosine waves contained in the component the number of contiguous frequencies included in c 1 1 c 1 2 c 1 3 are significantly smaller than those related to c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 as a result each of the components decomposed by the 7 component decomposition strategy can be accurately forecasted by an independent svr or xgboost model and the forecasted inflow values of ft svr and ft xgboost are accurate in contrast the frequency spectrum size of the centered 10 day inflow time series and c 1 4 are so large that ft svr and ft xgboost forecast unsatisfactorily with the degenerated and 4 component strategies table 3 lists the obtained parameters the parameter calibration time and the cross validation training and test rmse values of some svr and xgboost models with different experimental settings it can be observed from table 3 that if we reset the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation in svr as 40 000 then the parameter calibration time of the independent svr model sharply grows from 91 04 s to 405 93 s on c 1 1 and from 110 87 s to 953 08 s on c 2 4 the error threshold ε becomes smaller on c 1 1 and c 2 4 and the tradeoff factor β turns larger on c 1 1 and c 2 4 concerning the two cases fixing the number of iterations in other words the number of carts for xgboost at 50 and 150 the parameter calibration time of the independent xgboost model respectively decreases from 86 71 s to 51 26 s and increases to 114 21 s on c 1 1 the training and test rmse values of xgboost with 100 iterations are smaller than those of xgboost with 50 and 150 iterations on c 1 1 in table 3 we investigate splitting c 2 4 into equivalent halves c 3 4 and c 3 5 and adding c 2 4 and c 2 5 together to get c 4 4 specifically c 2 4 c 3 4 c 3 5 and c 4 4 c 2 4 c 2 5 using either svr or xgboost we can achieve even more accurate forecasting of c 2 4 through summing the forecasted outputs of c 3 4 and c 3 5 however the parameter calibration time consumed would be around 2 times of the original calibration time the test rmse value of the independent svr model on c 4 4 is significantly less than that of the independent svr model on c 1 4 however is much more than the added sum of the test rmse values of the independent svr models on c 2 4 and c 2 5 validating that we cannot achieve near perfect 10 day streamflow forecasting by just further decomposing c 1 4 into 2 equivalent components and resulting in totally 5 decomposed components the 7 component decomposition strategy takes a tradeoff between forecasting accuracy and parameter calibration efficiency 6 conclusions in this paper we have studied adapting ft svr for 10 day streamflow forecasting and the tgd has been taken as the case for study for the adaptation the 10 day streamflow time series is decomposed into 7 components based on ft preprocessing with each component containing an appropriate small number of contiguous frequencies rather than the decomposition into 4 components like in yu et al 2018 this is because ft converts a time series into contiguous frequencies each frequency is associated with a different cosine wave the forecasting accuracy of an independent svr or xgboost model developed on a decomposed component is affected by the number of cosine waves included in the component and the single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves and the frequency spectrum of the 10 day series is much larger than that of the monthly series studied in yu et al 2018 ft svr has been compared with ft xgboost the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation in svr is reduced to 3000 and the parameter calibration of each independent svr or xgboost model by eclpso is enhanced experimental results on the tgd case study has demonstrated that ft svr is as efficient as ft xgboost and just consumes 680 89 s for parameter calibration with the decomposition of 7 components whereas ft svr takes 1351 s for parameter calibration with 4 decomposed components in yu et al 2018 moreover ft svr is capable of deriving near perfect 10 day inflow forecasting for the tgd and significantly outperforms ft xgboost in terms of evaluation criteria including rmse mape nsec remax and remin we have also pointed out that the 7 component decomposition strategy can be conveniently generalized for streamflow forecasting with different time step granularities according to our previous work yu et al 2018 and this paper the combination of ft and svr is very promising for addressing data driven streamflow forecasting we encourage researchers worldwide applying ft svr to practical case studies in other watersheds to validate analyze and further improve the performance of ft svr in the future we plan to extend ft svr for streamflow forecasting with a shorter time step e g daily and hourly with the aid of graphical processing unit gpu parallelized acceleration to achieve accurate and fast forecasting i e we can parallelize the independent forecasting of each decomposed component on a gpu to achieve tens to hundreds times of speedup as compared to the sequential implementation on the central processing unit declaration of competing interest the authors

5853,we recently addressed data driven monthly streamflow forecasting using a decomposition based model that relies on fourier transform ft to decompose the monthly streamflow time series into 4 components with each component comprising of contiguous frequencies and being forecasted independently by support vector regression svr the model called ft svr is capable of achieving near perfect monthly inflow forecasting for china s three gorges dam tgd in this paper we adapt ft svr to 10 day streamflow forecasting and the tgd is still taken as the case for study the 10 day inflow time series is decomposed into 7 components and each component contains an appropriate small number of contiguous frequencies we also investigate forecasting each decomposed component by extreme gradient boosting xgboost and the investigated model is accordingly named as ft xgboost xgboost uses an ensemble of trees as the input output mapping the maximum number of iterations for solving convex quadratic programming in svr is considerably reduced and the parameter calibration process to develop each independent svr or xgboost model is enhanced we compare ft svr and ft xgboost on three different decomposition strategies the centered 10 day inflow time series 4 decomposed components like our previous work and 7 components experimental results on the tgd case study demonstrate that ft svr with the decomposition strategy of 7 components is able to derive again near perfect 10 day streamflow forecasting results significantly better than ft svr with the other decomposition strategies and ft xgboost with all the decomposition strategies while with parameter calibration being performed as efficiently as ft xgboost on each decomposition strategy keywords data driven streamflow

of streamflow in a watershed system is affected by a variety of factors such as precipitation evapotranspiration topography and human activities hence the process is very complex and hasn t been well understood instead of explicitly modeling the physical streamflow formation process many researchers have studied adopting time series analysis regression analysis and machine learning models to forecast future streamflow based on a long collection of historical streamflow records and historical meteorological records these two perspectives are respectively referred to as process driven and data driven wang 2006 for data driven streamflow forecasting the mapping relationship between the input features and the output streamflow value is usually strongly nonlinear time series analysis

accurately forecast each subseries by an independent time series regression analysis or machine learning model according to the characteristics of the subseries and sum the forecasting results of the subseries to reach the final mapping the decomposition based combination can lead to considerably better streamflow forecasting accuracy than simply fit the original streamflow time series by an advanced regression analysis or machine learning model in yu et al 2018 we proposed a decomposition based model called ft svr for monthly streamflow forecasting and the three gorges dam tgd in china was taken as the case for study ft svr employs ft to decompose the monthly streamflow time series into 4 different components based on frequency domain analysis with each component comprising of contiguous frequencies and exhibiting a clear physical meaning each decomposed component is independently forecasted by svr ft svr is able to derive near perfect forecasting results for the monthly inflow into the tgd but the time spent is rather consuming emd and ssa were also investigated in yu et al 2018 for decomposition preprocessing and cannot lead to streamflow forecasting results as accurate as ft in this paper we study adapting ft svr for 10 day streamflow forecasting and we still use the tgd for case study we aim to address four issues for the adaptation i e understanding the similarities and differences between the frequency domain of the 10 day streamflow time series and that of the monthly series appropriately decomposing the 10 day streamflow time series based on ft frequency domain analysis reducing the time consumed by each separate svr model for the forecasting of a decomposed component and generalizing ft svr for streamflow forecasting with other time scales we compare the adapted ft svr model with another model called ft xgboost ft xgboost also takes advantage of ft for decomposition preprocessing each decomposed component of ft xgboost is independently forecasted by extreme gboost xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 chen and he 2015 fan et al 2018a b which is a state of the art gboost model the implementation of xgboost is very efficient as a number of improvements including multithread parallelization awareness of sparse data and cache access have been integrated into xgboost the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews ft svr and xgboost the frameworks of the ft svr and ft xgboost models are described in section 3 section 4 presents the case study of the tgd our adaptation of ft svr as well as the performance comparison of ft svr and ft xgboost are elaborated in section 5 section 6 concludes the paper 2 methodologies 2 1 fourier transform ft bracewell 1965 yu et al 2018 converts a signal of time into frequencies ft can deal with a discrete time series let the discrete time series be s s t 0 s t 1 s t n 1 where n is an integer number no less than 1 tj jδ with j 0 1 n 1 and δ is the time step granularity s is

the original time series s can be considered as being made up of n 2 1 cosine waves corresponding to frequencies f 0 f 1 and fn 2 with s f 0 n being the single sided amplitude of the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 0 s f n 2 n being the single sided amplitude of the cosine wave corresponding to frequency fn 2 and 2 s f k n being the single sided amplitude of any other cosine wave eqs 4 and 5 indicate that ft and ift just need to take into account the n 2 1 frequencies including f 0 f 1 and fn 2 fast implementations of ft and ift were proposed by van loan in 1992 van loan 1992 2 2

higher dimensional feature space such that the samples can be linearly modeled in the higher dimensional space a is the slope vector b is the intercept and is an inner product operator rather than simply minimizing the summed mapping error of the training data samples svr introduces a generalized loss function as expressed in eq 6 and minimizes eq 7 that incorporates the loss function in order to avoid overfitting overfitting means that the mapping is too closely related to the particular set of training data samples and may thus fail to fit additional data reliably 6 l g x m y m g x m y m

projected to a feature space with very many dimensions therefore the terms ϕ x m ϕ x n in eq 9 and ϕ x m ϕ x in eq 11 require a lot of time to calculate the kernel function technique is usually leveraged for the purpose of overcoming such a dimensional curse for a kernel function p x m x n p x m x n is implicitly equivalent to ϕ x m ϕ x n the most frequently used kernel function is the radial basis function i e 12 p x m x n exp δ x m x n 2 where δ is a nonnegative radius coefficient here radius refers to the distance between xm and xn 2 3 extreme gradient boosting xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 chen and he 2015 fan et al 2018a b uses an ensemble of classification and regression trees carts as the mapping to fit the training data samples each cart has an independent binary tree decision rule structure and contains a continuous score on each leaf node for a given input the output is the sum of the corresponding leaves scores fig 1 illustrates an example xgboost model let the input x be a young male at the age of 16 and uses a computer daily then the mapping result according to the ensemble model shown in fig 1 is g x 2 0 9 2 9 xgboost determines the carts through minimizing the following regularized objective 13 min m 1 m h g x m y m u γ k u 1 2 λ w u 2 where h is a differentiable convex loss function that measures the difference between the mapping result g x

penalizes the complexity of the ensemble model to avoid overfitting the ensemble model is trained in an iterative manner with each cart added at a separate iteration at the uth iteration g xm with m 1

further combat overfitting shrinkage refers to scaling newly added scores by a nonnegative factor θ that is less than 1 after each iteration of tree boosting and column subsampling means just using a ratio σ of the training data samples for determining the xgboost model 3 10 day streamflow forecasting based on fourier transform decomposition preprocessing and machine learning by support vector regression or extreme gradient boosting 3 1 framework two decomposition based models i e ft svr and ft xgboost are studied in this paper for 10 day streamflow forecasting ft svr and ft xgboost follow the same framework stated in yu et al 2018 the framework is described step by step as follows step 1 the 10 day streamflow time series is s s t 0 s t 1 s t n 1 with s tj being the streamflow in the j 1 th 10 day center s through subtracting the streamflow in each 10 day s tj by the mean of s normalize the centered series in case the model used is ft svr divide the centered and normalized series into a training data set and a test data set step 2 decompose the training and test data sets into multiple components based on ft preprocessing step 3 develop an independent svr in case of ft svr or xgboost in case of ft xgboost machine learning model for each decomposed component of the training data set the final mapping g is the addition of the independently developed machine learning models and the mean of s step 4 apply each independently developed svr or xgboost model on the corresponding decomposed component of the test data set validate the performance of ft svr or ft xgboost on the test data set 3 2 development of each independent support vector regression or extreme gradient boosting model cross validation is adopted for developing a svr or xgboost model on each decomposed component of the training data set because an optimistically biased svr or xgboost model that is overly dependently on the training data set might be obtained if the model was simply trained by the single group of training data samples for o fold cross validation the training data set is randomly segmented into o subsets comprising approximately equivalent number of training data samples o rounds of validation are then performed one separate subset is tested in each round with the svr or xgboost model trained on all the remaining training data samples yu et al 2018 the development of ft svr involves data normalization as well as input selection and parameter calibration of each independent svr model data normalization linearly scales the centered 10 day streamflow time series to the range 0 1 yu et al 2018 input selection selects an appropriate lag of past consecutive values of each decomposed component as the input vector of the black box mapping to forecast future component value based on autocorrelation function acf and partial acf pacf analyses yu et al 2018 data normalization unifies different numerical ranges of the input features and addresses numerical difficulties that may occur during calculation the development of ft xgboost doesn t require data normalization and just involves input selection and parameter calibration of each independent xgboost model because xgboost judges one input feature in each node of a cart whereas svr projects all the input features onto a higher dimensional space and processes the features in an integrated way 3 parameters i e the error threshold ε in eq 6 the penalty factor β in eq 7 and the radius coefficient δ in eq 12 need to be determined for a svr model an xgboost model is affected by 4 parameters including the maximum number of leaf nodes in a cart k max the regularization coefficient λ in eq 13 the shrinkage factor θ and the column subsampling ratio σ a state of the art variant of particle swarm optimization pso called enhanced comprehensive learning pso eclpso yu and zhang 2014 yu et al 2018 is invoked to calibrate the parameters of each independent svr or xgboost model pso is a class of metaheuristics simulating the natural food searching behavior of a bird flock poli et al 2007 in pso the flock of birds is represented by a swarm of particles and the particles search for the optimum like the birds search for the food each particle flies in the search space and is thus associated with a velocity a position and a fitness indicating the particle s search performance pso iteratively adjusts the flight trajectories of the particles trying to let the particles gradually moving towards the optimum eclpso encourages each particle to learn from different exemplars on different dimensions of the search space for the flight trajectory update and is powerful at preserving the particles diversity for each particle the particle s position is encoded as a 3 dimensional vector log2 ε log2 β log2 δ for svr and a 4 dimensional vector log2 k max log2 λ log2 θ log2 σ for xgboost owing to cross validation each particle s fitness value is the mean of the corresponding model s root mean squared error rmse values on all the subsets rmse is calculated according to eq 19 19 rmse 1 m m 1 m y m z m 2 where zm is the forecasted output of the mth input vector a small rmse value indicates accurate forecasted outputs and the mapping is perfect when rmse equals to 0 all the particles positions are initialized randomly in the search space when eclpso ends the iterations or generations the position with the best fitness value among all the positions traversed so far by the swarm of particles gives the calibrated parameters compared with the traditional brute force grid search method taken for parameter calibration wang et al 2014 metaheuristics have been demonstrated to be significantly more efficient and can also give high quality parameters fang et al 2019 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2009 xing et al 2015 yu et al 2018 as metaheuristics quickly intentionally guide the search around promising regions whereas the grid search method has to inflexibly scan the entire search space the eclpso algorithm used in this paper has been evaluated with a number of metaheuristics on various benchmark global optimization functions yu and zhang 2014 and realworld multi reservoir hydropower systems optimal operation case studies zhang et al 2016 and exhibit excellent search performance 4 case study 4 1 the yangtze river drainage basin and the three gorges dam fig 2 shows china s yangtze river drainage basin and the tgd constructed on the yangtze river as the mother river of the chinese nationality the yangtze river sources from the tanggula mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau zigzags eastward with a length of 6397 km by traversing 11 provinces and independent municipalities and pours into the east china sea at the independent municipality of shanghai the drainage area of the yangtze river is about 1 8 million km2 nearly 20 of china s territory the tgd is upstream from and very close i e 44 km to the city of yichang the river section above yichang is the upper reach of the yangtze river the yangtze river is embodied with huge hydropower potential particularly on the upper reach the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are the most populated and economically developed regions of china and were often harassed by floods before the tgd was put into use the tgd is a critical hydraulic complex as it develops and harnesses the water resources of the yangtze river through hydropower generation flood control navigation sediment control and water provisioning the long term operation of the tgd is usually done at a 10 day time step yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 e g as the flood season of the tgd is from june to september the tgd s forebay elevation decreases to the flood control limit level 145 m during june 1 and june 10 and the tgd maintains its forebay elevation at the limit level so as to vacate enough storage for incoming floods until september 10 4 2 training data set and test data set long series of observed inflow data were recorded for the tgd the 10 day inflow records of the tgd from year 1990 to 2009 are used as the training data set and the records during the period from year 2010 to 2015 are treated as the test data set to validate the performance of ft svr and ft xgboost for 10 day streamflow forecasting on the studied case the training data set and the test data set contain totally n 936 records the 936 10 day inflow records are depicted in fig 3 the mean of the 936 records is 13084 m3 s fig 4 shows the ft frequency domain analysis of the centered 10 day inflow time series with the frequency index k 0 1 468 and the single sided amplitude i e s f 0 n for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 0 s f n 2 n for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 468 and 2 s f k n for all the other cosine waves respectively being the horizontal axis and the vertical axis the time domain and frequency domain analyses of the tgd s centered monthly inflow time series from year 1990 to 2015 were studied in yu et al 2018 similar to the centered monthly series it can be seen from fig 4 that the centered 10 day series also exhibit two striking single sided amplitudes in the frequency domain the champion striking single sided amplitude 8601 for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 26 and the runner up striking single sided amplitude 2873 for the cosine wave corresponding to frequency f 52 the single sided amplitudes of all the other cosine waves are significantly smaller than the two striking amplitudes the centered 10 day series are different from the centered monthly series mainly in that the frequency spectrum of the centered 10 day series is much larger than i e 3 times of that of the centered monthly series based on the similarities and differences between the 10 day and monthly streamflow time series we can infer that for a streamflow time series with an in between time step e g half monthly or a shorter time step e g daily and hourly the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies fd and f 2 d are also associated with two striking single sided amplitudes the single sided amplitude of the cosine wave corresponding to frequency fd is the largest and all the other cosine waves single sided amplitudes are much smaller than the two striking amplitudes with d being the number of years in addition the frequency spectrum of the series with a shorter time step is far larger than that of the monthly series e g the frequency spectrum of the tgd s daily inflow time series and that of the tgd s hourly series with the same period from year 1990 to 2015 respectively contain 4749 and 113 953 frequencies 5 experimental studies 5 1 performance metrics besides the rmse metric 4 other metrics including mean absolute percentage error mape nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsec relative error of maximum 10 day streamflow remax and relative error of minimum 10 day streamflow remin yu et al 2018 are also used for evaluating the performance of ft svr and ft xgboost mape nsec remax and remin are calculated respectively by eq 20 eq 21 eq 22 and eq 23 20 mape 1 m m 1 m y m z m z m 100 21 nsec 1 m 1 m y m z m 2 m 1 m y m y mean 2 22 remax 1 d d 1 d 1 y d max

10 day streamflow values in the dth year and y d min and z d min are respectively the minimum observed and forecasted 10 day streamflow values in the dth year mape quantifies the mean of the absolute relative errors between the observed and forecasted output values in a percentage form an accurate forecasting model is associated with a mape value close to 0 nsec measures the relationship of the accumulative squared error over the accumulative observed data variance a nsec value at 1 means a perfect match between the forecasted and observed output values remax and remin values around 0 indicate accurate forecasted extreme streamflow values 5 2 decomposition strategies ft transforms the centered 10 day inflow time series with 936 records into 469 cosine waves corresponding to different frequencies we investigate 3 strategies namely degenerated 4 component and 7 component for decomposing the centered 10 day series the degenerated decomposition strategy same as the strategy adopted by only svr in yu et al 2018 doesn t decompose the centered 10 day series and can be considered as a degenerated case of decomposition with only 1 decomposed component the 4 component decomposition strategy is like the strategy employed by ft svr in yu et al 2018 based on the two striking single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies f 26 and f 52 all the cosine waves are naturally grouped into 4 decomposed components c 1 1 c 1 2 c 1 3 and c 1 4 c 1 1 is the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies smaller than f 26 c 1 2 is the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around f 26 c 1 3 is the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around f 52 and c 1 4 is the addition of the remaining cosine waves i e corresponding to frequencies greater than f 52 to be more specific 24 c 1 1 t j s f 0 n k 1 u 1 1 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n 25 c 1 2 t j k u 1 1 1 u 1 2 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n 26 c 1 3 t j k u 1 2 1 u 1 3 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n 27 c 1 4 t j cos j π s f n 2 n k u 1 3 1 n 2 1 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n where u 1 1 is a frequency index smaller than 26 u 1 2 is a frequency index smaller than 52 and greater than 26 and u 1 3 is a frequency index greater than 52 here u 1 1 u 1 2 and u 1 3 are chosen such that the number of cosine waves in c 1 1 c 1 2 and c 1 3 are about the same as 23 accordingly the number of cosine waves in c 1 4 is about 400 the 4 components have clear physical meanings c 1 1 represents long term trend and cyclic changes c 1 2 features yearly seasonality c 1 3 is half yearly periodical and c 1 4 reflects stochastic influences the frequency spectrum of c 1 4 contains too many frequencies and is much larger than that of the fourth decomposed component forecasted by ft svr in yu et al 2018 we propose to further decompose c 1 4 into 4 smaller subseries consisting of contiguous frequencies in the 7 component decomposition strategy i e the 7 component strategy results in 7 decomposed components c 2 1 c 2 2 c 2 3 c2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 with c 1 1 c 2 1 c 1 2 c 2 2 c 1 3 c 2 3 and c 1 4 c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 c 2 7 c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 are constructed by about the same number of contiguous frequencies i e 100 with the frequency spectrum sizes about 4 times of those of c 2 1 c 2 2 and c 2 3 c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 stand for stochastic influences happening at different frequency scales figs 5 and 6 respectively depict the components c 1 1 to c 1 4 decomposed by the 4 component strategy and c 2 4 to c 2 7 further decomposed by the 7 component strategy the ft frequency domain analysis of c 1 1 to c 1 4 and that of c 2 4 to c 2 7 are respectively shown in figs 7 and 8 the 7 component decomposition strategy can be generalized and is easy to use given a e g monthly half monthly 10 day daily or hourly streamflow time series s with d years and n records s is decomposed into multiple at least 4 components with the first component being the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies smaller than fd the second component being the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around fd the third component being the addition of the cosine waves corresponding to frequencies around f 2 d and the other components containing the remaining contiguous frequencies the three decomposed components containing frequencies smaller than and around f 2 d are about the same in terms of the frequency spectrum size and each other component is comprised of about the same and about 100 contiguous frequencies 5 3 experimental settings and our adaptation open source software toolkits of svr and xgboost are available the toolkit of svr is called libsvm chang and lin 2011 in our experiments the java versions of libsvm and xgboost are used our hardware platform is a laptop computer with an intel core i7 6500 cpu at the clock rate of 2 5 ghz 8 gb double data rate internal memory and 256 gb solid state disk external memory the operating system is windows 7 an inappropriately small value for the error threshold ε or an inappropriately large value for the penalty factor β might give rise to numerical instability when solving the cqp formulation of a svr model the numerical instability causes libsvm to terminate cqp calculation only after the default maximum number of iterations i e 10 000 000 in yu et al 2018 we addressed the numerical instability by reducing the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation to 40000 in this paper we try to compare the performance of ft svr and ft xgboost xgboost has been claimed to be very efficient chen and guestrin 2016 chen and he 2015 fan et al 2018a b what is more we propose to decompose the centered 10 day inflow time series into 7 components whereas we decomposed the centered monthly series into just 4 components in yu et al 2018 we therefore further reduce the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation to 3000 which is significantly smaller than 40 000 making the adapted ft svr model consuming less time for development and similar to the time consumed by ft xgboost such that we can understand which of the two models can achieve better forecasting accuracy while with similar amount of time spent eclpso yu and zhang 2014 yu et al 2018 is applied to calibrate the parameters of each independent svr or xgboost model in yu et al 2018 we introduced some strategies to improve the parameter calibration performance of eclpso including 1 a particle s position on a dimension is randomly reset to a value between the overstepped boundary and the previous feasible value of the dimensional position when the particle moves outside the search space on the corresponding dimension 2 the number of particles is set as 10 and the number of generations is set as 40 in order to render reasonable calibration time 3 the perturbation based exploitation enhancement isn t invoked 4 the maximum learning probability is fixed at 0 75 to facilitate convergence and 5 the refreshing gap is reduced to 3 refreshing gap is the number of consecutive generations that each particle learns from the same combination of dimensional exemplars for flight velocity update in this paper we reduce the parameter calibration time of each independent svr or xgboost model by setting the number of generations as 25 in addition we waive the refreshing gap concept and let each particle re determine the dimensional exemplars in each generation thereby contributing to exploring more diverse regions of the search space and being more likely to locate the true optimum or a near optimum solution the search spaces for log2 ε log2 β log2 δ log2 k max log2 λ log2 θ and log2 σ are respectively 10 0 6 10 6 1 0 15 8 0 8 0 and 4 0 the number of iterations for xgboost is fixed at 100 i e 100 carts are constructed to constitute the ensemble each independent svr or xgboost model is developed on each decomposed component of the training data set based on 9 fold cross validation 5 4 experimental results and discussions a time lag is determined for selecting the input features of each independent svr or xgboost model based on the acf and pacf analyses of the corresponding decomposed component of the training data set and according to the principles stated in yu et al 2018 with a maximum lag of 72 table 1 lists the time lag values determined for the independent svr or xgboost models the parameters obtained by eclpso the parameter calibration time consumed by eclpso the best cross validation rmse value or fitness value among all the particles of eclpso and the rmse values validated on the training and test data sets for each independent svr or xgboost model are also given in table 1 the parameter calibration time of ft svr and ft xgboost as well as the final rmse mape nsec remax and remin values of the models with different decomposition strategies on the training data set i e 10 day inflow records from year 1990 and 2009 and the test data set i e 10 day records between year 2000 and 2015 are presented in table 2 as can be seen from table 1 the parameter calibration time of the independent svr model is around the same with that of the independent xgboost model on the centered 10 day inflow time series several seconds more on c 1 1 and c 1 3 tens of seconds more on c 2 4 and tens of seconds less on all the other decomposed components as a result the parameter calibration time of ft svr according to table 2 is almost equivalent to that of ft xgboost for the degenerated decomposition strategy about 39 less for the 4 component strategy and about 81 s less for the 7 component strategy the relative difference between the parameter calibration time of ft svr and that of ft xgboost is just about 10 for the 4 component strategy and 11 for the 7 component strategy for either ft svr or ft xgboost the degenerated decomposition strategy consumes the least parameter calibration time followed by the 4 component strategy and the 7 component strategy is the most time consuming indicating that the parameter calibration time of ft svr or ft xgboost increases with the number of decomposed components as each component needs to be forecasted independently in terms of the cross validation rmse values listed in table 1 the independent svr model differs little from the independent xgboost model on the centered series and c 1 4 and significantly outperforms the independent xgboost model on all the other decomposed components the observation verifies that svr is able to better address strong nonlinearity than xgboost the training and test rmse values of the independent svr model and the test rmse value of the independent xgboost are similar to the cross validation rmse value of the same model on each decomposed component meaning that it is appropriate to take the cross validation rmse metric for evaluating the fitness value of each particle in eclpso in addition with respect to the independently developed xgboost models the training rmse values are similar to the corresponding test rmse values on c 1 1 and c 1 3 however are significantly worse than the corresponding test rmse values on all the other decomposed components svr is good at overcoming overfitting while xgboost is still challenged by overfittting as it often fits well on the training data set but fits much worse on the test data set a look at the calibrated parameters of the independent svr and xgboost models developed on each decomposed component in table 1 reveal that an accurate svr model tends to be complex with a small ε value and a large β value in contrast the forecasting accuracy of an xgboost model doesn t have straightforward connections with the values of k max λ θ and σ we can see from table 2 that on the test data set the rmse and mape values of ft svr are similar to those of ft xgboost with the degenerated decomposition strategy slightly better with the 4 component strategy and significantly better with the 7 component strategy with respect to ft svr the rmse mape nsec remax and remin values on the training data set differ little from those on the test data set with all the decomposition strategies except the remax value with the 4 component strategy the rmse values of ft xgboost differ notably on the training and test data sets with all the decomposition strategies fig 9 plots the forecasted and observed 10 day inflow values of ft svr and ft xgboost on the test data set with different decomposition strategies as reflected from the rmse mape nsec remax and remin values given in table 2 and the forecasted observed inflow values illustrated in fig 9 1 both ft svr and ft xgboost perform slightly better with the 4 component decomposition strategy than with the degenerated strategy for the forecasting of the entire test data set and significantly better with the 7 component strategy than with the 4 component strategy 2 the forecasted 10 day inflow values of ft svr almost perfectly match the observed inflow records with the 7 component strategy and the forecasted values of ft xgboost also fit the observed records well with the 7 component strategy whereas the forecasted values of ft svr and ft xgboost aren t satisfactory with all the other decomposition strategies and 3 ft svr isn t good at forecasting the extreme streamflow values with the degenerated and 4 component decomposition strategies and ft xgboost is bad at forecasting the minimum streamflow values with the 7 component strategy the maximum streamflow values with the 4 component strategy and both the maximum and minimum streamflow values with the degenerated strategy the forecasting accuracy performance of ft svr and ft xgboost with different decomposition strategies can be explained by the fact that the forecasting accuracy of an independent svr or xgboost model developed on a decomposed component is affected by the number of contiguous frequencies included in the component and the single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves according to eq 5 the signal of time s t j s f 0 n cos j π s f n 2 n k 1 n 2 1 cos 2 π kj n arctan s f k 2 s f k n it can be observed from figs 4 and 8 that the single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves contained in c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 don t differ much in each of the components and are much smaller compared with the two striking amplitudes in addition for each component of c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 the number of contiguous frequencies included in the component is appropriately small the cosine waves fluctuate in terms of similar frequency scales and we can accurately model all the cosine waves by a single svr or xgboost model as shown in fig 7 c1 2 and c 1 3 each features a striking single sided amplitude and the striking amplitude is considerably larger than the single sided amplitudes of most other cosine waves contained in the component the number of contiguous frequencies included in c 1 1 c 1 2 c 1 3 are significantly smaller than those related to c 2 4 c 2 5 c 2 6 and c 2 7 as a result each of the components decomposed by the 7 component decomposition strategy can be accurately forecasted by an independent svr or xgboost model and the forecasted inflow values of ft svr and ft xgboost are accurate in contrast the frequency spectrum size of the centered 10 day inflow time series and c 1 4 are so large that ft svr and ft xgboost forecast unsatisfactorily with the degenerated and 4 component strategies table 3 lists the obtained parameters the parameter calibration time and the cross validation training and test rmse values of some svr and xgboost models with different experimental settings it can be observed from table 3 that if we reset the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation in svr as 40 000 then the parameter calibration time of the independent svr model sharply grows from 91 04 s to 405 93 s on c 1 1 and from 110 87 s to 953 08 s on c 2 4 the error threshold ε becomes smaller on c 1 1 and c 2 4 and the tradeoff factor β turns larger on c 1 1 and c 2 4 concerning the two cases fixing the number of iterations in other words the number of carts for xgboost at 50 and 150 the parameter calibration time of the independent xgboost model respectively decreases from 86 71 s to 51 26 s and increases to 114 21 s on c 1 1 the training and test rmse values of xgboost with 100 iterations are smaller than those of xgboost with 50 and 150 iterations on c 1 1 in table 3 we investigate splitting c 2 4 into equivalent halves c 3 4 and c 3 5 and adding c 2 4 and c 2 5 together to get c 4 4 specifically c 2 4 c 3 4 c 3 5 and c 4 4 c 2 4 c 2 5 using either svr or xgboost we can achieve even more accurate forecasting of c 2 4 through summing the forecasted outputs of c 3 4 and c 3 5 however the parameter calibration time consumed would be around 2 times of the original calibration time the test rmse value of the independent svr model on c 4 4 is significantly less than that of the independent svr model on c 1 4 however is much more than the added sum of the test rmse values of the independent svr models on c 2 4 and c 2 5 validating that we cannot achieve near perfect 10 day streamflow forecasting by just further decomposing c 1 4 into 2 equivalent components and resulting in totally 5 decomposed components the 7 component decomposition strategy takes a tradeoff between forecasting accuracy and parameter calibration efficiency 6 conclusions in this paper we have studied adapting ft svr for 10 day streamflow forecasting and the tgd has been taken as the case for study for the adaptation the 10 day streamflow time series is decomposed into 7 components based on ft preprocessing with each component containing an appropriate small number of contiguous frequencies rather than the decomposition into 4 components like in yu et al 2018 this is because ft converts a time series into contiguous frequencies each frequency is associated with a different cosine wave the forecasting accuracy of an independent svr or xgboost model developed on a decomposed component is affected by the number of cosine waves included in the component and the single sided amplitudes of the cosine waves and the frequency spectrum of the 10 day series is much larger than that of the monthly series studied in yu et al 2018 ft svr has been compared with ft xgboost the maximum number of iterations for cqp calculation in svr is reduced to 3000 and the parameter calibration of each independent svr or xgboost model by eclpso is enhanced experimental results on the tgd case study has demonstrated that ft svr is as efficient as ft xgboost and just consumes 680 89 s for parameter calibration with the decomposition of 7 components whereas ft svr takes 1351 s for parameter calibration with 4 decomposed components in yu et al 2018 moreover ft svr is capable of deriving near perfect 10 day inflow forecasting for the tgd and significantly outperforms ft xgboost in terms of evaluation criteria including rmse mape nsec remax and remin we have also pointed out that the 7 component decomposition strategy can be conveniently generalized for streamflow forecasting with different time step granularities according to our previous work yu et al 2018 and this paper the combination of ft and svr is very promising for addressing data driven streamflow forecasting we encourage researchers worldwide applying ft svr to practical case studies in other watersheds to validate analyze and further improve the performance of ft svr in the future we plan to extend ft svr for streamflow forecasting with a shorter time step e g daily and hourly with the aid of graphical processing unit gpu parallelized acceleration to achieve accurate and fast forecasting i e we can parallelize the independent forecasting of each decomposed component on a gpu to achieve tens to hundreds times of speedup as compared to the sequential implementation on the central processing unit declaration of competing interest the authors

5854,in recent decades increased groundwater use enabled a large areal increase in irrigated dry season crops in northwest bangladesh concurrent declining groundwater levels across the region are of great concern for food security a water balance model approach that considered changes in irrigated agriculture was implemented to assess changes over the long term to three five year evaluation periods 1985 1989 1998 2002 and 2011 2015 and seasonally annual dry season and wet season the model used two different methods that explicitly capture changes in irrigation to compute and compare actual evapotranspiration eta the first method used modis satellite data to estimate a crop coefficient based on vegetation indices at 500 m spatial resolution scaled by reference crop evapotranspiration etref the second method used a crop coefficient approach based on survey data of crop areas at the district level and subsequently scaled by etref both methods yielded very similar results at the district level with correlation coefficients between 0 75 and 0 89 the maximum difference between the monthly averages was only of 5 4 notwithstanding the observed overall increase in irrigated areas estimated overall mean annual eta is similar through the analysis ca 1100 mm and district level trends were mixed some increasing and some decreasing showing in some districts a weak association between eta and the related declining groundwater level from the water balance it is inferred that both the groundwater extraction by pumping for irrigation and capillary rise to supply roots and the groundwater recharge reduced from 1998 2002 to 2011 2015 and with deeper groundwater in later years much of the irrigation water supply is by soil water storage rather than by groundwater as highlighted in this paper there are other factors aside crop expansion that may have contributed to the groundwater decline thus a single policy or management change such as restricting groundwater extraction for irrigation may alone be inadequate to reverse declining groundwater trends keywords remote sensing evapotranspiration crop factor groundwater extraction boro rice bangladesh 1 introduction groundwater irrigation plays a key role in sustaining agricultural production in bangladesh ahmad et al 2014 kirby et al 2015 qureshi et al 2014 and globally döll et al 2014 wada et al 2012 since the 1950s the expansion of shallow and deep tube wells alongside the development of improved rice varieties have underpinned an intensification of irrigated agriculture in bangladesh turner and ali 1996 this has been instrumental for an increased agricultural output qureshi et al 2014 poverty alleviation smith 2004 and the near attainment of food security for the over 150 million inhabitants of bangladesh mainuddin and kirby 2015 groundwater use helped to boost total rice production the country s main crop from about 10 million tonnes of rice in 1961 to over 34 million tonnes in 2015 making bangladesh the fourth largest rice producer in the world fao 2019 groundwater is often a secure source of water however falling groundwater levels can lead to the need to deepen wells higher costs of pumping and salt water intrusion perrone and jasechko 2019 this has already happened in parts of bangladesh badc 2013 mohid et al 2019 additionally groundwater is often connected to surface water systems and groundwater pumping can affect surface water flows conversely changes in surface water flow affects groundwater if both surface and groundwater are managed sustainably considering increased anthropogenic use and climatic change groundwater can be an important source of water for irrigation in drier periods the northwest region has the largest areas of cropping in bangladesh it alone supplies about 35 6 6 million tons of the nation s irrigated dry season rice boro rice and more than 60 2 4 million tons of wheat and maize bangladesh bureau of statistics 2018 rainfall has significant control of the economy and wellbeing of bangladeshi people who depend on agriculture for an important part of their economic output around 14 of us 314 656 billion gdp imf 2019 rainfall is markedly seasonal and dominated by the south asian monsoon bryan et al 2019 which is characterized by very wet months june to september with most rainfall occurring during the boreal summer months and dry months november to april with least rainfall occurring during the boreal winter months rainfall mostly occurs by weak tropical depressions caused by wet monsoon winds and are often of synoptic scales 1000 km horizontal length shahid 2010 rainfall in the northwest during the dry season november to april accounts for only about 7 percent 140 mm of average annual rainfall 1900 mm for the 1985 2015 period because of trans boundary anthropogenic activities access to surface water during the dry season is very limited shahid and hazarika 2010 hence groundwater sustains over 96 percent of irrigated agriculture shahid 2009 compared to about 70 percent in the rest of bangladesh fao 2019 the large decline of groundwater levels in some areas portray clearly unsustainable groundwater use as in the barind area of northwest bangladesh see kirby et al 2015 and references therein conversely other areas in the northwest have only experienced moderate groundwater level declines dey et al 2017 and therefore there may well be potential for greater use islam et al 2014 government plans to switch to surface water use for irrigation in order to reduce declines in groundwater levels and boost irrigation expansion government of bangladesh 2010 may be unjustified in some areas while competing users navigation environmental flows may be compromised in many areas surface water would not be sufficient to address irrigation demand as many rivers cease to flow during the dry season but see krupnik et al 2017 shahid and hazarika 2010 surface and groundwater hydrologic processes need to be linked to better understand the factors that influence groundwater levels and the risks to sustainability besides the observed increase in groundwater use and rainfall declines changes in surface conditions affecting runoff and infiltration processes are crucial the use of groundwater enabled crop intensification with two or more crop sequences feasible during the year currently grown early ripening rice varieties allow planting of short season legumes whereas in the past rice ripened when the soil was already too dry and thus the land was left to fallow these interactions change soil surface conditions promoting or discouraging infiltration and subsequent recharge on the other hand there is a misconception when groundwater demand or pumping is used interchangeably with groundwater use for example mustafa et al 2017 found that the main explanatory factor in observed groundwater level declines in northwest bangladesh was groundwater extraction and meteorological factors were of second order this contrasts with the fact that areas which had the highest increase in irrigated area i e increase in groundwater extractions showed lower declines in groundwater levels than other areas see dey et al 2017 partly due to the dominant soils with relatively high permeability permitting recharge notwithstanding declining rainfall trends shamsudduha et al 2011 argue that net recharge in many areas in the northwest region has increased in response to increased groundwater pumping because there is an increase in the available storage and that current recharge is less than potential recharge as zhou 2009 notes increases in groundwater pumping may cause a temporary decrease in groundwater levels but if the recharge is more than the pumping rate groundwater levels will stabilise net groundwater use can be considered as the actual resulting evapotranspiration eta from the irrigated areas whereas some of the water pumped will either become runoff or infiltrate and some part of it eventually recharge the groundwater system eta in the northwest is high during the dry season ahmad et al 2014 and with an average of 365 mm is the largest component of the water balance quantifying eta in this changing landscape is crucial to understand the water balance a water balance or water account is generally regarded as fundamental to the understanding of water availability in a region and hence to the development of sustainable policies and plans for water management karimi et al 2012 dey et al 2017 assessed groundwater sustainability in five districts in the northwest by examining rainfall and groundwater trends and showed that rainfall groundwater levels and to a slight extent river water levels all show declines the extent of groundwater level decline varied from large more than 5 m to slight declines less than 1 m although the declines in rainfall were significant averaging 25 6 in their study they attributed the declining groundwater levels mainly to the increasing areas of boro rice noting that the clay soils limit how much rain can infiltrate to replenish the groundwater in some districts however dey et al 2017 did not calculate the actual water balance for the districts in their study and note that further research on the water balance is crucial for policy formulation kirby et al 2015 developed monthly time series water accounts for the main regions of bangladesh these water accounts provided tentative evidence that the declines in water tables in the northwest region might be due to changing rainfall rather than to increasing irrigation they noted that the water accounts were approximate and that the tentative conclusions should be assessed by more detailed work the present paper represents a contribution to the above suggestions for more detailed work by advancing a surface water balance developed following a top down approach klemes 1983 and based on concepts by ahmad et al 2005 who demonstrated that a surface water balance can be used to assess the net groundwater use in irrigated areas of pakistan the top down surface water balance model is conceptualised at a scale where the important characteristics of the water balance can be inferred sivapalan et al 2003 some processes for which data are not easily accessible and are therefore poorly constrained were simplified and subjected to a series of tested assumptions this enabled the exploration of the water balance fluxes and stores in relation to changes in rainfall and irrigation demand therefore the aim of this paper is to understand the impact of climate and crop area changes on groundwater levels and implications for sustainable groundwater use the specific aims are i to determine trends of climatic and hydrometric variables rainfall eta groundwater level and their role on the ii surface water balances for the districts of the northwest region in particular the human induced changes on eta as a result of the irrigation expansion and their impact on declining groundwater levels to this end rainfall records from 1985 to 2015 were examined and using two models based on remote sensing and crop coefficients respectively eta averaged for each of the 16 districts second tier administrative level of the region was estimated rainfall and eta estimates were used to calculate the annual and seasonal average surface water balances for the districts district boundaries were deemed more suitable as study subject since the smaller 100 km2 catchments subtending the northwest do not cover the whole study area as it is part of the ganges brahmaputra delta see section 2 besides this methodological reason there was also a practical reason for using districts as crop area data see section 3 4 3 needed to compute eta are collected at this administrative level this assumption is validated and discussed in sections 4 and 5 the term surface water balance is used to emphasise that the water balance does not consider deeper groundwater flows michael and voss 2009 showed that there is a large regional groundwater flow but because natural hydraulic gradients are low vertical exchanges dominate overall flow patterns this paper thus complements and extends the work of dey et al 2017 by studying trends in eta the major component of the water balance not considered in their study and developing estimates of the surface water balance for the 16 districts in the northwest region 2 study area northwest bangladesh 34 540 km2 comprises 16 districts surrounded by the padma river the name of the ganges river in bangladesh in the south the jamuna river the name of the brahmaputra river in bangladesh in the east and india in the north and west fig 1 and is thus part of the padma jamuna delta rainfall has marked intra annual variability with a distinct dry season from november to april mean annual rainfall for the 1985 2015 period is 1894 mm mean of 140 mm during the dry season varying from 1311 mm in the south rajshahi to 2326 mm in the north kurigram etref is more evenly distributed than rainfall for the same period mean reference evapotranspiration etref estimated using the fao 56 penman monteith method from station data from the bangladesh meteorological department fig 1 is 1299 mm mean of 582 mm during the dry season the dominant soils in the northwest region exhibit mostly moderate permeability except for districts in the central and southeast parts natore pabna sirajganj joypurhat and bogra where dominant soils have a mixture of slow and moderate permeability bca 2004 during the last few decades there has been a large increase in the area planted to boro dry season rice from 116 007 ha to 1 598 105 ha and a large decrease in the area of early wet season aus rice from 954 226 ha to 225 190 ha the area of main wet season aman rice has remained more or less steady from 1 775 765 ha to 1 870 165 ha fig 2 a the areas of many other dry season crops have also increased due to crop intensification including potatoes wheat maize oilseeds and pulses fig 2b because of groundwater availability and improved agricultural practices farmers can harvest more than two crops a year with up to four crops in some areas geographic climatic and dry season boro crop characteristics of the 16 districts are summarised in table 1 3 methods and materials 3 1 evapotranspiration estimation 3 1 1 remote sensing monthly eta estimates at 500 m spatial resolution were obtained using the cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration algorithm guerschman et al 2009 monthly eta is estimated by scaling priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration etp via a crop factor kc which is obtained from two indices from the modis daily mod09ga product the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 and the global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002 using evi and gvmi allows discrimination of open water and bare soils when evi is low and gvmi is high and to detect vegetation water content when evi is high the model was calibrated using eddy covariance eta from seven flux towers in australia and validated with water balance data for 227 unimpaired catchments across australia across australia cmrset provides reliable eta estimates with an accuracy which is comparable to or better than other more complex remote sensing models glenn et al 2011 guerschman et al 2009 the model performed well against eddy covariance eta from 14 flux towers with dissimilar land covers located in europe and the usa yebra et al 2013 cmrset eta has been used in studies in australia and elsewhere including water assessment modelling peña arancibia et al 2016 van dijk et al 2011 ecosystem mapping barron et al 2014 peña arancibia et al 2014 and recharge studies crosbie et al 2014 silberstein et al 2013 shen et al 2017 note that cmrset can capture eta patterns well over irrigated areas as well as areas subject to flooding and open water bodies 3 1 2 crop and other vegetation modelling of evapotranspiration the potential evapotranspiration etc in mm of a crop or a crop group was estimated using crop coefficients kv and etref following allen et al 1998 as 1 et c et ref k v the equation gives the evapotranspiration as the depth of water at a point i e it is a one dimensional calculation and for a single crop or crop group to calculate the evapotranspiration for a district the point evapotranspiration for each crop or crop group is multiplied by the area occupied by that crop or crop group ac i and the results summed to give the volume of evapotranspiration for the whole district etdv million cubic meters mcm 2 et cc dv i 1 nc et c i a c i where the subscript cc indicates that the evapotranspiration estimate is based on a crop coefficient calculation dv indicates that it is the district volumetric evapotranspiration i is the ith crop or crop group and nc is the number of crops and crop groups although eta is not etc as the latter can be higher eta is likely close to etc in northwest bangladesh ahmad et al 2014 because i in the wet season rainfall exceeds potential evapotranspiration ii for substantial parts of the dry season in recent years nearly half the landscape has been under irrigated rice and iii in much of the landscape and a greater fraction of the landscape in earlier years the water table is shallow and accessible to plant roots either directly or via capillary rise therefore etc will be used as eta in the remainder of this paper 3 2 trend analysis the seasonal non parametric mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 and the sen slope method to estimate rates of changes sen 1968 were used to investigate trends in observed data trends in water balance components were obtained by fitting a linear regression 3 3 district surface water balances a one dimensional surface water balance following a top down conceptualisation was computed for each of the 16 districts in the northwest the one dimensional water balance is similar to that of ahmad et al 2005 who demonstrated that a surface water can be used to assess the net groundwater use here the observed changes in groundwater levels are used together with observed rainfall and estimated evapotranspiration to estimate the overall water balance as follows 3 p et cc d v r o δ w ε 0 where p is rainfall ro is runoff δw is the change in water storage resulting from the surface water exchange and ε is an error a non zero residual if all other terms are known δw is equivalent to the combined change in storage in the soil δsw and the groundwater δgw the change in groundwater storage is the net result of downward movement of water as drainage below the root zone recharging the groundwater upward movement of water by capillary rise or direct access by roots and groundwater pumping for irrigation depleting the groundwater the change in storage of groundwater could also result from lateral inflows and outflows of water exchanging with the rivers but this is likely to be small relative to the one dimensional flows of groundwater there are few studies and few data with which to assess the magnitude of the lateral exchanges though they are likely to be small relative to the vertical exchanges with groundwater mainuddin et al 2014 therefore lateral exchanges are not assessed and recognise that any such exchanges appear in this approach either in the runoff term which may be considered as total runoff in the wet season or in the error term noting the change in groundwater storage is equal to the change in groundwater level δgwl multiplied by the aquifer specific yield sy eq 3 becomes 4 p et cc d v r o δ s w s y δ g w l ε 0 with the known rainfall eta and change in groundwater levels there remain three unknown quantities in eq 4 in addition to the error term runoff soil water storage and specific yield there are no data at the studied scale to constrain some of these fluxes and stores therefore some assumptions and calibration of parameters are necessary the following assumptions were then followed to resolve eq 4 as follows i the runoff was assumed to be zero during the dry season because of low rainfall this is generally acceptable as only 7 of rainfall occurs during the dry season and most of the landscape is comprised of agricultural land there are some exceptions impervious and ponded areas will produce runoff but this only occurs in a small fraction of the total area dey et al 2017 with this assumption any lateral flows into or out of the groundwater in the dry season will appear in the error term ii the groundwater is close to the surface throughout the year in most districts this was particularly the case in the earlier part of the considered period as shown in by the groundwater level data results section 4 2 furthermore much of the area in most districts is used to grow boro rice during the dry season this was particularly the case in more recent years it was therefore assumed that the change in soil water storage is likely to be small though the exact amount is unknown the implementation of the above assumptions required the water balance to be split into a dry season water balance to constrain some parameters which further allowed the estimation of the annual and wet season water balance as follows iii with runoff assumed to be zero the dry season water balance was computed with three settings for the change in water storage 0 mm 50 mm and 100 mm to test the model sensitivity to this parameter the water balance was also computed when the soil water storage was assumed to be greater with greater groundwater depth this generally led to an increase in the assumed soil water storage in later years with deeper groundwater the consequences of these assumptions will be discussed below and presented in more detail in the supplementary material section iv for each of the three dry season surface water balances the remaining unknown in eq 4 the specific yield term sy was calibrated as that which resulted in a zero for the sum of the error term for the three five year evaluation periods v the specific yields determined from the dry season calculation were used in the annual and wet season calculations in the annual calculation the soil water storage change was assumed to be zero since the soil is likely to return to approximately the same moisture content over an annual cycle in this highly seasonal environment in the wet season calculation the soil water storage change was assumed to be the opposite of that in the dry season following the above framework eq 4 was used to estimate the dry season annual and wet season surface water balances the water balance was determined for each of three evaluation periods 1985 1989 1998 2002 and 2011 2015 these periods were chosen to assess long term changes associated with the rapid expansion of irrigated areas as can be seen in fig 2 1985 1989 and 1998 2002 correspond to intervals of rapid irrigation expansion whereas 2011 2015 represents the current situation in which expansion is almost halted because of data availability a pre dry season irrigation development could not be evaluated in any case even as the two periods are transitional the long term averages for each period are monotonically increasing and the differences in area between the long term averages for each period are large fig 2 with 532 103 ha 1250 103 and 1605 103 ha for the three periods respectively therefore the results will reflect changed conditions as a result of an increase in irrigation expansion among other variables influencing the water balance rainfall and eta annual or seasonal as appropriate were averaged for each of the five year evaluation periods in the annual total calculation the observed change in groundwater was determined as the slope of a regression line fitted separately to the annual average groundwater in each of the five year evaluation periods in the dry season calculation the observed change in groundwater was determined as difference between the district average groundwater level at the end of the wet season and the level at the end of the dry season averaged for each of the five year evaluation periods the wet season calculation used the difference between groundwater level at the end of the dry season and that the end of the wet season 3 4 datasets 3 4 1 climate daily rainfall and climate datasets for 1985 to 2015 were acquired from the bangladesh meteorological department for the six stations shown in fig 1 the rainfall data comprise all the stations in the northwest region that can be accounted for in published sources e g mullick et al 2019 the station density is about 1 station per 5750 km2 considered adequate for land areas according to the standards outlined by the wmo 1985 which recommends at least 1 station per 25 000 km2 for climatological studies with an accuracy requirement of sampling error of less than 10 it is noted that the data temporal requirements in this paper predate routinely used satellite borne precipitation data for about 12 years e g trmm huffman et al 2007 the precipitation data was assigned to each of the 16 districts using a simple nearest neighbour method there was no attempt to spatially interpolate the data with more sophisticated algorithms e g bilinear interpolation due to i difficulties in obtaining daily rainfall data in neighbouring india ii other stations in bangladesh are located much further afield mullick et al 2019 and iii the potential edge smearing effects that these can cause on the interpolation accadia et al 2003 moreover precipitation is dominated by large scale weather patterns which occur at scales potentially 1000 km horizontal length shahid 2010 therefore the influence of convective precipitation on the nearest neighbour approach used to distribute rainfall amongst districts is less pervasive minimum and maximum temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate etc and etp for each of the stations through the ref et computer program allen 2011 the climate data inputs used to obtain etc and etp are less variable in time and space compared to rainfall and in turn less prone to causing the mentioned edge effects therefore etp was spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting to match the 500 m resolution of the remote sensing data see below inverse distance weighting was also used to obtain district average etc 3 4 2 remote sensing data monthly remotely sensed evi and gvmi composites from 500 m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis for the entire northwest region were obtained from google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 modis mod09ga nasa lp daac 2018 surface reflectance were used to produce a series of indices relevant for calculating monthly eta by selecting the average pixel value within the composite while minimising cloud cover and nulls monthly evis and gvmis were extracted from modis from 2000 to 2016 3 4 3 crop area and crop coefficient data crop area data were collected from agricultural statistics yearbooks and from the bangladesh bureau of statistics and disaggregated for the years prior to 2006 for which the data were recorded for the five earlier larger districts into the 16 districts of the later years the disaggregation was based on the equations outlined in the supplementary material section the results are shown in fig 2b the collated and disaggregated data are from 1985 to 2015 crop coefficients were taken from allen et al 1998 crop calendars were based on field observations carried on in six districts rajshahi bogra pabna rangpur dinajpur and thakurgaon during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 dry seasons mainuddin et al in preparation two or more crops per year are obtained from most arable land in bangladesh and so it was assumed crops were grown in rotation with short fallow periods in between as per the crop calendars since the northwest mostly has shallow water tables it was assumed that areas of non crop vegetation will evaporate at the potential rate i e etc etref in eq 1 3 4 4 groundwater level groundwater level data were obtained for more than 1200 wells from the bangladesh water development board the bangladesh water development board bwdb maintain an extensive groundwater monitoring database which contains time series water table depth recordings from more than 1200 wells across the country water table depth represents the depth from the ground surface to the water table at the well site as opposed to a groundwater elevation relative to mean seas level or some other datum monitoring data vary in terms of the length of time and frequency of sampling however many wells have data from the mid 1960s onwards measured weekly most wells have weekly data from at least the mid 1980s in the northwest region there are 454 wells with groundwater monitoring data between 1985 and 2016 these data have been compiled into a database and with obvious errors corrected hodgson et al 2014 to assess the water balance at the district level the database was queried to extract a monthly average groundwater depth for wells within the districts if all wells have weekly readings available then each monthly average will include 3 5 water table readings per well the number of wells used in each district varies between 4 in kurigram and 38 in dinajpur with a total of 350 being used here as reported in mohid et al 2019 these monthly averages for each district are only indicative of the general groundwater depth for the district and some districts have a large range of depths which have been averaged in areas such as the barind tract where there is higher elevation and an aquitard layer which semi confines the groundwater the depth to groundwater can be more than 20 m the districts containing these uplands also have lowland areas where the groundwater depth is shallow so the average depth will be less representative in these districts other districts have generally low elevation changes so average groundwater depths there will be more representative of the whole district for a district scale water balance this was deemed enough for the purpose used 4 results 4 1 evapotranspiration estimation monthly time series of both eta methods were visually compared from february 2000 to december 2015 a period in which both series overlapped the pearson s correlation coefficient r the mean percentage bias mpb and the root mean squared error rmse between remote sensing eta eta rs and crop coefficient eta eta crop were used to assess the differences in both estimates fig 3 shows the monthly time series volumetric mcm eta for the 16 districts in northwest bangladesh both time series are similar with correlation coefficients between 0 75 and 0 89 average of 0 86 the maximum difference between the monthly averages is 5 4 the absolute mpb is less than 5 in 14 districts and less the 10 in the remaining two kurigram and rangpur with no visible systematic under or overestimation the mean rmse for the entire period is between 19 7 and 73 4 mcm average of 41 mcm which is only about 2 of the mean annual eta for the period 2390 mcm two peaks in each year can be distinguished in both time series which roughly correspond to the peak boro rice season april and peak aman season september suggesting that constructed district crop factors capture the essential features of eta the two datasets will give similar results when used in a water balance calculation in the remainder of this paper unless otherwise indicated only the eta estimated by the crop coefficient modelling is considered since the results are available for the same period as other datasets from 1985 to 2015 4 2 trend analysis fig 4 shows the district wise time series of annual rainfall from january 1980 to december 2015 rainfall in all districts is declining with annual trends varying from 3 1 mm to 34 5 mm per year the average trend is 16 6 mm per year most districts to the north e g thakurgaon lalmonirhat panchagarh kurigram but not nilphamari nor gaibandha have statistically significant declines of 20 mm per year or more most districts to the south have significant declines declines of more than 15 mm per year e g nawabganj rangpur pabna and joypurhat except rajshahi pabna and nawabganj where the declines are less than 10 mm per year and are non statistically significant fig 5 shows the time series of annual eta from january 1980 to december 2015 satellite eta from 2001 onwards eta in 12 out of the 16 districts is increasing with annual trends varying from 5 7 mm to 7 5 mm per year the average trend is 1 8 mm per year districts with statistically significant increases of more than 6 mm per year include lalmonirhat nilphamari and kurigram in the north and rangpur in the south small increases of less than 2 mm per year are estimated in dinajpur panchagarh in the north and rajshahi nature and naogaon in the south only sirajgang has significant declining eta of 5 7 mm per year whereas nawabgang bogra and thakurgaon have non statistically significant declines of 3 3 1 3 and 1 3 mm per year respectively fig 6 shows the time series of annual groundwater level from january 1980 to december 2015 groundwater level is significantly declining in the 16 districts with annual trends varying from 0 01 m to 0 24 m per year the average trend is 0 08 m per year the largest declines are to the south where the districts of naogaon rajshahi and nawabganj have declines larger than 0 2 m per year all declines are statistically significant at the 90 significance level the monthly data also shows a decline in the intra annual seasonality recharge discharge cycles in some of the most affected districts this is particularly visible in joypurhat naogaon and nawabganj 4 3 district surface water balances a summary of trends of the water balance component for the 16 districts in northwest bangladesh and key boro rice data are shown in table 2 the one dimensional vertical exchange of water approach used in the district water balance was tested by comparing the pearson s correlation coefficient between district monthly rainfall and observed monthly change in groundwater level the correlation varied between 0 53 and 0 81 there was high correlation r 0 7 in 10 out of the 16 districts the time series comparisons are shown in the supplementary material section this result suggests that the groundwater behaviour and the water balance overall is largely dominated by one dimensional vertical exchange of water the annual surface water balances for the 16 districts determined using eqs 3 and 4 are shown in fig 7 and the associated changes with respect to water balance fluxes are summarised in table 3 the declines in rainfall from 1985 1989 to 2011 2015 are clear fig 7 the average annual rainfall for the three periods is 2200 mm 1985 1989 2068 mm 1998 2002 and 1606 mm 2011 2015 compared to 1985 1989 rainfall is generally lower in the districts located in the north lalmonirhat joypurhat panchagarh during the 1998 2002 evaluation period and also generally higher in the districts in the south natore pabana rajshahi during this period table 3 the evapotranspiration is similar across the five year evaluation periods with the period 1998 2002 being on average higher and higher for every district at 1140 mm compared to 1022 mm and 1005 mm for 1985 1989 and 2011 2015 respectively there are increases and declines during the 2011 2015 period consistent with the trends reported at the district level the changes in groundwater storage are small relative to the other terms so the declines in rainfall mostly result in a reduction in runoff with runoff being on average 1181 mm 1985 1989 932 mm 1998 2002 and 603 mm 2011 2015 the groundwater storage generally decreases positive values in fig 7 more so for the southern districts and for the 1998 2002 period although there are declines over the whole period from 1985 to 2015 the groundwater storage increases negative values in fig 7 in some districts in some 5 year periods particularly in the north there are also some districts increasing in the south for the 2011 2015 period the dry season and wet season surface water balances are shown in figs 8 and 9 for the case of assumed seasonal soil water storage change of 100 mm the dry season surface water balance assumed a change in soil water storage from the start to the end of the dry season that varies amongst the three five year periods as a function of dry season maximum groundwater depth averaged over each of the five year periods runoff was also assumed to be zero therefore it is not shown in fig 8 the lowest values in average dry season rainfall generally occur in the last evaluation period 2011 2015 whereas rainfall is similar for 1985 1989 and 1998 2002 the average dry season rainfall for the three periods is 166 mm 1985 1989 182 mm 1998 2002 and 130 mm 2011 2015 respectively the declines are higher in the northern districts panchagarh thakurgaon dinajpur and nilphamari and there are some increases in the south e g nawabganj evapotranspiration is similar across the five year evaluation periods with the period 1998 2002 being on average higher at 460 mm compared to 366 mm and 400 mm for 1985 1989 and 2011 2015 respectively decreases in groundwater storages are higher in the southern and central districts nawabganj rajshahi bogra joypurhat for the 1998 2002 period the errors in the dry season water balance calculation are generally small relative to the rainfall and eta in most cases they are smaller also than the calculated changes in groundwater storage the exceptions are the first and third five year periods in nilpharmari during which the error is greater than the calculated change in storage the computed specific yields for assumed soil water changes of zero and 50 mm and corresponding dry season water balances are shown in the supplementary material section for these assumptions the calculated changes in groundwater storage are correspondingly larger and the error terms are smaller relative to the groundwater change rainfall values for the wet season are generally lower in both the 1998 2002 and 2011 2015 evaluation periods compared to 1985 1989 fig 9 the average wet season rainfall for the three periods is 2030 mm 1985 1989 1773 mm 1998 2002 and 1479 mm 2011 2015 the largest declines are generally in the northern districts panchagarh thakurgaon joypurhat and kurigram with declines greater than 30 southern districts nawabganj rajshahi naogaon natore and pabna also had large declines of around 20 eta is similar across the five year evaluation periods generally slightly increasing in the 1998 2002 evaluation period and generally slightly decreasing in the 2011 2015 evaluation period except for some declines in districts in the south nawabganj rajshahi natore pabna the period 1998 2002 had on average higher eta at 694 mm compared to 661 mm and 609 mm for 1985 1989 and 2011 2015 respectively increase in groundwater storages are generally higher in the southern and central districts because of less runoff than in the northern districts where on average more rainfall ends up as runoff runoff was on average 1226 mm 1985 1989 909 mm 1998 2002 and 753 mm 2011 2015 5 discussion 5 1 evapotranspiration estimation two methods to estimate monthly eta were implemented and compared in 16 districts in northwest bangladesh the first method readily captures irrigation dynamics through the estimation of a crop coefficient based on satellite vegetation indices at 500 m spatial resolution the second method used a crop coefficient approach based on survey data of crop areas the results of the satellite data method and the crop coefficient approach method were comparable in magnitude seasonal and inter annual variability whilst the former is relatively straightforward to implement it is limited by the availability of satellite data before the 2000 s as pre 2000 satellite data are of coarser spatial and temporal resolution gowda et al 2008 this also limits the useability of longer term data to analyse hydrologic variables that require continuity for example the water balance and trends in fluxes and stores the second method relies on main crop statistics which have been collected systematically since 1969 bangladesh bureau of statistics 2018 careful consideration of crop patterns and crop intensity were inferred from crop statistics data and elicited expert knowledge at the district level to reduce errors in data and interpretation see the supplementary material section this detailed knowledge of historical and current irrigation practices was used to understand the retrospective dynamics in irrigated agriculture and thus reducing one of the main sources of uncertainty in water balance modelling hoff et al 2010 wada et al 2011 wisser et al 2008 the reasonable agreement between the two estimates which are also the first detailed eta estimates for the region increases the confidence in the ability of a water balance model to accurately describe long term changes associated with the expansion of irrigation both methods showed that despite the overall large areal increases in irrigated boro rice other dry season crops e g maize there was no evident commensurate increase in eta this suggests that the alternative land uses i e dry season non rice crops or natural vegetation replaced by boro had similar eta to that of dry season crops in the crop model it was assumed that non crop areas had an eta equal to etref which is a reasonable assumption for northwest bangladesh where roots have access to soil water or there is water readily available due to capillary rise from shallow groundwater pierret et al 2016 also crop sequencing in the crop coefficient model introduced fallow periods during which eta is much less than etref the remote sensing model intrinsically captures these dynamics and other possible land use changes that may have compensated the increase in eta by a concurrent reduction of other land types with high eta as a result of irrigation areal expansion dey et al 2017 used landsat images to conclude that a third of the wetland area about 250 km2 changed to other land uses in northwest bangladesh over the last two decades the reduction in river levels reported by dey et al 2017 may have reduced eta from the rivers themselves or from riparian vegetation in addition increased urbanization with an associated reduction in eta may have also played a minor role with a 5 increase in built up areas from 1990 to 2010 mustafa et al 2017 these were not assessed in the present paper but can be further investigated by exploring the remote sensing eta and the associated vegetation indices 5 2 trend analysis rainfall trends showed distinct patterns with most districts in the north except for gaibandha and nilphamari showing large statistically significant declines of 20 mm per year or more most districts in the south have statistically significant declines of more than 10 mm per year except for rajshahi nawabganj and pabna all with non significant declines of less than 10 mm per year these results are in agreement with those of dey et al 2017 however there are reported interdecadal variations in the south asian monsoon with epochs below and above mean precipitations at the broad scale of 30 years krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 reported time series of precipitation anomalies for selected indian stations showing below normal conditions during 1959 to 1988 and above normal conditions during 1989 to 1998 their analyses ended in 1998 it is possible that a similar phenomenon affects rainfall in bangladesh for example mullick et al 2019 did not show significant rainfall trends during the monsoon in northwest bangladesh for the last 50 years 1966 2015 period encompassing both below and above average conditions according to krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 there were no readily apparent spatial patterns for eta trends when aggregated at the district level some districts in the south that had large area increases in boro rice table 1 also had concurrent eta declines e g bogra with 1 3 mm y and sirajgang with 5 7 mm y whereas others had increases e g rangpur with 6 1 mm y and joypurhat with 3 9 mm y groundwater level trends showed clearer patterns with districts to the north rangpur lalmornihat panchagarh nilphamari and thaukargaon showing lower declines average of 0 03 m y and districts to the south showing larger average of 0 11 m y declines it is noted that in districts with larger 0 06 m y groundwater level declines in the south not all show significant declines 10 mm y in rainfall and some have decreased eta trends e g bogra districts to the south with a large proportion of slow soil permeability fig 2 had the largest declines in groundwater levels nawabgang rajshahi naogaon joypurhat natore and bogra some of these districts also have the highest proportions of deep tube well irrigation shamsudduha et al 2011 whilst the natural slope suggests slow groundwater discharge into the padma river dey et al 2017 the barind tract area located within rajshahi and naogaon has been highlighted in numerous studies as having unsustainable groundwater use see kirby et al 2015 and references therein results here extend this assessment to some the neighbouring districts emphasizing that rainfall decline and groundwater use to a lesser degree seems the main cause of the groundwater level declines at least in nawabgang naogaon bogra and natore conversely districts to the north thaukargaon lalmornihat panchagarh kurigram and joypurhat have the largest declines in rainfall mostly increases in et a slight decrease in thaukargaon and the lowest declines in groundwater level these districts have had large increases of irrigated boro rice area in some cases as much as in districts to the south and boro rice covers on average 45 of the area like districts to the south districts to the north have larger proportions of moderate soil permeability fig 2 and about 30 more rainfall than in the south and the natural slope suggests flow into the groundwater system from the jamuna and teesta rivers dey et al 2017 5 3 district surface water balance the et a estimates provided here are the first time series water balances for the region at the district scale previous studies of groundwater sustainability such as that of dey et al 2017 have generally interpreted sustainability from groundwater trends rather than from a water balance the district surface water balance conceptualised using a top down approach has been implemented using plausible assumptions about the changes in soil water storage the assumptions about soil water storage change outlined in section 3 2 lead to similar results see the supplementary material section the variable soil water storage is probably the most plausible assumption but has only slightly lower overall errors than the 50 mm or 100 mm assumption the assumption of one dimensional flow dominating the water exchange in the water balance follows from the strong correlation between rainfall and change in groundwater table fig s1 and is also suggested by michael and voss 2009 the calculated specific yields resulting from the assumptions fig s2 are of the same order of those in areas of shallow water tables gillham 1984 the approach adopted to conceptualise the surface water balance has required simplifications of complex hydrological processes at smaller scales that have proved sufficiently robust at describing the observations made at larger scales it was deemed unnecessary to increase the complexity in the model to address the hypotheses about the processes underlying this hydrological system for example additional assumptions and input parameters required to explain lateral flow require more observations and further calibration there are few data or studies of additional processes such as lateral groundwater exchanges with rivers mainuddin et al 2014 though they are thought to be small in the absence of constraining observations additional processes may result in more than one parameter set with similar explanatory value oreskes et al 1994 and thus a model suffering from structural equivalence or equifinality beven 2006 rainfall and et a dominate the water balance et a is similar around 1100 mm across districts although rainfall declined from 1985 to 2015 et a generally remained about the same annually runoff is approximately equal to the difference in rainfall and et a with some recharge to groundwater and varies from about 300 mm to about 1900 mm and is mostly determined by the variation in rain amongst the districts because of the decline in rainfall runoff declined in all districts from 1985 to 2015 annually the change in groundwater storage is small but the decrease in the dry season and increase in the wet is a larger part of the seasonal water balance the five districts with the largest and most obvious groundwater level declines bogra joypurhat naogaon nawabganj natore and rajshahi have greater declines in groundwater storage from about 2005 onwards fig 6 and table 2 this is consistent with a decline of groundwater storage reported by khaki et al 2018 in northwest bangladesh in an assessment that used a global hydrological model and assimilated terrestrial water storage tws data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission the 2011 2015 change in wet season and dry season storages for these five districts are all smaller than in 1998 2002 figs 8 and 9 in other words both the groundwater extraction and the groundwater recharge may have reduced from 1998 2002 to 2011 2015 note that the groundwater extraction comprises pumping for irrigation and extraction by roots which is re supplied by capillary rise from shallow groundwater tables a reduction in total extraction does not necessarily imply that pumping was reduced this reduction can be seen in the monthly groundwater levels fig 6 after about 2005 as the groundwater levels fell in these districts the difference between the maximum and minimum groundwater reduced the reduced groundwater extraction and recharge noted above are consistent with the explanation that with greater depth to groundwater more of the water storage change occurs in the soil and not in the groundwater thus with deeper groundwater in later years much of the landscape supply of water is by soil water storage depletion rather than by groundwater depletion with declining rainfall the soil water storage will be fully recharged later in the year and for a shorter period thus limiting the period of deep drainage from the soil and reducing the potential for groundwater recharge more so in areas where soil infiltrabilities are moderate to slow there are potentially others factor limiting the deep drainage from the soil and hence the groundwater recharge neumann et al 2009 showed that puddling i e traditional practice in preparation for growing transplanted rice substantially reduces the deep drainage of water while the un puddled bunds between rice fields remain much more transmissive as more and more of the landscape has been put under boro cultivation fig 2 an ever increasing area is puddled every dry season amounting to between 45 and 47 percent of the landscape from 2007 to 8 onwards the area of boro rice in recent years is greater than the area of aus that it mostly replaced thus a greater part of the landscape will be affected by dry season puddling in recent years than was the case in 1985 this explanation can be tested with further remote sensing analysis van niel and mcvicar 2004 6 conclusion groundwater demand has substantially increased in northwest bangladesh with the adoption of dry season boro rice and other dry season crops concurrent declines in rainfall surface water and groundwater levels are a reason of concern regarding the sustainability of groundwater resources this echoes a pervasive global problem also dubbed the silent drought the mining of groundwater underlying many of the world food bowls the methods described in this paper allowed i the assessment of trends of the two most important terms of the two hydrologic cycle in northwest bangladesh rainfall and evapotranspiration and ii the estimation of the surface water balance for the 16 districts in northwest bangladesh and their relationship with declining groundwater levels and expansion of dry season boro rice the district level surface water balances are the first of their kind in the entire northwest bangladesh and provide a framework to analyse the regional availability of water its use the causes for the observed declines in groundwater levels and the implications for farmers policymakers and other stakeholders of these declines this knowledge is essential for the management of river systems and aquifers particularly in areas experiencing climate variability and where water limitation becomes a major constraint to irrigation several factors have led to declining groundwater levels reduced rainfall increased groundwater use declining deep drainage contributing to groundwater recharge an associated increase in soil water storage and vegetation use of soil water the southern districts of the region with slow draining soils and prevalence of deep tube well irrigation technology have experienced the largest declines resulting in likely unsustainable groundwater use conversely the northern districts of the region have experienced moderate declines in groundwater levels despite of recording the largest declines in rainfall and increases in evapotranspiration moderate draining soils contribute to recharge in these districts which have on average about 30 more rainfall than districts in the south annual average of 2200 mm in the north and 1500 mm in the south therefore there are no reasons for immediate concern regarding groundwater sustainability in the districts to the north of northwest bangladesh given the various factors outlined that have contributed to groundwater decline a single policy or management change such as increased use of surface water for irrigation may alone be inadequate to reverse groundwater trends in the areas with serious groundwater decline where deep drainage has become more limited e g through changes in soil percolation and infiltration rates increased irrigation might lead to more runoff rather than more deep drainage and groundwater recharge groundwater levels will recover only if the recharge is increased sufficiently to overcome all groundwater losses including any baseflow losses to the rivers

5854,in recent decades increased groundwater use enabled a large areal increase in irrigated dry season crops in northwest bangladesh concurrent declining groundwater levels across the region are of great concern for food security a water balance model approach that considered changes in irrigated agriculture was implemented to assess changes over the long term to three five year evaluation periods 1985 1989 1998 2002 and 2011 2015 and seasonally annual dry season and wet season the model used two different methods that explicitly capture changes in irrigation to compute and compare actual evapotranspiration eta the first method used modis satellite data to estimate a crop coefficient based on vegetation indices at 500 m spatial resolution scaled by reference crop evapotranspiration etref the second method used a crop coefficient approach based on survey data of crop areas at the district level and subsequently scaled by etref both methods yielded very similar results at the district level with correlation coefficients between 0 75 and 0 89 the maximum difference between the monthly averages was only of 5 4 notwithstanding the observed overall increase in irrigated areas estimated overall mean annual eta is similar through the analysis ca 1100 mm and district level trends were mixed some increasing and some decreasing showing in some districts a weak association between eta and the related declining groundwater level from the water balance it is inferred that both the groundwater extraction by pumping for irrigation and capillary rise to supply roots and the groundwater recharge reduced from 1998 2002 to 2011 2015 and with deeper groundwater in later years much of the irrigation water supply is by soil water storage rather than by groundwater as highlighted in this paper there are other factors aside crop expansion that may have contributed to the groundwater decline thus a single policy or management change such as restricting groundwater extraction for irrigation may alone be inadequate to reverse declining groundwater trends keywords remote sensing evapotranspiration crop factor groundwater extraction boro rice bangladesh 1 introduction groundwater irrigation plays a key role in sustaining agricultural production in bangladesh ahmad et al 2014 kirby et al 2015 qureshi et al 2014 and globally döll et al 2014 wada et al 2012 since the 1950s the expansion of shallow and deep tube wells alongside the development of improved rice varieties have underpinned an intensification of irrigated agriculture in bangladesh turner and ali 1996 this has been instrumental for an increased agricultural output qureshi et al 2014 poverty alleviation smith 2004 and the near attainment of food security for the over 150 million inhabitants of bangladesh mainuddin and kirby 2015 groundwater use helped to boost total rice production the country s main crop from about 10 million tonnes of rice in 1961 to over 34 million tonnes in 2015 making bangladesh the fourth largest rice producer in the world fao 2019 groundwater is often a secure source of water however falling groundwater levels can lead to the need to deepen wells higher costs of pumping and salt water intrusion perrone and jasechko 2019 this has already happened in parts of bangladesh badc 2013 mohid et al 2019 additionally groundwater is often connected to surface water systems and groundwater pumping can affect surface water flows conversely changes in surface water flow affects groundwater if both surface and groundwater are managed sustainably considering increased anthropogenic use and climatic change groundwater can be an important source of water for irrigation in drier periods the northwest region has the largest areas of cropping in bangladesh it alone supplies about 35 6 6 million tons of the nation s irrigated dry season rice boro rice and more than 60 2 4 million tons of wheat and maize bangladesh bureau of statistics 2018 rainfall has significant control of the economy and wellbeing of bangladeshi people who depend on agriculture for an important part of their economic output around 14 of us 314 656 billion gdp imf 2019 rainfall is markedly seasonal and dominated by the south asian monsoon bryan et al 2019 which is characterized by very wet months june to september with most rainfall occurring during the boreal summer months and dry months november to april with least rainfall occurring during the boreal winter months rainfall mostly occurs by weak tropical depressions caused by wet monsoon winds and are often of synoptic scales 1000 km horizontal length shahid 2010 rainfall in the northwest during the dry season november to april accounts for only about 7 percent 140 mm of average annual rainfall 1900 mm for the 1985 2015 period because of trans boundary anthropogenic activities access to surface water during the dry season is very limited shahid and hazarika 2010 hence groundwater sustains over 96 percent of irrigated agriculture shahid 2009 compared to about 70 percent in the rest of bangladesh fao 2019 the large decline of groundwater levels in some areas portray clearly unsustainable groundwater use as in the barind area of northwest bangladesh see kirby et al 2015 and references therein conversely other areas in the northwest have only experienced moderate groundwater level declines dey et al 2017 and therefore there may well be potential for greater use islam et al 2014 government plans to switch to surface water use for irrigation in order to reduce declines in groundwater levels and boost irrigation expansion government of bangladesh 2010 may be unjustified in some areas while competing users navigation environmental flows may be compromised in many areas surface water would not be sufficient to address irrigation demand as many rivers cease to flow during the dry season but see krupnik et al 2017 shahid and hazarika 2010 surface and groundwater hydrologic processes need to be linked to better understand the factors that influence groundwater levels and the risks to sustainability besides the observed increase in groundwater use and rainfall declines changes in surface conditions affecting runoff and infiltration processes are crucial the use of groundwater enabled crop intensification with two or more crop sequences feasible during the year currently grown early ripening rice varieties allow planting of short season legumes whereas in the past rice ripened when the soil was already too dry and thus the land was left to fallow these interactions change soil surface conditions promoting or discouraging infiltration and subsequent recharge on the other hand there is a misconception when groundwater demand or pumping is used interchangeably with groundwater use for example mustafa et al 2017 found that the main explanatory factor in observed groundwater level declines in northwest bangladesh was groundwater extraction and meteorological factors were of second order this contrasts with the fact that areas which had the highest increase in irrigated area i e increase in groundwater extractions showed lower declines in groundwater levels than other areas see dey et al 2017 partly due to the dominant soils with relatively high permeability permitting recharge notwithstanding declining rainfall trends shamsudduha et al 2011 argue that net recharge in many areas in the northwest region has increased in response to increased groundwater pumping because there is an increase in the available storage and that current recharge is less than potential recharge as zhou 2009 notes increases in groundwater pumping may cause a temporary decrease in groundwater levels but if the recharge is more than the pumping rate groundwater levels will stabilise net groundwater use can be considered as the actual resulting evapotranspiration eta from the irrigated areas whereas some of the water pumped will either become runoff or infiltrate and some part of it eventually recharge the groundwater system eta in the northwest is high during the dry season ahmad et al 2014 and with an average of 365 mm is the largest component of the water balance quantifying eta in this changing landscape is crucial to understand the water balance a water balance or water account is generally regarded as fundamental to the understanding of water availability in a region and hence to the development of sustainable policies and plans for water management karimi et al 2012 dey et al 2017 assessed groundwater sustainability in five districts in the northwest by examining rainfall and groundwater trends and showed that rainfall groundwater levels and to a slight extent river water levels all show declines the extent of groundwater level decline varied from large more than 5 m to slight declines less than 1 m although the declines in rainfall were significant averaging 25 6 in their study they attributed the declining groundwater levels mainly to the increasing areas of boro rice noting that the clay soils limit how much rain can infiltrate to replenish the groundwater in some districts however dey et al 2017 did not calculate the actual water balance for the districts in their study and note that further research on the water balance is crucial for policy formulation kirby et al 2015 developed monthly time series water accounts for the main regions of bangladesh these water accounts provided tentative evidence that the declines in water tables in the northwest region might be due to changing rainfall rather than to increasing irrigation they noted that the water accounts were approximate and that the tentative conclusions should be assessed by more detailed work the present paper represents a contribution to the above suggestions for more detailed work by advancing a surface water balance developed following a top down approach klemes 1983 and based on concepts by ahmad et al 2005 who demonstrated that a surface water balance can be used to assess the net groundwater use in irrigated areas of pakistan the top down surface water balance model is conceptualised at a scale where the important characteristics of the water balance can be inferred sivapalan et al 2003 some processes for which data are not easily accessible and are therefore poorly constrained were simplified and subjected to a series of tested assumptions this enabled the exploration of the water balance fluxes and stores in relation to changes in rainfall and irrigation demand therefore the aim of this paper is to understand the impact of climate and crop area changes on groundwater levels and implications for sustainable groundwater use the specific aims are i to determine trends of climatic and hydrometric variables rainfall eta groundwater level and their role on the ii surface water balances for the districts of the northwest region in particular the human induced changes on eta as a result of the irrigation expansion and their impact on declining groundwater levels to this end rainfall records from 1985 to 2015 were examined and using two models based on remote sensing and crop coefficients respectively eta averaged for each of the 16 districts second tier administrative level of the region was estimated rainfall and eta estimates were used to calculate the annual and seasonal average surface water balances for the districts district boundaries were deemed more suitable as study subject since the smaller 100 km2 catchments subtending the northwest do not cover the whole study area as it is part of the ganges brahmaputra delta see section 2 besides this methodological reason there was also a practical reason for using districts as crop area data see section 3 4 3 needed to compute eta are collected at this administrative level this assumption is validated and discussed in sections 4 and 5 the term surface water balance is used to emphasise that the water balance does not consider deeper groundwater flows michael and voss 2009 showed that there is a large regional groundwater flow but because natural hydraulic gradients are low vertical exchanges dominate overall flow patterns this paper thus complements and extends the work of dey et al 2017 by studying trends in eta the major component of the water balance not considered in their study and developing estimates of the surface water balance for the 16 districts in the northwest region 2 study area northwest bangladesh 34 540 km2 comprises 16 districts surrounded by the padma river the name of the ganges river in bangladesh in the south the jamuna river the name of the brahmaputra river in bangladesh in the east and india in the north and west fig 1 and is thus part of the padma jamuna delta rainfall has marked intra annual variability with a distinct dry season from november to april mean annual rainfall for the 1985 2015 period is 1894 mm mean of 140 mm during the dry season varying from 1311 mm in the south rajshahi to 2326 mm in the north kurigram etref is more evenly distributed than rainfall for the same period mean reference evapotranspiration etref estimated using the fao 56 penman monteith method from station data from the bangladesh meteorological department fig 1 is 1299 mm mean of 582 mm during the dry season the dominant soils in the northwest region exhibit mostly moderate permeability except for districts in the central and southeast parts natore pabna sirajganj joypurhat and bogra where dominant soils have a mixture of slow and moderate permeability bca 2004 during the last few decades there has been a large increase in the area planted to boro dry season rice from 116 007 ha to 1 598 105 ha and a large decrease in the area of early wet season aus rice from 954 226 ha to 225 190 ha the area of main wet season aman rice has remained more or less steady from 1 775 765 ha to 1 870 165 ha fig 2 a the areas of many other dry season crops have also increased due to crop intensification including potatoes wheat maize oilseeds and pulses fig 2b because of groundwater availability and improved agricultural practices farmers can harvest more than two crops a year with up to four crops in some areas geographic climatic and dry season boro crop characteristics of the 16 districts are summarised in table 1 3 methods and materials 3 1 evapotranspiration estimation 3 1 1 remote sensing monthly eta estimates at 500 m spatial resolution were obtained using the cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration algorithm guerschman et al 2009 monthly eta is estimated by scaling priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration etp via a crop factor kc which is obtained from two indices from the modis daily mod09ga product the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 and the global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002 using evi and gvmi allows discrimination of open water and bare soils when evi is low and gvmi is high and to detect vegetation water content when evi is high the model was calibrated using eddy covariance eta from seven flux towers in australia and validated with water balance data for 227 unimpaired catchments across australia across australia cmrset provides reliable eta estimates with an accuracy which is comparable to or better than other more complex remote sensing models glenn et al 2011 guerschman et al 2009 the model performed well against eddy covariance eta from 14 flux towers with dissimilar land covers located in europe and the usa yebra et al 2013 cmrset eta has been used in studies in australia and elsewhere including water assessment modelling peña arancibia et al 2016 van dijk et al 2011 ecosystem mapping barron et al 2014 peña arancibia et al 2014 and recharge studies crosbie et al 2014 silberstein et al 2013 shen et al 2017 note that cmrset can capture eta patterns well over irrigated areas as well as areas subject to flooding and open water bodies 3 1 2 crop and other vegetation modelling of evapotranspiration the potential evapotranspiration etc in mm of a crop or a crop group was estimated using crop coefficients kv and etref following allen et al 1998 as 1 et c et ref k v the equation gives the evapotranspiration as the depth of water at a point i e it is a one dimensional calculation and for a single crop or crop group to calculate the evapotranspiration for a district the point evapotranspiration for each crop or crop group is multiplied by the area occupied by that crop or crop group ac i and the results summed to give the volume of evapotranspiration for the whole district etdv million cubic meters mcm 2 et cc dv i 1 nc et c i a c i where the subscript cc indicates that the evapotranspiration estimate is based on a crop coefficient calculation dv indicates that it is the district volumetric evapotranspiration i is the ith crop or crop group and nc is the number of crops and crop groups although eta is not etc as the latter can be higher eta is likely close to etc in northwest bangladesh ahmad et al 2014 because i in the wet season rainfall exceeds potential evapotranspiration ii for substantial parts of the dry season in recent years nearly half the landscape has been under irrigated rice and iii in much of the landscape and a greater fraction of the landscape in earlier years the water table is shallow and accessible to plant roots either directly or via capillary rise therefore etc will be used as eta in the remainder of this paper 3 2 trend analysis the seasonal non parametric mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 and the sen slope method to estimate rates of changes sen 1968 were used to investigate trends in observed data trends in water balance components were obtained by fitting a linear regression 3 3 district surface water balances a one dimensional surface water balance following a top down conceptualisation was computed for each of the 16 districts in the northwest the one dimensional water balance is similar to that of ahmad et al 2005 who demonstrated that a surface water can be used to assess the net groundwater use here the observed changes in groundwater levels are used together with observed rainfall and estimated evapotranspiration to estimate the overall water balance as follows 3 p et cc d v r o δ w ε 0 where p is rainfall ro is runoff δw is the change in water storage resulting from the surface water exchange and ε is an error a non zero residual if all other terms are known δw is equivalent to the combined change in storage in the soil δsw and the groundwater δgw the change in groundwater storage is the net result of downward movement of water as drainage below the root zone recharging the groundwater upward movement of water by capillary rise or direct access by roots and groundwater pumping for irrigation depleting the groundwater the change in storage of groundwater could also result from lateral inflows and outflows of water exchanging with the rivers but this is likely to be small relative to the one dimensional flows of groundwater there are few studies and few data with which to assess the magnitude of the lateral exchanges though they are likely to be small relative to the vertical exchanges with groundwater mainuddin et al 2014 therefore lateral exchanges are not assessed and recognise that any such exchanges appear in this approach either in the runoff term which may be considered as total runoff in the wet season or in the error term noting the change in groundwater storage is equal to the change in groundwater level δgwl multiplied by the aquifer specific yield sy eq 3 becomes 4 p et cc d v r o δ s w s y δ g w l ε 0 with the known rainfall eta and change in groundwater levels there remain three unknown quantities in eq 4 in addition to the error term runoff soil water storage and specific yield there are no data at the studied scale to constrain some of these fluxes and stores therefore some assumptions and calibration of parameters are necessary the following assumptions were then followed to resolve eq 4 as follows i the runoff was assumed to be zero during the dry season because of low rainfall this is generally acceptable as only 7 of rainfall occurs during the dry season and most of the landscape is comprised of agricultural land there are some exceptions impervious and ponded areas will produce runoff but this only occurs in a small fraction of the total area dey et al 2017 with this assumption any lateral flows into or out of the groundwater in the dry season will appear in the error term ii the groundwater is close to the surface throughout the year in most districts this was particularly the case in the earlier part of the considered period as shown in by the groundwater level data results section 4 2 furthermore much of the area in most districts is used to grow boro rice during the dry season this was particularly the case in more recent years it was therefore assumed that the change in soil water storage is likely to be small though the exact amount is unknown the implementation of the above assumptions required the water balance to be split into a dry season water balance to constrain some parameters which further allowed the estimation of the annual and wet season water balance as follows iii with runoff assumed to be zero the dry season water balance was computed with three settings for the change in water storage 0 mm 50 mm and 100 mm to test the model sensitivity to this parameter the water balance was also computed when the soil water storage was assumed to be greater with greater groundwater depth this generally led to an increase in the assumed soil water storage in later years with deeper groundwater the consequences of these assumptions will be discussed below and presented in more detail in the supplementary material section iv for each of the three dry season surface water balances the remaining unknown in eq 4 the specific yield term sy was calibrated as that which resulted in a zero for the sum of the error term for the three five year evaluation periods v the specific yields determined from the dry season calculation were used in the annual and wet season calculations in the annual calculation the soil water storage change was assumed to be zero since the soil is likely to return to approximately the same moisture content over an annual cycle in this highly seasonal environment in the wet season calculation the soil water storage change was assumed to be the opposite of that in the dry season following the above framework eq 4 was used to estimate the dry season annual and wet season surface water balances the water balance was determined for each of three evaluation periods 1985 1989 1998 2002 and 2011 2015 these periods were chosen to assess long term changes associated with the rapid expansion of irrigated areas as can be seen in fig 2 1985 1989 and 1998 2002 correspond to intervals of rapid irrigation expansion whereas 2011 2015 represents the current situation in which expansion is almost halted because of data availability a pre dry season irrigation development could not be evaluated in any case even as the two periods are transitional the long term averages for each period are monotonically increasing and the differences in area between the long term averages for each period are large fig 2 with 532 103 ha 1250 103 and 1605 103 ha for the three periods respectively therefore the results will reflect changed conditions as a result of an increase in irrigation expansion among other variables influencing the water balance rainfall and eta annual or seasonal as appropriate were averaged for each of the five year evaluation periods in the annual total calculation the observed change in groundwater was determined as the slope of a regression line fitted separately to the annual average groundwater in each of the five year evaluation periods in the dry season calculation the observed change in groundwater was determined as difference between the district average groundwater level at the end of the wet season and the level at the end of the dry season averaged for each of the five year evaluation periods the wet season calculation used the difference between groundwater level at the end of the dry season and that the end of the wet season 3 4 datasets 3 4 1 climate daily rainfall and climate datasets for 1985 to 2015 were acquired from the bangladesh meteorological department for the six stations shown in fig 1 the rainfall data comprise all the stations in the northwest region that can be accounted for in published sources e g mullick et al 2019 the station density is about 1 station per 5750 km2 considered adequate for land areas according to the standards outlined by the wmo 1985 which recommends at least 1 station per 25 000 km2 for climatological studies with an accuracy requirement of sampling error of less than 10 it is noted that the data temporal requirements in this paper predate routinely used satellite borne precipitation data for about 12 years e g trmm huffman et al 2007 the precipitation data was assigned to each of the 16 districts using a simple nearest neighbour method there was no attempt to spatially interpolate the data with more sophisticated algorithms e g bilinear interpolation due to i difficulties in obtaining daily rainfall data in neighbouring india ii other stations in bangladesh are located much further afield mullick et al 2019 and iii the potential edge smearing effects that these can cause on the interpolation accadia et al 2003 moreover precipitation is dominated by large scale weather patterns which occur at scales potentially 1000 km horizontal length shahid 2010 therefore the influence of convective precipitation on the nearest neighbour approach used to distribute rainfall amongst districts is less pervasive minimum and maximum temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate etc and etp for each of the stations through the ref et computer program allen 2011 the climate data inputs used to obtain etc and etp are less variable in time and space compared to rainfall and in turn less prone to causing the mentioned edge effects therefore etp was spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting to match the 500 m resolution of the remote sensing data see below inverse distance weighting was also used to obtain district average etc 3 4 2 remote sensing data monthly remotely sensed evi and gvmi composites from 500 m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis for the entire northwest region were obtained from google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 modis mod09ga nasa lp daac 2018 surface reflectance were used to produce a series of indices relevant for calculating monthly eta by selecting the average pixel value within the composite while minimising cloud cover and nulls monthly evis and gvmis were extracted from modis from 2000 to 2016 3 4 3 crop area and crop coefficient data crop area data were collected from agricultural statistics yearbooks and from the bangladesh bureau of statistics and disaggregated for the years prior to 2006 for which the data were recorded for the five earlier larger districts into the 16 districts of the later years the disaggregation was based on the equations outlined in the supplementary material section the results are shown in fig 2b the collated and disaggregated data are from 1985 to 2015 crop coefficients were taken from allen et al 1998 crop calendars were based on field observations carried on in six districts rajshahi bogra pabna rangpur dinajpur and thakurgaon during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 dry seasons mainuddin et al in preparation two or more crops per year are obtained from most arable land in bangladesh and so it was assumed crops were grown in rotation with short fallow periods in between as per the crop calendars since the northwest mostly has shallow water tables it was assumed that areas of non crop vegetation will evaporate at the potential rate i e etc etref in eq 1 3 4 4 groundwater level groundwater level data were obtained for more than 1200 wells from the bangladesh water development board the bangladesh water development board bwdb maintain an extensive groundwater monitoring database which contains time series water table depth recordings from more than 1200 wells across the country water table depth represents the depth from the ground surface to the water table at the well site as opposed to a groundwater elevation relative to mean seas level or some other datum monitoring data vary in terms of the length of time and frequency of sampling however many wells have data from the mid 1960s onwards measured weekly most wells have weekly data from at least the mid 1980s in the northwest region there are 454 wells with groundwater monitoring data between 1985 and 2016 these data have been compiled into a database and with obvious errors corrected hodgson et al 2014 to assess the water balance at the district level the database was queried to extract a monthly average groundwater depth for wells within the districts if all wells have weekly readings available then each monthly average will include 3 5 water table readings per well the number of wells used in each district varies between 4 in kurigram and 38 in dinajpur with a total of 350 being used here as reported in mohid et al 2019 these monthly averages for each district are only indicative of the general groundwater depth for the district and some districts have a large range of depths which have been averaged in areas such as the barind tract where there is higher elevation and an aquitard layer which semi confines the groundwater the depth to groundwater can be more than 20 m the districts containing these uplands also have lowland areas where the groundwater depth is shallow so the average depth will be less representative in these districts other districts have generally low elevation changes so average groundwater depths there will be more representative of the whole district for a district scale water balance this was deemed enough for the purpose used 4 results 4 1 evapotranspiration estimation monthly time series of both eta methods were visually compared from february 2000 to december 2015 a period in which both series overlapped the pearson s correlation coefficient r the mean percentage bias mpb and the root mean squared error rmse between remote sensing eta eta rs and crop coefficient eta eta crop were used to assess the differences in both estimates fig 3 shows the monthly time series volumetric mcm eta for the 16 districts in northwest bangladesh both time series are similar with correlation coefficients between 0 75 and 0 89 average of 0 86 the maximum difference between the monthly averages is 5 4 the absolute mpb is less than 5 in 14 districts and less the 10 in the remaining two kurigram and rangpur with no visible systematic under or overestimation the mean rmse for the entire period is between 19 7 and 73 4 mcm average of 41 mcm which is only about 2 of the mean annual eta for the period 2390 mcm two peaks in each year can be distinguished in both time series which roughly correspond to the peak boro rice season april and peak aman season september suggesting that constructed district crop factors capture the essential features of eta the two datasets will give similar results when used in a water balance calculation in the remainder of this paper unless otherwise indicated only the eta estimated by the crop coefficient modelling is considered since the results are available for the same period as other datasets from 1985 to 2015 4 2 trend analysis fig 4 shows the district wise time series of annual rainfall from january 1980 to december 2015 rainfall in all districts is declining with annual trends varying from 3 1 mm to 34 5 mm per year the average trend is 16 6 mm per year most districts to the north e g thakurgaon lalmonirhat panchagarh kurigram but not nilphamari nor gaibandha have statistically significant declines of 20 mm per year or more most districts to the south have significant declines declines of more than 15 mm per year e g nawabganj rangpur pabna and joypurhat except rajshahi pabna and nawabganj where the declines are less than 10 mm per year and are non statistically significant fig 5 shows the time series of annual eta from january 1980 to december 2015 satellite eta from 2001 onwards eta in 12 out of the 16 districts is increasing with annual trends varying from 5 7 mm to 7 5 mm per year the average trend is 1 8 mm per year districts with statistically significant increases of more than 6 mm per year include lalmonirhat nilphamari and kurigram in the north and rangpur in the south small increases of less than 2 mm per year are estimated in dinajpur panchagarh in the north and rajshahi nature and naogaon in the south only sirajgang has significant declining eta of 5 7 mm per year whereas nawabgang bogra and thakurgaon have non statistically significant declines of 3 3 1 3 and 1 3 mm per year respectively fig 6 shows the time series of annual groundwater level from january 1980 to december 2015 groundwater level is significantly declining in the 16 districts with annual trends varying from 0 01 m to 0 24 m per year the average trend is 0 08 m per year the largest declines are to the south where the districts of naogaon rajshahi and nawabganj have declines larger than 0 2 m per year all declines are statistically significant at the 90 significance level the monthly data also shows a decline in the intra annual seasonality recharge discharge cycles in some of the most affected districts this is particularly visible in joypurhat naogaon and nawabganj 4 3 district surface water balances a summary of trends of the water balance component for the 16 districts in northwest bangladesh and key boro rice data are shown in table 2 the one dimensional vertical exchange of water approach used in the district water balance was tested by comparing the pearson s correlation coefficient between district monthly rainfall and observed monthly change in groundwater level the correlation varied between 0 53 and 0 81 there was high correlation r 0 7 in 10 out of the 16 districts the time series comparisons are shown in the supplementary material section this result suggests that the groundwater behaviour and the water balance overall is largely dominated by one dimensional vertical exchange of water the annual surface water balances for the 16 districts determined using eqs 3 and 4 are shown in fig 7 and the associated changes with respect to water balance fluxes are summarised in table 3 the declines in rainfall from 1985 1989 to 2011 2015 are clear fig 7 the average annual rainfall for the three periods is 2200 mm 1985 1989 2068 mm 1998 2002 and 1606 mm 2011 2015 compared to 1985 1989 rainfall is generally lower in the districts located in the north lalmonirhat joypurhat panchagarh during the 1998 2002 evaluation period and also generally higher in the districts in the south natore pabana rajshahi during this period table 3 the evapotranspiration is similar across the five year evaluation periods with the period 1998 2002 being on average higher and higher for every district at 1140 mm compared to 1022 mm and 1005 mm for 1985 1989 and 2011 2015 respectively there are increases and declines during the 2011 2015 period consistent with the trends reported at the district level the changes in groundwater storage are small relative to the other terms so the declines in rainfall mostly result in a reduction in runoff with runoff being on average 1181 mm 1985 1989 932 mm 1998 2002 and 603 mm 2011 2015 the groundwater storage generally decreases positive values in fig 7 more so for the southern districts and for the 1998 2002 period although there are declines over the whole period from 1985 to 2015 the groundwater storage increases negative values in fig 7 in some districts in some 5 year periods particularly in the north there are also some districts increasing in the south for the 2011 2015 period the dry season and wet season surface water balances are shown in figs 8 and 9 for the case of assumed seasonal soil water storage change of 100 mm the dry season surface water balance assumed a change in soil water storage from the start to the end of the dry season that varies amongst the three five year periods as a function of dry season maximum groundwater depth averaged over each of the five year periods runoff was also assumed to be zero therefore it is not shown in fig 8 the lowest values in average dry season rainfall generally occur in the last evaluation period 2011 2015 whereas rainfall is similar for 1985 1989 and 1998 2002 the average dry season rainfall for the three periods is 166 mm 1985 1989 182 mm 1998 2002 and 130 mm 2011 2015 respectively the declines are higher in the northern districts panchagarh thakurgaon dinajpur and nilphamari and there are some increases in the south e g nawabganj evapotranspiration is similar across the five year evaluation periods with the period 1998 2002 being on average higher at 460 mm compared to 366 mm and 400 mm for 1985 1989 and 2011 2015 respectively decreases in groundwater storages are higher in the southern and central districts nawabganj rajshahi bogra joypurhat for the 1998 2002 period the errors in the dry season water balance calculation are generally small relative to the rainfall and eta in most cases they are smaller also than the calculated changes in groundwater storage the exceptions are the first and third five year periods in nilpharmari during which the error is greater than the calculated change in storage the computed specific yields for assumed soil water changes of zero and 50 mm and corresponding dry season water balances are shown in the supplementary material section for these assumptions the calculated changes in groundwater storage are correspondingly larger and the error terms are smaller relative to the groundwater change rainfall values for the wet season are generally lower in both the 1998 2002 and 2011 2015 evaluation periods compared to 1985 1989 fig 9 the average wet season rainfall for the three periods is 2030 mm 1985 1989 1773 mm 1998 2002 and 1479 mm 2011 2015 the largest declines are generally in the northern districts panchagarh thakurgaon joypurhat and kurigram with declines greater than 30 southern districts nawabganj rajshahi naogaon natore and pabna also had large declines of around 20 eta is similar across the five year evaluation periods generally slightly increasing in the 1998 2002 evaluation period and generally slightly decreasing in the 2011 2015 evaluation period except for some declines in districts in the south nawabganj rajshahi natore pabna the period 1998 2002 had on average higher eta at 694 mm compared to 661 mm and 609 mm for 1985 1989 and 2011 2015 respectively increase in groundwater storages are generally higher in the southern and central districts because of less runoff than in the northern districts where on average more rainfall ends up as runoff runoff was on average 1226 mm 1985 1989 909 mm 1998 2002 and 753 mm 2011 2015 5 discussion 5 1 evapotranspiration estimation two methods to estimate monthly eta were implemented and compared in 16 districts in northwest bangladesh the first method readily captures irrigation dynamics through the estimation of a crop coefficient based on satellite vegetation indices at 500 m spatial resolution the second method used a crop coefficient approach based on survey data of crop areas the results of the satellite data method and the crop coefficient approach method were comparable in magnitude seasonal and inter annual variability whilst the former is relatively straightforward to implement it is limited by the availability of satellite data before the 2000 s as pre 2000 satellite data are of coarser spatial and temporal resolution gowda et al 2008 this also limits the useability of longer term data to analyse hydrologic variables that require continuity for example the water balance and trends in fluxes and stores the second method relies on main crop statistics which have been collected systematically since 1969 bangladesh bureau of statistics 2018 careful consideration of crop patterns and crop intensity were inferred from crop statistics data and elicited expert knowledge at the district level to reduce errors in data and interpretation see the supplementary material section this detailed knowledge of historical and current irrigation practices was used to understand the retrospective dynamics in irrigated agriculture and thus reducing one of the main sources of uncertainty in water balance modelling hoff et al 2010 wada et al 2011 wisser et al 2008 the reasonable agreement between the two estimates which are also the first detailed eta estimates for the region increases the confidence in the ability of a water balance model to accurately describe long term changes associated with the expansion of irrigation both methods showed that despite the overall large areal increases in irrigated boro rice other dry season crops e g maize there was no evident commensurate increase in eta this suggests that the alternative land uses i e dry season non rice crops or natural vegetation replaced by boro had similar eta to that of dry season crops in the crop model it was assumed that non crop areas had an eta equal to etref which is a reasonable assumption for northwest bangladesh where roots have access to soil water or there is water readily available due to capillary rise from shallow groundwater pierret et al 2016 also crop sequencing in the crop coefficient model introduced fallow periods during which eta is much less than etref the remote sensing model intrinsically captures these dynamics and other possible land use changes that may have compensated the increase in eta by a concurrent reduction of other land types with high eta as a result of irrigation areal expansion dey et al 2017 used landsat images to conclude that a third of the wetland area about 250 km2 changed to other land uses in northwest bangladesh over the last two decades the reduction in river levels reported by dey et al 2017 may have reduced eta from the rivers themselves or from riparian vegetation in addition increased urbanization with an associated reduction in eta may have also played a minor role with a 5 increase in built up areas from 1990 to 2010 mustafa et al 2017 these were not assessed in the present paper but can be further investigated by exploring the remote sensing eta and the associated vegetation indices 5 2 trend analysis rainfall trends showed distinct patterns with most districts in the north except for gaibandha and nilphamari showing large statistically significant declines of 20 mm per year or more most districts in the south have statistically significant declines of more than 10 mm per year except for rajshahi nawabganj and pabna all with non significant declines of less than 10 mm per year these results are in agreement with those of dey et al 2017 however there are reported interdecadal variations in the south asian monsoon with epochs below and above mean precipitations at the broad scale of 30 years krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 reported time series of precipitation anomalies for selected indian stations showing below normal conditions during 1959 to 1988 and above normal conditions during 1989 to 1998 their analyses ended in 1998 it is possible that a similar phenomenon affects rainfall in bangladesh for example mullick et al 2019 did not show significant rainfall trends during the monsoon in northwest bangladesh for the last 50 years 1966 2015 period encompassing both below and above average conditions according to krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 there were no readily apparent spatial patterns for eta trends when aggregated at the district level some districts in the south that had large area increases in boro rice table 1 also had concurrent eta declines e g bogra with 1 3 mm y and sirajgang with 5 7 mm y whereas others had increases e g rangpur with 6 1 mm y and joypurhat with 3 9 mm y groundwater level trends showed clearer patterns with districts to the north rangpur lalmornihat panchagarh nilphamari and thaukargaon showing lower declines average of 0 03 m y and districts to the south showing larger average of 0 11 m y declines it is noted that in districts with larger 0 06 m y groundwater level declines in the south not all show significant declines 10 mm y in rainfall and some have decreased eta trends e g bogra districts to the south with a large proportion of slow soil permeability fig 2 had the largest declines in groundwater levels nawabgang rajshahi naogaon joypurhat natore and bogra some of these districts also have the highest proportions of deep tube well irrigation shamsudduha et al 2011 whilst the natural slope suggests slow groundwater discharge into the padma river dey et al 2017 the barind tract area located within rajshahi and naogaon has been highlighted in numerous studies as having unsustainable groundwater use see kirby et al 2015 and references therein results here extend this assessment to some the neighbouring districts emphasizing that rainfall decline and groundwater use to a lesser degree seems the main cause of the groundwater level declines at least in nawabgang naogaon bogra and natore conversely districts to the north thaukargaon lalmornihat panchagarh kurigram and joypurhat have the largest declines in rainfall mostly increases in et a slight decrease in thaukargaon and the lowest declines in groundwater level these districts have had large increases of irrigated boro rice area in some cases as much as in districts to the south and boro rice covers on average 45 of the area like districts to the south districts to the north have larger proportions of moderate soil permeability fig 2 and about 30 more rainfall than in the south and the natural slope suggests flow into the groundwater system from the jamuna and teesta rivers dey et al 2017 5 3 district surface water balance the et a estimates provided here are the first time series water balances for the region at the district scale previous studies of groundwater sustainability such as that of dey et al 2017 have generally interpreted sustainability from groundwater trends rather than from a water balance the district surface water balance conceptualised using a top down approach has been implemented using plausible assumptions about the changes in soil water storage the assumptions about soil water storage change outlined in section 3 2 lead to similar results see the supplementary material section the variable soil water storage is probably the most plausible assumption but has only slightly lower overall errors than the 50 mm or 100 mm assumption the assumption of one dimensional flow dominating the water exchange in the water balance follows from the strong correlation between rainfall and change in groundwater table fig s1 and is also suggested by michael and voss 2009 the calculated specific yields resulting from the assumptions fig s2 are of the same order of those in areas of shallow water tables gillham 1984 the approach adopted to conceptualise the surface water balance has required simplifications of complex hydrological processes at smaller scales that have proved sufficiently robust at describing the observations made at larger scales it was deemed unnecessary to increase the complexity in the model to address the hypotheses about the processes underlying this hydrological system for example additional assumptions and input parameters required to explain lateral flow require more observations and further calibration there are few data or studies of additional processes such as lateral groundwater exchanges with rivers mainuddin et al 2014 though they are thought to be small in the absence of constraining observations additional processes may result in more than one parameter set with similar explanatory value oreskes et al 1994 and thus a model suffering from structural equivalence or equifinality beven 2006 rainfall and et a dominate the water balance et a is similar around 1100 mm across districts although rainfall declined from 1985 to 2015 et a generally remained about the same annually runoff is approximately equal to the difference in rainfall and et a with some recharge to groundwater and varies from about 300 mm to about 1900 mm and is mostly determined by the variation in rain amongst the districts because of the decline in rainfall runoff declined in all districts from 1985 to 2015 annually the change in groundwater storage is small but the decrease in the dry season and increase in the wet is a larger part of the seasonal water balance the five districts with the largest and most obvious groundwater level declines bogra joypurhat naogaon nawabganj natore and rajshahi have greater declines in groundwater storage from about 2005 onwards fig 6 and table 2 this is consistent with a decline of groundwater storage reported by khaki et al 2018 in northwest bangladesh in an assessment that used a global hydrological model and assimilated terrestrial water storage tws data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission the 2011 2015 change in wet season and dry season storages for these five districts are all smaller than in 1998 2002 figs 8 and 9 in other words both the groundwater extraction and the groundwater recharge may have reduced from 1998 2002 to 2011 2015 note that the groundwater extraction comprises pumping for irrigation and extraction by roots which is re supplied by capillary rise from shallow groundwater tables a reduction in total extraction does not necessarily imply that pumping was reduced this reduction can be seen in the monthly groundwater levels fig 6 after about 2005 as the groundwater levels fell in these districts the difference between the maximum and minimum groundwater reduced the reduced groundwater extraction and recharge noted above are consistent with the explanation that with greater depth to groundwater more of the water storage change occurs in the soil and not in the groundwater thus with deeper groundwater in later years much of the landscape supply of water is by soil water storage depletion rather than by groundwater depletion with declining rainfall the soil water storage will be fully recharged later in the year and for a shorter period thus limiting the period of deep drainage from the soil and reducing the potential for groundwater recharge more so in areas where soil infiltrabilities are moderate to slow there are potentially others factor limiting the deep drainage from the soil and hence the groundwater recharge neumann et al 2009 showed that puddling i e traditional practice in preparation for growing transplanted rice substantially reduces the deep drainage of water while the un puddled bunds between rice fields remain much more transmissive as more and more of the landscape has been put under boro cultivation fig 2 an ever increasing area is puddled every dry season amounting to between 45 and 47 percent of the landscape from 2007 to 8 onwards the area of boro rice in recent years is greater than the area of aus that it mostly replaced thus a greater part of the landscape will be affected by dry season puddling in recent years than was the case in 1985 this explanation can be tested with further remote sensing analysis van niel and mcvicar 2004 6 conclusion groundwater demand has substantially increased in northwest bangladesh with the adoption of dry season boro rice and other dry season crops concurrent declines in rainfall surface water and groundwater levels are a reason of concern regarding the sustainability of groundwater resources this echoes a pervasive global problem also dubbed the silent drought the mining of groundwater underlying many of the world food bowls the methods described in this paper allowed i the assessment of trends of the two most important terms of the two hydrologic cycle in northwest bangladesh rainfall and evapotranspiration and ii the estimation of the surface water balance for the 16 districts in northwest bangladesh and their relationship with declining groundwater levels and expansion of dry season boro rice the district level surface water balances are the first of their kind in the entire northwest bangladesh and provide a framework to analyse the regional availability of water its use the causes for the observed declines in groundwater levels and the implications for farmers policymakers and other stakeholders of these declines this knowledge is essential for the management of river systems and aquifers particularly in areas experiencing climate variability and where water limitation becomes a major constraint to irrigation several factors have led to declining groundwater levels reduced rainfall increased groundwater use declining deep drainage contributing to groundwater recharge an associated increase in soil water storage and vegetation use of soil water the southern districts of the region with slow draining soils and prevalence of deep tube well irrigation technology have experienced the largest declines resulting in likely unsustainable groundwater use conversely the northern districts of the region have experienced moderate declines in groundwater levels despite of recording the largest declines in rainfall and increases in evapotranspiration moderate draining soils contribute to recharge in these districts which have on average about 30 more rainfall than districts in the south annual average of 2200 mm in the north and 1500 mm in the south therefore there are no reasons for immediate concern regarding groundwater sustainability in the districts to the north of northwest bangladesh given the various factors outlined that have contributed to groundwater decline a single policy or management change such as increased use of surface water for irrigation may alone be inadequate to reverse groundwater trends in the areas with serious groundwater decline where deep drainage has become more limited e g through changes in soil percolation and infiltration rates increased irrigation might lead to more runoff rather than more deep drainage and groundwater recharge groundwater levels will recover only if the recharge is increased sufficiently to overcome all groundwater losses including any baseflow losses to the rivers which may be increased due to the rivers flowing now at lower levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
