13985,adsorption by powdered activated carbon pac is an efficient method for dye removal from wastewater but the factors that influence it remain unclear in our work seven pacs having high performance of removal reactive blue 81 rb 81 were screened among fourteen pacs and three pacs showed better removal efficiency after modified with calcium the adsorption kinetics of selected six pacs except pac14 and modified pacs with calcium well fitted to pseudo second order the isotherms of the screened pacs excluding pac12 and pac13 were well described by langmuir mode dominated by monolayer adsorption the correlation analysis indicated that contents of carbon oxygen and chlorine as well as iodine number and methylene blue adsorption value of seven pacs were irrelevant to the adsorption capacity bet surface area and total pore volume moderately correlated with absorption capacity sulphur s and calcium ca content of pacs were significantly linear with the absorption capacity of pacs the s and ca elements in pac had a crucial role in rb 81 adsorption which can be taken as the priority indicators during the selection and optimization of pac for rb 81 adsorption this study provides

adsorption monolayer adsorption 1 introduction printing and dyeing wastewater originates from various critical human activities including the leather paper and textile industries dyeing effluents are challenging to treat because of their high chroma high organic content complex composition and poor biodegradability 1 they are becoming a serious environmental issue with increasing emissions and low recovery efficiencies and the presence of numerous hazardous chemicals that negatively impact living organisms and disturb ecosystems 2 azo dyes are particularly concerning which constitute more than

cost wide availability fast kinetics and considerable adsorption capacity pac can be prepared by physical or chemical activation from sources that contain carbonaceous material including coal wood and bamboo 8 the diversity of raw materials and preparation procedures originate pacs with different physicochemical properties and adsorptive capacity 10 11 hence it is important to determine the ideal

of pollutants larger specific surface area and wider pore distribution are beneficial to improve the adsorption 14 15 while others stated that textural properties of the activated carbons could not explain the disparity in dyes adsorption 16 previous research showed that functional groups on the surface of pac also play an important role 16 17 the acid oxygen containing surface groups had a positive effect on the adsorption for the basic dye and higher surface basicity of pac attributed to a higher adsorption performance for reactive and acid dyes 16 oxygen containing surface groups of

properties and adsorption capacity we characterized the top performing pacs with sem n2 physisorption ftir i number mb value and boehm titration furthermore we analyzed modified pacs and concluded that calcium plays a critical role in the removal of rb 81 by pac adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fourteen different pacs were from commercial products see table s1 rb 81 structure can be seen in fig s1 was purchased from xingtai wenyuan dyestuff co ltd pac6 pac13 and pac14 were modified according to reference methods with the following changes 5 g of the pac were added to 500

spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 256 nm after filtration with double filter paper and a 0 45 μm filter the removal percentage and adsorption capacity of rb 81 by pacs were calculated with the

and ftir the sem images were obtained with a su8000 scanning electron microscope the n2 adsorption desorption measurements were carried out with a micromeritics asap 2010 system at 77 k and use bet to calculate the specific surface area the ftir spectra of samples ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 were obtained using a ftir spectrophotometer nicolet 8700 ftir spectrometer in kbr pellets x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was recorded with a k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer escalab 250xi thermo i number was determined using the sodium thiosulfate volumetric method according to the procedure of standard gb t 3780 1 2015 and mb value was determined following the method of standard gb t 12496 10 1999 the quantity of acidic and basic groups present in the pacs was determined according to the boehm method 21 2 4 adsorption models the adsorption kinetics of rb 81 onto pacs were investigated using pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetics model 22 as

3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiency of rb 81 removal by different pacs we investigated the efficiency of rb 81 removal by fourteen pacs at two dosages 0 2 g l and 0 4 g l fig 1 most of pacs had high removal efficiencies at 0 4 g l higher than 90 except pac5 pac7 pac8 and pac10 at 0 2 g l pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 pac13 and pac14 showed top performing reaching 60 of rb 81 removal in addition pac6 pac13 and pac14 were all supplemented with three concentrations of ca no3 2 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m and labelled as a b c for each modified pac respectively the addition of calcium improved the capacity of the pacs to adsorb rb 81 in all modified versions fig 2 pac6 with 0 6 m pac6c pac13 with 0 2 m pac13a pac14 with 0 4 m pac14b had first rate rb 81 removal efficiencies pac6c reached 80 16 at 0 2 and 96 at 0 4 g l fig 2a pac13a removed 94 and 93 28 of rb 81 for the two same dosage of pacs fig 2b pac14b increased to 86 13 and 95 87 respectively fig 2c above three pacs that modified with calcium showed better removal efficiency which proved calcium playing vital role in pacs for removing rb81 thus we selected those top performing pacs including modified pacs for further analysis 3 2 characterization of pac physicochemical parameters to better understand the characteristics of pac that are conductive for good adsorption we investigated several physicochemical parameters by sem edx n2 physisorption ftir and boehm titration analysis of pac morphology by sem showed that pac 13 and pac 14 have smoother surfaces and larger particle sizes than the rest fig s2 almost all particle sizes are below 20 μm the relative element contents determined by edx revealed that the carbon content ranged between 79 82 pac6 and 94 43 pac1 fig 3 a the maximum oxygen content was 16 07 in pac6 and the minimum was 5 18 for pac1 while the oxygen content increased and carbon content decreased in modified three pacs fig 3a the oligoelements present in the pacs were sulfur s chlorine cl and calcium ca fig 3b calcium element in pac12 and chlorine elements in pac6 had variable distribution which respectively showed 1 2 and 0 7 in only one out of 6 checking points pac1 pac2 and pac3 are rich in calcium content for 0 34 1 65 and 1 14 after modified with calcium there was an increase in calcium content of 0 23 and 0 26 for pac13a and pac14b previously which were origin from pac13 of 0 and pac14 of 0 05 and pac6c had a great increase in calcium content to 6 49 from pac6 of 0 besides sulfur disappeared after calcination fig 3b we also investigated the chemical states of calcium in the three modified pacs by xps fig 4 calcium had doublet in the 2 p spectrum the energy peaks of the 3p3 2 appeared at 347 9 347 6 and 347 4 ev for pac6c pac13a and pac14b the binding energy of 3p1 2 peaks located at 351 3 351 3 and 351 1 ev the binding energy difference between ca2p3 2 and ca2p1 2 was 3 4 3 7 and 3 7 ev each these values agree well with those of caco3 25 we calculated the pac surface area pore volume and pore size using the n2 adsorption and desorption technique based on the brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh models fig 5 the bet surface area of pac1 pac12 pac13 and pac14 was 1022 62 1395 12 1261 71 and 1168 98 cm2 g respectively while pac2 pac3 and pac6 had 697 16 709 91 and 656 27 cm2 g fig 5a micropore area accounted for close to 50 of the total surface for all but pac3 and pac6 which had 223 12 cm2 g and 201 58 cm2 g respectively fig 5a the total pore volume was 1 13 cm3 g for pac13 and 1 07 cm3 g for pac14 while micropore volume was of 0 29 and 0 27 cm3 g respectively pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 and pac12 had lower total pore volume ranging from 0 45 to 0 86 cm3 g fig 5b micropore volume coincided with the nature of the micropore area with values falling in the 0 18 0 33 cm3 g range except for pac3 0 1 cm3 g and pac6 0 09 cm3 g the average pore width was between 3 45 and 3 65 nm for all pacs fig 5b furthermore surface area pore volume and pore size had a great change after modification this was particularly true for pac6a with its total surface area doubled 1223 84 cm2 g micropore area tripled 663 42 cm2 g external area increased 560 41 cm2 g and total pore volume and micropore volume also expanded to 1 08 cm3 g and 0 3 cm3 g fig 5a pore size decreased slightly fig 5b pac13a and pac14b also had a slight increase in these parameters these data showed that the tested pacs were mesopore based with abundant micropores i number and mb value which estimate pac microporosity and mesoporosity confirmed the micropore and bet surface area results 26 27 pac1 pac12 pac13 and pac14 had higher i number over 860 mg g and mb value over 200 mg g while for pac2 pac3 and pac6 they were below 750 mg g and 200 mg g furthermore the i number increased to 878 01 912 31 and 1107 35 mg g for pac6c pac13a and pac14b and the mb value to 241 13 258 77 and 266 31 mg g respectively fig 5c n2 physisorption isotherm plots further confirmed pac adsorption behavior fig 6 according to the iupac classification of adsorption isotherms all tested pacs belong to the type iv which was associated with capillary condensation in mesopores and the limiting uptake over a range of high p po the initial part of the type iv isotherm was attributed to monolayer multilayer adsorption since it relied on multilayer adsorption with the same path as the corresponding part of a type ii isotherm 28 the difference was that pac1 pac2 pac3 and pac12 had a h 4 hysteresis loop while a h 3 was present in pac6 pac13 and pac14 the pore size distribution psd plot confirmed these results fig s3 all tested pacs were mesoporous 2 50 nm pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 had similar psd with a single peak at 3 5 nm while pac13 and pac14 had bimodal pore distribution with peaks at 3 5 and 8 nm the type of n2 physisorption isotherm plots among modified pacs did not changed while the nitrogen adsorption amounts increased especially in pac6c fig 6 the psd of modified pacs kept the same trend as pore volume and the peak in 8 0 nm was more obvious but micropore distribution at 3 5 nm decreased especially in pac6c fig s3 this also demonstrated that calcium was effectively added to pacs 19 there was great variation in the ftir spectra of the different pacs fig s4 pac1 pac2 and pac3 had similar features as did pac13 and pac14 the peak around 3000 3600 cm 1 in pac6 and pac12 demonstrated the existence of oh bonds the peaks located at 2260 2125 and 1700 1900 cm 1 in pac1 pac2 pac3 and pac12 can be attributed to the cch and co bonds these peaks were weak in pac6 and pac13 and absent in pac14 the co and oco bonds likely correspond to the peaks at 1000 1200 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 in pac3 pac6 pac13 pac12 and pac14 29 new brands in the ftir spectra only appeared for pac6c the two new peaks were at 1200 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 which implied the presence of co and oco bonds fig s4 the intensity of the two bands also slightly increased in pac13a and pac14b as did one at 3500 cm 1 corresponding to oh 30 31 these changes revealed a dissociation of the adsorbed water in the presence of calcium 19 boehm titration also provided information on the functional groups present in the analyzed pacs table 1 the presence of acidic and basic groups on pac surface corroborates the data obtained with the ftir spectra pac12 pac13 and pac14 had greater amounts of phenolic groups while pac1 pac2 and pac3 had similar quantities the analyses of the quantities of carboxylic groups revealed a similar trend lactonic groups were more abundant in pac6 and pac12 as seen with the ftir spectra all tested pacs had a more acidic than basic groups except pac6 in which the abundances were similar 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption equilibrium time is one of the essential factors for estimating the removal efficiency of a substance 32 the adsorption equilibrium times at 0 4 g l were 60 90 45 120 and 45 min for pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 and pac14 respectively and their corresponding adsorption capabilities qt was 120 89 122 11 114 41 121 2 and 123 9 mg g fig 7 pac12 and pac13 had longer equilibrium time 360 and 300 min respectively with maximum adsorption capacities of 98 55 and 117 24 mg g fig 7 all the top pacs reached the adsorption equilibrium within 360 min for the pacs modified with calcium adsorption capacity hardly changed while adsorption equilibrium time shorten to 60 min excepting pac6 prolonged to 150 min it is implied pac that modified with calcium probably ameliorate adsorption equilibrium pfo and pso kinetic models are applied for further understanding the adsorption process and the statistical parameters of two adsorption kinetic models are shown in table 2 and fig 7 the pso model showed good fitting for pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 and pac13 according to relatively high r2 and low χ2 these results probably revealed that active sites were abound in those pacs and adsorption process was largely controlled by chemisorption 33 34 while three modified pacs and pac 14 fitted well to pfo model according to r2 and χ2 3 4 adsorption isotherms langmuir and freundlich isotherms are commonly used to describe the adsorption process of azo dyes in wastewater treatment 35 here we also used these two models fig 8 and the parameters of two models are summarized in table 3 the langmuir model produced higher r2 for pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac14 and modified pacs the langmuir dimensionless equilibrium parameter rl was greater than 0 but less than 1 which also showed favorable monolayer adsorption 35 pac12 and pac13 was better fitted to freundlich isotherm demonstrating adsorption process was controlled by multilayer adsorption 35 3 5 effect of ph and ionic factors on rb 81 removal by pacs the ph of a dye solution is a critical factor that influences the adsorption capacity by pacs 32 we investigated the effect of ph values ranging from 2 to 9 in rb 81 adsorption by the seven top performance pacs with 0 4 g l fig 9 the removal efficiency increased with the decrease of the ph of the dye solution at ph 2 the removal efficiency was at its highest for all tested pacs reaching almost 99 this phenomenon was likely due to the ionization suppression of the sulfonic acid group of rb 81 in the acidic solution which increased its hydrophobicity making it more apt to be adsorbed 36 37 additionally the chlorine substituents on rb 81 were negatively charged at acidic conditions and had electrostatic interactions with positively charged substances including the calcium ion on the pac surface which was also available for adsorption we also analyzed the impact of the ionic composition of the solution on pac performance at 0 2 g l pac fig 9 the rb 81 removal efficiency ranged between 60 and 75 in the absence of ionic substances with the addition of 0 02 m of nacl the removal efficiency increased to 84 15 86 84 94 88 and 96 44 in pac1 pac2 pac3 pac13 respectively and reached the adsorption equilibrium or maximum with 0 06 m and 0 01 m of nacl in the solution the removal efficiency reached adsorption equilibrium or maximum at 99 and 98 01 respectively in pac6 and pac14 while the concentration of nacl had a slight effect on pac12 the removal efficiency only reached 81 13 with 0 14 m nacl cacl2 had a more positive effect on pac adsorption efficiency than nacl the removal efficiency reached 99 for all but pac12 97 with cacl2 concentrations of 0 01 m for pac13 and pac14 0 02 m for pac3 0 04 m for pac12 and 0 06 m for pac1 pac2 and pac6 the slight formation of aggregates observed overnight in the solution containing cacl2 helped reduce the rb 81 concentration in the final filtrate this phenomenon of aggregation could be due to the influence of the ionic types and their strength on the surface potential of the adsorbate which reduced electric repulsion 38 the cations present likely provided additional shielding to the charged surface of rb 81 enhancing the interaction between rb 81 and pacs by reducing repulsion forces 19 3 6 correlation between pac parameters and adsorption capacity in order to eliminate the random interference caused by the lack of representative samples fourteen kinds of commercial pacs were screened seven of which exhibiting good performance were characterized with eighteen physicochemical indexes we correlated the pac characteristics indexes with adsorption capacity qm table 4 fig 5s the correlation of determination r2 between the adsorption capacity and i number and mb was low 0 2014 and 0 1846 respectively which implied that these indexes were inferior relevance with qm there was a barren correlation involving the amount of total basic total acidic carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups regarding the bet surface area the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 3409 indicating low correlation with qm the external surface area had a higher correlation than the micropore area which implied that adsorption react more frequently in the surface layer no significant correlation could be observed between adsorption capacity and pore properties of total pore volume micropore volume and average pore width see table 4 for element correlation analysis pac12 and pac6 was discarded in chloride and calcium data due to the maldistribution carbon is the primary substance in pac and the c content had only a faint correlation with qm the contents of oxygen and chlorine had weak correlation with the adsorption capacity interestingly s and ca content linearly correlated with the absorption capacity with the r2 of 0 78 for s and 0 9398 for ca additionally pearson correlation coefficient showed a positive correlation closed to 1 see table 4 above results of element correlation analysis elucidated that ca element displayed a vital role in rb 81 adsorption adsorbents and adsorbates characteristics determine the adsorption mechanism 39 and various physicochemical properties of pac result in different adsorptive capacities if the properties of adsorbent or adsorbate change the relationship of key parameters of adsorbent properties and adsorption capacity will change accordingly 9 18 34 thus the best choice should be based on the knowledge of the optimal physical and chemical properties of the pac 18 in our work those physicochemical indexes such as i number and mb value textural properties including specific surface area and pore distribution functional groups showed no significant correlation with adsorption capacity the results were also reported by other studies 13 16 18 few works have studied the influence of elements of pac on the adsorption of dyes and mineral salts were often applied to increase element content of adsorbent for improving adsorption capacity 20 21 29 the calcium element showed a strong relationship with adsorption capacity in our research and modified pacs with calcium showed better adsorption ability rb 81 is a kind of cationic dye that contain sulfonic group so3 it is probably adsorbed by calcium enriched pacs with electrostatic interaction this is great possible for popularization and application in the treatment of azo dye pollutants 4 conclusion we investigated the rb 81 removal efficiency by fourteen kinds of pacs and seven pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 pac13 and pac14 with a high adsorption performance were characterized the adsorption kinetics of selected six pacs except pac14 and modified pacs with calcium well fitted to pseudo second order the isotherms of the screened pacs excluding pac2 and pac3 were well described by langmuir mode dominated by monolayer adsorption the high linear correlation between the qm of the langmuir model and the physicochemical properties of seven pacs suggested that the presence of calcium element improve adsorption efficiency three modified pacs that showed higher removal efficiency and shorter equilibrium time further confirmed this observation further probing on the factors that influence adsorption showed that an acidic medium and the presence of nacl cacl2 in the dye solution improve rb 81 removal declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of

qcal mg g is the experimental and calculated amount of rb 81 adsorption on pacs respectively qmean mg g is the mean experimental data n and p is the number of dataset and model parameters respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiency of rb 81 removal by different pacs we investigated the efficiency of rb 81 removal by fourteen pacs at two dosages 0 2 g l and 0 4 g l fig 1 most of pacs had high removal efficiencies at 0 4 g l higher than 90 except pac5 pac7 pac8 and pac10 at 0 2 g l pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 pac13 and pac14 showed top performing reaching 60 of rb 81 removal in addition pac6 pac13 and pac14 were all supplemented with three concentrations of ca no3 2 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m and labelled as a b c for each modified pac respectively the addition of calcium improved the capacity of the pacs to adsorb rb 81 in all modified versions fig 2 pac6 with 0 6 m pac6c pac13 with 0 2 m pac13a pac14 with 0 4 m pac14b had first rate rb 81 removal efficiencies pac6c reached 80 16 at 0 2 and 96 at 0 4 g l fig 2a pac13a removed 94 and 93 28 of rb 81 for the two same dosage of pacs fig 2b pac14b increased to 86 13 and 95 87 respectively fig 2c above three pacs that modified with calcium showed better removal efficiency which proved calcium playing vital role in pacs for removing rb81 thus we selected those top performing pacs including modified pacs for further analysis 3 2 characterization of pac physicochemical parameters to better understand the characteristics of pac that are conductive for good adsorption we investigated several physicochemical parameters by sem edx n2 physisorption ftir and boehm titration analysis of pac morphology by sem showed that pac 13 and pac 14 have smoother surfaces and larger particle sizes than the rest fig s2 almost all particle sizes are below 20 μm the relative element contents determined by edx revealed that the carbon content ranged between 79 82 pac6 and 94 43 pac1 fig 3 a the maximum oxygen content was 16 07 in pac6 and the minimum was 5 18 for pac1 while the oxygen content increased and carbon content decreased in modified three pacs fig 3a the oligoelements present in the pacs were sulfur s chlorine cl and calcium ca fig 3b calcium element in pac12 and chlorine elements in pac6 had variable distribution which respectively showed 1 2 and 0 7 in only one out of 6 checking points pac1 pac2 and pac3 are rich in calcium content for 0 34 1 65 and 1 14 after modified with calcium there was an increase in calcium content of 0 23 and 0 26 for pac13a and pac14b previously which were origin from pac13 of 0 and pac14 of 0 05 and pac6c had a great increase in calcium content to 6 49 from pac6 of 0 besides sulfur disappeared after calcination fig 3b we also investigated the chemical states of calcium in the three modified pacs by xps fig 4 calcium had doublet in the 2 p spectrum the energy peaks of the 3p3 2 appeared at 347 9 347 6 and 347 4 ev for pac6c pac13a and pac14b the binding energy of 3p1 2 peaks located at 351 3 351 3 and 351 1 ev the binding energy difference between ca2p3 2 and ca2p1 2 was 3 4 3 7 and 3 7 ev each these values agree well with those of caco3 25 we calculated the pac surface area pore volume and pore size using the n2 adsorption and desorption technique based on the brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh models fig 5 the bet surface area of pac1 pac12 pac13 and pac14 was 1022 62 1395 12 1261 71 and 1168 98 cm2 g respectively while pac2 pac3 and pac6 had 697 16 709 91 and 656 27 cm2 g fig 5a micropore area accounted for close to 50 of the total surface for all but pac3 and pac6 which had 223 12 cm2 g and 201 58 cm2 g respectively fig 5a the total pore volume was 1 13 cm3 g for pac13 and 1 07 cm3 g for pac14 while micropore volume was of 0 29 and 0 27 cm3 g respectively pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 and pac12 had lower total pore volume ranging from 0 45 to 0 86 cm3 g fig 5b micropore volume coincided with the nature of the micropore area with values falling in the 0 18 0 33 cm3 g range except for pac3 0 1 cm3 g and pac6 0 09 cm3 g the average pore width was between 3 45 and 3 65 nm for all pacs fig 5b furthermore surface area pore volume and pore size had a great change after modification this was particularly true for pac6a with its total surface area doubled 1223 84 cm2 g micropore area tripled 663 42 cm2 g external area increased 560 41 cm2 g and total pore volume and micropore volume also expanded to 1 08 cm3 g and 0 3 cm3 g fig 5a pore size decreased slightly fig 5b pac13a and pac14b also had a slight increase in these parameters these data showed that the tested pacs were mesopore based with abundant micropores i number and mb value which estimate pac microporosity and mesoporosity confirmed the micropore and bet surface area results 26 27 pac1 pac12 pac13 and pac14 had higher i number over 860 mg g and mb value over 200 mg g while for pac2 pac3 and pac6 they were below 750 mg g and 200 mg g furthermore the i number increased to 878 01 912 31 and 1107 35 mg g for pac6c pac13a and pac14b and the mb value to 241 13 258 77 and 266 31 mg g respectively fig 5c n2 physisorption isotherm plots further confirmed pac adsorption behavior fig 6 according to the iupac classification of adsorption isotherms all tested pacs belong to the type iv which was associated with capillary condensation in mesopores and the limiting uptake over a range of high p po the initial part of the type iv isotherm was attributed to monolayer multilayer adsorption since it relied on multilayer adsorption with the same path as the corresponding part of a type ii isotherm 28 the difference was that pac1 pac2 pac3 and pac12 had a h 4 hysteresis loop while a h 3 was present in pac6 pac13 and pac14 the pore size distribution psd plot confirmed these results fig s3 all tested pacs were mesoporous 2 50 nm pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 had similar psd with a single peak at 3 5 nm while pac13 and pac14 had bimodal pore distribution with peaks at 3 5 and 8 nm the type of n2 physisorption isotherm plots among modified pacs did not changed while the nitrogen adsorption amounts increased especially in pac6c fig 6 the psd of modified pacs kept the same trend as pore volume and the peak in 8 0 nm was more obvious but micropore distribution at 3 5 nm decreased especially in pac6c fig s3 this also demonstrated that calcium was effectively added to pacs 19 there was great variation in the ftir spectra of the different pacs fig s4 pac1 pac2 and pac3 had similar features as did pac13 and pac14 the peak around 3000 3600 cm 1 in pac6 and pac12 demonstrated the existence of oh bonds the peaks located at 2260 2125 and 1700 1900 cm 1 in pac1 pac2 pac3 and pac12 can be attributed to the cch and co bonds these peaks were weak in pac6 and pac13 and absent in pac14 the co and oco bonds likely correspond to the peaks at 1000 1200 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 in pac3 pac6 pac13 pac12 and pac14 29 new brands in the ftir spectra only appeared for pac6c the two new peaks were at 1200 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 which implied the presence of co and oco bonds fig s4 the intensity of the two bands also slightly increased in pac13a and pac14b as did one at 3500 cm 1 corresponding to oh 30 31 these changes revealed a dissociation of the adsorbed water in the presence of calcium 19 boehm titration also provided information on the functional groups present in the analyzed pacs table 1 the presence of acidic and basic groups on pac surface corroborates the data obtained with the ftir spectra pac12 pac13 and pac14 had greater amounts of phenolic groups while pac1 pac2 and pac3 had similar quantities the analyses of the quantities of carboxylic groups revealed a similar trend lactonic groups were more abundant in pac6 and pac12 as seen with the ftir spectra all tested pacs had a more acidic than basic groups except pac6 in which the abundances were similar 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption equilibrium time is one of the essential factors for estimating the removal efficiency of a substance 32 the adsorption equilibrium times at 0 4 g l were 60 90 45 120 and 45 min for pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 and pac14 respectively and their corresponding adsorption capabilities qt was 120 89 122 11 114 41 121 2 and 123 9 mg g fig 7 pac12 and pac13 had longer equilibrium time 360 and 300 min respectively with maximum adsorption capacities of 98 55 and 117 24 mg g fig 7 all the top pacs reached the adsorption equilibrium within 360 min for the pacs modified with calcium adsorption capacity hardly changed while adsorption equilibrium time shorten to 60 min excepting pac6 prolonged to 150 min it is implied pac that modified with calcium probably ameliorate adsorption equilibrium pfo and pso kinetic models are applied for further understanding the adsorption process and the statistical parameters of two adsorption kinetic models are shown in table 2 and fig 7 the pso model showed good fitting for pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 and pac13 according to relatively high r2 and low χ2 these results probably revealed that active sites were abound in those pacs and adsorption process was largely controlled by chemisorption 33 34 while three modified pacs and pac 14 fitted well to pfo model according to r2 and χ2 3 4 adsorption isotherms langmuir and freundlich isotherms are commonly used to describe the adsorption process of azo dyes in wastewater treatment 35 here we also used these two models fig 8 and the parameters of two models are summarized in table 3 the langmuir model produced higher r2 for pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac14 and modified pacs the langmuir dimensionless equilibrium parameter rl was greater than 0 but less than 1 which also showed favorable monolayer adsorption 35 pac12 and pac13 was better fitted to freundlich isotherm demonstrating adsorption process was controlled by multilayer adsorption 35 3 5 effect of ph and ionic factors on rb 81 removal by pacs the ph of a dye solution is a critical factor that influences the adsorption capacity by pacs 32 we investigated the effect of ph values ranging from 2 to 9 in rb 81 adsorption by the seven top performance pacs with 0 4 g l fig 9 the removal efficiency increased with the decrease of the ph of the dye solution at ph 2 the removal efficiency was at its highest for all tested pacs reaching almost 99 this phenomenon was likely due to the ionization suppression of the sulfonic acid group of rb 81 in the acidic solution which increased its hydrophobicity making it more apt to be adsorbed 36 37 additionally the chlorine substituents on rb 81 were negatively charged at acidic conditions and had electrostatic interactions with positively charged substances including the calcium ion on the pac surface which was also available for adsorption we also analyzed the impact of the ionic composition of the solution on pac performance at 0 2 g l pac fig 9 the rb 81 removal efficiency ranged between 60 and 75 in the absence of ionic substances with the addition of 0 02 m of nacl the removal efficiency increased to 84 15 86 84 94 88 and 96 44 in pac1 pac2 pac3 pac13 respectively and reached the adsorption equilibrium or maximum with 0 06 m and 0 01 m of nacl in the solution the removal efficiency reached adsorption equilibrium or maximum at 99 and 98 01 respectively in pac6 and pac14 while the concentration of nacl had a slight effect on pac12 the removal efficiency only reached 81 13 with 0 14 m nacl cacl2 had a more positive effect on pac adsorption efficiency than nacl the removal efficiency reached 99 for all but pac12 97 with cacl2 concentrations of 0 01 m for pac13 and pac14 0 02 m for pac3 0 04 m for pac12 and 0 06 m for pac1 pac2 and pac6 the slight formation of aggregates observed overnight in the solution containing cacl2 helped reduce the rb 81 concentration in the final filtrate this phenomenon of aggregation could be due to the influence of the ionic types and their strength on the surface potential of the adsorbate which reduced electric repulsion 38 the cations present likely provided additional shielding to the charged surface of rb 81 enhancing the interaction between rb 81 and pacs by reducing repulsion forces 19 3 6 correlation between pac parameters and adsorption capacity in order to eliminate the random interference caused by the lack of representative samples fourteen kinds of commercial pacs were screened seven of which exhibiting good performance were characterized with eighteen physicochemical indexes we correlated the pac characteristics indexes with adsorption capacity qm table 4 fig 5s the correlation of determination r2 between the adsorption capacity and i number and mb was low 0 2014 and 0 1846 respectively which implied that these indexes were inferior relevance with qm there was a barren correlation involving the amount of total basic total acidic carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups regarding the bet surface area the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 3409 indicating low correlation with qm the external surface area had a higher correlation than the micropore area which implied that adsorption react more frequently in the surface layer no significant correlation could be observed between adsorption capacity and pore properties of total pore volume micropore volume and average pore width see table 4 for element correlation analysis pac12 and pac6 was discarded in chloride and calcium data due to the maldistribution carbon is the primary substance in pac and the c content had only a faint correlation with qm the contents of oxygen and chlorine had weak correlation with the adsorption capacity interestingly s and ca content linearly correlated with the absorption capacity with the r2 of 0 78 for s and 0 9398 for ca additionally pearson correlation coefficient showed a positive correlation closed to 1 see table 4 above results of element correlation analysis elucidated that ca element displayed a vital role in rb 81 adsorption adsorbents and adsorbates characteristics determine the adsorption mechanism 39 and various physicochemical properties of pac result in different adsorptive capacities if the properties of adsorbent or adsorbate change the relationship of key parameters of adsorbent properties and adsorption capacity will change accordingly 9 18 34 thus the best choice should be based on the knowledge of the optimal physical and chemical properties of the pac 18 in our work those physicochemical indexes such as i number and mb value textural properties including specific surface area and pore distribution functional groups showed no significant correlation with adsorption capacity the results were also reported by other studies 13 16 18 few works have studied the influence of elements of pac on the adsorption of dyes and mineral salts were often applied to increase element content of adsorbent for improving adsorption capacity 20 21 29 the calcium element showed a strong relationship with adsorption capacity in our research and modified pacs with calcium showed better adsorption ability rb 81 is a kind of cationic dye that contain sulfonic group so3 it is probably adsorbed by calcium enriched pacs with electrostatic interaction this is great possible for popularization and application in the treatment of azo dye pollutants 4 conclusion we investigated the rb 81 removal efficiency by fourteen kinds of pacs and seven pac1 pac2 pac3 pac6 pac12 pac13 and pac14 with a high adsorption performance were characterized the adsorption kinetics of selected six pacs except pac14 and modified pacs with calcium well fitted to pseudo second order the isotherms of the screened pacs excluding pac2 and pac3 were well described by langmuir mode dominated by monolayer adsorption the high linear correlation between the qm of the langmuir model and the physicochemical properties of seven pacs suggested that the presence of calcium element improve adsorption efficiency three modified pacs that showed higher removal efficiency and shorter equilibrium time further confirmed this observation further probing on the factors that influence adsorption showed that an acidic medium and the presence of nacl cacl2 in the dye solution improve rb 81 removal declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of

13986,microalgae culture is an environmentally friendly alternative to the energy consuming activated sludge technology used for wastewater treatment since the bioprocess is driven by sunlight the operational costs are considerably reduced compared to the mechanical aeration before implementing extensively this bioprocess still requires a better understanding of the organism interactions and the impact exerted by the main variable ruling the process light intensity for this purpose oxygen concentration evolution was studied and modelled in a consortia developed during the treatment of domestic wastewater rates of oxygenation were studied and modelled with the equations validated for microalgae cultures the bacterial activity was simulated by means of equations used for quantification of oxygen consumption in conventional wastewater treatment facilities analysis revealed important aspects of the symbiosis while bacterial oxygen consumption was limited to a few hours after the addition of wastewater microalgae not only act as oxygen producer events of photorespiration and endogenous respiration processes were detected along the continuous culture treating wastewater keywords dissolved oxygen evolution microalgae photobioreactors algal bacterial consortium photosynthetic oxygenation 1 introduction wastewater treatment with microalgae relies upon the photosynthesis reaction which captures light and provides oxygen for bacterial degradation of organic matter this bioprocess offers lower operational costs than the conventional activated sludge systems in which oxygen is mechanically provided simultaneously to oxygen release inorganic dissolved compounds co2 hco3 nh4 po4 3 are assimilated by the microalgae resulting in high quality effluents 1 although this bioprocess has been implemented in stabilization ponds where algae grow in the surface mixed cultures such as high rate algae ponds are considered a more suitable option since fully aerobic conditions are established in the all reactor volume and algal bacteria biomass can be removed from final effluent 2 4 despite of the advantages and achievements reached in pilot and demonstration plants based on mixed cultures 5 6 microalgae technology for wastewater treatment is still not widely implemented unlike the conventional wastewater treatment systems based on activated sludge where oxygenation rates are controlled in microalgae based systems the oxygen production in reactors is rarely regulated or even quantified 7 8 therefore these systems are often considered as an unproven alternative with a strong environmental condition dependence such as light availability in the other hand the microalgae oxygen production kinetics and the light dependence of this process have been extensively studied for the design of photobioreactors devoted to other purposes such as algae biomass production 9 10 for instance several response models have been described that correlate microalgae culture photosynthesis rates to light intensity 11 12 instantaneous values of dissolved oxygen are commonly used as a microalgae biomass growth indicator since both parameters are generally assumed to be stoichiometrically related 13 it is in general assumed that within of the microalgae based wastewater treatment systems the organic matter is removed by the symbiotic bacteria that consume the oxygen released by algae 8 since both processes o2 production and consumption occur simultaneously the biological activity of each microorganism type has rarely been described 7 oxygen production rates greatly exceeds consumption and gas exchange with the atmosphere therefore oversaturation of this compound has been frequently reported during wastewater treatment 8 14 18 under these circumstances the organic matter degradation rate in these systems is not well understood due to the difficulties to measure the biological activity of the heterotrophic aerobic bacteria the overall aim of this study was to characterize the main bioprocess taking place during the wastewater treatment process using a microalgal bacterial consortium more specifically oxygen evolution within of the system was studied in depth by following the photosynthetic oxygen production of the microalgae and its consumption by bacteria the oxygen concentration fluctuations measured during the wastewater treatment in enclosed reactors were used to develop a model that simulated the microbial activity during the treatment of domestic wastewater moreover this study also aimed to assess the oxygen production s light dependence for this purpose the culture s characteristic light response was studied the oxygen consumption rates of bacteria were modelled according to the commonly used equations for activated sludge designs this approach allowed to determine the biological activity of the consortia which constitutes the basis to construct accurate prediction tools to control the bioprocess 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater urban wastewater was daily collected from the pilot wastewater treatment plant of the university rey juan carlos móstoles spain the wastewater s composition was mg

codnp 43 9 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup consisted of two water jacketed enclosed photobioreactors both reactors were enclosed cylindrical glass tanks with a working volume of 1 l and a diameter of 0 1 m fig 1 cultures were laterally illuminated by 4 fluorescent lamps 18 w sylvania germany providing an average incident photosynthetic active radiation par i o on the side surface of the reactor of 122 μmol m 2 s 1 light intensity was measured at 10 different fixed points at the reactor s surface by means of a spectroradiometer blue wave stellarnetinc usa light dark cycles of 14 10 h were maintained during the experimentation temperature was set to 24 c using a thermal bath f12 julabo germany connected to the jacketed reactors agitation was provided by magnetic stirrers working at 250 rpm dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph evolution during the experimentation was registered online by means of a multiparametric probe hanna 9828 usa a complementary experimental setup was used to determine the photosynthetic response measured as oxygen production of the microalgae bacteria consortia in relation to light intensity by means of this determination microalgae oxygenation during wastewater treatment can be modelled as function of light availability in the photobioreactor the system used for this purpose consisted of a glass cylinder enclosed tube 0 04 m diameter equipped with a temperature and do probe crison do 5060 spain different levels of light irradiance were tested by modifying the distance to the light source lum floodlight led150 4000 k ng osram germany incident light intensity was measured at the surface of the glass cylinder moreover the incident intensity was determined at 3 fixed points distributed around different cylinder zones this experimental setup was used instead of the 1 l photobioreactor described above for the light response tests because a higher average irradiance inside of the culture can be reached given the lower optical pathway of this tubular glass cylinder in this manner a wide range of light conditions were tested from 61 to 977 μmol m 2 s 1 at the cylinder s surface according to previous studies these conditions are required for a determination of the maximum rates of oxygenation of microalgae 9 10 2 3 microorganisms a wild strain of chlorella sorokiniana was used for the assays this strain

used as the bacterial inoculum 50 ml of mixed liquor were used as the initial inoculum at a concentration of 1 27 g vss l 1 2 4 experimental procedures one liter experimental enclosed bioreactors were operated in a semi batch mode with a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days throughout a total of 23 days peristaltic pumps miniplus evolution gilson usa were used to introduce 0 33 l of fresh wastewater every day and to remove the same volume out of the system feeding and removal of the culture broth were carried out during the illumination period effluent removal was set after a 5 h illumination period and lasted 30 min while fresh wastewater feeding was programmed after illuminating during 7 h and lasted 30 min this operational mode resulted in do concentration fluctuations fig 2 that were used to explain the biological activity that occurred during the wastewater treatment using the microalgal bacterial consortium photosynthetic oxygen production and oxygen consumption by bacteria and microalgae samples of 30 ml were daily withdrawn from the influent and the effluent in order to measure the soluble cod nh4 no2 no3 and po4 3 and the total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss total cod was also measured in the wastewater used as influent the procedure followed to measure the microalgae culture photosynthetic response was similar to those described by costache et al 9 jeon et al 10 and molina et al 11 using monocultures of microalgae cultivated in mineral medium more specifically the glass cylinder was filled with 80 ml of the culture broth withdrawn from the bioreactor to determine the light response based on the photosynthetic oxygenation rate to avoid the presence of biodegradable cod in the culture broth these samples were taken from the semi batch experiment before the daily addition of wastewater in this way the biological consumption of oxygen by bacteria during the light response essays was avoided the oxygen generation rate was calculated from the slope of the do concentration over time in each experiment corresponding to different light intensities samples were aerated between every measurement with a mechanical air pump to ensure a 100 do saturation at the beginning of the experiment in order to avoid the possible negative impact of an elevated oxygen concentration slopes were recorded in a range of 100 140 do saturation 2 5 analytical procedures chemical oxygen demand cod and n nh4 were determined employing the colorimetric method using commercial kits merck iso 15705 and 000683 tss vss and total dissolved co2 were measured according to standard methods 20 to obtain the soluble fractions samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm during 15 min and then the supernatants were filtered using 0 45 μm diameter nylon

with the titrimetric method 4500 co2 as described in the standard methods 20 concentrations of hco3 co3 2 and co2 were estimated with the total dissolved co2 values and the ph variations according to the equation of henderson hasselbalch 2 6 modeling of oxygen concentration evolution given that the semi batch photobioreactors used were an enclosed system without atmospheric gas exchange the do oxygen accumulation fluctuations monitored during the wastewater treatment were used to describe microbial activity fig 2 modelization of this activity was done using a simple mass balance equation 1

maximum specific utilization rate mg cod mgbiomass 1 h 1 x the aerobic biomass amount mg l 1 ks the half velocity constant mg l 1 y the biomass yield formation g vss g cod 1 and s the biodegradable soluble cod codbs concentration at any given time t to execute this calculation the average values reported by tchobanoglous et al 24 were used for coefficients k equal to 5 g cod g biomass 1 d 1 and y equal to 0 4 gvss gcod 1 in the case of ks different coefficients were tested ranging from 25 to 100 g cod l 1 according to the values suggested by the same authors the aerobic bacterial

concentrations in the reactor were very low 1 6 mg n l 1 other bacterial group growths such as the nitrifying and denitrifying microbes were not considered dissolved oxygen monitorization revealed an important oxygen consumption during the dark period fig 2 the results of the bacterial activity modeling above suggested that this oxygen concentration drop was not due to bacterial consumption therefore microalgae endogenous respiration was suggested as the main cause of dark oxygen depletion rates of dark respiration in photosynthetic organisms depends mainly in storage reserves which was not determined in this experiment and available oxygen therefore night respiration of algae was modelled following a first order kinetic depending on initial oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid according to the expression 11 r o 2 m i c d o 2 t d o 2 e g t where ro 2mic stands for rate of microalgae endogenous respiration g is the kinetic constant and t is the elapsed time a summary of the variables used in the modelization is included in table 1 3 results 3 1 wastewater treatment performance the microalgae bacteria consortia were rapidly established within of the experimental photobioreactors during the first operation days the system was considered at steady state since 7 cycles of hrt 3 were conducted over 23 days of experiment in accordance to the microbial stability it should be highlighted that the average biomass concentration throughout the complete experimental time was 363 95 mg l 1 without any significant variation in spite of the inlet wastewater composition fluctuations total cod ranging from 816 to 224 mg l 1 and soluble cod from 469 to 116 mg l 1 the soluble cod concentration in the reactor s effluent presented stable values during the entire operation 172 21 mg l 1 corresponding to an average soluble cod removal of 37 11 fig 3 a in contrast the effluent n nh4 concentrations were affected by this compound s sharp fluctuations in the inlet wastewater from 5 to 64 mg l 1 fig 3b the average n nh4 removal was 70 25 the n no2 and n no3 concentrations in the bioreactor were very close to the concentrations detected in the wastewater used to feed the reactors the inlet wastewater measurements comprised 0 88 0 84 mg l 1 of n no2 and 1 17 1 10 mg l 1 of n no3 while the respective average concentrations in the reactors were 0 78 0 86 and 1 08 0 92 mg l 1 the p po4 3 concentration also presented a significant variation in the inlet wastewater with a maximum value of 15 09 mg l 1 and a minimum value of 0 96 mg l 1 however this compound s concentration presented stable values in the culture broth of the bioreactors from the third operation day onwards with an average value of 1 49 1 13 mg l 1 3 2 light intensity photosynthetic culture response the light intensity influence on the photosynthesis rate was studied by measuring the oxygen production under culture exposure to different average irradiance i av levels experiments were conducted at different culture times for example results presented in fig 4 correspond to samples withdrawn after 17 and 18 cultivation days having been the reactors in a steady state the photosynthetic oxygenation rate of the microalgae bacteria consortia increased with light availability up to values of 250 μmol m 2 s 1 presenting an average oxygen production rate of 6 96 0 60 mg o2 l 1 h 1 equivalent to 31 9 1 2 mg o2 g vss 1 h 1 under optimal conditions i av 150 250 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 the photosynthetic activity gradually decreased with light intensities higher than 250 μmol m 2 s 1 more specifically values of 18 mg o2 g vss 1 h 1 were recorded at the highest light intensity tested 730 μmol m 2 s 1 by fitting the experimental data into eq 2 the specific photosynthetic activity parameters of the microalgae were determined namely ro 2max 31 9 1 2 mg o2 g vss 1 h 1 i k 60 and n 2 considering the proposed modification to the model by including the inhibition constants eq 3 parameters m and i i were determined representing respectively values of 3 and 300 3 3 oxygen concentration evolution as consequence of the light dark cycles and of the semi batch operation the do concentration fluctuated along the day fig 2 light cycle was mainly characterized by oversaturation values while values below saturation the point were detected during dark period and after wastewater addition do was recorded during the whole experimental period and the same fluctuation pattern was detected each cycle however only data acquired during the 17th and 18th operation days are herein presented for the analytical oxygen balance fig 5 the selection of days corresponded to the most stable cod concentrations of the inlet wastewater during the first illumination hours the dissolved oxygen concentration increased at an average rate of 5 3 0 5 mg o2 l 1 h 1 reaching a concentration of 18 2 3 2 mg o2 l 1 at the end of the period comprised between the culture broth removal and the wastewater addition after 5 7 h operating exposed to illumination do concentration suddenly dropped to an average rate of 9 3 3 2 mg o2 l 1 h 1after feeding the reactor with fresh wastewater reaching a very brief steady state of stable concentrations ranging from 14 3 15 5 mg o2 l 1 approximately three hours after wastewater feeding do concentrations rose significantly at a constant rate of 6 2 1 3 mg l 1 h 1 the last light cycle hours were characterized by an oxygen accumulation decrease reaching a steady state with average value of 35 2 4 2 mg o2 l 1 do concentration dramatically decreased during the first hours of the dark period at a rate of 16 0 2 mg o2 l 1 h 1 until reaching the lowest value after 7 h devoid of illumination 1 2 mg o2 l 1 3 4 modeling dissolved oxygen during wastewater treatment the modelled oxygen balance calculated with eq 1 adjusted reasonably to the experimental data recorded during the light period fig 5a dashed lines estimated oxygen production at the beginning of the light cycle before supplying daily fresh wastewater presented a value of 4 4 mg o2 l 1 h 1 slightly lower than that determined experimentally 5 3 0 5 mg o2 l 1 h 1 the sharp do decrease after feeding was also lower than that experimentally recorded 6 8 mg o2 l 1 h 1 vs 9 3 3 2 mg o2 l 1 h 1 the sudden do concentration increase registered after providing wastewater during 3 h fitted well with the experimental values introducing into eq 6 the kinetic parameters ko 2 31 mg l 1 and z 2 3 the oxygenation rate decrease due the elevated oxygen concentrations registered at the end of the illumination period the simulated oxygen balance performed with eq 1 did not take into consideration microalgae dark respiration therefore the model reasonable fit the experimental data only during light period fig 5a using the mass balance presented in eq 2 the oxygen drop recorded during the night was described by the first order kinetic depending on the values of available o2 fig 5b 3 5 ph and inorganic carbon species evolution elevated ph values were recorded during the complete operation with maximum values before the supply of wastewater 10 8 0 3 and at the end of the illumination period 10 4 0 2 fig 6 minimum values were detected at the end of the dark conditions 9 45 0 2 and just after the feeding time 9 8 this fluctuation pattern was detected during the complete operational time concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 presented daily fluctuations concomitantly with the ph variations fig 6 minimum values of hco3 were detected just before addition of wastewater and at the end of the light cycle 8 81 1 1 and 12 1 3 1 mg l 1 respectively while maximum values corresponded to the end of the dark period and after feeding 30 3 3 1 and 26 6 4 1 mg l 1 respectively on the contrary co3 2 presented the maximum concentration before feeding and at the end of the illumination period 25 6 4 7 and 19 6 2 8 mg l 1 due to the elevated ph values free co2 concentration was very low during all the operation 0 02 mg l 1 4 discussion oxygenation provided by the microalgae could replace energy consuming technologies based on mechanical aeration since sunlight drives the bioprocess almost unlimited amounts of oxygen can be produced although mixed algae bacteria cultures such as hrap has proven promising results in terms of pollutant removal their implementation still requires a better understanding of the interactions between microorganisms and the impact of the main variable ruling the process light intensity while research conducted open air has mainly focused on demonstrations and engineering designs laboratory research should be geared towards developing simulation tools able to describe performances under different environmental conditions 4 1 wastewater treatment performance the microalgal bacterial consortium was rapidly established in the reactors and aerobic conditions were recorded from the second operation day onwards evidencing the stability of the biological communities the biomass concentrations reached during the semi batch operation were in the range of those previously reported experiences dealing with microalgae based systems for instance the vss concentrations in high rate algae ponds fed with domestic wastewater have ranged between 150 450 mg l 1 depending on the season and the dilution rate applied 5 6 in the case of laboratory scale bioreactors variable concentrations within a range of 300 1250 mg l 1 have been reported depending on the wastewater source and the operation conditions 25 in this sense it must be noticed that most lab scale experiments are based on the batch cultivation mode therefore higher biomass concentrations are normally achieved in spite of the high oxygenation levels achieved during the lasting of the experiment the average soluble cod concentration in the bioreactor was higher than the non biodegradable soluble fraction as determined by the biodegradability test 172 vs 119 mg l 1 respectively this fact can be attributed to the organic compound release by the microalgae or else to an insufficient organic matter biodegradation by the heterotrophic bacteria soluble cod increases due to extracellular organic compound excretions during symbiotic microalgae and bacteria cultures have previously been reported 26 in this context although cod removal limitations have so far not been reported in outdoor experiences 27 in this particular investigation unfavorable conditions could have occurred in the enclosed laboratory essays such oxygen oversaturation despite of the different cod concentrations of the influent fed into the reactor the effluent s cod concentration was stable 157 199 mg l 1 opposite to the cod effluent concentration the n nh4 fate in the bioreactor was significantly influenced by the composition of the wastewater thus complete ammonium removal was recorded during the experimental time corresponding to the lowest n nh4 concentration 15 mg l 1 feed according to previous studies that have dealt with microalgae based systems nh4 is mainly transformed by three mechanisms namely assimilation into biomass oxidation to nitrate or else nitrite and last volatilization as nh3 mediated by elevated ph values 1 6 given that the no2 and no3 formation during the process was negligible and that the bioreactors were enclosed systems without atmospheric exchange it can be considered that the nh4 removed was mainly assimilated by the biomass generated during the process in this sense the nitrogen balance calculated for the bioreactor showed a very constant nitrogen assimilation rate with an average rate of 18 3 3 1 mg n l 1 d 1 it should be mentioned that the partial nitrogen removal is a common phenomenon of photosynthetic treatment also found by many other authors due to the unbalance c n ratio 28 29 4 2 photosynthetic response of microalgae bacteria consortium microalgae oxygenation can be affected by many factors being the most important light intensity since oxygen release is directly related to microalgae biomass formation 30 the irradiance effect can be studied at a laboratory scale simulating different light intensity levels under controlled conditions while measuring the do production rates the characteristic light response curves obtained with the symbiotic biomass showed that the oxygenation level was maximum at irradiances between 200 270 μmol m 2 s 1 and decreased at levels higher than 300 μmol m 2 s 1 this analysis revealed that the wild chorella sorokiniana strain isolated from wastewater was less tolerant to high irradiances than type strains presenting inhibitions at significantly higher intensities in this sense costache et al 9 detected photoinhibition effects at irradiances higher than 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 in scenedesmus almeriensis jeon et al 10 reported that the green microalgae haematoccus pluvialis did not present inhibition at irradiances higher than 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 the photoinhibition phenomenon was modelled by introducing the inhibition constants of eq 4 this adjustment was reached by fitting the form parameters n 2 and m 3 however in previously reported experiences this fine tuning was achieved with a simpler expression in which n was equal to 1 and m was equal to 2 resulting in a haldane type expression 21 it must be noticed that light inhibition is a complex phenomenon that depends not only on the strain s tolerance to high irradiances but also in the pre exposure of cells mediating their acclimation 31 in this sense average irradiance i av levels in the experimental photobioreactor used to study the wastewater treatment were significantly lower than the detected inhibition levels 74 vs 300 μmol m 2 s 1 therefore the proposed inhibition equation eq 4 was not needed to simulate the oxygenation rates during the semi batch operation however it should be highlighted that depending on location and configuration the average irradiance levels of outdoor real scale reactors range between 100 and 300 μmol m 2 s 1 32 therefore models considering light inhibition are recommended to carry out oxygenation simulations in terms of oxygen production per biomass unit under optimum illumination conditions rates measured were considerably lower than those values reported for microalgae grown in a synthetic medium the symbiotic algae bacteria consortia presented a maximum value of 31 6 mg o2 g vss h 1 compared to costache et al 9 that calculated 88 mg o2 g dw h 1 cultivating scenedemus in a mineral media it ought to be noticed that in the present study the oxygen quantity produced was calculated per vss unit therefore including a non photosynthetically active biomass fraction formed by the aerobic bacteria cell debris and suspended solids present in the wastewater this fact could explain the relatively low values obtained compared to the last cited study 4 3 modelling the dissolved oxygen during wastewater treatment the specific parameters related to the photosynthetic activity of the microalgae bacteria consortia were determined from the light response curve ro 2max 7 0 mg o2 l 1 h 1 equivalent to 31 6 mg o2 g vss h 1 in a culture with a biomass concentration of 0 220 g vss l 1 n 2 and i k 60 were used to simulate the oxygenation rate during the semi batch wastewater treatment oxygen accumulation at the beginning of the illumination period showed a reasonable adjustment with the experimental values fig 5 the oxygen accumulation decrease as a result of inhibition by product at the end of the illumination period was also predicted when oxygenation rates were calculated applying eq 6 this inhibition phenomenon was due to the photorespiration which is a consequence of the high do concentrations and or low dissolved co2 concentrations under these conditions o2 is fixed instead of co2 by the rubisco enzyme consequently energy captured during the light periods is consumed and co2 and nh4 are released 33 34 at this point it must be stressed that photorespiration has rarely been included in photobioreactor performance modeling it is generally believed that do saturation concentrations above 250 20 mg l 1 should be avoided since most microalgae strains experience growth inhibition at these levels 35 although the highest do saturation levels were concomitantly detected with very low hco3 12 1 3 1 mg l 1 values figs 5 and 6 this component s concentration was far above the limit threshold of microalgae growth on inorganic carbon in this sense the reported hco3 half saturation constants are in a range of 1 2 mg l 1 36 therefore o2 oversaturation was the main factor resulting in photorespiration during the last few hours of the light period it ought to be considered that elevated do levels could also occur during outdoor cultivation conditions for instance a do concentration as high as 500 saturation 41 mg l 1 has been reported in large ponds 37 38 using the mass balance described in eq 1 which considers microalgae as oxygen producers and bacteria as consumers the oxygen accumulation was well predicted during the complete light period and in a wide range of do concentrations between 0 30 mg l 1 corresponding to saturation percentages of 0 375 at this point it must be stressed that these fluctuations are in the range of the values detected in full scale demonstrative mixed algal bacteria systems 7 8 17 18 however this approach did not cope with the experimental and modelled data mismatch during the dark period fig 5a the sharp do decrease detected during the dark period revealed microalgae respiration took place according to béchet et al 12 microalgae oxygen consumption can be distinguished in two modes short term light respiration which is directly proportional to photosynthetic rate and long term dark respiration which mainly depends on the storage compound content of cells while the first is usually not observed because it is lower than the photosynthetic oxygen release about 25 of according to 39 the second is clearly evidenced when light is suddenly interrupted in enclosed systems the oxygen decrease detected during the dark period followed a first order kinetic evidencing maximum rates during the first 3 h and a continuous deceleration until reaching a steady state with a stable do concentration hence indicating a limitation of oxygen up take or organic reserves used as substrate the simple equation herein used to describe this phenomenon eq 11 fig 5b was adopted considering soluble oxygen as limiting substrate however in order to allow a better examination of this phenomena intracellular carbohydrates content in algae biomass must be determined establishing the extent in which the culture conditions impact on the reserves content starch and endogenous respiration remains to be elucidated the importance of the microalgae endogenous dark respiration has previously been described by béchet et al 12 and torzillo et al 40 with regard to the bacterial activity oxygen consumption was precisely described with the proposed model the formulas used for the calculation related to the oxygen up take have previously been validated in different types of bacterial systems 24 both the experimental and the modelled o2 evolutions showed that the bacterial activity was limited to the short time period when the biodegradable cod was still available approximately lasting 3 hours after addition it should be stressed that only soluble substrates were considered to perform this calculation the speedily do depletion detected after wastewater supply suggests that only the soluble substrates codbs were consumed by bacteria while particulate materials were probably trapped by the algae bacteria flocs the fact that the bacterial activity was limited to a few hours is relevant since in general it is assumed that the wastewater treatment bioprocess with microalgae bacteria consortia comprises a continuous exchange of o2 and co2 between microorganisms 41 while the present results indicate that a faster bacterial metabolism depleted the organic substrates in a few hours while the microalgae activity lasted longer over time consequently the symbiotic bacteria grew under substrate limiting conditions during most of the operation time this fact was also evidenced during the simulation since the experimentally determined and modelled data evidenced a best fit when lower substrate affinity constant values were used k s 25 therefore as a consequence of the permanent limitations the bacterial biomass developed during the experimental time presented a considerable high affinity towards the substrate 42 under these conditions the microbial competition for substrate becomes a relevant phenomenon and the microorganisms with the highest affinity towards the substrate lower k s outcompete their counterparts 5 conclusions this experimental work has demonstrated that the oxygen evolution taking place during a wastewater treatment with microalga bacteria consortia can be predicted using appropriate photosynthetic production formulas as function of light availability and bacterial consumption as function of biodegradable substrate concentration the specific consortia light response was described with one of the models used for microalgae cultures in the case of the bacterial metabolism the specific parameters tested were in the range of values suggested for aerobic wastewater degradation processes this analysis revealed important aspects of the microorganism consortia developed 1 oxygenation rates and the light intensity kinetic response were similar to those reported for microalgae cultures grown in a synthetic medium 2

13986,microalgae culture is an environmentally friendly alternative to the energy consuming activated sludge technology used for wastewater treatment since the bioprocess is driven by sunlight the operational costs are considerably reduced compared to the mechanical aeration before implementing extensively this bioprocess still requires a better understanding of the organism interactions and the impact exerted by the main variable ruling the process light intensity for this purpose oxygen concentration evolution was studied and modelled in a consortia developed during the treatment of domestic wastewater rates of oxygenation were studied and modelled with the equations validated for microalgae cultures the bacterial activity was simulated by means of equations used for quantification of oxygen consumption in conventional wastewater treatment facilities analysis revealed important aspects of the symbiosis while bacterial oxygen consumption was limited to a few hours after the addition of wastewater microalgae not only act as oxygen producer events of photorespiration and endogenous respiration processes were detected along the continuous culture treating wastewater keywords dissolved oxygen evolution microalgae photobioreactors algal bacterial consortium photosynthetic oxygenation 1 introduction wastewater treatment with microalgae relies upon the photosynthesis reaction which captures light and provides oxygen for bacterial degradation of organic matter this bioprocess offers lower operational costs than the conventional activated sludge systems in which oxygen is mechanically provided simultaneously to oxygen release inorganic dissolved compounds co2 hco3 nh4 po4 3 are assimilated by the microalgae resulting in high quality effluents 1 although this bioprocess has been implemented in stabilization ponds where algae grow in the surface mixed cultures such as high rate algae ponds are considered a more suitable option since fully aerobic conditions are established in the all reactor volume and algal bacteria biomass can be removed from final effluent 2 4 despite of the advantages and achievements reached in pilot and demonstration plants based on mixed cultures 5 6 microalgae technology for wastewater treatment is still not widely implemented unlike the conventional wastewater treatment systems based on activated sludge where oxygenation rates are controlled in microalgae based systems the oxygen production in reactors is rarely regulated or even quantified 7 8 therefore these systems are often considered as an unproven alternative with a strong environmental condition dependence such as light availability in the other hand the microalgae oxygen production kinetics and the light dependence of this process have been extensively studied for the design of photobioreactors devoted to other purposes such as algae biomass production 9 10 for instance several response models have been described that correlate microalgae culture photosynthesis rates to light intensity 11 12 instantaneous values of dissolved oxygen are commonly used as a microalgae biomass growth indicator since both parameters are generally assumed to be stoichiometrically related 13 it is in general assumed that within of the microalgae based wastewater treatment systems the organic matter is removed by the symbiotic bacteria that consume the oxygen released by algae 8 since both processes o2 production and consumption occur simultaneously the biological activity of each microorganism type has rarely been described 7 oxygen production rates greatly exceeds consumption and gas exchange with the atmosphere therefore oversaturation of this compound has been frequently reported during wastewater treatment 8 14 18 under these circumstances the organic matter degradation rate in these systems is not well understood due to the difficulties to measure the biological activity of the heterotrophic aerobic bacteria the overall aim of this study was to characterize the main bioprocess taking place during the wastewater treatment process using a microalgal bacterial consortium more specifically oxygen evolution within of the system was studied in depth by following the photosynthetic oxygen production of the microalgae and its consumption by bacteria the oxygen concentration fluctuations measured during the wastewater treatment in enclosed reactors were used to develop a model that simulated the microbial activity during the treatment of domestic wastewater moreover this study also aimed to assess the oxygen production s light dependence for this purpose the culture s characteristic light response was studied the oxygen consumption rates of bacteria were modelled according to the commonly used equations for activated sludge designs this approach allowed to determine the biological activity of the consortia which constitutes the basis to construct accurate prediction tools to control the bioprocess 2

a diameter of 0 1 m fig 1 cultures were laterally illuminated by 4 fluorescent lamps 18 w sylvania germany providing an average incident photosynthetic active radiation par i o on the side surface of the reactor of 122 μmol m 2 s 1 light intensity was measured at 10 different fixed points at the reactor s surface by means of a spectroradiometer blue wave stellarnetinc usa light dark cycles of 14

working at 250 rpm dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph evolution during the experimentation was registered online by means of a multiparametric probe hanna 9828 usa a complementary experimental setup was used to determine the photosynthetic response measured as oxygen production of the microalgae bacteria consortia in relation to light intensity by means of this determination microalgae oxygenation during wastewater treatment can be modelled as function of light availability in the photobioreactor the system used for this purpose consisted of a glass cylinder enclosed tube 0 04 m diameter equipped with a temperature and do probe crison do 5060 spain different levels of light irradiance were tested by modifying the distance to the light source lum floodlight led150 4000 k ng osram germany incident light intensity was measured at the surface of the glass cylinder moreover the incident intensity was determined at 3 fixed points distributed around different cylinder zones this experimental setup was used instead of the 1 l photobioreactor described above for the light response tests because a higher average irradiance inside of the culture can be reached given the lower optical pathway of this tubular glass cylinder in this manner a wide range of light conditions were tested from 61 to 977 μmol m 2 s 1 at the cylinder s surface according to previous studies these conditions are required for a determination of the maximum rates of oxygenation of microalgae 9 10 2 3 microorganisms a wild strain of chlorella sorokiniana was used for the assays this strain

operated in a semi batch mode with a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days throughout a total of 23 days peristaltic pumps miniplus evolution gilson usa were used to introduce 0 33 l of fresh wastewater every day and to remove the same volume out of the system feeding and removal of the culture broth were carried out during the illumination period effluent removal was set after a 5 h illumination period and lasted 30 min while fresh wastewater feeding was programmed after illuminating during 7 h and lasted 30 min this operational mode resulted in do concentration fluctuations fig 2 that were used to explain the biological activity that occurred during the wastewater treatment using the microalgal bacterial consortium photosynthetic oxygen production and oxygen consumption by bacteria and microalgae samples of 30 ml were daily withdrawn from the influent and the effluent in order to measure the soluble cod nh4 no2 no3 and po4 3 and the total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss total cod was also measured in the wastewater used as influent the procedure followed to measure the microalgae culture photosynthetic response was similar to those described by costache et al 9 jeon et al 10 and molina et al 11 using monocultures of microalgae cultivated in mineral medium more specifically the glass cylinder was filled with 80 ml of the culture broth withdrawn from the bioreactor to determine the light response based on the photosynthetic oxygenation rate to avoid the presence of biodegradable cod in the culture broth these samples were taken from the semi batch experiment before the daily addition of wastewater in this way the biological consumption of oxygen by bacteria during the light response essays was avoided the oxygen generation rate was calculated from the slope of the do concentration over time in each experiment corresponding to different light intensities samples were aerated between every measurement with a mechanical air pump to ensure a 100 do saturation at the beginning of the experiment in order to avoid the possible negative impact of an elevated oxygen concentration slopes were recorded in a range of 100 140 do saturation 2 5

the equation of henderson hasselbalch 2 6 modeling of oxygen concentration evolution given that the semi batch photobioreactors used were an enclosed system without atmospheric gas exchange the do

high oxygen concentrations 9 22 23 6 r o 2 p h o d o 2 r o 2 p h o 1 d o 2 k o 2 z denoting do2 the dissolved oxygen concentration ko 2 the oxygen inhibition constant and z a form parameter the

1 42 r b g signifying rus the soluble substrate biodegradable cod utilization rate and rbg standing for the biomass growth rate based on the soluble substrates multiplied by a stoichiometric factor since systems were operated in a semi batch mode the soluble substrate utilization rate and the aerobic biomass growth rate depended directly on the substrate concentration and therefore increased

concentrations in the reactor were very low 1 6 mg n l 1 other bacterial group growths such as the nitrifying and denitrifying microbes were not considered dissolved oxygen monitorization revealed an important oxygen consumption during the dark period fig 2 the results of the bacterial activity modeling above suggested that this oxygen concentration drop was not due to bacterial consumption therefore microalgae endogenous respiration was suggested as the main cause of dark oxygen depletion rates of dark respiration in photosynthetic organisms depends mainly in storage reserves which was not determined in this experiment and available oxygen therefore night respiration of algae was modelled following a first order kinetic depending on initial oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid according to the expression 11 r o 2 m i c d o 2 t d o 2 e g t where ro 2mic stands for rate of microalgae endogenous respiration g is the kinetic constant and t is the elapsed time a summary of the variables used in the modelization is included in table 1 3 results 3 1 wastewater treatment performance the microalgae bacteria consortia were rapidly established within of the experimental photobioreactors during the first operation days the system was considered at steady state since 7 cycles of hrt 3 were conducted over 23 days of experiment in accordance to the microbial stability it should be highlighted that the average biomass concentration throughout the complete experimental time was 363 95 mg l 1 without any significant variation in spite of the inlet wastewater composition fluctuations total cod ranging from 816 to 224 mg l 1 and soluble cod from 469 to 116 mg l 1 the soluble cod concentration in the reactor s effluent presented stable values during the entire operation 172 21 mg l 1 corresponding to an average soluble cod removal of 37 11 fig 3 a in contrast the effluent n nh4 concentrations were affected by this compound s sharp fluctuations in the inlet wastewater from 5 to 64 mg l 1 fig 3b the average n nh4 removal was 70 25 the n no2 and n no3 concentrations in the bioreactor were very close to the concentrations detected in the wastewater used to feed the reactors the inlet wastewater measurements comprised 0 88 0 84 mg l 1 of n no2 and 1 17 1 10 mg l 1 of n no3 while the respective average concentrations in the reactors were 0 78 0 86 and 1 08 0 92 mg l 1 the p po4 3 concentration also presented a significant variation in the inlet wastewater with a maximum value of 15 09 mg l 1 and a minimum value of 0 96 mg l 1 however this compound s concentration presented stable values in the culture broth of the bioreactors from the third operation day onwards with an average value of 1 49 1 13 mg l 1 3 2 light intensity photosynthetic culture response the light intensity influence on the photosynthesis rate was studied by measuring the oxygen production under culture exposure to different average irradiance i av levels experiments were conducted at different culture times for example results presented in fig 4 correspond to samples withdrawn after 17 and 18 cultivation days having been the reactors in a steady state the photosynthetic oxygenation rate of the microalgae bacteria consortia increased with light availability up to values of 250 μmol m 2 s 1 presenting an average oxygen production rate of 6 96 0 60 mg o2 l 1 h 1 equivalent to 31 9 1 2 mg o2 g vss 1 h 1 under optimal conditions i av 150 250 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 the photosynthetic activity gradually decreased with light intensities higher than 250 μmol m 2 s 1 more specifically values of 18 mg o2 g vss 1 h 1 were recorded at the highest light intensity tested 730 μmol m 2 s 1 by fitting the experimental data into eq 2 the specific photosynthetic activity parameters of the microalgae were determined namely ro 2max 31 9 1 2 mg o2 g vss 1 h 1 i k 60 and n 2 considering the proposed modification to the model by including the inhibition constants eq 3 parameters m and i i were determined representing respectively values of 3 and 300 3 3 oxygen concentration evolution as consequence of the light dark cycles and of the semi batch operation the do concentration fluctuated along the day fig 2 light cycle was mainly characterized by oversaturation values while values below saturation the point were detected during dark period and after wastewater addition do was recorded during the whole experimental period and the same fluctuation pattern was detected each cycle however only data acquired during the 17th and 18th operation days are herein presented for the analytical oxygen balance fig 5 the selection of days corresponded to the most stable cod concentrations of the inlet wastewater during the first illumination hours the dissolved oxygen concentration increased at an average rate of 5 3 0 5 mg o2 l 1 h 1 reaching a concentration of 18 2 3 2 mg o2 l 1 at the end of the period comprised between the culture broth removal and the wastewater addition after 5 7 h operating exposed to illumination do concentration suddenly dropped to an average rate of 9 3 3 2 mg o2 l 1 h 1after feeding the reactor with fresh wastewater reaching a very brief steady state of stable concentrations ranging from 14 3 15 5 mg o2 l 1 approximately three hours after wastewater feeding do concentrations rose significantly at a constant rate of 6 2 1 3 mg l 1 h 1 the last light cycle hours were characterized by an oxygen accumulation decrease reaching a steady state with average value of 35 2 4 2 mg o2 l 1 do concentration dramatically decreased during the first hours of the dark period at a rate of 16 0 2 mg o2 l 1 h 1 until reaching the lowest value after 7 h devoid of illumination 1 2 mg o2 l 1 3 4 modeling dissolved oxygen during wastewater treatment the modelled oxygen balance calculated with eq 1 adjusted reasonably to the experimental data recorded during the light period fig 5a dashed lines estimated oxygen production at the beginning of the light cycle before supplying daily fresh wastewater presented a value of 4 4 mg o2 l 1 h 1 slightly lower than that determined experimentally 5 3 0 5 mg o2 l 1 h 1 the sharp do decrease after feeding was also lower than that experimentally recorded 6 8 mg o2 l 1 h 1 vs 9 3 3 2 mg o2 l 1 h 1 the sudden do concentration increase registered after providing wastewater during 3 h fitted well with the experimental values introducing into eq 6 the kinetic parameters ko 2 31 mg l 1 and z 2 3 the oxygenation rate decrease due the elevated oxygen concentrations registered at the end of the illumination period the simulated oxygen balance performed with eq 1 did not take into consideration microalgae dark respiration therefore the model reasonable fit the experimental data only during light period fig 5a using the mass balance presented in eq 2 the oxygen drop recorded during the night was described by the first order kinetic depending on the values of available o2 fig 5b 3 5 ph and inorganic carbon species evolution elevated ph values were recorded during the complete operation with maximum values before the supply of wastewater 10 8 0 3 and at the end of the illumination period 10 4 0 2 fig 6 minimum values were detected at the end of the dark conditions 9 45 0 2 and just after the feeding time 9 8 this fluctuation pattern was detected during the complete operational time concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 presented daily fluctuations concomitantly with the ph variations fig 6 minimum values of hco3 were detected just before addition of wastewater and at the end of the light cycle 8 81 1 1 and 12 1 3 1 mg l 1 respectively while maximum values corresponded to the end of the dark period and after feeding 30 3 3 1 and 26 6 4 1 mg l 1 respectively on the contrary co3 2 presented the maximum concentration before feeding and at the end of the illumination period 25 6 4 7 and 19 6 2 8 mg l 1 due to the elevated ph values free co2 concentration was very low during all the operation 0 02 mg l 1 4 discussion oxygenation provided by the microalgae could replace energy consuming technologies based on mechanical aeration since sunlight drives the bioprocess almost unlimited amounts of oxygen can be produced although mixed algae bacteria cultures such as hrap has proven promising results in terms of pollutant removal their implementation still requires a better understanding of the interactions between microorganisms and the impact of the main variable ruling the process light intensity while research conducted open air has mainly focused on demonstrations and engineering designs laboratory research should be geared towards developing simulation tools able to describe performances under different environmental conditions 4 1 wastewater treatment performance the microalgal bacterial consortium was rapidly established in the reactors and aerobic conditions were recorded from the second operation day onwards evidencing the stability of the biological communities the biomass concentrations reached during the semi batch operation were in the range of those previously reported experiences dealing with microalgae based systems for instance the vss concentrations in high rate algae ponds fed with domestic wastewater have ranged between 150 450 mg l 1 depending on the season and the dilution rate applied 5 6 in the case of laboratory scale bioreactors variable concentrations within a range of 300 1250 mg l 1 have been reported depending on the wastewater source and the operation conditions 25 in this sense it must be noticed that most lab scale experiments are based on the batch cultivation mode therefore higher biomass concentrations are normally achieved in spite of the high oxygenation levels achieved during the lasting of the experiment the average soluble cod concentration in the bioreactor was higher than the non biodegradable soluble fraction as determined by the biodegradability test 172 vs 119 mg l 1 respectively this fact can be attributed to the organic compound release by the microalgae or else to an insufficient organic matter biodegradation by the heterotrophic bacteria soluble cod increases due to extracellular organic compound excretions during symbiotic microalgae and bacteria cultures have previously been reported 26 in this context although cod removal limitations have so far not been reported in outdoor experiences 27 in this particular investigation unfavorable conditions could have occurred in the enclosed laboratory essays such oxygen oversaturation despite of the different cod concentrations of the influent fed into the reactor the effluent s cod concentration was stable 157 199 mg l 1 opposite to the cod effluent concentration the n nh4 fate in the bioreactor was significantly influenced by the composition of the wastewater thus complete ammonium removal was recorded during the experimental time corresponding to the lowest n nh4 concentration 15 mg l 1 feed according to previous studies that have dealt with microalgae based systems nh4 is mainly transformed by three mechanisms namely assimilation into biomass oxidation to nitrate or else nitrite and last volatilization as nh3 mediated by elevated ph values 1 6 given that the no2 and no3 formation during the process was negligible and that the bioreactors were enclosed systems without atmospheric exchange it can be considered that the nh4 removed was mainly assimilated by the biomass generated during the process in this sense the nitrogen balance calculated for the bioreactor showed a very constant nitrogen assimilation rate with an average rate of 18 3 3 1 mg n l 1 d 1 it should be mentioned that the partial nitrogen removal is a common phenomenon of photosynthetic treatment also found by many other authors due to the unbalance c n ratio 28 29 4 2 photosynthetic response of microalgae bacteria consortium microalgae oxygenation can be affected by many factors being the most important light intensity since oxygen release is directly related to microalgae biomass formation 30 the irradiance effect can be studied at a laboratory scale simulating different light intensity levels under controlled conditions while measuring the do production rates the characteristic light response curves obtained with the symbiotic biomass showed that the oxygenation level was maximum at irradiances between 200 270 μmol m 2 s 1 and decreased at levels higher than 300 μmol m 2 s 1 this analysis revealed that the wild chorella sorokiniana strain isolated from wastewater was less tolerant to high irradiances than type strains presenting inhibitions at significantly higher intensities in this sense costache et al 9 detected photoinhibition effects at irradiances higher than 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 in scenedesmus almeriensis jeon et al 10 reported that the green microalgae haematoccus pluvialis did not present inhibition at irradiances higher than 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 the photoinhibition phenomenon was modelled by introducing the inhibition constants of eq 4 this adjustment was reached by fitting the form parameters n 2 and m 3 however in previously reported experiences this fine tuning was achieved with a simpler expression in which n was equal to 1 and m was equal to 2 resulting in a haldane type expression 21 it must be noticed that light inhibition is a complex phenomenon that depends not only on the strain s tolerance to high irradiances but also in the pre exposure of cells mediating their acclimation 31 in this sense average irradiance i av levels in the experimental photobioreactor used to study the wastewater treatment were significantly lower than the detected inhibition levels 74 vs 300 μmol m 2 s 1 therefore the proposed inhibition equation eq 4 was not needed to simulate the oxygenation rates during the semi batch operation however it should be highlighted that depending on location and configuration the average irradiance levels of outdoor real scale reactors range between 100 and 300 μmol m 2 s 1 32 therefore models considering light inhibition are recommended to carry out oxygenation simulations in terms of oxygen production per biomass unit under optimum illumination conditions rates measured were considerably lower than those values reported for microalgae grown in a synthetic medium the symbiotic algae bacteria consortia presented a maximum value of 31 6 mg o2 g vss h 1 compared to costache et al 9 that calculated 88 mg o2 g dw h 1 cultivating scenedemus in a mineral media it ought to be noticed that in the present study the oxygen quantity produced was calculated per vss unit therefore including a non photosynthetically active biomass fraction formed by the aerobic bacteria cell debris and suspended solids present in the wastewater this fact could explain the relatively low values obtained compared to the last cited study 4 3 modelling the dissolved oxygen during wastewater treatment the specific parameters related to the photosynthetic activity of the microalgae bacteria consortia were determined from the light response curve ro 2max 7 0 mg o2 l 1 h 1 equivalent to 31 6 mg o2 g vss h 1 in a culture with a biomass concentration of 0 220 g vss l 1 n 2 and i k 60 were used to simulate the oxygenation rate during the semi batch wastewater treatment oxygen accumulation at the beginning of the illumination period showed a reasonable adjustment with the experimental values fig 5 the oxygen accumulation decrease as a result of inhibition by product at the end of the illumination period was also predicted when oxygenation rates were calculated applying eq 6 this inhibition phenomenon was due to the photorespiration which is a consequence of the high do concentrations and or low dissolved co2 concentrations under these conditions o2 is fixed instead of co2 by the rubisco enzyme consequently energy captured during the light periods is consumed and co2 and nh4 are released 33 34 at this point it must be stressed that photorespiration has rarely been included in photobioreactor performance modeling it is generally believed that do saturation concentrations above 250 20 mg l 1 should be avoided since most microalgae strains experience growth inhibition at these levels 35 although the highest do saturation levels were concomitantly detected with very low hco3 12 1 3 1 mg l 1 values figs 5 and 6 this component s concentration was far above the limit threshold of microalgae growth on inorganic carbon in this sense the reported hco3 half saturation constants are in a range of 1 2 mg l 1 36 therefore o2 oversaturation was the main factor resulting in photorespiration during the last few hours of the light period it ought to be considered that elevated do levels could also occur during outdoor cultivation conditions for instance a do concentration as high as 500 saturation 41 mg l 1 has been reported in large ponds 37 38 using the mass balance described in eq 1 which considers microalgae as oxygen producers and bacteria as consumers the oxygen accumulation was well predicted during the complete light period and in a wide range of do concentrations between 0 30 mg l 1 corresponding to saturation percentages of 0 375 at this point it must be stressed that these fluctuations are in the range of the values detected in full scale demonstrative mixed algal bacteria systems 7 8 17 18 however this approach did not cope with the experimental and modelled data mismatch during the dark period fig 5a the sharp do decrease detected during the dark period revealed microalgae respiration took place according to béchet et al 12 microalgae oxygen consumption can be distinguished in two modes short term light respiration which is directly proportional to photosynthetic rate and long term dark respiration which mainly depends on the storage compound content of cells while the first is usually not observed because it is lower than the photosynthetic oxygen release about 25 of according to 39 the second is clearly evidenced when light is suddenly interrupted in enclosed systems the oxygen decrease detected during the dark period followed a first order kinetic evidencing maximum rates during the first 3 h and a continuous deceleration until reaching a steady state with a stable do concentration hence indicating a limitation of oxygen up take or organic reserves used as substrate the simple equation herein used to describe this phenomenon eq 11 fig 5b was adopted considering soluble oxygen as limiting substrate however in order to allow a better examination of this phenomena intracellular carbohydrates content in algae biomass must be determined establishing the extent in which the culture conditions impact on the reserves content starch and endogenous respiration remains to be elucidated the importance of the microalgae endogenous dark respiration has previously been described by béchet et al 12 and torzillo et al 40 with regard to the bacterial activity oxygen consumption was precisely described with the proposed model the formulas used for the calculation related to the oxygen up take have previously been validated in different types of bacterial systems 24 both the experimental and the modelled o2 evolutions showed that the bacterial activity was limited to the short time period when the biodegradable cod was still available approximately lasting 3 hours after addition it should be stressed that only soluble substrates were considered to perform this calculation the speedily do depletion detected after wastewater supply suggests that only the soluble substrates codbs were consumed by bacteria while particulate materials were probably trapped by the algae bacteria flocs the fact that the bacterial activity was limited to a few hours is relevant since in general it is assumed that the wastewater treatment bioprocess with microalgae bacteria consortia comprises a continuous exchange of o2 and co2 between microorganisms 41 while the present results indicate that a faster bacterial metabolism depleted the organic substrates in a few hours while the microalgae activity lasted longer over time consequently the symbiotic bacteria grew under substrate limiting conditions during most of the operation time this fact was also evidenced during the simulation since the experimentally determined and modelled data evidenced a best fit when lower substrate affinity constant values were used k s 25 therefore as a consequence of the permanent limitations the bacterial biomass developed during the experimental time presented a considerable high affinity towards the substrate 42 under these conditions the microbial competition for substrate becomes a relevant phenomenon and the microorganisms with the highest affinity towards the substrate lower k s outcompete their counterparts 5 conclusions this experimental work has demonstrated that the oxygen evolution taking place during a wastewater treatment with microalga bacteria consortia can be predicted using appropriate photosynthetic production formulas as function of light availability and bacterial consumption as function of biodegradable substrate concentration the specific consortia light response was described with one of the models used for microalgae cultures in the case of the bacterial metabolism the specific parameters tested were in the range of values suggested for aerobic wastewater degradation processes this analysis revealed important aspects of the microorganism consortia developed 1 oxygenation rates and the light intensity kinetic response were similar to those reported for microalgae cultures grown in a synthetic medium 2

13987,global environmental pollution is thought to be the principal source of emission of industrial untreated effluent photocatalysis is the versatile process to eliminate these pollutants which is utilizing semiconductor metal oxides a nanocomposite wo3 tio2 working under visible light λ 420 nm has been prepared employing cis butenedioic acid to associate component semiconductors of wo3 and tio2 nanoparticle the composite was optimized to 5 mol wo3 tio2 in terms of photocatalytic activity to decompose phenol and methylene blue dye in aqueous under visible light afterwards au nanoparticle

light au wo3 tio2 demonstrated extraordinarily high photocatalytic efficiency in decomposing the pollutants compare to 5 mol wo3 tio2 nanocomposite after 120 min of visible irradiation 63 decomposition of phenol and 52 degradation of methylene blue dye was observed under the identical condition the outstanding improvement of photocatalytic efficiency of au wo3 tio2 nanocomposite ascribed due to the perfect matching of energy band positions of wo3 and tio2 which inhibit photo excited e hole h recombination as well as favor inter particle transfer between wo3 and tio2 au nanoparticles enhances transfer of electron e from cb of wo3 thus possible recombination of photo excited electron e hole h pair was retarded and photocatalytic efficiency was greatly improved keywords nanocomposite au loaded wo3 tio2 visible light organic pollutants photocatalysis degradation 1 introduction in current centuries researches have been conducted by investigators to minimize problems of environmental contamination photocatalysts which are prepared from semiconductor materials have gained among the environmentally friendly technologies and have been comprehensively considered for an extensive range of uses 1 3 anatase phase titanium dioxide tio2 has been presented as superb and extensively used semiconductor material for the degradation of significant organic pollutants owing to its physical and chemical stability as well as long term photo stability extraordinary power of oxidation high catalytic action low cost and ease of fabrication due to the presence of tio2 in an aqueous solution numerous organic compounds can be decomposed excited when the energy of the incident photons is equal or larger than the band gap of titanium dioxide 3 2 ev for anatase tio2 4 6 despite various drawbacks tio2 has been utilized in most photocatalytic applications yet suffer due to its easy recombination of photo excited electron e hole h and energy absorption at the uv region of solar spectrum 5 7 with the intention of improving the tio2 photocatalytic activity various researches have focused on two key instructions 1 decrease the photogenerated electron hole recombination rate and lengthen its convenient operating range and 2 rise its surface region and adjust the adsorption properties 8 up to now numerous studies have been stated that the photocatalytic characteristics can effectively be improved by dye sensitization 9 noble metals deposition 10 13 and joining with other semiconductors such as sno2 nio bi2o3 sbxsn1 xo2 fetio3 in2o3 zno cds zro2 cus fe2o3 wo3 sio2 and others 14 28 amongst the metal oxides wo3 has narrower band gap 2 68 ev especially than tio2 that absorb visible light 29 31 by absorbing visible energy from solar spectrum electrons of the vb of wo3 have possibility to excite and transfer to cb in addition wo3 has suitable conduction band cb and valence band vb positions with respect to tio2 and performs hunter for electrons which are photo excited and obtained from tio2 the holes which are produced by photogeneration of the wo3 valence band vb transfer near the valence band vb of tio2 and accumulate in the valence band vb 32 33 by this process the capability of charge transfer is improved and as a consequence photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 composite is also enhanced furthermore the surface acidity of wo3 tio2 rises due to the development of wo3 layer on tio2 which allows the adsorption of larger quantity of organic reactants and hydroxyl groups on the external surface wo3 tio2 composites were produced through various methods for example sol gel ultrasonic spray pyrolysis hydrothermal sol precipitation and so on 34 38 to develop photocatalytic action of tio2 under visible light hence the amalgamation of these two materials can expand photocatalytic activity due to the visible irradiation and escalate charge carrier lifetime thus in these two components system like wo3 tio2 several phenomena may have chances to occur e g photo excited electrons from the cb of wo3 may come back to vb wo3 or vb of tio2 however photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 composite might decrease 30 32 38 39 due to this recombination or neutralization of photo excited electron e hole h anyway the presence of noble metal on to the surface of composite the photo excited electrons in the cb of wo3 will be transferred to the noble metal and thus recombination might be prohibited in this paper wo3 tio2 composites were synthetized through uniting the constituents wo3 and tio2 and the structural properties and contact phenomena of this composite were characterized by xrd sem and tem afterwards wo3 tio2 were optimized in terms of photocatalytic efficiency and to improve photocatalytic activity au loaded

methylene blue dye in aqueous phase under the visible light λ 420 nm irradiation 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of wo3 tio2 nanocomposite tio2 degussa p25 was dissolved in absolute ethanol in a glass beaker under constant magnetic stirring and grinded wo3 powder was taken into this tio2 ethanol solution the tio2 ethanol wo3 suspension was stirred vigorously and continued for 4 h covered with aluminum foil to prevent the minimum loss of ethanol under ambient condition the suspension was dried and annealed to make a tight contact between wo3 and tio2 nanoparticles and elimination of

stirred for half an hour under uv irradiation afterwards it was centrifuged washed and dried under vacuum this was further heat treated at 100 c for 2 h the sample has been utilized to measure the

microscope functioned at 250 kv one mg of the composite was added in 50 ml of absolute ethanol and made a homogeneous solution by ultrasonication one drop of this solution was spread on a holey amorphous carbon film and dried under vacuum 2 4 estimation of photocatalytic activity phenol and methylene blue dye have been utilized as the model compounds to check the efficiency of the prepared photocatalytic samples 1 10 4 mol of degussa p25 and wo3 tio2 composite photocatalysts were suspended separately in 50 ml 5 10 5 m aqueous solution of phenol by magnetic stirrer for the degradation in aqueous solution the remnant phenol obtained from the irradiation of visible light λ 420 nm was investigated from its characteristic absorption peak detected by uv vis spectrophotometer similar procedure was followed for methylene blue dye to measure the photocatalytic efficiency of composite 1 10 4 mol of degussa p25 and wo3 tio2 were suspended separately in 50 ml of 1 10 4m methylene blue

calculated value is to be 16 36 nm and 26 60 nm respectively the sem images of wo3 tio2 heterojunction shown in fig 1 c and d reveal that the relatively large wo3 particles are covered with nanosized tio2 particles the sizes are probably as small as can be expected depending on chemical synthesis method according to the sem image it could be concluded that this preparation method was appropriate to obtain the wo3 tio2 nanocomposite to make a tight contact between wo3 and tio2 nanoparticles 3 2 study of morphology and contact between the au nanoparticle tio2 and wo3 the tem images of tio2

composites are exhibited in fig 2 c d and e the rectangular part of fig 2 d is further magnified and illustrated in fig 2 e edx mapping image of au loaded wo3 tio2 composites is displayed in fig 2 f it has been observed from fig 2 c and d that the tio2 nanoparticles with a dimension of 25 nm fig 2 a is homogeneously distributed and conjointly parted above the total surface of comparatively bigger wo3 as shown in fig 2 b and cover the whole surface of wo3 it is easy to interpret from the tem images of fig 2 c and d that a close fitting interaction is made between tio2 nanoparticle and wo3 to form a wo3 tio2 heterocomposite this has been considered as a decisive condition for electron e hole h transfer between the constituent of heterostructure fig 2 e is a high magnification image of the interface between tio2 and wo3 the sharp edge without any break recommends that tio2 is firmly attached with the wo3 particles the magnified image in fig 2 e shows tio2 with identical fringe forms over its whole area the fringe arrangement of 1 89211 nm was measured to be d 200 of the anatase tio2 jcpdf 71 1166 thus the annealing temperature of 320 c for 2 h is enough for wo3 tio2 composite to

of nanocomposite wo3 tio2 with different tio2 component annealed at 320 c for 2 h has been illustrated in fig 3 xrd patterns of tio2 and wo3 have also been contained within this fig 3 a to make comparison between the diffraction peaks of these two end members with that of the peaks of the composite wo3 tio2 as shown in fig 3 a the diffraction peaks appeared at 25 306 36 947 37 791 38 572 48 047 55 069 and 62 687 correspond to the 101 103 004 112 200 211 and 204 planes respectively of the pure tio2 jcpdf 71 1166 while the diffraction peaks of wo3 at 23 117 23 591 24 420 26 587 33 579 34 162 49 944 and 53 500 correspond to the 002 020 200 120 202 140 and 024 planes respectively of wo3 jcpdf 43 1035 as shown in fig 3 g it is clear from the fig 3 that the diffraction peaks of tio2 and wo3 appeared in the nanocomposites wo3 tio2 are owing to the existence of tio2 and wo3 the diffraction peaks other than that of tio2 and wo3 were not detected in the composite inside the detection limit impart that there were no considerable chemical reactions occurred between tio2 and wo3 during the development of composite wo3 tio2 and successive heat treatment at 320 c for 2 h thus 320 c for 2 h annealing temperature is fairly adequate to create effectively close fitting contact between tio2 nanoparticles and wo3 semiconductors as presented in fig 3 we have prepared a number of composite samples of wo3 tio2 with different tio2 composition starting from 1 mol to 10 mol of wo3 fig 3 g a shown that the peak intensity of tio2 rises and wo3 reduces with increasing tio2 concentrations in the composite wo3 tio2 xrd of au nanoparticles loaded wo3 tio2 composites were measured and the peaks due to the presence of au were not identified as the amount of au was not sufficient to detect by xrd 3 4 optical properties measurement by uv vis spectrophotometry the absorption spectra drs of uncontaminated tio2 wo3 and wo3 tio2 hetero junction nanocomposite in a number of compositions of wo3 is shown in fig 4 the photocatalytic samples were heat treated by 320 c for 2 h the band gap of wo3 and tio2 nanoparticles have been determined from the absorption spectra of the semiconductors the estimated band gap of wo3 from the tauc s plot as shown in inset of fig 4 is 2 68 ev which is resembling with the previous reports 29 31 and it is yellow in color the band gap of tio2 has also been calculated from the same inset of fig 4 and it is 3 20 ev and this value is quite similar to others 4 6 thus the composite wo3 tio2 becomes more yellow colored with increasing wo3 content in the composite photocatalyst the absorption edge of clean wo3 was 462 nm measured from the direct extrapolation of the steep part of the curve to the reference point as exhibited in fig 4 however heterocomposite wo3 tio2 demonstrated significant absorption within visible spectrum that is further improved with the enhancement of wo3 fraction 3 5 photocatalytic decomposition of phenol and methylene blue dye to evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency of the synthesized sample we have considered phenol a small organic molecule and methylene blue dye a comparatively bigger molecule as typical model organic pollutant the degradation efficiency of the catalyst has been measured in aqueous phase under visible light irradiation λ 420 nm as shown in fig 5 photocatalytic degradation trend of phenol with wo3 wo3 tio2 composite of different compositions is demonstrated in fig 5 a the catalytic efficiency of degussa p25 was carried out under identical condition and included in fig 5 a to compare the activity with that of prepared composite wo3 tio2 samples as indicated in fig 5 a that 5 mol wo3 tio2 composite exhibited highest catalytic efficiency to decompose phenol in aqueous phase among the wo3 tio2 heterojunctions and degussa p25 after 120 min of visible light irradiation 52 degradation of phenol was observed with 5 mol wo3 tio2 heterojunction whereas degussa p25 demonstrated low catalytic activity 40 41 and this is 5 2 times higher than degussa p25 photocatalytic efficiency of the composite samples was measured to decompose methylene blue dye in aqueous phase and shown in fig 5 b a similar trend was detected for the degradation of methylene blue dye as that of phenol e g 5 mol wo3 tio2 heterojunction exhibited maximum catalytic activity among the wo3 tio2 heterocomposite 42 decomposition of dye was obtained after 120 min of visible light irradiation it is 5 3 times higher than commercial photocatalyst degussa p25 for further improvement of photocatalytic efficiency of 5 mol wo3 tio2 composite optimized composition among the composite samples as indicated in fig 5 a and b au nanoparticles have been loaded on to the surface of 5 mol wo3 tio2 composite and demonstrated photocatalytic activity to degrade phenol in aqueous phase under visible light irradiation and showed in fig 5 c different weight percent of au nanoparticles with respect to 5 mol wo3 tio2 heterojunction have been prepared as indicated in fig 5 c among the compositions 0 25 wt of au loaded 5 mol wo3 tio2 heterojunction exhibited best photocatalytic efficiency even better than 5 mol wo3 tio2 however 52 decomposition of phenol was done with 5 mol wo3 tio2 composite after 120 min of visible light irradiation whereas 63 degradation was achieved with 0 25 wt of au loaded 5 mol wo3 tio2 under identical condition this is about 1 21 times higher than that of 5 mol wo3 tio2 composite photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared au loaded 5 mol wo3 tio2 heterojunction measured in case of methylene blue dye as illustrated in fig 5 d under the identical condition that of phenol resembling without being identical results were found and 52 decomposition was obtained with 0 25 wt of au loaded 5 mol wo3 tio2 this is 1 24 times higher than 5 mol wo3 tio2 in decomposing methylene blue dye 3 6 measurement of photochemical stability the photochemical stability of 0 25 au loaded wo3 tio2 5 mol wo3 and 95 mol tio2 heterocomposite photocatalyst was assessed for the decomposition of phenol in aqueous phase by reutilizing the photocatalytic sample for several times au loaded wo3 tio2 nanocomposite photocatalyst was recovered and recycled five times under ambient condition in every cycle the photocatalyst sample was added in phenol solution stirred in dark for 30 min to get equilibrium and subsequently irradiated for 120 min as in the photocatalytic efficiency test afterwards aliquot of phenol solution was taken and measured absorbance to check the remaining phenol in solution using spectrophotometer after every experimental cycle the photocatalytic sample was collected by filtration and washed with water and ethanol the sample was dried under vacuum and reutilize to photo decompose of phenol following the same experimental condition for testing the photochemical stability this procedure was repeated five times and the data are given in fig 6 it is clear from the fig 6 that no significant change in photocatalytic performance to degrade phenol was observed in repeated cycle which highlights the photochemical reproducibility of au loaded wo3 tio2 composite photocatalyst 3 7 surface area and rate constant bet surface area of the optimized 5 mol wo3 tio2 composite photocatalyst and different weight percent au loaded 5 mol wo3 tio2 photocatalyst samples were measured and exhibited in table 1 it has been calculated photocatalytical degradation rate constant and rate constant per unit surface area of phenol and methylene blue dye and shown in table 1 as illustrated in table 1 that bet of wo3 tio2 composite demonstrated 48 62 m 2 g 1 whereas au loaded wo3 tio2 photocatalyst samples showed 49 41 m 2 g 1 these values indicate that the bet surface area was not changed significantly due to the presence of au nanoparticles on to the surface of wo3 tio2 as the deposited au nanoparticle was 0 35 the photocatalytic decomposition rate constant per unit surface area of phenol is 0 01817 and 0 02135 h 1 m 2 with wo3 tio2 and 0 25 au wo3 tio2 respectively the similar parameter for dye is 0 01452 and 0 01735 h 1 m 2 with wo3 tio2 and 0 25 au wo3 tio2 respectively it is revealed that degradation rate constant and rate constant per unit surface area are followed similar trend for photocatalytic decomposition both for phenol and dye as that of shown in fig 5 it is reasonable to think that photocatalytic reactions are independent of bet surface area 3 8 discussion enhancement of photocatalytic activity by coupling of semiconductors than the individual components are widely reported 20 42 44 in this system recombination photocorrosion or neutralization of photo excited electrons e and holes h are inhibited and thus photocatalytic efficiency of the composite system is increased loading of noble metals on the surface of heterocomposite and or metal oxides greatly increase photocatalytic efficiency of loaded system by retarding the mentioned adverse effect of photocatalysis under visible light irradiation 31 36 in our au loaded heterocomposite wo3 tio2 demonstrated extraordinarily high photocatalytic activity compare to wo3 tio2 composite towards the decomposition of organic pollutants in aqueous phase band gaps of wo3 and tio2 semiconductors are 2 68 ev and 3 20 ev respectively vb position of wo3 is 3 18 v and 2 91 v for tio2 accordingly 0 5 v is the cb position of wo3 and 0 29 v of tio2 thus vb of wo3 is situated below than that of tio2 and cbs of these semiconductors are located following band gaps and vb positions as shown in fig 7 during irradiation of visible light electrons at the vb of wo3 get excited and moved to cb of wo3 as the band gap of wo3 is 2 68 ev 29 31 these photo excited electrons e may have chance to come back to vb of wo3 or it may take part in the reduction reaction with oxygen and or available organic pollutants which is previously adsorbed on the surface of catalyst nanocomposite or the photo excited electrons will be transferred to au nanoparticles since these au nanoparticles are enough tightly contact on the surface of wo3 tio2 nanocompoaite to interparticle electron transfer presumably the transfer of photo excited electron to au nanoparticle will be faster than to organic pollutants to reduction reactions anyway it is logical to consider that the photo excited electrons will take part according to following reactions 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 aq 0 68 v vs nhe 2 o2 4h 4e 2h2o aq 1 23 v vs nhe it is clear from the eqs 1 and 2 that both the oxygen reduction is multi electrons process one question may be arisen that why is this multielectron without single electron process as mentioned in fig 7 conduction band maximum cbm of wo3 is 0 5 v and this value is sufficiently higher than required potential eqs 1 and 2 while for single electron process it is lower than the required energy as described in eqs 3 and 4 thus it is quite reasonable to think that the reactions shown in eqs 1 and 2 take place in this photocatalytic process 45 46 3 o2 e o2 aq 0 284 v vs nhe 4 o2 h e ho2 aq 0 046 v vs nhe during photoexcitation in presence of visible irradiation holes h are generated in the vb of wo3 and these photogenerated holes h are likely to move to vb of tio2 nanoparticle since the bv of tio2 is located above vb of wo3 however recombination of photo excited electrons e and holes h will be effectively suppressed due to the presence of au nanoparticles on to the surface of wo3 tio2 composite thus the hole h generated at the vb of tio2 will take part at different oxidation reactions with adsorbed organic pollutants and or with h2o oh to form oh to degrade organic pollutants hence this process could be an effective measure to mineralize harmful organic pollutants for clean enjoyable environment 4 conclusion a visible light λ 420 nm active au loaded heteronanocomposite wo3 tio2 has been successfully prepared nanocomposite wo3 tio2 in a series of composition demonstrated better photocatalytic efficiency compare to constituent semiconductor wo3 and tio2 nanoparticle the composition of the composite was optimized to 5 mol wo3 tio2 5 mol wo3 and 95 mol tio2 in terms of photocatalytic efficiency to degrade phenol and methylene blue dye in presence of visible irradiation after loading of au nanoparticle on to the surface of wo3 tio2 nanocomposite the degradation efficiency of au loaded wo3 tio2 was enhanced extraordinarily high than that of composite wo3 tio2 towards the decomposition of organic pollutants like a small molecule phenol and a large molecule methylene blue dye in aqueous phase under visible light irradiation au loaded wo3 tio2 composite was optimized to 0 25 wt au wo3 tio2 after 120 min of visible light irradiation 63 decomposition of phenol and 52 for methylene blue dye was observed that were respectively 1 21 times and 1 24 times better than that of wo3 tio2 under equivalent working condition the enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency by au loaded wo3 tio2 composite ascribed due to favorable appropriate matching of energy band position of wo3 and tio2 nanoparticles that retards recombination of electron e hole h pair and efficient transfer of excited electron from cb of wo3 to au nanoparticle however by loading noble metal nanoparticle on to the surface of heterocomposite the photocatalytic efficiency of noble metal loaded composite might be increased thus this work could be effective to neutralize organic pollutants as well as directive for management of industrial

13987,global environmental pollution is thought to be the principal source of emission of industrial untreated effluent photocatalysis is the versatile process to eliminate these pollutants which is utilizing semiconductor metal oxides a nanocomposite wo3 tio2 working under visible light λ 420 nm has been prepared employing cis butenedioic acid to associate component semiconductors of wo3 and tio2 nanoparticle the composite was optimized to 5 mol wo3 tio2 in terms of photocatalytic activity to decompose phenol and methylene blue dye in aqueous under visible light afterwards au nanoparticle was deposited on to the surface of optimized wo3 tio2 au loaded wo3 tio2 were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem transmission electron microscope tem x ray diffraction xrd energy dispersive x ray spectroscope edx mapping and uv vis absorption spectra photocatalytic efficiency of au wo3 tio2 has been measured to degrade above organic pollutants in aqueous phase under visible light au wo3 tio2 demonstrated extraordinarily high photocatalytic efficiency in decomposing the pollutants compare to 5 mol wo3 tio2 nanocomposite after 120 min of visible irradiation 63 decomposition of phenol and 52 degradation of methylene blue dye was observed under the identical condition the outstanding improvement of photocatalytic efficiency of au wo3 tio2 nanocomposite ascribed due to the perfect matching of energy band positions of wo3 and tio2 which inhibit photo excited e hole h recombination as well as favor inter particle transfer between wo3 and tio2 au nanoparticles enhances transfer of electron e from cb of wo3 thus possible recombination of photo excited electron e hole h pair was retarded and photocatalytic efficiency was greatly improved keywords nanocomposite au loaded wo3 tio2 visible light organic pollutants photocatalysis degradation 1 introduction in current centuries researches have been conducted by investigators to minimize problems of environmental contamination photocatalysts which are prepared from semiconductor materials have gained among the environmentally friendly technologies and have been comprehensively considered for an extensive range of uses 1 3 anatase phase titanium dioxide tio2 has been presented as superb and extensively used semiconductor material for the degradation of significant organic pollutants owing to its physical and chemical stability as well as long term photo stability extraordinary power of oxidation high catalytic action low cost and ease of fabrication due to the presence of tio2 in an aqueous solution numerous organic compounds can be decomposed excited when the energy of the incident photons is equal or larger than the band gap of titanium dioxide 3 2 ev for anatase tio2 4 6 despite various drawbacks tio2 has been utilized in most photocatalytic applications yet suffer due to its easy recombination of photo excited electron e hole h and energy absorption at the uv region of solar spectrum 5 7 with the intention of improving the tio2 photocatalytic activity various researches have focused on two key instructions 1 decrease the photogenerated electron hole recombination rate and lengthen its convenient operating range and 2 rise its surface region and adjust the adsorption properties 8 up to now numerous studies have been stated that the photocatalytic characteristics can effectively be improved by dye sensitization 9 noble metals deposition 10 13 and joining with other semiconductors such as sno2 nio bi2o3 sbxsn1 xo2 fetio3 in2o3 zno cds zro2 cus fe2o3 wo3 sio2 and others 14 28 amongst the metal oxides wo3 has narrower band gap 2 68 ev especially than tio2 that absorb visible light 29 31 by absorbing visible energy from solar spectrum electrons of the vb of wo3 have possibility to excite and transfer to cb in addition wo3 has suitable conduction band cb and valence band vb positions with respect to tio2 and performs hunter for electrons which are photo excited and obtained from tio2 the holes which are produced by photogeneration of the wo3 valence band vb transfer near the valence band vb of tio2 and accumulate in the valence band vb 32 33 by this process the capability of charge transfer is improved and as a consequence photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 composite is also enhanced furthermore the surface acidity of wo3 tio2 rises due to the development of wo3 layer on tio2 which allows the adsorption of larger quantity of organic reactants and hydroxyl groups on the external surface wo3 tio2 composites were produced through various methods for example sol gel ultrasonic spray pyrolysis hydrothermal sol precipitation and so on 34 38 to develop photocatalytic action of tio2 under visible light hence the amalgamation of these two materials can expand photocatalytic activity due to the visible irradiation and escalate charge carrier lifetime thus in these two components system like wo3 tio2 several phenomena may have chances to occur e g photo excited electrons from the cb of wo3 may come back to vb wo3 or vb of tio2 however photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 composite might decrease 30 32 38 39 due to this recombination or neutralization of photo excited electron e hole h anyway the presence of noble metal on to the surface of composite the photo excited electrons in the cb of wo3 will be transferred to the noble metal and thus recombination might be prohibited in this paper wo3 tio2 composites were synthetized through uniting the constituents wo3 and tio2 and the structural properties and contact phenomena of this composite were characterized by xrd sem and tem afterwards wo3 tio2 were optimized in terms of photocatalytic efficiency and to improve photocatalytic activity au loaded wo3 tio2 heterojunctions were prepared utilizing optimized wo3 tio2 composite and were characterized the objective of this research was to modify the band gap energy of wo3 tio2 composite near the visible region and to enhance its photocatalytic efficiency by depositing noble metal like au the photocatalytic activity of wo3 tio2 and au loaded wo3 tio2 composite were tested on phenol and methylene blue dye in aqueous phase under the visible light λ 420 nm irradiation 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of wo3 tio2 nanocomposite tio2 degussa p25 was dissolved in absolute ethanol in a glass beaker under constant magnetic stirring and grinded wo3 powder was taken into this tio2 ethanol solution the tio2 ethanol wo3 suspension was stirred vigorously and continued for 4 h covered with aluminum foil to prevent the minimum loss of ethanol under ambient condition the suspension was dried and annealed to make a tight contact between wo3 and tio2 nanoparticles and elimination of

microscope functioned at 250 kv one mg of the composite was added in 50 ml of absolute ethanol and made a homogeneous solution by ultrasonication one drop of this solution was spread on a holey amorphous carbon film and dried under vacuum 2 4 estimation of photocatalytic activity phenol and methylene blue dye have been utilized as the model compounds to check the efficiency of the prepared photocatalytic samples 1 10 4 mol of degussa p25 and wo3 tio2 composite photocatalysts were suspended separately in 50 ml 5 10 5 m aqueous solution of phenol by magnetic stirrer for the degradation in aqueous solution the remnant phenol obtained from the irradiation of visible light λ 420 nm was investigated from its characteristic absorption peak detected by uv vis spectrophotometer similar procedure was followed for methylene blue dye to measure the photocatalytic efficiency of composite 1 10 4 mol of degussa p25 and wo3 tio2 were suspended separately in 50 ml of 1 10 4m methylene blue dye solution and measured the characteristic peak before going to record the irradiation time defined amount of each sample was stirred for half an hour under dark condition to get equilibrium similar

calculated value is to be 16 36 nm and 26 60 nm respectively the sem images of wo3 tio2 heterojunction shown in fig 1 c and d reveal that the relatively large wo3 particles are covered with nanosized tio2 particles the sizes are probably as small as can be expected depending on chemical synthesis method according to the sem image it could be concluded that this preparation method was appropriate to obtain the wo3 tio2 nanocomposite to make a tight contact between wo3 and tio2 nanoparticles 3 2 study of morphology and contact between the au nanoparticle tio2 and wo3 the tem images of tio2

dye and shown in table 1 as illustrated in table 1 that bet of wo3 tio2 composite demonstrated 48 62 m 2 g 1 whereas au loaded wo3 tio2 photocatalyst samples showed 49 41 m 2 g 1 these values indicate that the bet surface area was not changed significantly due to the presence of au nanoparticles on to the surface of wo3 tio2 as the deposited au nanoparticle was 0 35 the photocatalytic decomposition rate constant per unit surface area of phenol is 0 01817 and 0 02135 h 1 m 2 with wo3 tio2 and 0 25 au wo3 tio2 respectively the similar parameter for dye is 0 01452 and 0 01735 h 1 m 2 with wo3 tio2 and 0 25 au wo3 tio2 respectively it is revealed that degradation rate constant and rate constant per unit surface area are followed similar trend for photocatalytic decomposition both for phenol and dye as that of shown in fig 5 it is reasonable to think that photocatalytic reactions are independent of bet surface area 3 8 discussion enhancement of photocatalytic activity by coupling of semiconductors than the individual components are widely reported 20 42 44 in this system recombination photocorrosion or neutralization of photo excited electrons e and holes h are inhibited and thus photocatalytic efficiency of the composite system is increased loading of noble metals on the surface of heterocomposite and or metal oxides greatly increase photocatalytic efficiency of loaded system by retarding the mentioned adverse effect of photocatalysis under visible light irradiation 31 36 in our au loaded heterocomposite wo3 tio2 demonstrated extraordinarily high photocatalytic activity compare to wo3 tio2 composite towards the decomposition of organic pollutants in aqueous phase band gaps of wo3 and tio2 semiconductors are 2 68 ev and 3 20 ev respectively vb position of wo3 is 3 18 v and 2 91 v for tio2 accordingly 0 5 v is the cb position of wo3 and 0 29 v of tio2 thus vb of wo3 is situated below than that of tio2 and cbs of these semiconductors are located following band gaps and vb positions as shown in fig 7 during irradiation of visible light electrons at the vb of wo3 get excited and moved to cb of wo3 as the band gap of wo3 is 2 68 ev 29 31 these photo excited electrons e may have chance to come back to vb of wo3 or it may take part in the reduction reaction with oxygen and or available organic pollutants which is previously adsorbed on the surface of catalyst nanocomposite or the photo excited electrons will be transferred to au nanoparticles since these au nanoparticles are enough tightly contact on the surface of wo3 tio2 nanocompoaite to interparticle electron transfer presumably the transfer of photo excited electron to au nanoparticle will be faster than to organic pollutants to reduction reactions anyway it is logical to consider that the photo excited electrons will take part according to following reactions 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 aq 0 68 v vs nhe 2 o2 4h 4e 2h2o aq 1 23 v vs nhe it is clear from the eqs 1 and 2 that both the oxygen reduction is multi electrons process one question may be arisen that why is this multielectron without single electron process as mentioned in fig 7 conduction band maximum cbm of wo3 is 0 5 v and this value is sufficiently higher than required potential eqs 1 and 2 while for single electron process it is lower than the required energy as described in eqs 3 and 4 thus it is quite reasonable to think that the reactions shown in eqs 1 and 2 take place in this photocatalytic process 45 46 3 o2 e o2 aq 0 284 v vs nhe 4 o2 h e ho2 aq 0 046 v vs nhe during photoexcitation in presence of visible irradiation holes h are generated in the vb of wo3 and these photogenerated holes h are likely to move to vb of tio2 nanoparticle since the bv of tio2 is located above vb of wo3 however recombination of photo excited electrons e and holes h will be effectively suppressed due to the presence of au nanoparticles on to the surface of wo3 tio2 composite thus the hole h generated at the vb of tio2 will take part at different oxidation reactions with adsorbed organic pollutants and or with h2o oh to form oh to degrade organic pollutants hence this process could be an effective measure to mineralize harmful organic pollutants for clean enjoyable environment 4 conclusion a visible light λ 420 nm active au loaded heteronanocomposite wo3 tio2 has been successfully prepared nanocomposite wo3 tio2 in a series of composition demonstrated better photocatalytic efficiency compare to constituent semiconductor wo3 and tio2 nanoparticle the composition of the composite was optimized to 5 mol wo3 tio2 5 mol wo3 and 95 mol tio2 in terms of photocatalytic efficiency to degrade phenol and methylene blue dye in presence of visible irradiation after loading of au nanoparticle on to the surface of wo3 tio2 nanocomposite the degradation efficiency of au loaded wo3 tio2 was enhanced extraordinarily high than that of composite wo3 tio2 towards the decomposition of organic pollutants like a small molecule phenol and a large molecule methylene blue dye in aqueous phase under visible light irradiation au loaded wo3 tio2 composite was optimized to 0 25 wt au wo3 tio2 after 120 min of visible light irradiation 63 decomposition of phenol and 52 for methylene blue dye was observed that were respectively 1 21 times and 1 24 times better than that of wo3 tio2 under equivalent working condition the enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency by au loaded wo3 tio2 composite ascribed due to favorable appropriate matching of energy band position of wo3 and tio2 nanoparticles that retards recombination of electron e hole h pair and efficient transfer of excited electron from cb of wo3 to au nanoparticle however by loading noble metal nanoparticle on to the surface of heterocomposite the photocatalytic efficiency of noble metal loaded composite might be increased thus this work could be effective to neutralize organic pollutants as well as directive for management of industrial

13988,in this study the effect of ageing on the performance and fouling mechanisms in the ultrafiltration of landfill leachates using titania zirconia zro2 tio2 tubular membrane was thoroughly studied results revealed that the maturation of the leachate has a positive effect on its ultrafiltration with a twofold higher final permeability compared with the young one this is the result of the higher organic load particularly that corresponding to proteins and carbohydrates of the young leachate resistance in series analysis demonstrated that the loss of permeability was mainly due to reversible fouling caused by cake filtration either irrecoverable or irreversible fouling were scarce and not conditioned by the stage of maturation of the leachate chemical oxygen demand cod rejection for the mature leachate varied with volume concentration ratio vcr following an approximately sigmoidal shape from an initial value of 18 5 to a final one of 49 6 with the faster increase at vcr ranging from 1 2 to 1 7 due to the permeation of fatty acids by the ultrafiltration uf membrane on the other hand cod rejection remained approximately constant at 48 during the ultrafiltration of the young leachate which can be attributed to the presence of higher molecular weight compounds in its composition keywords landfill leachate wastewater management ageing ultrafiltration fouling modelling 1 introduction the increasing solid waste landfilling has led to one of the major environmental challenges of today the efficient management of the leachates generated these aqueous wastes which can be defined as the liquid that passes through a landfill and has extracted dissolved and suspended matter from it are considered a significant threat to surface water groundwater and soil 1 many factors have been reported that influence leachate composition such as the age of the landfill the local climate or season the depth of the waste in the landfill and mainly the composition of the waste material 2 4 this fact makes leachate matrices significantly complex and variable 5 which in turns means that the improvement and or development of a generalized treatment method for any leachate to meet the relevant quality standards is not possible 6 in fact leachate treatments are based on process schemes which generally comprise some combination of biological physical and or chemical treatment 7 10 biological treatments are used for removing the biodegradable organic matter content in the leachate while chemical and physical treatments such as flotation coagulation flocculation precipitation adsorption or air stripping are employed as pre treatments in order to improve the efficiency of a subsequent treatment or when a biological oxidation process is hampered by the presence of bio refractory materials like non biodegradable humic and fulvic acids and or undesirable compounds heavy metals aoxs pcbs besides these treatments can also be employed as post treatments after a biological one with the aim of ensuring final polishing level by removing toxic metals and organic compounds 6 10 advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation alone or in combination with uv and uv tio2 photocatalysis which are a particular case of chemical treatment can also be used as post treatments after biodegradation processes for removing recalcitrant compounds 6 in addition to the conventional treatments physical treatments based on membrane technology have emerged as viable alternatives to reach the level of purification needed to fully reduce the negative impact of landfill leachates on the environment either as a main step in a landfill leachate treatment chain or as a single treatment step the use of membrane technologies has shown to be an indispensable means of achieving a high degree of purification of this stream 10 among the various membrane technologies ultrafiltration uf is used in separation and purification because of its high efficiency and lower energy consumption thus reducing treatment costs 11 uf is effective in eliminating macromolecules and particles around 50 of organic matter can be separated from the leachate 12 13 although a study reported uf as a sufficient treatment to ensure the discharge standards for a leachate 13 this technique is not individually used but in combination with others thus uf can serve as a pre treatment prior to reverse osmosis 14 17 nanofiltration 15 evaporation 18 or fenton oxidation 19 and as a post treatment for biologically active carbon 20 adsorption 12 15 21 coagulation 15 lime addition 22 nanofiltration for the concentrate generated 23 air stripping and coagulation 24 or fenton reaction and neutralization 25 particularly this technique can also be effective as a pre treatment for biological degradation of landfill leachate since it helps reducing the content in humic acids which can compromise the efficiency of the biological treatment at this point it should be noted that to the best of our knowledge the effect of the landfill leachate age on the membrane performance has not been studied yet this is surprising because although there are many factors affecting the composition of such leachates this varies greatly depending on the age of the landfill and thus the degree of solid waste stabilization 26 in fact two types of leachates have been defined according to landfill age young and mature young leachates are those which come from landfills less than 1 year old with chemical oxygen demand cod values above 15 g l and the ratio between the biodegradable matter as biological oxygen demand bod5 and the total organic one as cod higher than 0 5 on the other hand mature leachates are those from facilities which are more than 5 years old maturation phase with cod values below 3 g l and mainly composed of a refractory mixture of humic substances their bod5 to cod ratio is lower than 0 1 7 10 it should be noted that the results of ultrafiltration reported in the bibliography for leachates either for the individual operation or coupled with other processes are highly subjected to the age of the specific leachate selected for each experimentation thus making the comparison between the findings of the different studies difficult in view of these considerations the aim of this work was to study for the first time ever the effect of the landfill leachate age on the quality of the effluent treated by uf as a pre treatment prior to a biological process as well as modelling the fouling mechanism of the membrane 2 experimental 2 1 landfill leachates all the leachates used in this study were obtained from the sanitary landfill site la zoreda and provided by cogersa asturias spain two different leachates were employed during the experimentation mature m and young y the young leachate was obtained from a new area of the landfill which is in expansion regarding the mature leachate it comes from an area of the landfill where wastes has not been deposited since 2010 a description of the main physicochemical characteristics of the different leachates can be found in table 1 higher colour value in young leachate has already been reported 27 and can be explained by higher total organic carbon toc and suspended solid concentrations leachates were pre filtered with a metal mesh filter of 250 μm of pore size and 200 mm of diameter cisa spain to remove coarse particles samples were stored at 5 c before being used 2 2 experimental setup a scheme of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 all the ultrafiltration experiments were conducted using a locally house made and assembled system fig 1 this system consisted of a glass vessel of 3 l where the corresponding leachate was stored and pumped towards the ultrafiltration module using a masterflex i p 7591 55 cole parmer usa peristaltic pump attached to an easyload masterflex i p 77601 10 cole parmer usa pump head ultrafiltration cell was composed by a tubular zro2 tio2 membrane 600 6 mm tami industries with an area of 1 14 10 2 m2 and a molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 kda ceramic membranes are more resistant to mechanical chemical thermal or biological stresses than polymeric membranes and they have been already implemented for wastewater treatment 28 also the use of zro2 tio2 in form of particles 29 or membrane additives 30 has been reported to be efficient in reducing the fouling caused by humic acid as for pore size membrane mwco was selected in order to minimize humic acid caused fouling in this sense yan et al 31 have reported that when ultrafiltrating humic acids maximum fluxes can be obtained using membranes within a mwco range between 100 and 300 kda pressure gauges and valves were placed in the flow line before and after the ultrafiltration module in order to measure and set the value of the transmembrane pressure tmp all experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 5 4 l min and cross flow velocity of 3 2 m s over the membrane in order to select the operation temperature a previous study of ultrafiltration performance at temperatures from 50 c to 70 c was performed lower fouling rates and higher fluxes were obtained when higher temperatures were used thus all experiments were carried out at a steady temperature of 70 c the permeate flux was determined by weighing of permeate under a tmp of 1 6 bar temperature was kept at the desired value using a water bath two different kinds of experiments were carried out using this experimental setup see fig 1 i total recycle tr mode and ii volume concentration ratio vcr mode the first one is necessary in order to determine the evolution of membrane fouling with time while the second one is needed to evaluate the effect of concentration on the permeate flux and fouling resistances regarding tr mode experiment retentate and permeate were both completely recirculated to the supply tank and permeate flux was periodically measured until achieving a constant value afterwards membrane was washed with distilled water until the permeate flux did not change with time and then cleaned at 70 c with 0 5 aqueous solution of basic detergent divos 124 vm5 provided by diversey until the final flux was higher than 90 of the initial permeate flux 32 in the case of the vcr mode experiment retentate was also continuously recirculated to the supply tank but permeate was discarded samples of permeate were periodically withdrawn to measure cod toc colour number cn and humic acid retentions as well as permeate fluxes leachate filtration was maintained up to a final vcr of 3 afterwards the uf membrane was washed and cleaned in the same way than that used in the tr mode test both tr and vcr mode experiments were performed at least in duplicate and in all cases the experimental error was below 5 2 3 fouling modelling in order to define the fouling during the ultrafiltration of both leachates in terms of permeability recovery the next equation was employed eq 1 1 j t m p μ r t t m p μ r m r r e v r i r r e v r i r r e c o v where j is the permeate flux m s 1 tmp is the transmembrane pressure kg m 1 s 2 μ is the dynamic viscosity kg m s 1 r t is the total fouling resistance r m is the intrinsic membrane resistance and r r e v r i r r e v and r i r r e c o v are the reversible irreversible and irrecoverable fouling resistances respectively all resistances in m 1 in a practical way reversible fouling is removed by physical cleaning irreversible fouling is eliminated by chemical cleaning and irrecoverable fouling refers to those foulants that cannot be removed by any cleaning step 33 by measuring the initial tap water flux through the membrane j 0 and the permeate fluxes achieved at the end of the ultrafiltration j s and after the physical rinsing with distilled water j p c and chemical j c c cleanings the values of each resistance can be calculated according to the methodology included in the appendix 34 in addition to this resistance in series model based on permeability recovery fouling evolution was also modelled by the hermia s model 35 with the aim of obtaining an in depth knowledge of the fouling mechanisms involved eq 2 2 d j d t k j j 0 j 2 n where k is a constant j 0 is the limiting flux m s 1 and n is a constant with different values for the four simple mechanisms of fouling proposed by hermia complete blocking n 2 k in min 1 standard blocking n 1 5 k in m 1 intermediate pore blocking n 1 k in m 1 and cake filtration n 0 k in min m 2 36 the choice of the best model was based on the sum of squared residuals ssr where each residual was equal to the difference between the experimental data and the value predicted by the model 2 4 analytical methods humic acids were extracted from leachate according the method proposed by thurman and malcolm 37 stated briefly 10 ml of the corresponding sample were acidified with hcl 1 mol l to ph 1 0 in order to precipitate the humic acids then the sample was filtrated and the solid fraction was redissolved in a 7 g l naoh solution until the initial volume is reached absorbance values at 465 nm and 665 nm were measured using a helios alpha uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa a calibration curve was constructed by dissolving different amounts of commercial humic acid sigma aldrich in a 7 g l naoh solution cod was obtained by the dichromate method using a hach dr 2500 spectrophotometer hach company usa 38 toc was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcsh the cn which is defined in eq 3 39 was used to monitor changes in the colour of the leachate during the ultrafiltration process spectral absorbance coefficients sac are defined as the ratio of the values of the respective absorbance over the cell thickness both cn and sac have units of cm 1 this parameter was measured at 436 525 and 620 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific heλios γ 3 c n s a c 436 2 s a c 525 2 s a c 620 2 s a c 436 s a c 525 s a c 620 rejection coefficients were defined as follows eq 4 4 r i 1 c p i c r i where c p i and c r i the concentration of the analyte i in permeate and retentate respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 total recycle mode fig 2 shows the evolution of the permeate flux with time during the ultrafiltration of the mature leachate 2a or the young one 2b in a tr mode the initial water permeability of the membrane was 211 5 l m2 h bar once the filtration of the leachate started this permeability decreased rapidly for both assayed leachates finally reaching constant values of around 37 5 and 17 6 l m2 h bar for the mature and the young leachate respectively after less than 15 min of filtration these results correspond to reductions in permeability at the end of the experiment of 82 3 and 91 7 according to several authors these drastic flux declines observed during the first minutes of filtration may be due to the fast accumulation on the membrane surface of a first layer of fouling which is thin but very resistant to mass transfer due to its low porosity after that the structure of the newly formed layers is less compact indicating the existence of a porosity gradient through the cake thickness 34 40 therefore the maturation of the leachate has a positive effect on its ultrafiltration with a twofold higher final permeability than that obtained with a young leachate as it was previously explained the ageing of the leachate involves a reduction in either its cod or bod5 cod ratio this fact together with the higher concentration of proteins and carbohydrates in the young leachate explain why the old leachate are more easily ultra filtered than the young one 41 42 fig 3 shows the fouling resistances obtained for either the mature or young leachate under tr mode ultrafiltration as expected from the permeability data previously commented total resistance r t for the young leachate 4 4 10 15 m 1 is higher than that obtained for the mature one 2 1 10 15 m 1 nevertheless these results also revealed that the flux decline due to irreversible fouling is significantly lower than that caused by the reversible one thus calculating the r r e v r i r r e v ratio for both leachates the values obtained are 2 8 and 6 3 for the mature and young one respectively in this regard it is also interesting to point out that the resistances due to irreversible fouling for both experiments are somewhat similar indicating that the internal fouling is scarce and not conditioned by the stage of maturation of the leachate considering that reversible fouling is widely associated with the cake layer resistance also known as external fouling whereas the irreversible one has to do with pore fouling resistance or internal fouling results show that the main reason for the permeability decrease during the ultrafiltration of leachates is the external fouling this being higher for younger leachates this fact also implies that the initial membrane permeability can be easily recoverable in a high proportion after leachate ultrafiltration by means of membrane relaxation backflushing or other physical cleaning techniques standard rising 43 in addition leachate age had a negligible effect on both the irreversible or irrecoverable fouling finally low values of r i r r e c o v indicated that more than 99 5 of the initial permeability is recovered after cleaning thus suggesting a long lifespan of the membrane in plant operation either for mature or young leachates although a higher number of physical cleaning cycles would be required during the ultrafiltration of the latter if the filtration sequence filtration followed by physical cleaning does not result in complete recovery of membrane fouling status a chemical cleaning phase is needed which should be optimized in order to maximize as much as possible the cost efficiency of the operation fig 2 shows the results of permeate flux and their fittings to the four simple mechanisms of fouling proposed by hermia additionally table 2 provides the values of the main fitting parameters for each model as well as goodness of fit of the data to the curve based on the results obtained the prevailing fouling model during the ultrafiltration of leachate under tr mode corresponds to cake formation indicating that the accumulation of leachate particles occurred on the surface of the membrane in a permeable cake of increasing thickness until a limit value is reached according to this mechanism the evolution of the permeate fluxes showed in fig 2 could be explained as follows the first phase of flux decline observed during the first few seconds or minutes of operation is primarily due to concentration polarization the second phase of flux decline is slower and is attributed to the formation of a complete surface layer over the initial mono layer the third phase represents a quasi steady state period wherein the flux decline occurs slowly and may be due to the consolidation of the fouling layer due to a balance between the deposition of foulants on the cake and their removal due to the shear stress caused by the cross flow 20 the final achievement of a final cake with an almost constant thickness is consistent with the prevalence of an external fouling observed from the analysis of the resistance in series mode ma et al 44 also found that cake filtration was the main fouling mechanism involved during the ultrafiltration of humic acid with and without addition of inorganic salts syzdek and ahlert 14 reported some results during the ultrafiltration of a high strength industrial landfill leachate which suggested the predominance of cake formation as main fouling mechanism as well for example the fouling layer did not block the passage of organic carbon across the membrane but only created a pressure drop that resulted in a lower flux the occurrence of this fouling mechanism poses operational implications when working with a non foulant stream a linear relationship between applied tmp and flux is assumed nonetheless if fouling particles present in the stream are larger than the membrane pore size a fouling cake will eventually deposit on the membrane surface this phenomenon occurs more drastically when higher pressures are applied compressing the fouling cake and minimizing membrane flux 45 it has been reported that in these cases reynolds number happens to be more relevant for flux improving that applied pressure 46 making it possible to minimize the fouling layer by increasing the shear at the membrane surface several authors reported that fouling of the majority of membrane processes applied to leachate treatment was mainly due to the presence of humic substances in the leachate organic fraction 22 47 if the formation of an external fouling layer as suggested by previous fouling models is assumed then it is also reasonable to suppose that humic acids are mainly retained on the membrane surface it should be highlighted that interactions between humic acids as well as other natural organic matter and the membrane are of hydrophobic nature 48 and thus a high ionic strength of the stream fosters membrane fouling caused by humic acid 31 as the concentrations of humic acids are quite similar in both leachates because the biodegradability of these compounds is almost null the lower permeability of the young leachate should be associated with the species which are biologically degraded during its maturation considering that the fouling associated with humic substances is approximately the same the leachates which are degraded during the landfill maturation are responsible for the 75 calculation based on k i of the fouling observed during the ultrafiltration of the leachate in tr mode 3 2 volume concentration ratio mode in order to gather information about the influence of solute concentration on the permeability and membrane rejection during the ultrafiltration of either the young or mature leachates a set of experiments without permeate recirculation to the feed tank were also carried out it is worth noting here that whereas the tr mode simulates a continuous filtration the aim of these experiments named as vcr mode is to study the batch filtration and decide the most convenient solute concentration in a continuous filtration fig 4 shows the evolution with time of the permeate flux during the vcr mode ultrafiltration of a mature a or a young leachate b as in the case of tr the decline in the permeate flux for the young leachate was stronger than that obtained for the mature one again the reduction in the permeability mainly occurred during the first minutes of filtration nevertheless the permeability losses were more noticeable for the vcr mode filtration than for the tr mode operations as expected due to the gradual increase in the concentration of the feed so the final permeate fluxes for vcr mode experiments with mature or young leachates were a 41 and 55 lower than those obtained during the ultrafiltration intr mode these results indicate that the fouling resistance r t r m during the batch ultrafiltration vcr mode is approximately twofold higher than that of the continuous one tr mode under the same time of filtration 60 min more specifically the fouling resistances obtained during tr and vcr mode experiments were 2 8 1015 and 5 0 1015 m 1 for the mature leachate and 5 1 1015 and 11 2 1015 m 1 for the young one respectively using the resistance in series model see fig 3 it can be deduced that the main contribution to this resistance is due to reversible fouling which represented 70 and 88 of the total fouling for the mature and young leachates respectively these percentages were pretty similar to those obtained under tr mode nevertheless the irreversible fouling during the batch ultrafiltration increased substantially in comparison to the continuous one although no significant differences were found between young and mature leachates fig 3 regarding the irrecoverable fouling its contribution to the total fouling was negligible for both leachates using again the individual fouling models proposed by hermia 35 fig 4 and table 2 the loss of permeability during the batch ultrafiltration of either the mature or young leachate was mainly attributed to the cake formation mechanism as with the continuous one the predominance of this fouling model is consistent with the high proportion of reversible fouling 49 fig 5 shows the evolution of the rejection coefficients for cod r c o d toc r t o c colour r c n and humic acids r h a as well as the permeate flux with the vcr mode during the ultrafiltration of either a mature or young leachate dealing first with permeate fluxes the evolutions of these with vcr are the expected ones for both leachates differentiating three periods thus a rapid flux drop was observed initially which was mainly attributed to concentration polarization followed by a less marked decrease in the flux due to irreversible fouling and a final period corresponding to a small flux decrease as can be seen in fig 5 the short duration of the second period suggests that internal fouling is not significant as it was deduced from the analysis of resistances regarding the latter period it is usually associated with the foulant deposition on the membrane surface that is to say the reversible fouling 50 during this stage approximately constant fouling rates of 4 3 10 3 or 7 9 10 3 m 1 h 1 were observed for the mature or the young leachate respectively regarding the rejection coefficients their evolutions differed between leachates for instance the cod rejection for the mature leachate showed an approximately sigmoidal shape from an initial value of 18 5 to a final one of 49 6 with the faster increase at vcr ranging from 1 2 to 1 7 nevertheless this parameter seemed to remain approximately constant during the ultrafiltration of the young leachate although a slight increase was perceived at the beginning of the filtration concerning r t o c it showed similar values to r c o d throughout the filtration experiment nevertheless in the case of the young one the r c o d values were slightly higher than that of the r t o c at the beginning of the ultrafiltration in regard to cn the rejections were significantly higher for the mature leachate although a decrease in the rcn for mature leachate during the early stages of the operation could be seen these differences in the evolution of the cod toc and cn rejections for both leachates can be explained on the basis of their composition a more in depth and detailed discussion of this statement will be carried out in the next section 3 3 fouling mechanism the previous observations on permeate fluxes and rejection coefficients seem to suggest that there is clear connection between ultrafiltration performance and the changes in the leachate composition due to landfill ageing in this regard and before developing this relationship it is interesting to mention that landfills undergo at least four stages of decomposition during their ageing an initial aerobic phase an anaerobic acid phase an initial methanogenic phase and finally a stable methanogenic phase thus existing a strong relationship between the state of refuse decomposition and its corresponding leachate characteristics 51 on the basis of size exclusion chromatography results aftab and hur 52 proposed that leachates are composed by five different fractions biopolymers 10 kda humic substances approx 1 kda building blocks 300 500 da and low molecular neutrals and acids 350 da as the landfill is becoming older biopolymers are broken up into building blocks and these are decomposed and transformed into simple molecules such as fatty acids carbon dioxide and methane whereas humic substances are hardly modified due to their recalcitrant character 17 53 see fig 6 therefore a high relative abundance of low molecular weight compounds in the mature leachate but not in the young one is accepted in this sense mohammadzadeh and clark reported that leachates generated in an area of old wastes were mainly composed of humic substances and simple fatty acids mostly acetic and propionic 53 taking into account that cod and toc measurements include all the organic compounds the small fatty acids easily passed through the membrane during the first minutes of ultrafiltration of the mature leachate thus increasing the permeate cod and toc and reducing the initial r c o d and r t o c as it is observed in fig 5 meanwhile the proportion of compounds with higher molecular weight in the retentate increased once most of the fatty acids had already been removed the cod and toc values in the permeate mainly depended on the presence of humic substances on it obviously this causes a progressive increase in the cod and toc rejection thereby the rejection coefficients of the compounds tend to approximate to that of the higher molecular size that is to say to the humic acids one r h a thus explaining the sigmoidal evolution of r c o d and r t o c observed in fig 5 at this point it should be pointed out that the increase in the humic acids rejection during the first minutes of filtration was probably due to the rapid development of a fouling layer on the membrane surface as explained above this external fouling layer is mainly made up of humic acids and acts as a dynamic membrane reducing the permeability and increasing r h a 44 54 the additional barrier would not have influence on the pass of small molecules such as the fatty acids so its reject coefficient would not be affected once the cake was formed its compaction and or the consolidation of irreversible fouling are likely the main reasons why the r h a slightly increased after the external fouling layer was formed fig 5 50 55 with regard to the high values of r c n it should be taken into account that mature leachate is mainly composed of humic acids which are highly coloured and simple fatty acids which are colourless therefore permeate results in an almost colourless stream thus achieving a high colour retention due to humic acid retention on the other hand the composition of a young leachate is more complex when compared with mature leachates the lower relative content in small molecules of the young ones can also explain the results depicted in fig 5 thus the small variation in r c o d with vcr observed for the young leachate instead of the sigmoidal tendency of the mature one can be attributed to the higher abundance of high molecular weight compounds and their cohesive interactions facilitated by the higher ionic strength of the young leachate 56 taking into account that the molecular weight cut off of the membrane is 150 kda and the predominance of biopolymers 10 kda and humic acids approx 1 kda in the young leachate cod and humic acids rejections should be pretty similar to each other as was experimentally proved fig 5 4 52 as for r c n lower values were observed in comparison to that of the mature leachate this can be explained considering the chemical nature of the young leachate this stream is highly complex as opposed to the mature leachate which as it was previously mentioned is mainly made up of humic acids and simple fatty acids thus both retentate and permeate will be richer in coloured species therefore reducing colour differences between these streams finally the experimental evidence that total resistance for the young leachate is higher than that of the mature one can be also linked to the leachate composition young leachate has a high proportion of biopolymers 10 kda while organic matter in mature leachate consists basically of humic substances renou et al 22 reported that the major cause of ceramic membrane fouling during the ultrafiltration of landfill leachate was the formation of precipitated humic acid on the surface of the membrane fostered by the presence of calcium ions nevertheless during the filtration of young leachate interactions between the deposited humic acid and biopolymers present in the stream are expected generating a thicker less permeable fouling cake fig 2 in this sense jermann et al observed that humic acids could act as a bridge between alginate and membrane resulting in a more stable and less reversible fouling layer 41 in a similar way xiao et al also reported the interaction proneness between humic acids polysaccharides and proteins 42 4 conclusions results suggest that there is a clear connection between ultrafiltration performance and the changes in the leachate composition due to landfill ageing both young and mature leachates cause a very steep permeate flux decline during the first minutes of filtration probably due to the fast accumulation on the membrane surface of a first layer of fouling in a second stage the flux declines slower caused by the consolidation of the fouling layer due to a balance between the deposition of foulants on the cake and their removal produced by the shear stress of the cross flow the maturation of the leachate has a positive effect on the permeability with a twofold higher final permeability than that obtained with a young leachate this finding is likely related to the higher concentration of proteins and carbohydrates in the young leachate the main reason for the decrease of permeability during the ultrafiltration of leachates is the external fouling this being higher for younger leachates resistance in series analysis demonstrated that the loss of permeability was mainly due to reversible fouling either irrecoverable or internal fouling were scarce and not determined by the stage of maturation of the leachate this leads to suggest a long lifespan of the membrane in plant operation since more than 99 5 of the initial permeability can be recovered after cleaning the prevailing fouling model during the ultrafiltration of both leachates is the corresponding to cake formation either under tr or vcr modes cod rejection for the mature leachate showed an approximately sigmoidal shape from an initial value of 18 5 to a final one of 49 6 with the faster increase for vcr ranging from 1 2 to 1 7 the main reason for this behaviour is due to the fatty acids are not retained by the uf membrane on the

13988,in this study the effect of ageing on the performance and fouling mechanisms in the ultrafiltration of landfill leachates using titania zirconia zro2 tio2 tubular membrane was thoroughly studied results revealed that the maturation of the leachate has a positive effect on its ultrafiltration with a twofold higher final permeability compared with the young one this is the result of the higher organic load particularly that corresponding to proteins and carbohydrates of the young leachate resistance in series analysis demonstrated that the loss of permeability was mainly due to reversible fouling caused by cake filtration either irrecoverable or irreversible fouling were scarce and not conditioned by the stage of maturation of the leachate chemical oxygen demand cod rejection for the mature leachate varied with volume concentration ratio vcr following an approximately sigmoidal shape from an initial value of 18 5 to a final one of 49 6 with the faster increase at vcr ranging from 1 2 to 1 7 due to the permeation of fatty acids by the ultrafiltration uf membrane on the other hand cod rejection remained approximately constant at 48 during the ultrafiltration of the young leachate which can be attributed to the presence of higher molecular weight compounds in its composition keywords landfill leachate wastewater management ageing ultrafiltration fouling modelling 1 introduction the increasing solid waste landfilling has led to one of the major environmental challenges of today the efficient management of the leachates generated these aqueous wastes which can be defined as the liquid that passes through a landfill and has extracted dissolved and suspended matter from it are considered a significant threat to surface water groundwater and soil 1 many factors have been reported that influence leachate composition such as the age of the landfill the local climate or season the depth of the waste in the landfill and mainly the composition of the waste material 2 4 this fact makes leachate matrices significantly complex and variable 5 which in turns means that the improvement and or development of a generalized treatment method for any leachate to meet the relevant quality standards is not possible 6 in fact leachate treatments are based on process schemes which generally comprise some combination of biological physical and or chemical treatment 7 10 biological treatments are used for removing the biodegradable organic matter content in the leachate while chemical and physical treatments such as flotation coagulation flocculation precipitation adsorption or air stripping are employed as pre treatments in order to improve the efficiency of a subsequent treatment or when a biological oxidation process is hampered by the presence of bio refractory materials like non biodegradable humic and fulvic acids and or undesirable compounds heavy metals aoxs pcbs besides these treatments can also be employed as post treatments after a biological one with the aim of ensuring final polishing level by removing toxic metals and organic compounds 6 10 advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation alone or in combination with uv and uv tio2 photocatalysis which are a particular case of chemical treatment can also be used as post treatments after biodegradation processes for removing recalcitrant compounds 6 in addition to the conventional treatments physical treatments based on membrane technology have emerged as viable alternatives to reach the level of purification needed to fully reduce the negative impact of landfill leachates on the environment either as a main step in a landfill leachate treatment chain or as a single treatment step the use of membrane technologies has shown to be an indispensable means of achieving a high degree of purification of this stream 10 among the various membrane technologies ultrafiltration uf is used in separation and purification because of its high efficiency and lower energy consumption thus reducing treatment costs 11 uf is effective in eliminating macromolecules and particles around 50 of organic matter can be separated from the leachate 12 13 although a study reported uf as a sufficient treatment to ensure the discharge standards for a leachate 13 this technique is not individually used but in combination with others thus uf can serve as a pre treatment prior to reverse osmosis 14 17 nanofiltration 15 evaporation 18 or fenton oxidation 19 and as a post treatment for biologically active carbon 20 adsorption 12 15 21 coagulation 15 lime addition 22 nanofiltration for the concentrate generated 23 air stripping and coagulation 24 or fenton reaction and neutralization 25 particularly this technique can also be effective as a pre treatment for biological degradation of landfill leachate since it helps reducing the content in humic acids which can compromise the efficiency of the biological treatment at this point it should be noted that to the best of our knowledge the effect of the landfill leachate age on the membrane performance has not been studied yet this is surprising because although there are many factors affecting the composition of such leachates this varies greatly depending on the age of the landfill and thus the degree of solid waste stabilization 26 in fact two types of leachates have been defined according to landfill age young and mature young leachates are those which come from landfills less than 1 year old with chemical oxygen demand cod values above 15 g l and the ratio between the biodegradable matter as biological oxygen demand bod5 and the total organic one as cod higher than 0 5 on the other hand mature leachates are those from facilities which are more than 5 years old maturation phase with cod values below 3 g l and mainly composed of a refractory mixture of humic substances their bod5 to cod ratio is lower than 0 1 7 10 it should be noted that the results of ultrafiltration reported in the bibliography for leachates either for the individual operation or coupled with other processes are highly subjected to the age of the specific leachate selected for each experimentation thus making the comparison between the findings of the different studies difficult in view of these considerations the aim of this work was to study for the first time ever the effect of the landfill leachate age on the quality of the effluent treated by uf as a pre treatment prior to a biological process as well as modelling the fouling mechanism of the membrane 2 experimental 2 1 landfill leachates all the leachates used in this study were obtained from the sanitary landfill site la zoreda and provided by cogersa asturias spain two different leachates were employed during the experimentation mature m and young y the young leachate was obtained from a new area of the landfill which is in expansion regarding the mature leachate it comes from an area of the landfill where wastes has not been deposited since 2010 a description of the main physicochemical characteristics of the different leachates can be found in table 1 higher colour value in young leachate has already been reported 27 and can be explained by higher total organic carbon toc and suspended solid concentrations leachates were pre filtered with a metal mesh filter of 250 μm of pore size and 200 mm of diameter cisa spain to remove coarse particles samples were stored at 5 c before being used 2 2 experimental setup a scheme of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 all the ultrafiltration experiments were conducted using a locally house made and assembled system fig 1 this system consisted of a glass vessel of 3 l where the corresponding leachate was stored and pumped towards the ultrafiltration module using a masterflex i p 7591 55 cole parmer usa peristaltic pump attached to an easyload masterflex i p 77601 10 cole parmer usa pump head ultrafiltration cell was composed by a tubular zro2 tio2 membrane 600 6 mm tami industries with an area of 1 14 10 2 m2 and a molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 kda ceramic membranes are more resistant to mechanical chemical thermal or biological stresses than polymeric membranes and they have been already implemented for wastewater treatment 28 also the use of zro2 tio2 in form of particles 29 or membrane additives 30 has been reported to be efficient in reducing the fouling caused by humic acid as for pore size membrane mwco was selected in order to minimize humic acid caused fouling in this sense yan et al 31 have reported that when ultrafiltrating humic acids maximum fluxes can be obtained using membranes within a mwco range between 100 and 300 kda pressure gauges and valves were placed in the flow line before and after the ultrafiltration module in order to measure and set the value of the transmembrane pressure tmp all experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 5 4 l min and cross flow velocity of 3 2 m s over the membrane in order to select the operation temperature a previous study of ultrafiltration performance at temperatures from 50 c to 70 c was performed lower fouling rates and higher fluxes were obtained when higher temperatures were used thus all experiments were carried out at a steady temperature of 70 c the permeate flux was determined by weighing of permeate under a tmp of 1 6 bar temperature was kept at the desired value using a water bath two different kinds of experiments were carried out using this experimental setup see fig 1 i total recycle tr mode and ii volume concentration ratio vcr mode the first one is necessary in order to determine the evolution of membrane fouling with time while the second one is needed to evaluate the effect of concentration on the permeate flux and fouling resistances regarding tr mode experiment retentate and permeate were both completely recirculated to the supply tank and permeate flux was periodically measured until achieving a constant value afterwards membrane was washed with distilled water until the permeate flux did not change with time and then cleaned at 70 c with 0 5 aqueous solution of basic detergent divos 124 vm5 provided by diversey until the final flux was higher than 90 of the initial permeate flux 32 in the case of the vcr mode experiment retentate was also continuously recirculated to the supply tank but permeate was discarded samples of permeate were periodically withdrawn to measure cod toc colour number cn and humic acid retentions as well as permeate fluxes leachate filtration was maintained up to a final vcr of 3 afterwards the uf membrane was washed and cleaned in the same way than that used in the tr mode test both tr and vcr mode experiments were performed at least in duplicate and in all cases the experimental error was below 5 2 3 fouling modelling in order to define the fouling during the ultrafiltration of both leachates in terms of permeability recovery the next equation was employed eq 1 1 j t m p μ r t t m p μ r m r r e v r i r r e v r i r r e c o v where j is the permeate flux m s 1 tmp is the transmembrane pressure kg m 1 s 2 μ is the dynamic viscosity kg m s 1 r t is the total fouling resistance r m is the intrinsic membrane resistance and r r e v r i r r e v and r i r r e c o v are the reversible irreversible and irrecoverable fouling resistances respectively all resistances in m 1 in a practical way reversible fouling is removed by physical cleaning irreversible fouling is eliminated by chemical cleaning and irrecoverable fouling refers to those foulants that cannot be removed by any cleaning step 33 by measuring the initial tap water flux through the membrane j 0 and the permeate fluxes achieved at the end of the ultrafiltration j s and after the physical rinsing with distilled water j p c and chemical j c c cleanings the values of each resistance can be calculated according to the methodology included in the appendix 34 in addition to this resistance in series model based on permeability recovery fouling evolution was also modelled by the hermia s model 35 with the aim of obtaining an in depth knowledge of the fouling mechanisms involved eq 2 2 d j d t k j j 0 j 2 n where k is a constant j 0 is the limiting flux m s 1 and n is a constant with different values for the four simple mechanisms of fouling proposed by hermia complete blocking n 2 k in min 1 standard blocking n 1 5 k in m 1 intermediate pore blocking n 1 k in m 1 and cake filtration n 0 k in min m 2 36 the choice of the best model was based on the sum of squared residuals ssr where each residual was equal to the difference between the experimental data and the value predicted by the model 2 4 analytical methods humic acids were extracted from leachate according the method proposed by thurman and malcolm 37 stated briefly 10 ml of the corresponding sample were acidified with hcl 1 mol l to ph 1 0 in order to precipitate the humic acids then the sample was filtrated and the solid fraction was redissolved in a 7 g l naoh solution until the initial volume is reached absorbance values at 465 nm and 665 nm were measured using a helios alpha uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa a calibration curve was constructed by dissolving different amounts of commercial humic acid sigma aldrich in a 7 g l naoh solution cod was obtained by the dichromate method using a hach dr 2500 spectrophotometer hach company usa 38 toc was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcsh the cn which is defined in eq 3 39 was used to monitor changes in the colour of the leachate during the ultrafiltration process spectral absorbance coefficients sac are defined as the ratio of the values of the respective absorbance over the cell thickness both cn and sac have units of cm 1 this parameter was measured at 436 525 and 620 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific heλios γ 3 c n s a c 436 2 s a c 525 2 s a c 620 2 s a c 436 s a c 525 s a c 620 rejection coefficients were defined as follows eq 4 4 r i 1 c p i c r i where c p i and c r i the concentration of the analyte i in permeate and retentate respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 total recycle mode fig 2 shows the evolution of the permeate flux with time during the ultrafiltration of the mature leachate 2a or the young one 2b in a tr mode the initial water permeability of the membrane was 211 5 l m2 h bar once the filtration of the leachate started this permeability decreased rapidly for both assayed leachates finally reaching constant values of around 37 5 and 17 6 l m2 h bar for the mature and the young leachate respectively after less than 15 min of filtration these results correspond to reductions in permeability at the end of the experiment of 82 3 and 91 7 according to several authors these drastic flux declines observed during the first minutes of filtration may be due to the fast accumulation on the membrane surface of a first layer of fouling which is thin but very resistant to mass transfer due to its low porosity after that the structure of the newly formed layers is less compact indicating the existence of a porosity gradient through the cake thickness 34 40 therefore the maturation of the leachate has a positive effect on its ultrafiltration with a twofold higher final permeability than that obtained with a young leachate as it was previously explained the ageing of the leachate involves a reduction in either its cod or bod5 cod ratio this fact together with the higher concentration of proteins and carbohydrates in the young leachate explain why the old leachate are more easily ultra filtered than the young one 41 42 fig 3 shows the fouling resistances obtained for either the mature or young leachate under tr mode ultrafiltration as expected from the permeability data previously commented total resistance r t for the young leachate 4 4 10 15 m 1 is higher than that obtained for the mature one 2 1 10 15 m 1 nevertheless these results also revealed that the flux decline due to irreversible fouling is significantly lower than that caused by the reversible one thus calculating the r r e v r i r r e v ratio for both leachates the values obtained are 2 8 and 6 3 for the mature and young one respectively in this regard it is also interesting to point out that the resistances due to irreversible fouling for both experiments are somewhat similar indicating that the internal fouling is scarce and not conditioned by the stage of maturation of the leachate considering that reversible fouling is widely associated with the cake layer resistance also known as external fouling whereas the irreversible one has to do with pore fouling resistance or internal fouling results show that the main reason for the permeability decrease during the ultrafiltration of leachates is the external fouling this being higher for younger leachates this fact also implies that the initial membrane permeability can be easily recoverable in a high proportion after leachate ultrafiltration by means of membrane relaxation backflushing or other physical cleaning techniques standard rising 43 in addition leachate age had a negligible effect on both the irreversible or irrecoverable fouling finally low values of r i r r e c o v indicated that more than 99 5 of the initial permeability is recovered after cleaning thus suggesting a long lifespan of the membrane in plant operation either for mature or young leachates although a higher number of physical cleaning cycles would be required during the ultrafiltration of the latter if the filtration sequence filtration followed by physical cleaning does not result in complete recovery of membrane fouling status a chemical cleaning phase is needed which should be optimized in order to maximize as much as possible the cost efficiency of the operation fig 2 shows the results of permeate flux and their fittings to the four simple mechanisms of fouling proposed by hermia additionally table 2 provides the values of the main fitting parameters for each model as well as goodness of fit of the data to the curve based on the results obtained the prevailing fouling model during the ultrafiltration of leachate under tr mode corresponds to cake formation indicating that the accumulation of leachate particles occurred on the surface of the membrane in a permeable cake of increasing thickness until a limit value is reached according to this mechanism the evolution of the permeate fluxes showed in fig 2 could be explained as follows the first phase of flux decline observed during the first few seconds or minutes of operation is primarily due to concentration polarization the second phase of flux decline is slower and is attributed to the formation of a complete surface layer over the initial mono layer the third phase represents a quasi steady state period wherein the flux decline occurs slowly and may be due to the consolidation of the fouling layer due to a balance between the deposition of foulants on the cake and their removal due to the shear stress caused by the cross flow 20 the final achievement of a final cake with an almost constant thickness is consistent with the prevalence of an external fouling observed from the analysis of the resistance in series mode ma et al 44 also found that cake filtration was the main fouling mechanism involved during the ultrafiltration of humic acid with and without addition of inorganic salts syzdek and ahlert 14 reported some results during the ultrafiltration of a high strength industrial landfill leachate which suggested the predominance of cake formation as main fouling mechanism as well for example the fouling layer did not block the passage of organic carbon across the membrane but only created a pressure drop that resulted in a lower flux the occurrence of this fouling mechanism poses operational implications when working with a non foulant stream a linear relationship between applied tmp and flux is assumed nonetheless if fouling particles present in the stream are larger than the membrane pore size a fouling cake will eventually deposit on the membrane surface this phenomenon occurs more drastically when higher pressures are applied compressing the fouling cake and minimizing membrane flux 45 it has been reported that in these cases reynolds number happens to be more relevant for flux improving that applied pressure 46 making it possible to minimize the fouling layer by increasing the shear at the membrane surface several authors reported that fouling of the majority of membrane processes applied to leachate treatment was mainly due to the presence of humic substances in the leachate organic fraction 22 47 if the formation of an external fouling layer as suggested by previous fouling models is assumed then it is also reasonable to suppose that humic acids are mainly retained on the membrane surface it should be highlighted that interactions between humic acids as well as other natural organic matter and the membrane are of hydrophobic nature 48 and thus a high ionic strength of the stream fosters membrane fouling caused by humic acid 31 as the concentrations of humic acids are quite similar in both leachates because the biodegradability of these compounds is almost null the lower permeability of the young leachate should be associated with the species which are biologically degraded during its maturation considering that the fouling associated with humic substances is approximately the same the leachates which are degraded during the landfill maturation are responsible for the 75 calculation based on k i of the fouling observed during the ultrafiltration of the leachate in tr mode 3 2 volume concentration ratio mode in order to gather information about the influence of solute concentration on the permeability and membrane rejection during the ultrafiltration of either the young or mature leachates a set of experiments without permeate recirculation to the feed tank were also carried out it is worth noting here that whereas the tr mode simulates a continuous filtration the aim of these experiments named as vcr mode is to study the batch filtration and decide the most convenient solute concentration in a continuous filtration fig 4 shows the evolution with time of the permeate flux during the vcr mode ultrafiltration of a mature a or a young leachate b as in the case of tr the decline in the permeate flux for the young leachate was stronger than that obtained for the mature one again the reduction in the permeability mainly occurred during the first minutes of filtration nevertheless the permeability losses were more noticeable for the vcr mode filtration than for the tr mode operations as expected due to the gradual increase in the concentration of the feed so the final permeate fluxes for vcr mode experiments with mature or young leachates were a 41 and 55 lower than those obtained during the ultrafiltration intr mode these results indicate that the fouling resistance r t r m during the batch ultrafiltration vcr mode is approximately twofold higher than that of the continuous one tr mode under the same time of filtration 60 min more specifically the fouling resistances obtained during tr and vcr mode experiments were 2 8 1015 and 5 0 1015 m 1 for the mature leachate and 5 1 1015 and 11 2 1015 m 1 for the young one respectively using the resistance in series model see fig 3 it can be deduced that the main contribution to this resistance is due to reversible fouling which represented 70 and 88 of the total fouling for the mature and young leachates respectively these percentages were pretty similar to those obtained under tr mode nevertheless the irreversible fouling during the batch ultrafiltration increased substantially in comparison to the continuous one although no significant differences were found between young and mature leachates fig 3 regarding the irrecoverable fouling its contribution to the total fouling was negligible for both leachates using again the individual fouling models proposed by hermia 35 fig 4 and table 2 the loss of permeability during the batch ultrafiltration of either the mature or young leachate was mainly attributed to the cake formation mechanism as with the continuous one the predominance of this fouling model is consistent with the high proportion of reversible fouling 49 fig 5 shows the evolution of the rejection coefficients for cod r c o d toc r t o c colour r c n and humic acids r h a as well as the permeate flux with the vcr mode during the ultrafiltration of either a mature or young leachate dealing first with permeate fluxes the evolutions of these with vcr are the expected ones for both leachates differentiating three periods thus a rapid flux drop was observed initially which was mainly attributed to concentration polarization followed by a less marked decrease in the flux due to irreversible fouling and a final period corresponding to a small flux decrease as can be seen in fig 5 the short duration of the second period suggests that internal fouling is not significant as it was deduced from the analysis of resistances regarding the latter period it is usually associated with the foulant deposition on the membrane surface that is to say the reversible fouling 50 during this stage approximately constant fouling rates of 4 3 10 3 or 7 9 10 3 m 1 h 1 were observed for the mature or the young leachate respectively regarding the rejection coefficients their evolutions differed between leachates for instance the cod rejection for the mature leachate showed an approximately sigmoidal shape from an initial value of 18 5 to a final one of 49 6 with the faster increase at vcr ranging from 1 2 to 1 7 nevertheless this parameter seemed to remain approximately constant during the ultrafiltration of the young leachate although a slight increase was perceived at the beginning of the filtration concerning r t o c it showed similar values to r c o d throughout the filtration experiment nevertheless in the case of the young one the r c o d values were slightly higher than that of the r t o c at the beginning of the ultrafiltration in regard to cn the rejections were significantly higher for the mature leachate although a decrease in the rcn for mature leachate during the early stages of the operation could be seen these differences in the evolution of the cod toc and cn rejections for both leachates can be explained on the basis of their composition a more in depth and detailed discussion of this statement will be carried out in the next section 3 3 fouling mechanism the previous observations on permeate fluxes and rejection coefficients seem to suggest that there is clear connection between ultrafiltration performance and the changes in the leachate composition due to landfill ageing in this regard and before developing this relationship it is interesting to mention that landfills undergo at least four stages of decomposition during their ageing an initial aerobic phase an anaerobic acid phase an initial methanogenic phase and finally a stable methanogenic phase thus existing a strong relationship between the state of refuse decomposition and its corresponding leachate characteristics 51 on the basis of size exclusion chromatography results aftab and hur 52 proposed that leachates are composed by five different fractions biopolymers 10 kda humic substances approx 1 kda building blocks 300 500 da and low molecular neutrals and acids 350 da as the landfill is becoming older biopolymers are broken up into building blocks and these are decomposed and transformed into simple molecules such as fatty acids carbon dioxide and methane whereas humic substances are hardly modified due to their recalcitrant character 17 53 see fig 6 therefore a high relative abundance of low molecular weight compounds in the mature leachate but not in the young one is accepted in this sense mohammadzadeh and clark reported that leachates generated in an area of old wastes were mainly composed of humic substances and simple fatty acids mostly acetic and propionic 53 taking into account that cod and toc measurements include all the organic compounds the small fatty acids easily passed through the membrane during the first minutes of ultrafiltration of the mature leachate thus increasing the permeate cod and toc and reducing the initial r c o d and r t o c as it is observed in fig 5 meanwhile the proportion of compounds with higher molecular weight in the retentate increased once most of the fatty acids had already been removed the cod and toc values in the permeate mainly depended on the presence of humic substances on it obviously this causes a progressive increase in the cod and toc rejection thereby the rejection coefficients of the compounds tend to approximate to that of the higher molecular size that is to say to the humic acids one r h a thus explaining the sigmoidal evolution of r c o d and r t o c observed in fig 5 at this point it should be pointed out that the increase in the humic acids rejection during the first minutes of filtration was probably due to the rapid development of a fouling layer on the membrane surface as explained above this external fouling layer is mainly made up of humic acids and acts as a dynamic membrane reducing the permeability and increasing r h a 44 54 the additional barrier would not have influence on the pass of small molecules such as the fatty acids so its reject coefficient would not be affected once the cake was formed its compaction and or the consolidation of irreversible fouling are likely the main reasons why the r h a slightly increased after the external fouling layer was formed fig 5 50 55 with regard to the high values of r c n it should be taken into account that mature leachate is mainly composed of humic acids which are highly coloured and simple fatty acids which are colourless therefore permeate results in an almost colourless stream thus achieving a high colour retention due to humic acid retention on the other hand the composition of a young leachate is more complex when compared with mature leachates the lower relative content in small molecules of the young ones can also explain the results depicted in fig 5 thus the small variation in r c o d with vcr observed for the young leachate instead of the sigmoidal tendency of the mature one can be attributed to the higher abundance of high molecular weight compounds and their cohesive interactions facilitated by the higher ionic strength of the young leachate 56 taking into account that the molecular weight cut off of the membrane is 150 kda and the predominance of biopolymers 10 kda and humic acids approx 1 kda in the young leachate cod and humic acids rejections should be pretty similar to each other as was experimentally proved fig 5 4 52 as for r c n lower values were observed in comparison to that of the mature leachate this can be explained considering the chemical nature of the young leachate this stream is highly complex as opposed to the mature leachate which as it was previously mentioned is mainly made up of humic acids and simple fatty acids thus both retentate and permeate will be richer in coloured species therefore reducing colour differences between these streams finally the experimental evidence that total resistance for the young leachate is higher than that of the mature one can be also linked to the leachate composition young leachate has a high proportion of biopolymers 10 kda while organic matter in mature leachate consists basically of humic substances renou et al 22 reported that the major cause of ceramic membrane fouling during the ultrafiltration of landfill leachate was the formation of precipitated humic acid on the surface of the membrane fostered by the presence of calcium ions nevertheless during the filtration of young leachate interactions between the deposited humic acid and biopolymers present in the stream are expected generating a thicker less permeable fouling cake fig 2 in this sense jermann et al observed that humic acids could act as a bridge between alginate and membrane resulting in a more stable and less reversible fouling layer 41 in a similar way xiao et al also reported the interaction proneness between humic acids polysaccharides and proteins 42 4 conclusions results suggest that there is a clear connection between ultrafiltration performance and the changes in the leachate composition due to landfill ageing both young and mature leachates cause a very steep permeate flux decline during the first minutes of filtration probably due to the fast accumulation on the membrane surface of a first layer of fouling in a second stage the flux declines slower caused by the consolidation of the fouling layer due to a balance between the deposition of foulants on the cake and their removal produced by the shear stress of the cross flow the maturation of the leachate has a positive effect on the permeability with a twofold higher final permeability than that obtained with a young leachate this finding is likely related to the higher concentration of proteins and carbohydrates in the young leachate the main reason for the decrease of permeability during the ultrafiltration of leachates is the external fouling this being higher for younger leachates resistance in series analysis demonstrated that the loss of permeability was mainly due to reversible fouling either irrecoverable or internal fouling were scarce and not determined by the stage of maturation of the leachate this leads to suggest a long lifespan of the membrane in plant operation since more than 99 5 of the initial permeability can be recovered after cleaning the prevailing fouling model during the ultrafiltration of both leachates is the corresponding to cake formation either under tr or vcr modes cod rejection for the mature leachate showed an approximately sigmoidal shape from an initial value of 18 5 to a final one of 49 6 with the faster increase for vcr ranging from 1 2 to 1 7 the main reason for this behaviour is due to the fatty acids are not retained by the uf membrane on the other hand cod rejection remains approximately constant during the ultrafiltration of the young leachate 48 which can be attributed to the presence of higher molecular weight compounds in its

13989,in recent years the perception that conventional treatment of waters and effluents produce secondary effluents containing various substances still considered toxic has increased the investigation for more efficient treatment methods the adsorption process on activated carbons acs is an acknowledged tertiary method or of post treatment of effluents in this work several acs obtained from the flamboyant pods were used for the first time for the treatment of effluents generated in an industrial laundry the adsorbents produced by chemical activation and physical activation presented high surface areas from 265 5 to 561 1 m2 g 1 microporous and mesoporous physical characteristic and various acidic and basic functional groups two types of effluents one raw and another previously treated through activated sludge were submitted to adsorption processes and a decrease of the initial values of apparent color turbidity and cod was observed on the other hand the results indicated that the contribution of the porous membranes used in the filtration step for the adsorption process must be considered in order to assess the real adsorption capacity furthermore the uv vis spectra of the effluents indicated the acs have a high capacity of adsorption of compounds which absorb in the visible and ultraviolet regions the adsorption of several components present in the effluents suggests that the flamboyant pods can be explored to produce several acs with potential to be applied together as auxiliary agents with conventional treatments and to improve the reuse of secondary effluents produced after biological treatment keywords activated carbon flamboyant pods adsorption wastewater water remediation 1 introduction the improvement of treatment stages of waters and effluents has become an important research area in the recent years due to a combination of factors such as emergence of new toxic substances with neither disposal legislation nor adequate toxicity studies in the aquatic receptor bodies 1 2 lack of treatment and inappropriate disposal of industrial waste 3 and the acknowledgement that the conventional treatments used in waters and effluents purification are not efficient for the degradation of numerous contaminants 4 it is important to highlight that even secondary effluents resulting from conventional treatments primary and secondary can present remaining compounds with concentrations still considered excessive both for consumption and various other reutilization 4 5 for these reasons tertiary treatments post treatments or combined treatments of waters and effluents have stimulated interest to the scientific community emphasizing treatments where the adsorption on activated carbons acs is used in a stage of the process 6 10 2 11 the acs have been considered as very effective adsorbents for the adsorption removal of varied undesirable organic compounds with several advantages in comparison to other treatment methods and whose usage and implementation normally allow the final effluents to achieve a discharge standard 1 3 7 12 the versatility of these adsorbents has been proven in recent works as for example i the removal of antibiotics beta blockers and psychiatric drugs combining acs with ultrafiltration 4 ii the treatment of coking wastewater with a biological aerobic process combined with two adsorption stages with acs 5 iii the cork wastewater purification combining flocculation and adsorption 6 iv the removal of carbamazepine from complex wastewater of pharmaceutical industry using an integrated fenton system and with acs 7 v combination of electrocoagulation and adsorption for the removal of total organic carbon from peat solution 11 two methods of chemical and physical activation have been employed for the production of these adsorbents 13 the chemical activation involves the usage of activating agents such as naoh koh zncl2 h3po4 and others 3 14 15 while the physical activation involves the use of oxidizing gases as co2 steam and other mixtures 3 14 15 the physical and chemical characteristics of acs depend on the activation method used 1 over the past years the utilization of biomasses as renewable precursors for the acs production has been improved due to the need to lower costs reduce accumulated agro industrial waste and mainly to carry out processes environmentally correct 1 15 3 11 a very successful example is the use of flamboyant pods delonix regia as precursors for the production of a carbon activated chemically with naoh which after an optimization process presented a surface area superior to 2500 m2 g 1 16 the application of this material for the removal of various dyes in aqueous solution showed a capacity of adsorption highly superior in comparison to other adsorbents 17 19 despite the observed potentiality of the flamboyant pods as precursors their utilization for acs production processes using physical or chemical activations with activating agents different of naoh has been rarely reported only one work on adsorption involving chemical activation with zncl2 20 and two preparations of catalytic supports involving physical activations with steam 21 22 in addition to the best of our knowledge there is no previously published study using acs produced from flamboyant pods for the treatment of industrial effluents in the present work the potential of flamboyant pods as precursors was explored implementing chemical and physical activations using various conditions of temperature time and impregnation ratio with zncl2 and co2 activating agents respectively also the new adsorbents produced and one adsorbent optimized according a previous work 16 were used for the first time for the treatment of effluents generated in an industrial laundry in which parameters of water quality such as apparent color turbidity chemical oxygen demand conductivity and ph were monitored 2 material and methods 2 1 processes of chemical naoh or zncl2 and physical co2 activations of the flamboyant pods the flamboyant pods were washed dried in a drying oven fanem 315 se at 110 c for 24 h and submitted to a granulometric separation using a stirrer bertel and a series of tyler sieves solotest in the carbonization stage the pods 6 0 0001 g with particle size between 250 and 425 μm were introduced in a horizontal stainless steel reactor and heated in a programmable muffle furnace edg 3p s 7000 to 500 c heating rate of 20 c min 1 and kept in this temperature for an hour and a half the carbonization was performed under a steady flow of n2 of 100 cm3 min 1 the chemical activation process of the flamboyant pods with naoh used in this work followed a procedure optimized through multivariate statistical methods as detailed in a previous article 16 in the chemical activation with zncl2 the carbonized material was mixed using impregnation ratios zncl2 char equal to 1 1 2 1 or 3 1 in a vertical stainless steel reactor under magnetic stirring together with a small quantity of water for 2 h subsequently the mixture was dried at 130 c for 4 h the dried mixture was placed in a muffle furnace and heated until the temperature reached 600 700 or 800 c with a heating rate of 20 c min 1 maintaining this temperature for 90 min the activation was carried out under a n2 steady flow of 100 cm3 min 1 after the activation step the resulting mixture was washed with a solution of hcl 0 1 mol l 1 and hot distilled water until it reached a ph of 6 5 in the stages of washing the acs were vacuum filtered using membranes of 0 45 μm millipore iso9001 the obtained acs were dried at 110 c for 24 h and stored properly in the physical activation with co2 an amount equal to 3 0 0001 g of flamboyant pods was placed in a vertical stainless steel reactor thereafter the precursor was heated in a muffle furnace until reaching 700 or 800 c with heating rate up to 20 c min 1 under an initial flow of n2 100 cm3 min 1 after reaching the desired temperature the n2 gas flow was substituted for a co2 gas flow 100 cm3 min 1 maintaining the respective temperatures under oxidant environment for 1 or 2 h after that period the co2 gas was once more substituted for n2 so that the cooling of the activated material taken place under inert atmosphere then the acs were washed with distilled water using membranes of 0 45 μm millipore iso9001 the acs obtained were dried at 110 c for 24 h and stored properly the yield of the activation process to all these methods was determined through ratio mac mp 100 where mac and mp are the final activated carbon dry weight g and the precursor dry weight g respectively in order to facilitate the identification of these adsorbents the following abbreviations were used ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh for the acs obtained using the activation agents zncl2 co2 e naoh respectively 2 2 porosity parameters and surface chemistry the porosity parameters were obtained from adsorption and desorption of nitrogen at 77 k using a surface area analyzer quantachrome nova1200 the surface area sbet was determined using the isotherms and the bet equation 23 the total volume of the pore vt was obtained from the amount adsorbed in p p 0 99 the mesopore volume vm was calculated using the difference between the total pore volume vt and micropore volume vμ the micropore volume vμ and the pore diameter dp were obtained using the equipment software the point in which the total charge on the surface of the acs is zero phdrift and the amounts of acidic and basic oxygenated groups boehm titration were determined according to prahas et al 24 the surface organic structures of the acs were studied by ft ir spectra recorded at 0 5 cm 1 of resolution and between 4000 and 220 cm 1 using a ft ir frontier single range mir spectrometer perkin elmer the attenuated total reflectance diamond crystal was used as sampling technique 2 3 effluent sampling two types of effluents were collected from an industrial laundry dinâmica in the region of maringá state of paraná brazil the system of effluents treatment in the laundry is conducted biologically through an activated sludge system simple samples of the raw effluent re and the effluent treated by laundry itself te were used as adsorbates the samplings were carried out in the output channel of the effluent using polyethylene containers which were immediately sealed after the collection tagged and taken to the lab to perform the initial analyses all the samples were stored in a refrigerator temperature between 1 and 6 c 2 4 effluents adsorption experiments the samples re and te were used as adsorbates to perform adsorption tests with the adsorbents acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 the experiments were carried out using falcon conical tubes of 50 ml in which 40 ml of the effluents re or te were placed in contact using a shaker with 0 04 g of the adsorbent 1 g l 1 the effluents re e te were not previously filtered in order to simulate a real application process of acs in the effluents of the industrial laundry the time of contact between adsorbates and adsorbents was 4 h 240 rpm at a temperature of 20 4 24 5 c after this period the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane millipore iso9001 to separate the particles of acs from remaining solutions the analyses of apparent color turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod conductivity and ph were carried out after this filtration process the influence of the filtration stage was also taken into account all these experiments were performed in triplicates finally the absorption spectra uv vis of the samples range of 200 800 nm were obtained using a spectrophotometer uv vis perkin elmer 2 5 parameters analysed in effluents the analyses of apparent color turbidity cod conductivity and ph were carried out according to standard methods 25 for the apparent color analyses it was used the 2120 c method the samples were homogenized and read against an analytical curve in a digital spectrophotometer using a 5 cm glass cubete merck modelo nova 60 the results were expressed in mg pt co l 1 for the turbidity analyses the method 2130 b was used the samples were homogenized so as not to generate air bubbles and then inserted into the turbidimeter cell policontrol model ap 2000 homogenized again and finally read in the same apparatus the values obtained were expressed in nephelometric turbidity units ntu nanocolor tube tests were used during the cod analyses with results expressed in units of mg o2 l 1 this method has as principle the photometric determination of the dichromate ion concentration reduction after the organic matter oxidation this oxidation occurs with k2cr2o7 h2so4 ag2so4 and hgso4 after digestion the remaining k2cr2o7 not reduced was determined using an analytical curve the test tube was opened slowly covered with 2 ml of sample closed and homogenized after homogenization the tube was placed in the digester block at 148 c for 2 h finally after the sample homogenization and turbidity decantation the samples were analysed using a digital spectrophotometer nanocolor model 500d the samples were evaluated in the following ranges 2 40 mg o2 l 1 345 nm 15 160 mg o2 l 1 436 nm and 100 1500 mg o2 l 1 620 nm the conductivity analyses results expressed as μs cm 1 and ph were done following the methods 2510 b and 4500 h b respectively for these last two analyses the samples were kept at a temperature around 25 c homogenized and the conductivity electrode gehaka model cg 1800 or ph electrode phtek model phs 3b and the temperature compensation sensor were inserted in the falcon conical tubes containing the samples all these experiments were performed in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents in this work two different acs groups were prepared by chemical activations with zncl2 and physical activations with co2 of flamboyant pods furthermore optimized acs were also produced according to a previous work 16 in order to perform comparisons these three types of acs were applied in adsorption processes of two types of industrial effluents the value of the porosity parameters for the acop naoh previously published were 16 sbet 2854 m2 g 1 vp 1 60 cm3 g 1 vμ 1 44 cm3 g 1 vm 0 16 cm3 g 1 vμ 90 vm 10 and dp 2 24 nm yield 10 80 table 1 shows all the yields for the adsorbents ac zncl2 and ac co2 obtained it was observed that different temperatures and impregnation ratios influenced the final yield of these adsorbents for ac zncl2 yields in the range of 19 8 32 3 were obtained and it is possible to notice that when the activation temperature from 600 to 800 c and the impregnation ratio from 1 1 to 3 1 increased the yield of the acs decreased the abovementioned decrease is associated with the degradation of materials as high temperatures and impregnation ratios were used during the activation process however the yields for different ac zncl2 were higher than the one reported for acop naoh 10 80 this is due to the fact that naoh is a stronger activating agent than zncl2 i e the latter produces less decomposition of the precursor material during the activation process in addition it is interesting to notice that at activation temperatures of 800 c table 1 there was less influence of the impregnation ratio in the final yields for ac zncl2 remaining close to the three impregnation ratios the condition in which was used a temperature of activation and impregnation ratio at 800 c and 1 1 respectively presented the highest yield 23 2 on the other hand the activation temperature increase and the activation time increase resulted in a final yield decrease of adsorbents ac co2 presenting yields in the range of 6 2 16 1 table 1 the low yields are associated with a highly oxidizing atmosphere of co2 which easily degrades lignocellulosic materials the following reactions which are purely descriptive describe this process according to eqs 1 3 26 1 c s c o 2 g c o g c o 2 c o c o 3 c o c o g eq 1 shows the reaction between the carbon atoms present in the carbonized material and the co2 g molecules in this stage the formation of carbon oxygen complexes occurs represented as c o eq 2 demonstrates how these complexes become unstable and suppress the reaction sites in the carbon surface while eq 3 indicates how the decomposition destruction of these complexes releases co g leaving the surface of the carbon free for subsequent reactions when high temperatures and highly oxidizing environments are used eq 3 probably take place predominantly which explains the degradation of the carbon oxygen complexes and low final yields 3 1 1 physical characterization of adsorbents fig 1 a d shows different isotherms obtained in different conditions for ac zncl2 and ac co2 the table 1 values and the fig 1a c adsorption isotherms indicate that at activation temperatures of 600 and 700 c the ac zncl2 surface areas sbet m2 g 1 increased with the impregnation ratios increase in contrast at activation temperature of 800 c the impregnation ratio increase decreased sbet probably due to a greater degradation of the material in high temperatures values of sbet in the range of 265 5 and 561 1 m2 g 1 were obtained table 1 fig 1a shows that ac zncl2 activated at 600 c presented a very small amount of mesopores with type i isotherms according to the iupac classification 23 however at activation temperatures of 700 c it was observed the presence of hysteresis curves fig 1b which explains the reason why the mesoporosity values for ac zncl2 activated at 700 c are bigger than the ones activated at 600 c furthermore the mesoporosity increase continued when temperatures of 800 c were used fig 1c on the other hand the values of dp table 1 are in the range of 2 and 50 nm characterizing mesoporous materials according to iupac classification 23 15 hu et al 27 carried out a chemical activation with zncl2 associated with a subsequent physical activation with co2 in two different precursors and showed that at activation temperature of 800 c the impregnation ratio increase caused an increase of sbet in one of the precursors in this study it was also observed an increase in the mesopore percentage for both precursors and a decreased final yield in both activated materials khalili et al 28 showed an activation with zncl2 and noted that the impregnation ratio increase generated more mesopores while the sbet only increased until an impregnation ratio equal to 2 5 yorgun et al 29 also used zncl2 as an activating agent and showed that the increase of both the impregnation ratio and the temperature decreased the yield of the obtained materials fig 1d shows the different isotherms obtained for ac co2 with values of sbet in the range of 30 2 and 492 1 m2 g 1 table 1 the sbet values for the ac co2 lower as the activation time and temperature increase this tendency is observed in fig 1d where the hysteresis curves also appear for these adsorbents there was a significant increase of mesopores when the activation temperature was 800 c at this temperature it was observed a mesopore percentage increase from 11 35 to 33 18 a micropore percentage decrease from 88 64 to 66 82 and significant decrease of sbet from 412 2 to 30 2 m2 g 1 when the activation time increased from 1 to 2 h the higher the acs contact time with the oxidizing atmosphere of co2 the higher will be the decomposition of the material and destruction of the pores formed in addition ac co2 showed dp values which increased with the activation time increase and temperature increase during the experiments all with values corresponding to mesoporous adsorbents table 1 the isotherms which presented hysteresis curves in fig 1 according with the iupac classification 23 correspond to the type h4 ones which are characterized for remaining practically horizontal or parallel to the relative pressure axis p p the type h4 hysteresis is associated with narrow slit shaped pores and also with microporosity presence due to the similarity of these isotherms with the type i isotherms 23 similar results were found by prauchner and rodríguez reinoso 30 in their comparative work between chemical and physical activations using h3po4 zncl2 and co2 as activating agents out of all ac zncl2 and ac co2 obtained two adsorbents were selected to be chemically characterized and applied in the adsorption processes of industrial effluents the acs highlighted in bold in table 1 were chosen with the purpose of studying acs with a different characteristic from acop naoh which is essencially microporous ac zncl2 obtained at temperature of 800 c and impregnation ratio of 1 1 presented the greatest yield at this temperature 23 22 as well as the greatest amount of mesopores 14 of all the acs activated with zncl2 on the other hand ac co2 obtained at activation temperature and time of 800 c and 1 h respectively presented significant amounts of mesopores without its sbet being too low in comparison to other adsorbents thus from this point on the abbreviations ac zncl2 and ac co2 will refer uniquely to these two adsorbents 3 1 2 chemical characterization of adsorbents table 2 shows the results of the boehm titration method for the acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 for acop naoh the acidic groups 1 30 mmol g 1 are predominant in comparison to basic groups 0 87 mmol g 1 this indicates that when exposed to an aqueous solution during the adsorption process this adsorbent will present an acidic characteristic ac zncl2 has also presented an acidic characteristic since the amount of acidic groups 1 03 mmol g 1 is almost double that the basic groups one 0 55 mmol g 1 however this amount of acidic groups is inferior to the acop naoh one on the other hand for ac co2 the amount of basic groups 2 41 mmol g 1 is more than twice the acidic groups one 1 01 mmol g 1 this indicates that in aqueous solution this adsorbent will present a basic characteristic it is interesting to note that the quantity of total groups for acop naoh 2 17 mmol g 1 decreased in comparison to ac zncl2 1 58 mmol g 1 in the same way the values of sbet decreased from 2854 m2 g 1 acop naoh section 3 1 to 455 6 m2 g 1 ac zncl2 table 1 table 2 data has also indicated a surface chemistry similar for acop naoh and ac zncl2 probably due to both materials having suffered an activation process involving an activating agent in aqueous solution in contrast even though sbet for ac co2 is the smaller of the three adsorbents 412 2 m2 g 1 table 1 the number of total groups is the higher of all 3 42 mmol g 1 probably the oxidizing atmosphere of co2 has generated a great number of polycyclic polyaromatic pyrone type basic groups during the physical activation 31 figs 2 a c shows the graphs of the method used to find the phdrift of acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 the graphs show on the y axis the ph final values phf or the difference between the initial and final ph phi phf versus the initial ph on the x axis the same characteristics acidic or basic showed in table 2 can be observed for the three acs therefore both acop naoh and ac zncl2 showed phdrift values close to 2 00 in the acidic region fig 2a and b respectively while for ac co2 it was found a phdrift close to 9 00 in the basic region fig 2c figs 3 a c shows the ft ir spectra of the acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 the acid character in the surface of carbon materials has been attributed to presence of carboxyl anhydrides lactones phenol and lactol groups while the basic character corresponds to cyclic ketones pyrone like groups chromenes and cyclic ethers 32 according to figueiredo et al 33 and fuente et al 32 the following regions can be assigned to the functional groups present on the surface of acs i phenolic groups coh stretching 1000 1220 cm 1 oh 1160 1200 cm 1 2500 3620 cm 1 ii cc aromatic stretching 1585 1600 cm 1 iii carboxylic acids 1120 1200 cm 1 1665 1760 cm 1 2500 3300 cm 1 iv cyclic ketones zig zag 1690 1710 cm 1 v pyrones c rings 1450 1640 cm 1 co 1660 1700 cm 1 all of these absorption regions were observed for acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 and appear identified in fig 3a c the identification of acid and basic groups is in agreement with the results showed in table 2 for the three acs 3 2 adsorption of industrial effluents the initial values of apparent color turbidity cod conductivity and ph for re and te were respectively equal to 362 and 42 3 mg pt co l 1 304 and 38 3 ntu 1422 and 63 mg o2 l 1 1622 and 1148 μs cm 1 and 9 04 and 7 32 the results absolute values for re e te after adsorption process are presented in figs 4 7 the abbreviations used in the graphs are the following i initial raw effluent without treatment re ii re effluent treated with acs produced by chemical activation with zncl2 re ac zncl2 iii re effluent treated with acs produced by physical activation with co2 re ac co2 and iv re effluent treated with acs produced by chemical activation with naoh re acop naoh the same nomenclature was used for the samples correspondent to the effluents treated by the industrial laundry te as mentioned in section 2 4 the influence of the filtration stage of acs with the 0 45 μm membranes millipore iso9001 was studied when this filtration is carried out the membrane has the ability to retain some non filtrable or suspended solids as well as different natured particulate materials as a result the simple passage of effluents through the membrane decreases de values of apparent color turbidity and cod therefore is necessary to discern between the individual effect of the membrane and the individual adsorption effect of the acs the correction of the membrane effect was possible by passing the re and te effluents through the 0 45 μm membrane filter without the presence or contact with any of the adsorbents i e without any adsorption process in the case of the conductivity and ph parameters the filtration process does not affect the results the experiments showed that the passage of effluents through the 0 45 μm porous membrane without the presence of the absorbents decreases the initial values of apparent color 362 mg pt co l 1 turbidity 304 ntu and cod 1422 mg o2 l 1 for re to 159 mg pt co l 1 64 5 ntu and 600 mg o2 l 1 respectively these values indicate a decrease in the same order of 56 07 78 78 and 57 81 a similar analysis for te showed that the initial values of apparent color 42 30 mg pt co l 1 turbidity 38 3 ntu and cod 63 mg o2 l 1 decreased to 21 5 mg pt co l 1 2 05 ntu and 28 mg o2 l 1 respectively a decrease of 49 17 94 65 and 55 55 the color due to substances in solution suspended matter finely divided organic and inorganic matter plankton microscopic organism etc contribute to the initial values of apparent color turbidity and cod both re and te once the 0 45 μm membranes possess an important retention the calculous of percentage removal for re and te after adsorption process with acs should take into account this fact all results presented in figs 4a 5 a and 6 a correspond to the corrected values without the individual effect of the membrane fig 4a and b show the apparent color results without and with the influence of the membranes respectively for the re and te effluents in terms of percentage removal for re without membrane influence values of 6 81 337 33 11 01 13 90 311 67 7 50 and 36 64 229 37 13 04 were found for the adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively whereas with membrane influence the percentage removal values for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh increased to 62 89 134 33 11 01 69 98 108 67 7 50 and 92 71 26 37 13 04 respectively in the case of te without membrane influence the removal percentages were 38 94 25 83 1 86 28 13 30 4 4 51 and 40 19 25 30 0 10 for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively whereas with membrane influence values equal to 88 11 5 03 1 86 77 30 9 60 4 51 and 89 36 4 50 0 10 respectively were found the individual adsorption effect of acop naoh showed an important capacity to reduce apparent color for the re 37 and te 40 while ac zncl2 could remove approximately 39 for the te fig 5a and b show the turbidity results without and with the influence of the membranes respectively for the turbidity of re without membrane influence were found values of 4 43 290 53 11 47 11 23 269 87 7 58 and 19 63 244 33 2 45 for the adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively while with membrane influence the removal percentages for the ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh increased to 83 21 51 03 11 47 90 01 30 37 7 58 and 98 41 4 83 2 45 respectively for the turbidity of te without membrane influence the percentages were 1 46 37 74 0 21 0 0 38 42 0 93 and 0 94 37 94 0 17 for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively while with membrane influence values equal to 96 11 1 49 0 21 94 33 2 17 0 93 and 95 59 1 69 0 17 respectively were found these results indicate that the individual effect of membranes is very significant for the turbidity of re and te samples if compared to the individual effect of acs fig 6a and b shows the results for the cod without and with the influence of the membranes respectively in terms of percentage removal without membrane influence for the re values of 10 29 1275 67 37 87 14 58 1214 67 52 16 and 32 42 961 0 2 64 were found for the adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively in the same order values of 68 10 453 67 37 87 72 39 392 67 52 16 and 90 22 139 0 2 64 were found for the re with membrane influence for the cod of the te without membrane influence values equal to 24 87 47 33 0 58 19 05 51 0 6 93 and 25 92 46 67 0 58 for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively were found whereas percentages equal to 80 43 12 33 0 58 74 60 16 0 6 93 and 81 48 11 67 0 58 respectively were found with membrane influence the individual adsorption effect of acop naoh shows an important capacity to reduce dqo for the re 32 and less capacity for the te 26 while ac zncl2 could remove approximately 25 for the te when analyzing the general tendencies of re samples with and without membrane influence of the three adsorbents in relation to the parameters of apparent color fig 4a turbidity fig 5a and cod fig 6a the removal efficiency follows the descending order re acop naoh re ac co2 re ac zncl2 the higher removal efficiency of acop naoh in relation to ac co2 and ac zncl2 is probably due to the large surface area and acidic characteristic table 2 and fig 2a section 3 1 of this adsorbent it is interesting to see that the figs 4b 5 b and 6 b allow to compare the te samples re treated by the industrial laundry and re acop naoh re treated to the acop naoh and with membrane influence thus the following values respectively were observed for the samples te and re acop naoh i apparent color 42 3 and 26 37 mg pt co l 1 ii turbidity 38 3 and 4 83 ntu and iii cod 63 0 and 139 0 mg o2 l 1 an increased removal of the parameters of apparent color and turbidity of the re samples was obtained whereas the treatment carried out by the laundry has been superior for the removal of cod according to katheresan et al 14 the international standard of dye effluent discharge into the environment for ph and cod are between 6 and 9 and below 50 mg l 1 respectively on the other hand lu et al 34 indicated discharge standards according to ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china equals to 50 pt co l 1 100 mg l 1 and between 6 and 9 for apparent color cod and ph respectively it is also worth highlighting that the role played by the filtration membranes in adsorption studies involving the acs in laboratory scale can be compared keeping in mind the specific characteristics with other processes used in waters and effluents treatment for example sbardella et al 4 using a system combined of biological activated carbon filter coupled with an ultrafiltration for the removal of many antibiotics beta blockers and psychiatric drugs of a secondary effluent verified that the physical adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism of these pharmaceutic compounds similarly paredes et al 8 applied acs as post treatment of two secondary effluents previously treated with biological systems integrated with an ultrafiltration membrane or a settler to remove many organic micropollutants on the other hand in figs 4 a b 5 a b and 6 a b it was observed that the values of apparent color turbidity and cod reduced or remained constant for the te samples when treated with the three types of acs these results indicate that these acs could also be used in tertiary treatments as for example after the biological treatment performed by the industrial laundry to direct or indirect reuse of final effluents fig 7a and b show the results for conductivity and ph respectively the variation in the values of conductance was not significant for the adsorption process involving the three acs both for the re in the range of 1622 and 1633 μs cm 1 and te in the range of 1104 and 1148 μs cm 1 samples it is pertinent to emphasize that the re and te effluents had already presented high initial values of conductance fig 7a due to large amounts of salts sodium carbonate for example used in the numerous processes of the industrial laundry cai et al 35 described a precursor chemically activated with naoh in the treatment of electroplating wastewater in which was verified that the presence of several anions no3 so4 2 and cl in the environment has not affected the cr iv removal apparently a similar behavior was observed in this work the variation of ph for the re from 9 to 7 and the te maintained in neutrality were significant mostly for re samples fig 7b the decrease of ph for the re samples after adsorption process can be attributed to interactions such as a neutralization between the functional groups of acs table 2 and fig 3 and the compounds present in the effluents large amounts of soap organic matter salts metals fat and a wide range of reactive dyes used by the industrial laundry can be present in this type of effluents which can also influence this ph change 3 2 1 uv vis spectra of effluents the uv vis spectra of effluents re and te treated with adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh are shown in fig 8a and b respectively due to the fact that the dyes or their degradation products are not retained during the filtration process the analysis of the spectra is not influenced by the membrane fig 8a shows four spectra corresponding to re re ac zncl2 re ac co2 and re acop naoh the spectrum corresponding to re samples indicates that among the numerous compounds present in the effluent there is a significative presence of those which absorb in the range of 390 460 nm and 560 670 nm the reactive dyes used in the laundry are usually very colorful and can absorb visible radiation in fig 8a is observed that the absorption bands decrease after the treatment with the three acs due to the process of adsorption removal of these dyes or compounds able to absorb these wavelengths considering the maximum wavelengths λmax equal to 412 and 600 nm fig 8a the reduction percentages of signals for the spectra of re ac zncl2 re ac co2 and re acop naoh in comparison to initial re spectrum were equal to 41 55 30 57 and 90 35 respectively for the λmax 412 nm while for λmax 600 nm the decreases were 40 69 17 74 and 86 08 respectively the data indicate that acop naoh is an efficient material for the removal of most compounds that absorb these wavelengths in addition the carboxylic acids or phenols present in acop naoh table 2 and fig 3a can remove reactive dyes through a substitution reaction between the nucleophilic groups of the chlorotriazines and hydroxyl groups 36 fig 8b shows the four spectra corresponding to te te ac zncl2 te ac co2 and te acop naoh the spectra of all the te effluents did not present signals in the visible region because they were previously treated by the industrial laundry although there are no signals in the visible region it was observed absorbance signals in the ultraviolet region between 200 and 350 nm deng et al 37 for example used acs to adsorb uv 254 nm quenching substances and verified that the main adsorbed fractions are composed of aromatic compounds such as fulvic acids and humic acids in addition according to ge et al 6 the absorption of compounds in the region uv254 indicates the presence of aromatic rings and unsaturated bonds given that the structure of reactive dyes used by the industrial laundry includes aromatic rings it is possible that various degradation fragments containing aromatic groups are still present in the te effluents the spectra of fig 8b showed that the band in the region between 200 and 350 nm decreased by almost half for te ac zncl2 and te ac co2 while this reduction is even more pronounced for te acop naoh once again it is noted that acop naoh is the most efficient material for the removal of compounds that absorb in this region of the spectrum 200 350 nm the identification and removal of these aromatic compounds is important to minimize the toxicity of secondary effluents considering that several compounds analogous to benzene are carcinogenic 38 as mentioned in section 2 3 the effluents of the industrial laundry were treated biologically through an activated sludge system the results obtained confirm previous works where the associated advantages of combining biological treatments with adsorption processes using acs were reported as for example i the cost reduction of operation and maintenance when acs are used as post treatments of biological systems 37 ii the energy extraction from the organic contaminants of the effluent when the acs are used before bio treatment making the latter more effective 5 iii the obtaining of a final effluent with appropriate disposal standards when the acs are used after bio treatment 5 iv the reduction of several organic micropollutants when the acs are applied as tertiary treatment combined with a biological treatment 8 4 conclusion the chemical and physical activations of the flamboyant pods resulted in microporous and mesoporous adsorbents with a surface chemistry containing various acidic and basic compounds this characteristic expands the application of these materials the results of the acs application in the treatment of the re and te effluents obtained from an industrial laundry showed a significant contribution of the 0 45 μm membranes to the decrease of apparent color turbidity and cod it is essential to consider this contribution in order to know the real contribution of acs the acop naoh presented an important capacity to decrease without the influence of the membrane the apparent color and cod for re 37 and 32 respectively and te 40 and 26 respectively while the ac zncl2 without the influence of the membrane showed to be able to decrease apparent color and cod only for te 39 and 25 respectively this behavior indicates that these adsorbents could serve as auxiliary agents in conventional treatment of raw effluents as well as in tertiary treatments of secondary effluents the possibility of the last application increases considering that the acs have a high adsorption capacity of compounds with absorption in the visible 390 460 nm and 560 670 nm and ultraviolet 200 350 nm regions which also expands the possibilities of direct or indirect reuse of final effluents declaration of competing interest there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome acknowledgements the authors acknowledge capes for the financial support dinâmica for providing the effluent samples and laboratory of

13989,in recent years the perception that conventional treatment of waters and effluents produce secondary effluents containing various substances still considered toxic has increased the investigation for more efficient treatment methods the adsorption process on activated carbons acs is an acknowledged tertiary method or of post treatment of effluents in this work several acs obtained from the flamboyant pods were used for the first time for the treatment of effluents generated in an industrial laundry the adsorbents produced by chemical activation and physical activation presented high surface areas from 265 5 to 561 1 m2 g 1 microporous and mesoporous physical characteristic and various acidic and basic functional groups two types of effluents one raw and another previously treated through activated sludge were submitted to adsorption processes and a decrease of the initial values of apparent color turbidity and cod was observed on the other hand the results indicated that the contribution of the porous membranes used in the filtration step for the adsorption process must be considered in order to assess the real adsorption capacity furthermore the uv vis spectra of the effluents indicated the acs have a high capacity of adsorption of compounds which absorb in the visible and ultraviolet regions the adsorption of several components present in the effluents suggests that the flamboyant pods can be explored to produce several acs with potential to be applied together as auxiliary agents with conventional treatments and to improve the reuse of secondary effluents produced after biological treatment keywords activated carbon flamboyant pods adsorption wastewater water remediation 1 introduction the improvement of treatment stages of waters and effluents has become an important research area in the recent years due to a combination of factors such as emergence of new toxic substances with neither disposal legislation nor adequate toxicity studies in the aquatic receptor bodies 1 2 lack of treatment and inappropriate disposal of industrial waste 3 and the acknowledgement that the conventional treatments used in waters and effluents purification are not efficient for the degradation of numerous contaminants 4 it is important to highlight that even secondary effluents resulting from conventional treatments primary and secondary can present remaining compounds with concentrations still considered excessive both for consumption and various other reutilization 4 5 for these reasons tertiary treatments post treatments or combined treatments of waters and effluents have stimulated interest to the scientific community emphasizing treatments where the adsorption on activated carbons acs is used in a stage of the process 6 10 2 11 the acs have been considered as very effective adsorbents for the adsorption removal of varied undesirable organic compounds with several advantages in comparison to other treatment methods and whose usage and implementation normally allow the final effluents to achieve a discharge standard 1 3 7 12 the versatility of these adsorbents has been proven in recent works as for example i the removal of antibiotics beta blockers and psychiatric drugs combining acs with ultrafiltration 4 ii the treatment of coking wastewater with a biological aerobic process combined with two adsorption stages with acs 5 iii the cork wastewater purification combining flocculation and adsorption 6 iv the removal of carbamazepine from complex wastewater of pharmaceutical industry using an integrated fenton system and with acs 7 v combination of electrocoagulation and adsorption for the removal of total organic carbon from peat solution 11 two methods of chemical and physical activation have been employed for the production of these adsorbents 13 the chemical activation involves the usage of activating agents such as naoh koh zncl2 h3po4 and others 3 14 15 while the physical activation involves the use of oxidizing gases as co2 steam and other mixtures 3 14 15 the physical and chemical characteristics of acs depend on the activation method used 1 over the past years the utilization of biomasses as renewable precursors for the acs production has been improved due to the need to lower costs reduce accumulated agro industrial waste and mainly to carry out processes environmentally correct 1 15 3 11 a very successful example is the use of flamboyant pods delonix regia as precursors for the production of a carbon activated chemically with naoh which after an optimization process presented a surface area superior to 2500 m2 g 1 16 the application of this material for the removal of various dyes in aqueous solution showed a capacity of adsorption highly superior in comparison to other adsorbents 17 19 despite the observed potentiality of the flamboyant pods as precursors their utilization for acs production processes using physical or chemical activations with activating agents different of naoh has been rarely reported only one work on adsorption involving chemical activation with zncl2 20 and two preparations of catalytic supports involving physical activations with steam 21 22 in addition to the best of our knowledge there is no previously published study using acs produced from flamboyant pods for the treatment of industrial effluents in the present work the potential of flamboyant pods as precursors was explored implementing chemical and physical activations using various conditions of temperature time and impregnation ratio with zncl2 and co2 activating agents respectively also the new adsorbents produced and one adsorbent optimized according a previous work 16 were used for the first time for the treatment of effluents generated in an industrial laundry in which parameters of water quality such as apparent color turbidity chemical oxygen demand conductivity and ph were monitored 2 material and methods 2 1 processes of chemical naoh or zncl2 and physical co2 activations of the flamboyant pods the flamboyant pods were washed dried in a drying oven fanem 315 se at 110 c for 24 h and submitted to a granulometric separation using a stirrer bertel and a series of tyler sieves solotest in the carbonization stage the pods 6 0 0001 g with particle size between 250 and 425 μm were introduced in a horizontal stainless steel reactor and heated in a programmable muffle furnace edg 3p s 7000 to 500 c heating rate of 20 c min 1 and kept in this temperature for an hour and a half the carbonization was performed under a steady flow of n2 of 100 cm3 min 1 the chemical activation process of the flamboyant pods with naoh used in this work followed a procedure optimized through multivariate statistical methods as detailed in a previous article 16 in the chemical activation with zncl2 the carbonized material was mixed using impregnation ratios zncl2 char equal to 1 1 2 1 or 3 1 in a vertical stainless steel reactor under magnetic stirring together with a small quantity of water for 2 h subsequently the mixture was dried at 130 c for 4 h the dried mixture was placed in a muffle furnace and heated until the temperature reached 600 700 or 800 c with a heating rate of 20 c min 1 maintaining this temperature for 90 min the activation was carried out under a n2 steady flow of 100 cm3 min 1 after the activation step the resulting mixture was washed with a solution of hcl 0 1 mol l 1 and hot distilled water until it reached a ph of 6 5 in the stages of washing the acs were vacuum filtered using membranes of 0 45 μm millipore iso9001 the obtained acs were dried at 110 c for 24 h and stored properly in the physical activation with co2 an amount equal to 3 0 0001 g of flamboyant pods was placed in a vertical stainless steel reactor thereafter the precursor was heated in a muffle furnace until reaching 700 or 800 c with heating rate up to 20 c min 1 under an initial flow of n2 100 cm3 min 1 after reaching the desired temperature the n2 gas flow was substituted for a co2 gas flow 100 cm3 min 1 maintaining the respective temperatures under oxidant environment for 1 or 2 h after that period the co2 gas was once more substituted for n2 so that the cooling of the activated material taken place under inert atmosphere then the acs were washed with distilled water using membranes of 0 45 μm millipore iso9001 the acs obtained were dried at 110 c for 24 h and stored properly the yield of the activation process to all these methods was determined through ratio mac mp 100 where mac and mp are the final activated carbon dry weight g and the precursor dry weight g respectively in order to facilitate the identification of these adsorbents the following abbreviations were used ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh for the acs obtained using the activation agents zncl2 co2 e naoh respectively 2 2 porosity parameters and surface chemistry the porosity parameters were obtained from adsorption and desorption of nitrogen at 77 k using a surface area analyzer quantachrome nova1200 the surface area sbet was determined using the isotherms and the bet equation 23 the total volume of the pore vt was obtained from the amount adsorbed in p p 0 99 the mesopore volume vm was calculated using the difference between the total pore volume vt and micropore volume vμ the micropore volume vμ and the pore diameter dp were obtained using the equipment software the point in which the total charge on the surface of the acs is zero phdrift and the amounts of acidic and basic oxygenated groups boehm titration were determined according to prahas et al 24 the surface organic structures of the acs were studied by ft ir spectra recorded at 0 5 cm 1 of resolution and between 4000 and 220 cm 1 using a ft ir frontier single range mir spectrometer perkin elmer the attenuated total reflectance diamond crystal was used as sampling technique 2 3 effluent sampling two types of effluents were collected from an industrial laundry dinâmica in the region of maringá state of paraná brazil the system of effluents treatment in the laundry is conducted biologically through an activated sludge system simple samples of the raw effluent re and the effluent treated by laundry itself te were used as adsorbates the samplings were carried out in the output channel of the effluent using polyethylene containers which were immediately sealed after the collection tagged and taken to the lab to perform the initial analyses all the samples were stored in a refrigerator temperature between 1 and 6 c 2 4 effluents adsorption experiments the samples re and te were used as adsorbates to perform adsorption tests with the adsorbents acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 the experiments were carried out using falcon conical tubes of 50 ml in which 40 ml of the effluents re or te were placed in contact using a shaker with 0 04 g of the adsorbent 1 g l 1 the effluents re e te were not previously filtered in order to simulate a real application process of acs in the effluents of the industrial laundry the time of contact between adsorbates and adsorbents was 4 h 240 rpm at a temperature of 20 4 24 5 c after this period the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane millipore iso9001 to separate the particles of acs from remaining solutions the analyses of apparent color turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod conductivity and ph were carried out after this filtration process the influence of the filtration stage was also taken into account all these experiments were performed in triplicates finally the absorption spectra uv vis of the samples range of 200 800 nm were obtained using a spectrophotometer uv vis perkin elmer 2 5 parameters analysed in effluents the analyses of apparent color turbidity cod conductivity and ph were carried out according to standard methods 25 for the apparent color analyses it was used the 2120 c method the samples were homogenized and read against an analytical curve in a digital spectrophotometer using a 5 cm glass cubete merck modelo nova 60 the results were expressed in mg pt co l 1 for the turbidity analyses the method 2130 b was used the samples were homogenized so as not to generate air bubbles and then inserted into the turbidimeter cell policontrol model ap 2000 homogenized again and finally read in the same apparatus the values obtained were expressed in nephelometric turbidity units ntu nanocolor tube tests were used during the cod analyses with results expressed in units of mg o2 l 1 this method has as principle the photometric determination of the dichromate ion concentration reduction after the organic matter oxidation this oxidation occurs with k2cr2o7 h2so4 ag2so4 and hgso4 after digestion the remaining k2cr2o7 not reduced was determined using an analytical curve the test tube was opened slowly covered with 2 ml of sample closed and homogenized after homogenization the tube was placed in the digester block at 148 c for 2 h finally after the sample homogenization and turbidity decantation the samples were analysed using a digital spectrophotometer nanocolor model 500d the samples were evaluated in the following ranges 2 40 mg o2 l 1 345 nm 15 160 mg o2 l 1 436 nm and 100 1500 mg o2 l 1 620 nm the conductivity analyses results expressed as μs cm 1 and ph were done following the methods 2510 b and 4500 h b respectively for these last two analyses the samples were kept at a temperature around 25 c homogenized and the conductivity electrode gehaka model cg 1800 or ph electrode phtek model phs 3b and the temperature compensation sensor were inserted in the falcon conical tubes containing the samples all these experiments were performed in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents in this work two different acs groups were prepared by chemical activations with zncl2 and physical activations with co2 of flamboyant pods furthermore optimized acs were also produced according to a previous work 16 in order to perform comparisons these three types of acs were applied in adsorption processes of two types of industrial effluents the value of the porosity parameters for the acop naoh previously published were 16 sbet 2854 m2 g 1 vp 1 60 cm3 g 1 vμ 1 44 cm3 g 1 vm 0 16 cm3 g 1 vμ 90 vm 10 and dp 2 24 nm yield 10 80 table 1 shows all the yields for the adsorbents ac zncl2 and ac co2 obtained it was observed that different temperatures and impregnation ratios influenced the final yield of these adsorbents for ac zncl2 yields in the range of 19 8 32 3 were obtained and it is possible to notice that when the activation temperature from 600 to 800 c and the impregnation ratio from 1 1 to 3 1 increased the yield of the acs decreased the abovementioned decrease is associated with the degradation of materials as high temperatures and impregnation ratios were used during the activation process however the yields for different ac zncl2 were higher than the one reported for acop naoh 10 80 this is due to the fact that naoh is a stronger activating agent than zncl2 i e the latter produces less decomposition of the precursor material during the activation process in addition it is interesting to notice that at activation temperatures of 800 c table 1 there was less influence of the impregnation ratio in the final yields for ac zncl2 remaining close to the three impregnation ratios the condition in which was used a temperature of activation and impregnation ratio at 800 c and 1 1 respectively presented the highest yield 23 2 on the other hand the activation temperature increase and the activation time increase resulted in a final yield decrease of adsorbents ac co2 presenting yields in the range of 6 2 16 1 table 1 the low yields are associated with a highly oxidizing atmosphere of co2 which easily degrades lignocellulosic materials the following reactions which are purely descriptive describe this process according to eqs 1 3 26 1 c s c o 2 g c o g c o 2 c o c o 3 c o c o g eq 1 shows the reaction between the carbon atoms present in the carbonized material and the co2 g molecules in this stage the formation of carbon oxygen complexes occurs represented as c o eq 2 demonstrates how these complexes become unstable and suppress the reaction sites in the carbon surface while eq 3 indicates how the decomposition destruction of these complexes releases co g leaving the surface of the carbon free for subsequent reactions when high temperatures and highly oxidizing environments are used eq 3 probably take place predominantly which explains the degradation of the carbon oxygen complexes and low final yields 3 1 1 physical characterization of adsorbents fig 1 a d shows different isotherms obtained in different conditions for ac zncl2 and ac co2 the table 1 values and the fig 1a c adsorption isotherms indicate that at activation temperatures of 600 and 700 c the ac zncl2 surface areas sbet m2 g 1 increased with the impregnation ratios increase in contrast at activation temperature of 800 c the impregnation ratio increase decreased sbet probably due to a greater degradation of the material in high temperatures values of sbet in the range of 265 5 and 561 1 m2 g 1 were obtained table 1 fig 1a shows that ac zncl2 activated at 600 c presented a very small amount of mesopores with type i isotherms according to the iupac classification 23 however at activation temperatures of 700 c it was observed the presence of hysteresis curves fig 1b which explains the reason why the mesoporosity values for ac zncl2 activated at 700 c are bigger than the ones activated at 600 c furthermore the mesoporosity increase continued when temperatures of 800 c were used fig 1c on the other hand the values of dp table 1 are in the range of 2 and 50 nm characterizing mesoporous materials according to iupac classification 23 15 hu et al 27 carried out a chemical activation with zncl2 associated with a subsequent physical activation with co2 in two different precursors and showed that at activation temperature of 800 c the impregnation ratio increase caused an increase of sbet in one of the precursors in this study it was also observed an increase in the mesopore percentage for both precursors and a decreased final yield in both activated materials khalili et al 28 showed an activation with zncl2 and noted that the impregnation ratio increase generated more mesopores while the sbet only increased until an impregnation ratio equal to 2 5 yorgun et al 29 also used zncl2 as an activating agent and showed that the increase of both the impregnation ratio and the temperature decreased the yield of the obtained materials fig 1d shows the different isotherms obtained for ac co2 with values of sbet in the range of 30 2 and 492 1 m2 g 1 table 1 the sbet values for the ac co2 lower as the activation time and temperature increase this tendency is observed in fig 1d where the hysteresis curves also appear for these adsorbents there was a significant increase of mesopores when the activation temperature was 800 c at this temperature it was observed a mesopore percentage increase from 11 35 to 33 18 a micropore percentage decrease from 88 64 to 66 82 and significant decrease of sbet from 412 2 to 30 2 m2 g 1 when the activation time increased from 1 to 2 h the higher the acs contact time with the oxidizing atmosphere of co2 the higher will be the decomposition of the material and destruction of the pores formed in addition ac co2 showed dp values which increased with the activation time increase and temperature increase during the experiments all with values corresponding to mesoporous adsorbents table 1 the isotherms which presented hysteresis curves in fig 1 according with the iupac classification 23 correspond to the type h4 ones which are characterized for remaining practically horizontal or parallel to the relative pressure axis p p the type h4 hysteresis is associated with narrow slit shaped pores and also with microporosity presence due to the similarity of these isotherms with the type i isotherms 23 similar results were found by prauchner and rodríguez reinoso 30 in their comparative work between chemical and physical activations using h3po4 zncl2 and co2 as activating agents out of all ac zncl2 and ac co2 obtained two adsorbents were selected to be chemically characterized and applied in the adsorption processes of industrial effluents the acs highlighted in bold in table 1 were chosen with the purpose of studying acs with a different characteristic from acop naoh which is essencially microporous ac zncl2 obtained at temperature of 800 c and impregnation ratio of 1 1 presented the greatest yield at this temperature 23 22 as well as the greatest amount of mesopores 14 of all the acs activated with zncl2 on the other hand ac co2 obtained at activation temperature and time of 800 c and 1 h respectively presented significant amounts of mesopores without its sbet being too low in comparison to other adsorbents thus from this point on the abbreviations ac zncl2 and ac co2 will refer uniquely to these two adsorbents 3 1 2 chemical characterization of adsorbents table 2 shows the results of the boehm titration method for the acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 for acop naoh the acidic groups 1 30 mmol g 1 are predominant in comparison to basic groups 0 87 mmol g 1 this indicates that when exposed to an aqueous solution during the adsorption process this adsorbent will present an acidic characteristic ac zncl2 has also presented an acidic characteristic since the amount of acidic groups 1 03 mmol g 1 is almost double that the basic groups one 0 55 mmol g 1 however this amount of acidic groups is inferior to the acop naoh one on the other hand for ac co2 the amount of basic groups 2 41 mmol g 1 is more than twice the acidic groups one 1 01 mmol g 1 this indicates that in aqueous solution this adsorbent will present a basic characteristic it is interesting to note that the quantity of total groups for acop naoh 2 17 mmol g 1 decreased in comparison to ac zncl2 1 58 mmol g 1 in the same way the values of sbet decreased from 2854 m2 g 1 acop naoh section 3 1 to 455 6 m2 g 1 ac zncl2 table 1 table 2 data has also indicated a surface chemistry similar for acop naoh and ac zncl2 probably due to both materials having suffered an activation process involving an activating agent in aqueous solution in contrast even though sbet for ac co2 is the smaller of the three adsorbents 412 2 m2 g 1 table 1 the number of total groups is the higher of all 3 42 mmol g 1 probably the oxidizing atmosphere of co2 has generated a great number of polycyclic polyaromatic pyrone type basic groups during the physical activation 31 figs 2 a c shows the graphs of the method used to find the phdrift of acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 the graphs show on the y axis the ph final values phf or the difference between the initial and final ph phi phf versus the initial ph on the x axis the same characteristics acidic or basic showed in table 2 can be observed for the three acs therefore both acop naoh and ac zncl2 showed phdrift values close to 2 00 in the acidic region fig 2a and b respectively while for ac co2 it was found a phdrift close to 9 00 in the basic region fig 2c figs 3 a c shows the ft ir spectra of the acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 the acid character in the surface of carbon materials has been attributed to presence of carboxyl anhydrides lactones phenol and lactol groups while the basic character corresponds to cyclic ketones pyrone like groups chromenes and cyclic ethers 32 according to figueiredo et al 33 and fuente et al 32 the following regions can be assigned to the functional groups present on the surface of acs i phenolic groups coh stretching 1000 1220 cm 1 oh 1160 1200 cm 1 2500 3620 cm 1 ii cc aromatic stretching 1585 1600 cm 1 iii carboxylic acids 1120 1200 cm 1 1665 1760 cm 1 2500 3300 cm 1 iv cyclic ketones zig zag 1690 1710 cm 1 v pyrones c rings 1450 1640 cm 1 co 1660 1700 cm 1 all of these absorption regions were observed for acop naoh ac zncl2 and ac co2 and appear identified in fig 3a c the identification of acid and basic groups is in agreement with the results showed in table 2 for the three acs 3 2 adsorption of industrial effluents the initial values of apparent color turbidity cod conductivity and ph for re and te were respectively equal to 362 and 42 3 mg pt co l 1 304 and 38 3 ntu 1422 and 63 mg o2 l 1 1622 and 1148 μs cm 1 and 9 04 and 7 32 the results absolute values for re e te after adsorption process are presented in figs 4 7 the abbreviations used in the graphs are the following i initial raw effluent without treatment re ii re effluent treated with acs produced by chemical activation with zncl2 re ac zncl2 iii re effluent treated with acs produced by physical activation with co2 re ac co2 and iv re effluent treated with acs produced by chemical activation with naoh re acop naoh the same nomenclature was used for the samples correspondent to the effluents treated by the industrial laundry te as mentioned in section 2 4 the influence of the filtration stage of acs with the 0 45 μm membranes millipore iso9001 was studied when this filtration is carried out the membrane has the ability to retain some non filtrable or suspended solids as well as different natured particulate materials as a result the simple passage of effluents through the membrane decreases de values of apparent color turbidity and cod therefore is necessary to discern between the individual effect of the membrane and the individual adsorption effect of the acs the correction of the membrane effect was possible by passing the re and te effluents through the 0 45 μm membrane filter without the presence or contact with any of the adsorbents i e without any adsorption process in the case of the conductivity and ph parameters the filtration process does not affect the results the experiments showed that the passage of effluents through the 0 45 μm porous membrane without the presence of the absorbents decreases the initial values of apparent color 362 mg pt co l 1 turbidity 304 ntu and cod 1422 mg o2 l 1 for re to 159 mg pt co l 1 64 5 ntu and 600 mg o2 l 1 respectively these values indicate a decrease in the same order of 56 07 78 78 and 57 81 a similar analysis for te showed that the initial values of apparent color 42 30 mg pt co l 1 turbidity 38 3 ntu and cod 63 mg o2 l 1 decreased to 21 5 mg pt co l 1 2 05 ntu and 28 mg o2 l 1 respectively a decrease of 49 17 94 65 and 55 55 the color due to substances in solution suspended matter finely divided organic and inorganic matter plankton microscopic organism etc contribute to the initial values of apparent color turbidity and cod both re and te once the 0 45 μm membranes possess an important retention the calculous of percentage removal for re and te after adsorption process with acs should take into account this fact all results presented in figs 4a 5 a and 6 a correspond to the corrected values without the individual effect of the membrane fig 4a and b show the apparent color results without and with the influence of the membranes respectively for the re and te effluents in terms of percentage removal for re without membrane influence values of 6 81 337 33 11 01 13 90 311 67 7 50 and 36 64 229 37 13 04 were found for the adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively whereas with membrane influence the percentage removal values for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh increased to 62 89 134 33 11 01 69 98 108 67 7 50 and 92 71 26 37 13 04 respectively in the case of te without membrane influence the removal percentages were 38 94 25 83 1 86 28 13 30 4 4 51 and 40 19 25 30 0 10 for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively whereas with membrane influence values equal to 88 11 5 03 1 86 77 30 9 60 4 51 and 89 36 4 50 0 10 respectively were found the individual adsorption effect of acop naoh showed an important capacity to reduce apparent color for the re 37 and te 40 while ac zncl2 could remove approximately 39 for the te fig 5a and b show the turbidity results without and with the influence of the membranes respectively for the turbidity of re without membrane influence were found values of 4 43 290 53 11 47 11 23 269 87 7 58 and 19 63 244 33 2 45 for the adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively while with membrane influence the removal percentages for the ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh increased to 83 21 51 03 11 47 90 01 30 37 7 58 and 98 41 4 83 2 45 respectively for the turbidity of te without membrane influence the percentages were 1 46 37 74 0 21 0 0 38 42 0 93 and 0 94 37 94 0 17 for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively while with membrane influence values equal to 96 11 1 49 0 21 94 33 2 17 0 93 and 95 59 1 69 0 17 respectively were found these results indicate that the individual effect of membranes is very significant for the turbidity of re and te samples if compared to the individual effect of acs fig 6a and b shows the results for the cod without and with the influence of the membranes respectively in terms of percentage removal without membrane influence for the re values of 10 29 1275 67 37 87 14 58 1214 67 52 16 and 32 42 961 0 2 64 were found for the adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively in the same order values of 68 10 453 67 37 87 72 39 392 67 52 16 and 90 22 139 0 2 64 were found for the re with membrane influence for the cod of the te without membrane influence values equal to 24 87 47 33 0 58 19 05 51 0 6 93 and 25 92 46 67 0 58 for ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh respectively were found whereas percentages equal to 80 43 12 33 0 58 74 60 16 0 6 93 and 81 48 11 67 0 58 respectively were found with membrane influence the individual adsorption effect of acop naoh shows an important capacity to reduce dqo for the re 32 and less capacity for the te 26 while ac zncl2 could remove approximately 25 for the te when analyzing the general tendencies of re samples with and without membrane influence of the three adsorbents in relation to the parameters of apparent color fig 4a turbidity fig 5a and cod fig 6a the removal efficiency follows the descending order re acop naoh re ac co2 re ac zncl2 the higher removal efficiency of acop naoh in relation to ac co2 and ac zncl2 is probably due to the large surface area and acidic characteristic table 2 and fig 2a section 3 1 of this adsorbent it is interesting to see that the figs 4b 5 b and 6 b allow to compare the te samples re treated by the industrial laundry and re acop naoh re treated to the acop naoh and with membrane influence thus the following values respectively were observed for the samples te and re acop naoh i apparent color 42 3 and 26 37 mg pt co l 1 ii turbidity 38 3 and 4 83 ntu and iii cod 63 0 and 139 0 mg o2 l 1 an increased removal of the parameters of apparent color and turbidity of the re samples was obtained whereas the treatment carried out by the laundry has been superior for the removal of cod according to katheresan et al 14 the international standard of dye effluent discharge into the environment for ph and cod are between 6 and 9 and below 50 mg l 1 respectively on the other hand lu et al 34 indicated discharge standards according to ministry of environmental protection of the people s republic of china equals to 50 pt co l 1 100 mg l 1 and between 6 and 9 for apparent color cod and ph respectively it is also worth highlighting that the role played by the filtration membranes in adsorption studies involving the acs in laboratory scale can be compared keeping in mind the specific characteristics with other processes used in waters and effluents treatment for example sbardella et al 4 using a system combined of biological activated carbon filter coupled with an ultrafiltration for the removal of many antibiotics beta blockers and psychiatric drugs of a secondary effluent verified that the physical adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism of these pharmaceutic compounds similarly paredes et al 8 applied acs as post treatment of two secondary effluents previously treated with biological systems integrated with an ultrafiltration membrane or a settler to remove many organic micropollutants on the other hand in figs 4 a b 5 a b and 6 a b it was observed that the values of apparent color turbidity and cod reduced or remained constant for the te samples when treated with the three types of acs these results indicate that these acs could also be used in tertiary treatments as for example after the biological treatment performed by the industrial laundry to direct or indirect reuse of final effluents fig 7a and b show the results for conductivity and ph respectively the variation in the values of conductance was not significant for the adsorption process involving the three acs both for the re in the range of 1622 and 1633 μs cm 1 and te in the range of 1104 and 1148 μs cm 1 samples it is pertinent to emphasize that the re and te effluents had already presented high initial values of conductance fig 7a due to large amounts of salts sodium carbonate for example used in the numerous processes of the industrial laundry cai et al 35 described a precursor chemically activated with naoh in the treatment of electroplating wastewater in which was verified that the presence of several anions no3 so4 2 and cl in the environment has not affected the cr iv removal apparently a similar behavior was observed in this work the variation of ph for the re from 9 to 7 and the te maintained in neutrality were significant mostly for re samples fig 7b the decrease of ph for the re samples after adsorption process can be attributed to interactions such as a neutralization between the functional groups of acs table 2 and fig 3 and the compounds present in the effluents large amounts of soap organic matter salts metals fat and a wide range of reactive dyes used by the industrial laundry can be present in this type of effluents which can also influence this ph change 3 2 1 uv vis spectra of effluents the uv vis spectra of effluents re and te treated with adsorbents ac zncl2 ac co2 and acop naoh are shown in fig 8a and b respectively due to the fact that the dyes or their degradation products are not retained during the filtration process the analysis of the spectra is not influenced by the membrane fig 8a shows four spectra corresponding to re re ac zncl2 re ac co2 and re acop naoh the spectrum corresponding to re samples indicates that among the numerous compounds present in the effluent there is a significative presence of those which absorb in the range of 390 460 nm and 560 670 nm the reactive dyes used in the laundry are usually very colorful and can absorb visible radiation in fig 8a is observed that the absorption bands decrease after the treatment with the three acs due to the process of adsorption removal of these dyes or compounds able to absorb these wavelengths considering the maximum wavelengths λmax equal to 412 and 600 nm fig 8a the reduction percentages of signals for the spectra of re ac zncl2 re ac co2 and re acop naoh in comparison to initial re spectrum were equal to 41 55 30 57 and 90 35 respectively for the λmax 412 nm while for λmax 600 nm the decreases were 40 69 17 74 and 86 08 respectively the data indicate that acop naoh is an efficient material for the removal of most compounds that absorb these wavelengths in addition the carboxylic acids or phenols present in acop naoh table 2 and fig 3a can remove reactive dyes through a substitution reaction between the nucleophilic groups of the chlorotriazines and hydroxyl groups 36 fig 8b shows the four spectra corresponding to te te ac zncl2 te ac co2 and te acop naoh the spectra of all the te effluents did not present signals in the visible region because they were previously treated by the industrial laundry although there are no signals in the visible region it was observed absorbance signals in the ultraviolet region between 200 and 350 nm deng et al 37 for example used acs to adsorb uv 254 nm quenching substances and verified that the main adsorbed fractions are composed of aromatic compounds such as fulvic acids and humic acids in addition according to ge et al 6 the absorption of compounds in the region uv254 indicates the presence of aromatic rings and unsaturated bonds given that the structure of reactive dyes used by the industrial laundry includes aromatic rings it is possible that various degradation fragments containing aromatic groups are still present in the te effluents the spectra of fig 8b showed that the band in the region between 200 and 350 nm decreased by almost half for te ac zncl2 and te ac co2 while this reduction is even more pronounced for te acop naoh once again it is noted that acop naoh is the most efficient material for the removal of compounds that absorb in this region of the spectrum 200 350 nm the identification and removal of these aromatic compounds is important to minimize the toxicity of secondary effluents considering that several compounds analogous to benzene are carcinogenic 38 as mentioned in section 2 3 the effluents of the industrial laundry were treated biologically through an activated sludge system the results obtained confirm previous works where the associated advantages of combining biological treatments with adsorption processes using acs were reported as for example i the cost reduction of operation and maintenance when acs are used as post treatments of biological systems 37 ii the energy extraction from the organic contaminants of the effluent when the acs are used before bio treatment making the latter more effective 5 iii the obtaining of a final effluent with appropriate disposal standards when the acs are used after bio treatment 5 iv the reduction of several organic micropollutants when the acs are applied as tertiary treatment combined with a biological treatment 8 4 conclusion the chemical and physical activations of the flamboyant pods resulted in microporous and mesoporous adsorbents with a surface chemistry containing various acidic and basic compounds this characteristic expands the application of these materials the results of the acs application in the treatment of the re and te effluents obtained from an industrial laundry showed a significant contribution of the 0 45 μm membranes to the decrease of apparent color turbidity and cod it is essential to consider this contribution in order to know the real contribution of acs the acop naoh presented an important capacity to decrease without the influence of the membrane the apparent color and cod for re 37 and 32 respectively and te 40 and 26 respectively while the ac zncl2 without the influence of the membrane showed to be able to decrease apparent color and cod only for te 39 and 25 respectively this behavior indicates that these adsorbents could serve as auxiliary agents in conventional treatment of raw effluents as well as in tertiary treatments of secondary effluents the possibility of the last application increases considering that the acs have a high adsorption capacity of compounds with absorption in the visible 390 460 nm and 560 670 nm and ultraviolet 200 350 nm regions which also expands the possibilities of direct or indirect reuse of final effluents declaration of competing interest there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome acknowledgements the authors acknowledge capes for the financial support dinâmica for providing the effluent samples and laboratory of
