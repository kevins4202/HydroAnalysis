9480,predicting the impacts of water management policies under uncertainty can support policy makers in making sound decisions most previous methods for policy impact simulation lacked a calibration process that would allow model results to match observed values and did not address the inherent uncertainties to fill this methodological knowledge gap an interval credibility constrained positive mathematical programming icpmp approach was first developed in this study for simulating the impacts of water management policies this method improved over traditional positive mathematical programming in terms of uncertainty treatment it also improved upon inexact programming methods through activating a calibration process icpmp was then coupled with a multi attribute decision making approach leading to a simulation evaluation method that could support the analysis and screening of policy alternatives this method has been applied to an agricultural water management problem in northwestern china various policy alternatives corresponding to different water prices and varied fuzzy credibility levels of water availability were investigated the impacts of these alternatives over farmers income irrigation water consumption benefit per cubic meter of water planting area and fertilizer use were simulated through icpmp forty policy alternatives with better indicator performances were selected to be comprehensively evaluated using the multi attribute decision making approach the results indicated that when the decision makers have a positive preference for water availability the water price at the turning point of water use efficiency i e benefit per cubic of water was recommended when decision makers have conservative attitude towards water availability it was recommended to keep the water price unchanged comparisons of icpmp against traditional methods indicated that icpmp could generate more reliable results through incorporating uncertain information as inputs and reproducing actual situation as well solutions of icpmp could provide in depth analysis of the trade offs between violation risk and system benefits icpmp and the associated simulation evaluation method are also applicable to analyze other types of policies abbreviations fccp fuzzy credibility constrained programming ilp interval linear programming icpmp interval credibility

contradictions between water supply and water demand in recent years the world has been facing severe environmental stress and socio economic challenges chen et al 2020 to alleviate these problems various water management policies have been implemented in many areas such as water pricing policies and water allocation policies xu et al 2018 quay et al 2022 these policies are diverse and their impacts are complicated water management policies directly or indirectly affect many subsystems e g hydrologic agronomic environmental and economic subsystems and trigger changes in many aspects of high attention such as water consumption farmers income and water quality zhang et al 2019a 2019b du et al 2022 meanwhile the impacts of water management policies are susceptible to the uncertainties inherent in natural resources and human activities wu and chen 2015 wu et al 2018 amaranto et al 2022 those all make it extremely difficult to predict and assess the impacts of policies if the impacts of water management policies are insufficiently understood policy formulation practices often inevitably fail to achieve desired results and may even exacerbate problems including but not limited to water shortages and water quality deterioration mehrazar et al 2020 suwal et al 2020 therefore decision support tools for revealing and assessing the impacts of policy alternatives in uncertain environments are urgently needed to help policy makers make informed decisions and formulate sound policies in the past couple of decades a number of quantitative methods have been developed to study policy impacts such as the econometric methods the general computable equilibriums models and the mathematical programming methods wang and xiao 2012 perez blanco and standardi 2019 among them mathematical programming methods e g linear programming and inexact programming have been frequently utilized as they require less data and could provide detailed analysis before policy implementation janssen and van ittersum 2007 ji et al 2018 despite their strengths one of the major problems of the traditional and inexact linear programming methods lied in that the model results might be inconsistent with the actual situation in the absence of calibration nakashima 2011 although these methods attempted to add arbitrary constraints to overcome this limitation such constraints had no clearly defined economic or technical background and would limit the model flexibility rohm and dabbert 2003 besides the solutions of linear programming are obtained at the corner of the feasible region resulting in the model s unsmooth responses to policy changes howitt 1995 nakashima and ishikawa 2017 to overcome these problems positive mathematical programming pmp was developed superior to conventional mathematical programming pmp could be spontaneously calibrated to the actual situation in the base period without affecting the model flexibility and make smooth responses to the policy changes due to its nonlinear objective function howitt 1995 nakashima and ishikawa 2017 zhao et al 2019 previously pmp has been widely used for policy impact analyses in the fields of water resources ali and klein 2014 franco crespo and sumpsi vinas 2017 he et al 2012 maneta et al 2020 for example iglesias and blanco 2008 assessed environmental and socio economic impacts of water pricing policies in spanish irrigated lands zamani et al 2019 studied the impacts of the timing and reduction of water supply on agricultural production those studies have verified that the pmp method could be an effective tool for analyzing impacts of water management policies unfortunately the input parameters of the traditional pmp were assumed to be known with certainty which made them inapplicable to effectively reflect or address real world problems in fact due to the great natural and behavioral variability associated with various processes and factors there were many uncertainties in hydrological and economic systems amaranto et al 2022 in recent years many inexact programming methods including stochastic fuzzy and interval mathematical programming methods have been proposed and proven to be capable of dealing with uncertainties in water resources management tan and zhang 2018 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 among them interval mathematical programming is an effective method in handling uncertainties since it does not require distributional information of parameters huang et al 1992 tan et al 2017 doole and pannell 2009 proposed a method coupling pmp with robust optimization for policy analysis under interval uncertainty although this method was novel its solutions were obtained in the worst case of parameters which could hardly reflect the actual policy impacts in comparison interval linear programming ilp can provide a larger solution space by incorporating infinite parameter values within the intervals into the model input and solution process huang et al 1995 fan 2012 methods that coupled ilp with pmp are promising for policy analysis under uncertainty in spite of this when the parameters are subject to human judgements fuzzy sets would be more suitable for expressing the uncertainty li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 besides fuzzy membership functions are easier to be obtained than probability distributions and they are more informative than interval numbers fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp could effectively reflect the risk violation caused by fuzzy uncertainty in the system arÄ±k 2019 ma et al 2020 maharjan and hanaoka 2020 this approach is more feasible than risk analysis methods based on probability theory arata et al 2017 liu et al 2020 when there is insufficient data to specify the probability distribution functions of parameters to sum up both pmp and inexact programming methods suffer from shortcomings while being applied to policy simulation the traditional pmp could not handle uncertainties which are common in real world problems the inexact programming could handle many types of uncertainties but there are concerns over how the results could mimic the actual situation without affecting the model flexibility although a few studies performed interval uncertainty analyses while calibrating the model it was not suitable for empirical application because of its inherent conservatism and degeneracy in policy analysis doole and kingwell 2010 in addition these studies could not deal with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets to the best of our knowledge there was no existing method that could be capable for calibration based policy simulation under interval and fuzzy uncertainties moreover the selection of desired policy alternatives from the outputs of above mentioned policy simulation models also faces challenges most previous studies on evaluation of policy alternatives could merely be effective when the predicted indicator values were precise which is usually impossible in many circumstances considering the complex responses to policies fragoso et al 2011 gallego ayala 2012 the neglect of inherent uncertainty in real world problems made those studies incapable of providing foresights required for policy development there were a lack of tools that could comprehensively evaluate and screen policy alternatives based on the simulation of their impacts in uncertain environments to remedy the prescribed shortcomings the aim of this study is to develop a novel policy formulation methodology that could credibly simulate and comprehensively assess the impacts of various policies under uncertainty an interval credibility constrained positive mathematical programming icpmp method that integrated ilp fccp and traditional pmp was first proposed for revealing policy impacts in this study icpmp improved over the traditional pmp methods through reflecting and handling uncertain parameters expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets it also outweighed traditional and inexact programming technologies by incorporating a calibration process subsequently a simulation evaluation methodology was then developed by coupling the developed icpmp method with a multi attribute decision making approach madm for supporting the comprehensive comparison and screening of policy alternatives furthermore the methodology has been tested by an agricultural water management case in northwest china the impacts imposed by agricultural water management policies water pricing policies under different water availabilities were simulated and evaluated based on which viable policies that could contribute to sustainable agricultural development were formulated 2 methodology a simulation evaluation methodology originating from pmp inexact programming and multi attribute decision making is developed in this study for the simulation and evaluation of policy alternatives firstly an icpmp method is proposed through seamlessly integrating interval analysis fccp and the pmp method within a general framework the icpmp method could calibrate the model results to observed values as well as deal with interval numbers and fuzzy sets enabling accurate prediction of policy impacts the developed icpmp method is then coupled with the madm method facilitating the evaluation of policy alternatives from multiple aspects and the formulation of desired policies in this study the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach based on maximum deviation md method is selected as the madm method where the md method is utilized to determine the attribute weights this simulation evaluation method is able to identify the best policy alternative based on the simulation results of different policy alternatives under uncertainty 2 1 interval credibility constrained positive mathematical programming approach the standard pmp method developed by howitt 1995 is only suitable for cases where the input parameters of the model are precise in order to effectively deal with the uncertain parameters in real world problems an icpmp method is newly proposed for policy analysis in this study by incorporating interval analysis and fccp into the pmp method the interval analysis in icpmp is based on the interval number theory where the parameters in a model are expressed as interval numbers with known lower and upper bounds huang et al 1995 the fccp method applies credibility theory which can effectively reflect the satisfaction degrees of the constraints using fuzzy sets liu and liu 2002 ma et al 2020 icpmp could improve upon pmp through dealing with uncertainties expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets while overcoming the major shortcoming of traditional and inexact linear programming techniques in model calibration a general formula of icpmp can be written as 1a max z p x c x 1b c x Î± x 0 5 x Î³ x subject to 1c a x b Î¼ 1d x 0 where z denotes the objective function with interval values x is the vector of activity levels i e land area allocated to crops x r n 1 x is the transpose of x x r 1 n p is the vector of output prices per unit of activity p r 1 n c x is the cost function of crop production in quadratic form similar to the cost function of pmp Î± and Î³ are parameters to be calibrated Î± is the vector linking parameters associated with linear terms Î± r 1 n Î³ is a symmetric positive definite matrix of parameters associated with the quadratic term Î³ r n n a denotes a matrix of coefficients in resource constraints a r m n b is a vector of resource availability some or all of the coefficients in the vector are fuzzy numbers b r m 1 and Î¼ is a vector of dual values associated with the constraints eq 1c Î¼ r m 1 r s t are s t interval parameter matrixes the constraints with fuzzy parameters can be transformed into the following credibility constraints by the fccp method liu and liu 2002 ma et al 2020 2 c r j 1 n a i j x i j b i Ï i where c r is the credibility measure of a fuzzy event in i and j represent the i th row and j th column of the matrix respectively and Ï i is the predetermined credibility level i e mean value of the possibility and necessity which represents the satisfaction degree of the associated constraint assume that b i is fully determined by the triplet b i b i b i of crisp numbers with b i b i b i let r i be the real numbers and r i j 1 n a i j x i j according to the definition of fuzzy membership function and credibility measure the credibility of r i b i can be expressed as follows liu and liu 2002 3 c r r i b i 1 i f r i b i 2 b i b i r i 2 b i b i i f b i r i b i r i b i 2 b i b i i f b i r i b i 0 i f r i b i a larger credibility level implies that the fuzzy credibility constraints can be satisfied to a higher degree generally a significant credibility level should be greater than 0 5 therefore the credibility constraints can be written as 4 2 b i b i r i 2 b i b i Ï i 2 2 model calibration and solution algorithm the icpmp model can be solved by converting into upper and lower bound sub models the derivation and parameter calibration of the two sub models are carried out in nine steps in the first step formulate the icpmp model described in section 2 1 in the second step establish an auxiliary model for calibrating parameters Î± and this model adds calibration constraints to icpmp according to the observations in the base period and the cost function is linear which can be written as follows 5a max z p c x subject to 5b a x b Î¼ 5c x x Îµ Î» 5d x 0 where c is the vector of accounting costs per unit of activity c r 1 n b is the vector of resource availability in the base period b r m 1 x is the vector of observed activity levels i e observed land area allocated to crops x r n 1 Îµ denotes a vector of small positive number Îµ r n 1 and Î» is a vector of dual values associated with the calibration constraints Î» r n 1 in the third step model 5 is solved through a solution algorithm for ilp huang et al 1992 1995 fan 2012 in the case of maximizing the objective function this method is utilized to transform the model into two deterministic sub models corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the objective function value the upper bound deterministic sub model is formulated at first as follows 6a max z j 1 n p j x j c j x j subject to 6b j 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i Î¼ 1 i 6c x j x j Îµ j Î» 1 j 6d x j 0 where s i g n is a signal function which is defined as s i g n a i j 1 a i j 0 s i g n a i j 1 a i j 0 i 1 2 m Î¼ 1 i is the vector of dual value associated with the resource constraint in the upper sub model Î» 1 j is the vector of dual value associated with the calibration constraint of upper sub model in the fourth step the parameters to be calibrated in the cost function of the upper bound sub model of icpmp are obtained using the dual values Î» 1 j associated with the calibration constraint in model 6 the cost function c 1 j x is applied with a quadratic form 7 c 1 j x Î± 1 j x j 0 5 Î³ 1 j x j 2 where Î± 1 j and Î³ 1 j are the parameters to be calibrated in the upper bound sub model of icpmp replace the cost function in model 6 with eq 7 and remove the calibration constraints eq 6c to obtain the upper bound sub model of icpmp according to the necessary conditions of the optimization model karush kuhn tucker kkt condition linear equations about Î± 1 j and Î³ 1 j can be obtained howitt 1995 8 Î± 1 j Î³ 1 j x c j Î» 1 j by associating the observation of accounting costs on a unit area basis with the model the parameters to be calibrated can be derived as howitt 1995 nakashima and ishikawa 2017 9 Î± 1 j c j Î» 1 j 10 Î³ 1 j 2 Î» 1 j x j in the fifth step solutions of x j o p t j 1 2 n are obtained through substituting parameters Î± 1 j and Î³ 1 j into the upper bound sub model of icpmp and solving it in the sixth step the lower bound deterministic sub model is formulated based on the solutions of the upper bound sub model of icpmp it can be written as follows 11a max z j 1 n p j x j c j x j subject to 11b j 1 k 1 a i j s i g n a i j x j b i Î¼ 2 i 11c x j x j Îµ j Î» 2 j 11d x j x j o p t 11e x j 0 where Î¼ 2 i is the vector of dual value associated with the constraint in the lower deterministic sub model Î» 2 j is the vector of dual value associated with the calibration constraint of lower deterministic sub model in the seventh step the lower bound sub model of icpmp can be obtained using the dual values Î» 2 j associated with the calibration constraints of model 11 which is similar to the processes in the fourth step the cost function c 2 j x in the lower bound sub model of icpmp can be written as 12 c 2 j x Î± 2 j x j 0 5 Î³ 2 j x j 2 where Î± 2 j and Î³ 2 j are the parameters to be calibrated in the lower bound sub model of icpmp the parameters to be calibrated can be written as 13 Î± 2 j c j Î» 2 j 14 Î³ 2 j 2 Î» 2 j x j where Î± 2 j and Î³ 2 j are the parameters to be calibrated in the lower bound sub model of icpmp in the eighth step solutions of the x j can be obtained through solving the above lower bound sub model of icpmp in the ninth step the optimal solutions of icpmp can be obtained as a set of intervals x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t and f j o p t f j o p t f j o p t by combining the solutions of the upper and lower bound models of icpmp such interval solutions can reproduce the activity levels observed in the base period by giving different credibility levels Ï i in eq 2 and solving the calibrated icpmp model the optimal solutions under different credibility levels can be generated 2 3 simulation evaluation method an icpmp md topsis simulation evaluation method is developed for policy analysis by integrating icpmp and topsis method based on md method into a general framework the icpmp model is used for the simulation of policy impacts and the topsis based on md method is used as the policy evaluation tool during the course of policy analysis the simulation tool is first adopted to obtain the results of various indicators related to economic environmental and social conditions under different policy alternatives and credibility levels the evaluation tool is then used to assess the policy alternatives from a wide spectrum of aspects based on the simulation results of indicators topsis is based upon the concept that the chosen alternative should have a shorter distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest from the negative ideal solution jahanshahloo et al 2006 the topsis method is high efficiency in calculation process and can get the utmost out of the existing data to make the calculation results consistent with the actual situation thus it is utilized for ranking the policy alternatives in this study the attribute weights must be known when using topsis to evaluate the policy alternatives in this study the attribute weights are determined by the md method the md method is an objective weighting method which can reduce the subjectivity in the evaluation process lo and guo 2010 zhang and liu 2010 the specific procedures of the topsis method based on the md method are shown in the text s1 in the supporting information to sum up the overall methodological framework and the solution procedures of the developed icpmp md topsis are shown in fig 1 3 application to agricultural water management policy analysis 3 1 statement of the study problem minqin county 102 45 103 55 e 38 20 39 10 n is located in the downstream of shiyang river basin northwestern china it has an average annual rainfall of 110 mm and evaporation of 2623 mm making it one of the driest regions in china yue et al 2018 it contains five irrigation districts namely quanshan baqu huqu huanhe and changning irrigation districts changning and huanhe irrigation districts solely depend on groundwater for irrigation baqu quanshan and huqu irrigation districts are mixed irrigation areas irrigated by both groundwater and surface water the main grain crops are wheat and corn and the main cash crops are sunflower vegetables melons and cotton these six crops account for 67 6 of the total cultivated area of minqin traditional irrigation technologies applied in the study area include furrow irrigation pipe irrigation and flood irrigation the most popular water saving irrigation technique is drip irrigation either under mulch in fields or in greenhouses in recent years the available surface water of minqin county has been sharply reduced due to the rapid population and economy growth along the shiyang river basin intensive demand supply contradiction for water has led to serious over exploitation of groundwater kang et al 2017 tan and zhang 2018 which intensified the ecological and environmental problems such as land subsidence land desertification and groundwater pollution in addition it has hindered local socio economic development huang et al 2014 bierkens et al 2019 hence availabilities of surface water and groundwater had and will continually have substantial impacts on local socio economic and ecological development water price has long been deemed as an important instrument for water resources management esmaeili and vazirzadeh 2009 asaadi et al 2019 for a long time no charge or a negligible fixed fee was applied to agricultural water use in most regions of china under such policies irrigation water fees were essentially irrelevant to water consumption which unsurprisingly instigated waste of water resources ren et al 2018 to fix this problem the chinese government has progressively reformed agricultural water pricing policies in pilot areas minqin county began water pricing reform in 2003 and gradually increased agricultural water price according to the policies set up in 2015 the price of surface water was 0 266 yuan m3 in all irrigation districts in contrast the price of groundwater varied which were 0 194 yuan m3 0 174 yuan m3 0 420 yuan m3 0 076 yuan m3 and 0 082 yuan m3 in quanshan baqu huqu huanhe and changning irrigation districts respectively based on this differential water pricing was implemented which required that the prices of surface water and groundwater should vary with irrigation techniques and crop types in detail for grain crops irrigated with traditional methods surface water price rose by 30 and groundwater price increased by 50 for cash crops with drip irrigation price of surface water and groundwater decreased by 30 and 50 respectively and for the rest water prices remained unchanged table 1 in addition a fixed water charge of 30 yuan per hectare was required for the areas irrigated by groundwater obviously the current policies encourage the increase of water pricing levels to improve the water use efficiency whereas the water pricing policies are linked to multiple subsystems e g agricultural hydrological environmental and economic systems and would result in substantial impacts on socio economic development and environmental sustainability it is required to determine water pricing levels based on the understanding of these complex impacts and linkages moreover the study system is subjected to great uncertainty which further increases the difficulties of formulating reliable water pricing policy such uncertainties mainly exist in the economic and resource coefficients that are closely related to economic and environmental concerns of local decision makers for example production costs and selling prices of crops in a period of time are not fixed values but fluctuate within a range and the amount of available water in the study area also varies in years the yield and irrigation water quota of crops vary with soil properties and farmers management methods even the observed planting area may deviate from the actual value due to measurement and statistical errors without addressing these uncertainties it is difficult for decision makers to fully understand which water management alternatives are appropriate and what consequences and risks a water management alternative will entail furthermore due to the variations in the availability and the quality of data in system parameters are obtained in different formats and the accuracy of estimates varies for instance in the study system water availability was represented as a fuzzy set while other parameters were represented as interval numbers therefore how to accurately analyze the impacts of water pricing policy alternatives under multiple uncertainties and how to reasonably determine the water pricing levels to achieve a win win situation for economic development and environmental sustainability are the key issues to be addressed in the study area 3 2 icpmp md topsis method for agricultural water management policy analysis the icpmp md topsis simulation evaluation method developed in this study was applied and tailored to the study case for analyzing and screening potential agricultural water management policies maximized farmers income was the goal and the planting areas were the decision variables the constraints of icpmp included farmland availability constraints water availability constraints food security constraints and non negativity constraints the icpmp model for agriculture water management policy analysis was formulated as follows 15a max f s c i k p r c y i s c i k s u

section 2 2 the icpmp model for agriculture water management was calibrated and solved by converting into upper and lower bounds sub models in these steps the calibrated constrains of the upper bound

model for agricultural water management were generated as x s c i k o p t x s c i k o p t and f o p t f o p t the obtained results can reproduce the upper and lower bound planting areas observed in the base period after calibration the model can be used to simulate the policy impacts of agricultural water management water pricing levels under different water availabilities based on the simulation results the topsis method was applied in this research to evaluate and compare different agricultural water management policy alternatives 3 3 scenarios and data 3 3 1 policy alternatives under different water availability current policies in the study area promote higher water pricing levels for better agricultural water use efficiency the impacts of the water pricing policy on the socio economic development and environmental sustainability are closely related to the water availability hence different water pricing levels under different water availabilities were investigated in this study i water pricing levels based on the current water price benchmark water price in the study area the water price of surface water and groundwater were increased by 1 20 times at the same time ii water resources availability water availabilities at the benchmark year of 2015 benchmark water availability as well as those under credibility levels of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 were considered a higher credibility level implies that the fuzzy credibility constraints can be satisfied to a higher degree and the corresponding amount of available water resources is less 3 3 2 data this study used the year of 2015 as the base year for calibration in this study the uncertain parameters were available in the forms of interval number and fuzzy sets except for water availability all model inputs were expressed as interval numbers with known upper and lower bound the crop planting area yield per unit area required irrigation water per unit area price and cost of crops were obtained from field surveys expert estimations and a comprehensive review of literature bureau 2016 division 2016 the food demand data was extracted from the dietary guidelines for chinese residents the upper and lower bounds of these parameters were specified by the maximum and minimum values of collected or revised data table 2 presents the basic crop related data e g prices and costs the production cost and required irrigation water per unit area varied between traditional and drip irrigations the capital costs of field pipes were included in the cost estimates for drip irrigation the required irrigation water per unit area was different between groundwater irrigation areas and mixed irrigation areas the prices yields and costs of various crops irrigated with different water sources were considered the same groundwater extraction costs have been recovered by area through water charges and were therefore not considered in the model the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are presented in table 3 the triangular fuzzy number was typically used to represent the fuzzy events i e a a a a where a middle value was the most likely value with a membership degree of 1 the a lower value and a upper value were the least credible with a membership degree of 0 the fuzzy sets of surface water availability were determined according to the history data the lower middle and upper value were accordingly calculated based on the minimum mean and the maximum values of the historical statistical data of surface water availability the reduction of groundwater extraction in the study area was advocated by the government hence the groundwater availability was determined based on the possible amount of groundwater extraction allowed by the decision makers 4 results analysis 4 1 model calibration and policy impact simulation the developed icpmp model for agricultural water management was calibrated to reproduce the actual situations in the base year of 2015 fig 2 shows that the relative error between simulated results obtained from icpmp and the observed values would be less than 0 1 after calibration various water pricing policy alternatives under different water availabilities were run with the model to simulate their policy impacts a series of indicators in the form of interval numbers were obtained from the model based on which the impacts of policy alternatives could be revealed and compared indicators symbolizing economic social and environmental implications were selected which included farmers income total water consumption benefit per cubic meter of water total planting area nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer use ratio of the drip irrigation area to total planting area and ratio of the grain planting area to cash planting area by increasing the water price by 1 20 times and keeping the water amount allocated to agriculture similar to the implemented plan in 2015 the policy impacts were simulated fig 3 presents the simulated planting area as water price increases it demonstrated the upper and lower bound planting area of various crops would all decrease as water price increases except for corn the area of wheat and corn would have obvious turning points in the process of gradual water price rising which occurred when grain yield falls to a minimum set by the government for the upper lower bound the turning point would be reached when the water price increases by 5 5 4 5 times after reaching the turning point the decline rate of the wheat planting area would slow down with the increase in water price while the corn planting area would expand this is because at first grain crops with high water consumption and low benefit would fall and reach the government set minimum grain yieldas water price increases after that despite the stabilization of the total grain yield the planting area of corn would increase because of its better water use efficiency compared to wheat as water price increases the ratio of drip irrigation area to total planting area would increase and the ratio of grain crop planting area to cash crop planting area would first decline and then rise fig 4 this is probably because in the process of rising water price grain crops would first decrease and then stabilize while cash crops would decrease continuously these results indicated that as water price increases farmers would respond by adopting some measures e g reducing planting area adopting water saving irrigation technologies and shifting from grain crops to cash crops fig 5 shows the changes in the total planting area farmers income irrigation water consumption benefits per unit of water the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers as water price rises the farmers income would drop uniformly when water price rises and the upper and lower bounds of other indicators would have an obvious turning point when the water price rises to 4 5 or 5 5 times before reaching the turning point as water price rises the total planting area irrigation water consumption and fertilizer use would all decrease and the benefit per cubic of water would increase after reaching the turning point as water price increases the decline rate of the total planting area total water consumption and fertilizer use would slow down to 28 38 of the previous decline rate and the benefit per cubic of water would also decline from four perspectives i e increasing benefit per cubic of water reducing the negative impact on farmers income decreasing irrigation water consumption and fertilizer use the water price should rise to around the turning point i e 4 5 5 5 times the benchmark water price this is because when the water price is at the turning point despite the slight decrease in farmers income the benefit per cubic of water would be the highest and the decline speed of fertilizer use and irrigation water would slow down significantly fig 6 shows the changes of each index with increases of water price under different credibility levels in practice a high credibility level is associated with low water availability and system failure risk level which may be preferred by water managers with conservative attitude in contrast water managers with a positive preference may be satisfied with low credibility levels with high risk but sufficient water resources and high system benefits under all credibility levels as water price rises the farmers income would keep decreasing uniformly the total planting area nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use would slightly increase at first and then rapidly decline the total water consumption would stay flat at first and then decrease when the credibility level Ï is 0 7 the benefit per cubic of water would firstly decline then rise then drop again it would decrease constantly as water price rises when the credibility levels Ï are 0 8 and 0 9 in detail under a credibility level of 0 7 the upper and lower bounds of each index would reach two turning points in the process of rising water price the first turning point would be reached when the water price is 2 times the benchmark at which the total water consumption starts to drop before this the planting area and the fertilizer use would increase slightly while the farmers income and the benefit per cubic of water would decrease the total water consumption would remain unchanged the second turning points of the upper lower bounds of each index would be reached when the water price 4 5 5 times the benchmark at which the grain crop yields declined to a minimum after this the planting area total water consumption and fertilizer use would continue to decline as water price rises but at a significantly slower decline speed of one third to one half of the previous speed moreover after reaching the second turning point the trend of benefit per cubic of water with rising water price would shift from increase to decrease under the credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 the upper and lower bounds of each index would reach one turning point in the process of rising water price this is because the available water resources would be less under these two credibility levels and the yield of grain crops would reach the minimum even before the water price rises under the credibility level of 0 8 the upper and lower bounds of each index would both reach the turning point when the water price is 5 times benchmark under the credibility level of 0 9 the turning points of the upper and lower bounds of each index would be reached when the water price is 11 and 13 times the benchmark respectively upon reaching the turning point with the rise of water price the change trend of planting area and fertilizer use would shift from rise to decline the benefit per cubic of water would decrease and the trend of total water consumption would switch from constant to decline lower negative impact on farmers income lower irrigation water and fertilizer use as well as higher benefit per cubic of water were regarded as the most important indicators for determining the local water price threshold under all credibility levels the water prices between the benchmark water price and the water price at the first turning point were not recommended this is because within these water price ranges the amount of irrigation water would remain unchanged as the water price rises the benefit per cubic of water would decline rapidly and the fertilizer use and planting area would increase under the credibility of 0 7 if the water price increase relative to the water price at the first turning point it was recommended to increase it to around the second turning point i e 4 5 5 times the benchmark water price at this turning point although the farmers income would be lower than that before the water price rises the benefit per cubic of water would be the highest and the decline speed of fertilizer use and irrigation water would slow down significantly in summary under the credibility level of 0 7 the water price was recommended to remain unchanged or increase around 4 5 5 times the benchmark water price under the credibility level of 0 8 0 9 water price between 5 and 20 11 20 times the benchmark water price and the benchmark water price should be screened out for further assessment from the above analysis it can be seen that the water prices at the turning points were different under the three credibility levels fig 6 the higher the credibility level the higher the water price at the turning point this indicated that water availability can influence the responses of farmers to water price when water resources are scarce water prices need to be raised to a higher level before the farmers respond by reducing water use and planting area this is also in line with the laws of economics under a fixed water price as the credibility level increases the total planting area farmers income total water consumption and fertilizer use would reduce or remain unchanged the benefit per cubic meter of water would climb or remain unchanged this meant that the reduction of available water resources would promote water saving in agriculture reduce non point source pollution caused by fertilizer application and have a complex impact on the economy 4 2 evaluation of policy alternatives higher benefit per cubic meter of water famers income as well as lower water consumption and fertilizer use are welcomed by the local government based on the simulation results of these four indicators and the analysis over the different water pricing levels in section 4 1 inferior alternatives were excluded from further assessment to reduce computational loads when the water availability remains the same as the implemented plan in the base year 5 policy alternatives with water prices around 4 5 5 5 times the benchmark water price were selected for the water availability under the credibility level of 0 7 7 policy alternatives where the water prices remained unchanged or around 4 5 5 times the benchmark water price were selected under the credibility level of 0 8 0 9 17 11 alternatives in which water prices remained unchanged or 5 20 11 20 times the benchmark water price were selected as a result a total of 40 alternatives were put into the evaluation process table 4 as discussed above these 40 alternatives all had their pros and cons it was difficult to rank them straightforwardly therefore a set of attributes were used to identify the multi dimensional performance of these alternatives from a perspective of sustainable development of agricultural system in this study 11 attributes considered here were outlined in table 5 riesgo and gÃ³mez limÃ³n 2006 gomez limon and sanchez fernandez 2010 the attribute weights were determined using the md method once obtaining the attribute weights the topsis method was applied to rank the alternatives the relative closeness coefficient to the positive ideal solution obtained by the topsis method was defined as the comprehensive benefit the higher the relative closeness coefficient of policy alternative the higher its comprehensive benefit hence the more worthy of being selected table 4 shows the rank of the 40 selected alternatives under different water availabilities if the available water remains unchanged or under the credibility level of 0 7 the alternative with a water price 5 5 times the benchmark would yield the highest comprehensive benefit under the credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 the alternatives with the highest comprehensive benefit were obtained when the water price remains unchanged from the base period which would also rank as the top two among the forty alternatives the comprehensive benefit would reduce as the water price increases under the credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 the alternatives with the lowest comprehensive benefit were obtained when the water price is 20 times of the benchmark under 0 8 and 0 9 credibility levels which would also rank as the bottom two among all the alternatives this demonstrated that when there is lower available water and no subsidies water price should not be raised to maintain the sustainable development of agriculture 5 discussions 5 1 implications and implementation the results of this research could provide local authorities with recommended policies on water pricing under different water availabilities with a better understanding of the policy impacts on economy society and environment the local authorities could implement specific agricultural water management policies according to the actual conditions and development needs in the local study area when the decision makers have a positive preference for water availability water availabilities remains unchanged or under 0 7 credibility level it was recommended to increase the water price to 5 5 times of benchmark water price at this water price the system comprehensive benefit would be the highest in detail the surface water prices of changning huanhe baqu quanshan and huqu irrigation districts would be 1 46 yuan m3 and the corresponding groundwater prices would be 0 45 yuan m3 0 42 yuan m3 0 96 yuan m3 1 07 yuan m3 and 2 31 yuan m3 respectively when decision makers have conservative attitude towards water availability under 0 8 and 0 9 credibility levels it was recommended to keep the water price unchanged the increase in water price would affect farmers income while the implementation of subsidy policies could reduce the losses of farmers income at present the chinese government is advocating a water price policy of one grow one subsidy this policy supports subsiding for farmers economic losses caused by rising water prices while raising agricultural water prices to achieve fairness the subsidy method is generally based on the area of cultivated land if the local government could subsidize the total loss of farmers income caused by rising water prices a subsidy of 4345 yuan hm2 should be provided when the water price is 5 5 times the benchmark under a credibility level of 0 7 with adequate subsidies when the available water is scarce increasing water price above the turning point would not compromise comprehensive benefits but achieve water saving and environment improvement 5 2 model comparisons and limitations to verify the proposed icpmp model the simulation results were compared against those from two other models one was an ilp model that could reflect uncertain inputs but lacks calibration the other was a traditional pmp model that could be calibrated but could not reflect any uncertainty in inputs the mean values of parameters were used as inputs of the traditional pmp model in other words icpmp model could accommodate continuous information of uncertain parameters whereas pmp could merely handle the determinate values as substitute of uncertain data fig 7 compares the farmers income and planting area of policy alternatives obtained from the three models when the available water stays unchanged or under the credibility level of 0 9 both the total planting area and farmers income obtained from the pmp model would roughly fall within the ranges of interval solutions obtained from icpmp this verification indicates that compared with pmp the icpmp method could avoid significant losses of uncertain information in inputs and also provide a solution range to enable flexibility in execution the ilp model provided no solution when Ï 0 9 regardless of water pricing level it only generated solutions when water prices stays below 8 times the benchmark under the benchmark water availability this is probably because the solution of the ilp model could only be obtained at the corner of the feasible region making the model unable to simulate policy changes in some cases in comparison icpmp could obtain the simulation results of policy alternatives under different violation risks of water resource constraints it indicated that icpmp was more flexible and had a wider application range compared to ilp model in addition without enough constraints added arbitrarily to correct the model results the solution of the ilp model would have the tendency to deviate from the real situation moreover compared to ilp the icpmp model would result in higher farmers income fig 8 presents the upper and lower bounds of farmers income and total consumption under different credibility levels when the water price equals to the benchmark water price the farmers income and the total water consumption would have an obvious downward trend as the credibility levels increase this indicated icpmp could provide various scenarios to comprehensively analyze the changes of system benefits and other indicators under different violation risks of water resource constraints which could not be obtained by pmp and ilp this approach could help policymakers understand the risks when formulating water pricing policies in agricultural water management a decision maker with a conservative altitude towards water availability may set a low water price which would exacerbate water waste when water is abundant a decision maker with positive preference for water availability tend to set high water prices whereas it may cause a potential risk of constraint violations and fail to meet farmers expected income when water resource is insufficient in general icpmp exhibited advantages over the other two models in terms of improved flexibility in decision making as well as enhanced reliability through reproducing actual situation and handling input uncertainty expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets although this study was the first attempt to provide a new method for analyzing and selecting policy alternatives under uncertainty expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets there are still research gaps to be filled in the future studies the icpmp method using the quadratic pmp cost function may result in negative marginal costs over a range of low hectares for a specific crop and region howitt et al 2012 the quadratic pmp cost function can be replaced by the exponential pmp cost function to avoid this problem as for the evaluation part of the simulation evaluation framework the topsis method based on the md method was suitable and adopted in this study because the attribute values were expressed as interval numbers besides other madm methods could also be integrated within the general model framework such as the evidential reasoning zhang et al 2017 and gray relational analysis wei 2011 the selection of methods for policy alternative analysis depends on a number of factors such as data quality and the actual demands 6 conclusions analyzing the impacts of water management policy before implementation can help policy makers make informed decisions to analyze the impacts of water management policies an icpmp method that coupled the standard pmp interval linear programming and fuzzy credibility constrained programming was first proposed in this study the icpmp method improved up the traditional pmp by being able to handle uncertain parameters expressed as intervals and fuzzy sets it also overcame the shortcoming of traditional and inexact linear programming techniques in lacking model calibration subsequently the simulation evaluation modeling method was proposed through integrating the developed icpmp method with the topsis approach to assess and screen out policy alternatives the developed methodology was applied to arid northwestern china where water supply demand contradictions are intense by investigating different water pricing levels under different water availabilities water availability at the benchmark year and those under credibility levels of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 various water management policy alternatives were generated the impacts of these alternatives were all simulated using the calibrated icpmp model results of various indicators were obtained for preliminary analysis which mainly included farmers income total water consumption benefit per cubic meter of water and fertilizer use based on the analysis of these four indicators forty alternatives were more beneficial which were screened out for in depth evaluation eleven attributes covering the perspectives of socio economy and environment were selected to assess those forty alternatives finally the topsis method was utilized to ultimately rank the alternatives the simulation results demonstrated that as water price increases farmers would take a series of measures to prevent income from being affected e g reducing planting area adopting water saving irrigation technologies and shifting from grain crops to cash crops when available water is equal to the water availability at the benchmark year the total planting area farmers income irrigation water consumption and fertilizer use would decrease as water price rises and the benefit per cubic of water would first increase and then decline under the three credibility levels the total planting area and fertilizer use would first increase slightly and then decrease as water price rises the irrigation water consumption would first remain unchanged then decline farmers income would keep declining the benefit per cubic of water would decline as water prices increase under credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 but under credibility levels of 0 7 it would first decrease then rise and then decrease again the best water pricing levels under different water availabilities were obtained from the evaluation model the results indicated that when the decision makers have a positive preference water availabilities remains unchanged or under 0 7 credibility level for water availability the water price at the turning point of water use efficiency i e benefit per cubic of water was recommend when decision makers have conservative attitude towards water availability under 0 8 and 0 9 credibility levels it was recommended to keep the water price unchanged from the base period besides the government should subsidize the losses of farmers income caused by rising water price the icpmp method was compared against the ilp model without calibration process and the pmp model without uncertain inputs the results showed that the icpmp could enhance reliability through reflecting and addressing input uncertainty as well as reproducing actual situation besides icpmp could provide reasonable water price policies under different violation risks of water resource constraints and generate a solution range to enable flexibility in decision making icpmp and the associated simulation evaluation modeling framework developed in this study has potential of wide applications to simulate and assess the implications of diverse types of policies

9480,predicting the impacts of water management policies under uncertainty can support policy makers in making sound decisions most previous methods for policy impact simulation lacked a calibration process that would allow model results to match observed values and did not address the inherent uncertainties to fill this methodological knowledge gap an interval credibility constrained positive mathematical programming icpmp approach was first developed in this study for simulating the impacts of water management policies this method improved over traditional positive mathematical programming in terms of uncertainty treatment it also improved upon inexact programming methods through activating a calibration process icpmp was then coupled with a multi attribute decision making approach leading to a simulation evaluation method that could support the analysis and screening of policy alternatives this method has been applied to an agricultural water management problem in northwestern china various policy alternatives corresponding to different water prices and varied fuzzy credibility levels of water availability were investigated the impacts of these alternatives over farmers income irrigation water consumption benefit per cubic meter of water planting area and fertilizer use were simulated through icpmp forty policy alternatives with better indicator performances were selected to be comprehensively evaluated using the multi attribute decision making approach the results indicated that when the decision makers have a positive preference for water availability the water price at the turning point of water use efficiency i e benefit per cubic of water was recommended when decision makers have conservative attitude towards water availability it was recommended to keep the water price unchanged comparisons of icpmp against traditional methods indicated that icpmp could generate more reliable results through incorporating uncertain information as inputs and reproducing actual situation as well solutions of icpmp could provide in depth analysis of the trade offs between violation risk and system benefits icpmp and the associated simulation evaluation method are also applicable to analyze other types of policies abbreviations fccp fuzzy credibility constrained programming ilp interval linear programming icpmp interval credibility

ideal solution keywords positive mathematical programming inexact programming multi attribute decision making water pricing policy uncertainty 1 introduction due to increasingly sharpened contradictions between water supply and water demand in recent years the world has been facing severe environmental stress and socio economic challenges chen et al 2020 to alleviate these problems various water management policies have been implemented in many areas such as water pricing policies and water allocation policies xu et al 2018 quay et al 2022 these policies are diverse and their impacts are complicated water management policies directly or indirectly affect many subsystems e g hydrologic agronomic environmental and economic subsystems and trigger changes in many aspects of high attention such as water consumption farmers income and water quality zhang et al 2019a 2019b du et al 2022 meanwhile the impacts of water management policies are susceptible to the uncertainties inherent in natural resources and human activities wu and chen 2015 wu et al 2018 amaranto et al 2022 those all make it extremely difficult to predict and assess the impacts of policies if the impacts of water management policies are insufficiently understood policy formulation practices often inevitably fail to achieve desired results and may even exacerbate problems including but not limited to water shortages and water quality deterioration mehrazar et al 2020 suwal et al 2020 therefore decision support tools for revealing and assessing the impacts of policy alternatives in uncertain environments are urgently needed to help policy makers make informed decisions and formulate sound policies in the past couple of decades a number of quantitative methods have been developed to study policy impacts such as the econometric methods the general computable equilibriums models and the mathematical programming methods wang and xiao 2012 perez blanco and standardi 2019 among them mathematical programming methods e g linear programming and inexact programming have been frequently utilized as they require less data and could provide detailed analysis before policy implementation janssen and van ittersum 2007 ji et al 2018 despite their strengths one of the major problems of the traditional and inexact linear programming methods lied in that the model results might be inconsistent with the actual situation in the absence of calibration nakashima 2011 although these methods attempted to add arbitrary constraints to overcome this limitation such constraints had no clearly defined economic or technical background and would limit the model flexibility rohm and dabbert 2003 besides the solutions of linear programming are obtained at the corner of the feasible region resulting in the model s unsmooth responses to policy changes howitt 1995 nakashima and ishikawa 2017 to overcome these problems positive mathematical programming pmp was developed superior to conventional mathematical programming pmp could be spontaneously calibrated to the actual situation in the base period without affecting the model flexibility and make smooth responses to the policy changes due to its nonlinear objective function howitt 1995 nakashima and ishikawa 2017 zhao et al 2019 previously pmp has been widely used for policy impact analyses in the fields of water resources ali and klein 2014 franco crespo and sumpsi vinas 2017 he et al 2012 maneta et al 2020 for example iglesias and blanco 2008 assessed environmental and socio economic impacts of water pricing policies in spanish irrigated lands zamani et al 2019 studied the impacts of the timing and reduction of water supply on agricultural production those studies have verified that the pmp method could be an effective tool for analyzing impacts of water management policies unfortunately the input parameters of the traditional pmp were assumed to be known with certainty which made them inapplicable to effectively reflect or address real world problems in fact due to the great natural and behavioral variability associated with various processes and factors there were many uncertainties in hydrological and economic systems amaranto et al 2022 in recent years many inexact programming methods including stochastic fuzzy and interval mathematical programming methods have been proposed and proven to be capable of dealing with uncertainties in water resources management tan and zhang 2018 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 among them interval mathematical programming is an effective method in handling uncertainties since it does not require distributional information of parameters huang et al 1992 tan et al 2017 doole and pannell 2009 proposed a method coupling pmp with robust optimization for policy analysis under interval uncertainty although this method was novel its solutions were obtained in the worst case of parameters which could hardly reflect the actual policy impacts in comparison interval linear programming ilp can provide a larger solution space by incorporating infinite parameter values within the intervals into the model input and solution process huang et al 1995 fan 2012 methods that coupled ilp with pmp are promising for policy analysis under uncertainty in spite of this when the parameters are subject to human judgements fuzzy sets would be more suitable for expressing the uncertainty li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 besides fuzzy membership functions are easier to be obtained than probability distributions and they are more informative than interval numbers fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp could effectively reflect the risk violation caused by fuzzy uncertainty in the system arÄ±k 2019 ma et al 2020 maharjan and hanaoka 2020 this approach is more feasible than risk analysis methods based on probability theory arata et al 2017 liu et al 2020 when there is insufficient data to specify the probability distribution functions of parameters to sum up both pmp and inexact programming methods suffer from shortcomings while being applied to policy simulation the traditional pmp could not handle uncertainties which are common in real world problems the inexact programming could handle many types of uncertainties but there are concerns over how the results could mimic the actual situation without affecting the model flexibility although a few studies performed interval uncertainty analyses while calibrating the model it was not suitable for empirical application because of its inherent conservatism and degeneracy in policy analysis doole and kingwell 2010 in addition these studies could not deal with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets to the best of our knowledge there was no existing method that could be capable for calibration based policy simulation under interval and fuzzy uncertainties moreover the selection of desired policy alternatives from the outputs of above mentioned policy simulation models also faces challenges most previous studies on evaluation of policy alternatives could merely be effective when the predicted indicator values were precise which is usually impossible in many circumstances considering the complex responses to policies fragoso et al 2011 gallego ayala 2012 the neglect of inherent uncertainty in real world problems made those studies incapable of providing foresights required for policy development there were a lack of tools that could comprehensively evaluate and screen policy alternatives based on the simulation of their impacts in uncertain environments to remedy the prescribed shortcomings the aim of this study is to develop a novel policy formulation methodology that could credibly simulate and comprehensively assess the impacts of various policies under uncertainty an interval credibility constrained positive mathematical programming icpmp method that integrated ilp fccp and traditional pmp was first proposed for revealing policy impacts in this study icpmp improved over the traditional pmp methods through reflecting and handling uncertain parameters expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets it also outweighed traditional and inexact programming technologies by incorporating a calibration process subsequently a simulation evaluation methodology was then developed by coupling the developed icpmp method with a multi attribute decision making approach madm for supporting the comprehensive comparison and screening of policy alternatives furthermore the methodology has been tested by an agricultural water management case in northwest china the impacts imposed by agricultural water management policies water pricing policies under different water availabilities were simulated and evaluated based on which viable policies that could contribute to sustainable agricultural development were formulated 2 methodology a simulation evaluation methodology originating from pmp inexact programming and multi attribute decision making is developed in this study for the simulation and evaluation of policy alternatives firstly an icpmp method is proposed through seamlessly integrating interval analysis fccp and the pmp method within a general framework the icpmp method could calibrate the model results to observed values as well as deal with interval numbers and fuzzy sets enabling accurate prediction of policy impacts the developed icpmp method is then coupled with the madm method facilitating the evaluation of policy alternatives from multiple aspects and the formulation of desired policies in this study the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach based on maximum deviation md method is selected as the madm method where the md method is utilized to determine the attribute weights this simulation evaluation method is able to identify the best policy alternative based on the simulation results of different policy alternatives under uncertainty 2 1 interval credibility constrained positive mathematical programming approach the standard pmp method developed by howitt 1995 is only suitable for cases where the input parameters of the model are precise in order to effectively deal with the uncertain parameters in real world problems an icpmp method is newly proposed for policy analysis in this study by incorporating interval analysis and fccp into the pmp method the interval analysis in icpmp is based on the interval number theory where the parameters in a model are expressed as interval numbers with known lower and upper bounds huang et al 1995 the fccp method applies credibility theory which can effectively reflect the satisfaction degrees of the constraints using fuzzy sets liu and liu 2002 ma et al 2020 icpmp could improve upon pmp through dealing with uncertainties expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets while overcoming the major shortcoming of traditional and inexact linear programming techniques in model calibration a general formula of icpmp can be written as 1a max z p x c x 1b c x Î± x 0 5 x Î³ x subject to 1c a x b Î¼ 1d x 0 where z denotes the objective function with interval values x is the vector of activity levels i e land area allocated to crops x r n 1 x is the transpose of x x r 1 n p is the vector of output prices per unit of activity p r 1 n c x is the cost function of crop production in quadratic form similar to the cost function of pmp Î± and Î³ are parameters to be calibrated Î± is the vector linking parameters associated with linear terms Î± r 1 n Î³ is a symmetric positive definite matrix of parameters associated with the quadratic term Î³ r n n a denotes a matrix of coefficients in resource constraints a r m n b is a vector of resource availability some or all of the coefficients in the vector are fuzzy numbers b r m 1 and Î¼ is a vector of dual values associated with the constraints eq 1c Î¼ r m 1 r s t are s t interval parameter matrixes the constraints with fuzzy parameters can be transformed into the following credibility constraints by the fccp method liu and liu 2002 ma et al 2020 2 c r j 1 n a i j x i j b i Ï i where c r is the credibility measure of a fuzzy event in i and j represent the i th row and j th column of the matrix respectively and Ï i is the predetermined credibility level i e mean value of the possibility and necessity which represents the satisfaction degree of the associated constraint assume that b i is fully determined by the triplet b i b i b i of crisp numbers with b i b i b i let r i be the real numbers and r i j 1 n a i j x i j according to the definition of fuzzy membership function and credibility measure the credibility of r i b i can be expressed as follows liu and liu 2002 3 c r r i b i 1 i f r i b i 2 b i b i r i 2 b i b i i f b i r i b i r i b i 2 b i b i i f b i r i b i 0 i f r i b i a larger credibility level implies that the fuzzy credibility constraints can be satisfied to a higher degree generally a significant credibility level should be greater than 0 5 therefore the credibility constraints can be written as 4 2 b i b i r i 2 b i b i Ï i 2 2 model calibration and solution algorithm the icpmp model can be solved by converting into upper and lower bound sub models the derivation and parameter calibration of the two sub models are carried out in nine steps in the first step formulate the icpmp model described in section 2 1 in the second step establish an auxiliary model for calibrating parameters Î± and this model adds calibration constraints to icpmp according to the observations in the base period and the cost function is linear which can be written as follows 5a max z p c x subject to 5b a x b Î¼ 5c x x Îµ Î» 5d x 0 where c is the vector of accounting costs per unit of activity c r 1 n b is the vector of resource availability in the base period b r m 1 x is the vector of observed activity levels i e observed land area allocated to crops x r n 1 Îµ denotes a vector of small positive number Îµ r n 1 and Î» is a vector of dual values associated with the calibration constraints Î» r n 1 in the third step model 5 is solved through a solution algorithm for ilp huang et al 1992 1995 fan 2012 in the case of maximizing the objective function this method is utilized to transform the model into two deterministic sub models corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the objective function value the upper bound deterministic sub model is formulated at first as follows 6a max z j 1 n p j x j c j x j subject to 6b j 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i Î¼ 1 i 6c x j x j Îµ j Î» 1 j 6d x j 0 where s i g n is a signal function which is defined as s i g n a i j 1 a i j 0 s i g n a i j 1 a i j 0 i 1 2 m Î¼ 1 i is the vector of dual value associated with the resource constraint in the upper sub model Î» 1 j is the vector of dual value associated with the calibration constraint of upper sub model in the fourth step the parameters to be calibrated in the cost function of the upper bound sub model of icpmp are obtained using the dual values Î» 1 j associated with the calibration constraint in model 6 the cost function c 1 j x is applied with a quadratic form 7 c 1 j x Î± 1 j x j 0 5 Î³ 1 j x j 2 where Î± 1 j and Î³ 1 j are the parameters to be calibrated in the upper bound sub model of icpmp replace the cost function in model 6 with eq 7 and remove the calibration constraints eq 6c to obtain the upper bound sub model of icpmp according to the necessary conditions of the optimization model karush kuhn tucker kkt condition linear equations about Î± 1 j and Î³ 1 j can be obtained howitt 1995 8 Î± 1 j Î³ 1 j x c j Î» 1 j by associating the observation of accounting costs on a unit area basis with the model the parameters to be calibrated can be derived as howitt 1995 nakashima and ishikawa 2017 9 Î± 1 j c j Î» 1 j 10 Î³ 1 j 2 Î» 1 j x j in the fifth step solutions of x j o p t j 1 2 n are obtained through substituting parameters Î± 1 j and Î³ 1 j into the upper bound sub model of icpmp and solving it in the sixth step the lower bound deterministic sub model is formulated based on the solutions of the upper bound sub model of icpmp it can be written as follows 11a max z j 1 n p j x j c j x j subject to 11b j 1 k 1 a i j s i g n a i j x j b i Î¼ 2 i 11c x j x j Îµ j Î» 2 j 11d x j x j o p t 11e x j 0 where Î¼ 2 i is the vector of dual value associated with the constraint in the lower deterministic sub model Î» 2 j is the vector of dual value associated with the calibration constraint of lower deterministic sub model in the seventh step the lower bound sub model of icpmp can be obtained using the dual values Î» 2 j associated with the calibration constraints of model 11 which is similar to the processes in the fourth step the cost function c 2 j x in the lower bound sub model of icpmp can be written as 12 c 2 j x Î± 2 j x j 0 5 Î³ 2 j x j 2 where Î± 2 j and Î³ 2 j are the parameters to be calibrated

reproduce the activity levels observed in the base period by giving different credibility levels Ï i in eq 2 and solving the calibrated icpmp model the optimal solutions under different credibility levels can be generated 2 3 simulation evaluation method an icpmp md topsis simulation evaluation method is developed for policy analysis by integrating icpmp and topsis method based on md method into a general framework the icpmp model is used for the simulation of policy impacts and the topsis based on md method is used as the policy evaluation tool during the course of policy analysis the simulation tool is first adopted to obtain the results of various indicators related to economic environmental and social conditions under different policy alternatives and credibility levels the evaluation tool is then used to assess the policy alternatives from a wide spectrum of aspects based on the simulation results of indicators topsis is based upon the concept that the chosen alternative should have a shorter distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest from the negative ideal solution jahanshahloo et al 2006 the topsis method is high efficiency in calculation process and can get the utmost out of the existing data to make the calculation results consistent with the actual situation thus it is utilized for ranking the policy alternatives in this study the attribute weights must be known when using topsis to evaluate the policy alternatives in this study the attribute weights are determined by the md method the md method is an objective weighting method which can reduce the subjectivity in the evaluation process lo and guo 2010 zhang and liu 2010 the specific procedures of the topsis method based on the md method are shown in the text s1 in the supporting information to sum up the overall methodological framework and the solution procedures of the developed icpmp md topsis are shown in fig 1 3 application to agricultural water management policy analysis 3 1 statement of the study problem minqin county 102 45 103 55 e 38 20 39 10 n is located in the downstream of shiyang river basin northwestern china it has an average annual rainfall of 110 mm and evaporation of 2623 mm making it one of the driest regions in china yue et al 2018 it contains five irrigation districts namely quanshan baqu huqu huanhe and changning irrigation districts changning and huanhe irrigation districts solely depend on groundwater for irrigation baqu quanshan and huqu irrigation districts are mixed irrigation areas irrigated by both groundwater and surface water the main grain crops are wheat and corn and the main cash crops are sunflower vegetables melons and cotton these six crops account for 67 6 of the total cultivated area of minqin traditional irrigation technologies applied in the study area include furrow irrigation pipe irrigation and flood irrigation the most popular water saving irrigation technique is drip irrigation either under mulch in fields or in greenhouses in recent years the available surface water of minqin county has been sharply reduced due to the rapid population and economy growth along the shiyang river basin intensive demand supply contradiction for water has led to serious over exploitation of groundwater kang et al 2017 tan and zhang 2018 which intensified the ecological and environmental problems such as land subsidence land desertification and groundwater pollution in addition it has hindered local socio economic development huang et al 2014 bierkens et al 2019 hence availabilities of surface water and groundwater had and will continually have substantial impacts on local socio economic and ecological development water price has long been deemed as an important instrument for water resources management esmaeili and vazirzadeh 2009 asaadi et al 2019 for a long time no charge or a negligible fixed fee was applied to agricultural water use in most regions of china under such policies irrigation water fees were essentially irrelevant to water consumption which unsurprisingly instigated waste of water resources ren et al 2018 to fix this problem the chinese government has progressively reformed agricultural water pricing policies in pilot areas minqin county began water pricing reform in 2003 and gradually increased agricultural water price according to the policies set up in 2015 the price of surface water was 0 266 yuan m3 in all irrigation districts in contrast the price of groundwater varied which were 0 194 yuan m3 0 174 yuan m3 0 420 yuan m3 0 076 yuan m3 and 0 082 yuan m3 in quanshan baqu huqu huanhe and changning irrigation districts respectively based on this differential water pricing was implemented which required that the prices of surface water and groundwater should vary with irrigation techniques and crop types in detail for grain crops irrigated with traditional methods surface water price rose by 30 and groundwater price increased by 50 for cash crops with drip irrigation price of surface water and groundwater decreased by 30 and 50 respectively and for the rest water prices remained unchanged table 1 in addition a fixed water charge of 30 yuan per hectare was required for the areas irrigated by groundwater obviously the current policies encourage the increase of water pricing levels to improve the water use efficiency whereas the water pricing policies are linked to multiple subsystems e g agricultural hydrological environmental and economic systems and would result in substantial impacts on socio economic development and environmental sustainability it is required to determine water pricing levels based on the understanding of these complex impacts and linkages moreover the study system is subjected to great uncertainty which further increases the difficulties of formulating reliable water pricing policy such uncertainties mainly exist in the economic and resource coefficients that are closely related to economic and environmental concerns of local decision makers for example production costs and selling prices of crops in a period of time are not fixed values but fluctuate within a range and the amount of available water in the study area also varies in years the yield and irrigation water quota of crops vary with soil properties and farmers management methods even the observed planting area may deviate from the actual value due to measurement and statistical errors without addressing these uncertainties it is difficult for decision makers to fully understand which water management alternatives are appropriate and what consequences and risks a water management alternative will entail furthermore due to the variations in the availability and the quality of data in system parameters are obtained in different formats and the accuracy of estimates varies for instance in the study system water availability was represented as a fuzzy set while other parameters were represented as interval numbers therefore how to accurately analyze the impacts of water pricing policy alternatives under multiple uncertainties and how to reasonably determine the water pricing levels to achieve a win win situation for economic development and environmental sustainability are the key issues to be addressed in the study area 3 2 icpmp md topsis method for agricultural water management policy analysis the icpmp md topsis simulation evaluation method developed in this study was applied and tailored to the study case for analyzing and screening potential agricultural water management policies maximized farmers income was the goal and the planting areas were the decision variables the constraints of icpmp included farmland availability constraints water availability

the base period after calibration the model can be used to simulate the policy impacts of agricultural water management water pricing levels under different water availabilities based on the simulation results the topsis method was applied in this research to evaluate and compare different agricultural water management policy alternatives 3 3 scenarios and data 3 3 1 policy alternatives under different water availability current policies in the study area promote higher water pricing levels for better agricultural water use efficiency the impacts of the water pricing policy on the socio economic development and environmental sustainability are closely related to the water availability hence different water pricing levels under different water availabilities were investigated in this study i water pricing levels based on the current water price benchmark water price in the study area the water price of surface water and groundwater were increased by 1 20 times at the same time ii water resources availability water availabilities at the benchmark year of 2015 benchmark water availability as well as those under credibility levels of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 were considered a higher credibility level implies that the fuzzy credibility constraints can be satisfied to a higher degree and the corresponding amount of available water resources is less 3 3 2 data this study used the year of 2015 as the base year for calibration in this study the uncertain parameters were available in the forms of interval number and fuzzy sets except for water availability all model inputs were expressed as interval numbers with known upper and lower bound the crop planting area yield per unit area required irrigation water per unit area price and cost of crops were obtained from field surveys expert estimations and a comprehensive review of literature bureau 2016 division 2016 the food demand data was extracted from the dietary guidelines for chinese residents the upper and lower bounds of these parameters were specified by the maximum and minimum values of collected or revised data table 2 presents the basic crop related data e g prices and costs the production cost and required irrigation water per unit area varied between traditional and drip irrigations the capital costs of field pipes were included in the cost estimates for drip irrigation the required irrigation water per unit area was different between groundwater irrigation areas and mixed irrigation areas the prices yields and costs of various crops irrigated with different water sources were considered the same groundwater extraction costs have been recovered by area through water charges and were therefore not considered in the model the availabilities of surface water and groundwater are presented in table 3 the triangular fuzzy number was typically used to represent the fuzzy events i e a a a a where a middle value was the most likely value with a membership degree of 1 the a lower value and a upper value were the least credible with a membership degree of 0 the fuzzy sets of surface water availability were determined according to the history data the lower middle and upper value were accordingly calculated based on the minimum mean and the maximum values of the historical statistical data of surface water availability the reduction of groundwater extraction in the study area was advocated by the government hence the groundwater availability was determined based on the possible amount of groundwater extraction allowed by the decision makers 4 results analysis 4 1 model calibration and policy impact simulation the developed icpmp model for agricultural water management was calibrated to reproduce the actual situations in the base year of 2015 fig 2 shows that the relative error between simulated results obtained from icpmp and the observed values would be less than 0 1 after calibration various water pricing policy alternatives under different water availabilities were run with the model to simulate their policy impacts a series of indicators in the form of interval numbers were obtained from the model based on which the impacts of policy alternatives could be revealed and compared indicators symbolizing economic social and environmental implications were selected which included farmers income total water consumption benefit per cubic meter of water total planting area nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer use ratio of the drip irrigation area to total planting area and ratio of the grain planting area to cash planting area by increasing the water price by 1 20 times and keeping the water amount allocated to agriculture similar to the implemented plan in 2015 the policy impacts were simulated fig 3 presents the simulated planting area as water price increases it demonstrated the upper and lower bound planting area of various crops would all decrease as water price increases except for corn the area of wheat and corn would have obvious turning points in the process of gradual water price rising which occurred when grain yield falls to a minimum set by the government for the upper lower bound the turning point would be reached when the water price increases by 5 5 4 5 times after reaching the turning point the decline rate of the wheat planting area would slow down with the increase in water price while the corn planting area would expand this is because at first grain crops with high water consumption and low benefit would fall and reach the government set minimum grain yieldas water price increases after that despite the stabilization of the total grain yield the planting area of corn would increase because of its better water use efficiency compared to wheat as water price increases the ratio of drip irrigation area to total planting area would increase and the ratio of grain crop planting area to cash crop planting area would first decline and then rise fig 4 this is probably because in the process of rising water price grain crops would first decrease and then stabilize while cash crops would decrease continuously these results indicated that as water price increases farmers would respond by adopting some measures e g reducing planting area adopting water saving irrigation technologies and shifting from grain crops to cash crops fig 5 shows the changes in the total planting area farmers income irrigation water consumption benefits per unit of water the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers as water price rises the farmers income would drop uniformly when water price rises and the upper and lower bounds of other indicators would have an obvious turning point when the water price rises to 4 5 or 5 5 times before reaching the turning point as water price rises the total planting area irrigation water consumption and fertilizer use would all decrease and the benefit per cubic of water would increase after reaching the turning point as water price increases the decline rate of the total planting area total water consumption and fertilizer use would slow down to 28 38 of the previous decline rate and the benefit per cubic of water would also decline from four perspectives i e increasing benefit per cubic of water reducing the negative impact on farmers income decreasing irrigation water consumption and fertilizer use the water price should rise to around the turning point i e 4 5 5 5 times the benchmark water price this is because when the water price is at the turning point despite the slight decrease in farmers income the benefit per cubic of water would be the highest and the decline speed of fertilizer use and irrigation water would slow down significantly fig 6 shows the changes of each index with increases of water price under different credibility levels in practice a high credibility level is associated with low water availability and system failure risk level which may be preferred by water managers with conservative attitude in contrast water managers with a positive preference may be satisfied with low credibility levels with high risk but sufficient water resources and high system benefits under all credibility levels as water price rises the farmers income would keep decreasing uniformly the total planting area nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use would slightly increase at first and then rapidly decline the total water consumption would stay flat at first and then decrease when the credibility level Ï is 0 7 the benefit per cubic of water would firstly decline then rise then drop again it would decrease constantly as water price rises when the credibility levels Ï are 0 8 and 0 9 in detail under a credibility level of 0 7 the upper and lower bounds of each index would reach two turning points in the process of rising water price the first turning point would be reached when the water price is 2 times the benchmark at which the total water consumption starts to drop before this the planting area and the fertilizer use would increase slightly while the farmers income and the benefit per cubic of water would decrease the total water consumption would remain unchanged the second turning points of the upper lower bounds of each index would be reached when the water price 4 5 5 times the benchmark at which the grain crop yields declined to a minimum after this the planting area total water consumption and fertilizer use would continue to decline as water price rises but at a significantly slower decline speed of one third to one half of the previous speed moreover after reaching the second turning point the trend of benefit per cubic of water with rising water price would shift from increase to decrease under the credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 the upper and lower bounds of each index would reach one turning point in the process of rising water price this is because the available water resources would be less under these two credibility levels and the yield of grain crops would reach the minimum even before the water price rises under the credibility level of 0 8 the upper and lower bounds of each index would both reach the turning point when the water price is 5 times benchmark under the credibility level of 0 9 the turning points of the upper and lower bounds of each index would be reached when the water price is 11 and 13 times the benchmark respectively upon reaching the turning point with the rise of water price the change trend of planting area and fertilizer use would shift from rise to decline the benefit per cubic of water would decrease and the trend of total water consumption would switch from constant to decline lower negative impact on farmers income lower irrigation water and fertilizer use as well as higher benefit per cubic of water were regarded as the most important indicators for determining the local water price threshold under all credibility levels the water prices between the benchmark water price and the water price at the first turning point were not recommended this is because within these water price ranges the amount of irrigation water would remain unchanged as the water price rises the benefit per cubic of water would decline rapidly and the fertilizer use and planting area would increase under the credibility of 0 7 if the water price increase relative to the water price at the first turning point it was recommended to increase it to around the second turning point i e 4 5 5 times the benchmark water price at this turning point although the farmers income would be lower than that before the water price rises the benefit per cubic of water would be the highest and the decline speed of fertilizer use and irrigation water would slow down significantly in summary under the credibility level of 0 7 the water price was recommended to remain unchanged or increase around 4 5 5 times the benchmark water price under the credibility level of 0 8 0 9 water price between 5 and 20 11 20 times the benchmark water price and the benchmark water price should be screened out for further assessment from the above analysis it can be seen that the water prices at the turning points were different under the three credibility levels fig 6 the higher the credibility level the higher the water price at the turning point this indicated that water availability can influence the responses of farmers to water price when water resources are scarce water prices need to be raised to a higher level before the farmers respond by reducing water use and planting area this is also in line with the laws of economics under a fixed water price as the credibility level increases the total planting area farmers income total water consumption and fertilizer use would reduce or remain unchanged the benefit per cubic meter of water would climb or remain unchanged this meant that the reduction of available water resources would promote water saving in agriculture reduce non point source pollution caused by fertilizer application and have a complex impact on the economy 4 2 evaluation of policy alternatives higher benefit per cubic meter of water famers income as well as lower water consumption and fertilizer use are welcomed by the local government based on the simulation results of these four indicators and the analysis over the different water pricing levels in section 4 1 inferior alternatives were excluded from further assessment to reduce computational loads when the water availability remains the same as the implemented plan in the base year 5 policy alternatives with water prices around 4 5 5 5 times the benchmark water price were selected for the water availability under the credibility level of 0 7 7 policy alternatives where the water prices remained unchanged or around 4 5 5 times the benchmark water price were selected under the credibility level of 0 8 0 9 17 11 alternatives in which water prices remained unchanged or 5 20 11 20 times the benchmark water price were selected as a result a total of 40 alternatives were put into the evaluation process table 4 as discussed above these 40 alternatives all had their pros and cons it was difficult to rank them straightforwardly therefore a set of attributes were used to identify the multi dimensional performance of these alternatives from a perspective of sustainable development of agricultural system in this study 11 attributes considered here were outlined in table 5 riesgo and gÃ³mez limÃ³n 2006 gomez limon and sanchez fernandez 2010 the attribute weights were determined using the md method once obtaining the attribute weights the topsis method was applied to rank the alternatives the relative closeness coefficient to the positive ideal solution obtained by the topsis method was defined as the comprehensive benefit the higher the relative closeness coefficient of policy alternative the higher its comprehensive benefit hence the more worthy of being selected table 4 shows the rank of the 40 selected alternatives under different water availabilities if the available water remains unchanged or under the credibility level of 0 7 the alternative with a water price 5 5 times the benchmark would yield the highest comprehensive benefit under the credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 the alternatives with the highest comprehensive benefit were obtained when the water price remains unchanged from the base period which would also rank as the top two among the forty alternatives the comprehensive benefit would reduce as the water price increases under the credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 the alternatives with the lowest comprehensive benefit were obtained when the water price is 20 times of the benchmark under 0 8 and 0 9 credibility levels which would also rank as the bottom two among all the alternatives this demonstrated that when there is lower available water and no subsidies water price should not be raised to maintain the sustainable development of agriculture 5 discussions 5 1 implications and implementation the results of this research could provide local authorities with recommended policies on water pricing under different water availabilities with a better understanding of the policy impacts on economy society and environment the local authorities could implement specific agricultural water management policies according to the actual conditions and development needs in the local study area when the decision makers have a positive preference for water availability water availabilities remains unchanged or under 0 7 credibility level it was recommended to increase the water price to 5 5 times of benchmark water price at this water price the system comprehensive benefit would be the highest in detail the surface water prices of changning huanhe baqu quanshan and huqu irrigation districts would be 1 46 yuan m3 and the corresponding groundwater prices would be 0 45 yuan m3 0 42 yuan m3 0 96 yuan m3 1 07 yuan m3 and 2 31 yuan m3 respectively when decision makers have conservative attitude towards water availability under 0 8 and 0 9 credibility levels it was recommended to keep the water price unchanged the increase in water price would affect farmers income while the implementation of subsidy policies could reduce the losses of farmers income at present the chinese government is advocating a water price policy of one grow one subsidy this policy supports subsiding for farmers economic losses caused by rising water prices while raising agricultural water prices to achieve fairness the subsidy method is generally based on the area of cultivated land if the local government could subsidize the total loss of farmers income caused by rising water prices a subsidy of 4345 yuan hm2 should be provided when the water price is 5 5 times the benchmark under a credibility level of 0 7 with adequate subsidies when the available water is scarce increasing water price above the turning point would not compromise comprehensive benefits but achieve water saving and environment improvement 5 2 model comparisons and limitations to verify the proposed icpmp model the simulation results were compared against those from two other models one was an ilp model that could reflect uncertain inputs but lacks calibration the other was a traditional pmp model that could be calibrated but could not reflect any uncertainty in inputs the mean values of parameters were used as inputs of the traditional pmp model in other words icpmp model could accommodate continuous information of uncertain parameters whereas pmp could merely handle the determinate values as substitute of uncertain data fig 7 compares the farmers income and planting area of policy alternatives obtained from the three models when the available water stays unchanged or under the credibility level of 0 9 both the total planting area and farmers income obtained from the pmp model would roughly fall within the ranges of interval solutions obtained from icpmp this verification indicates that compared with pmp the icpmp method could avoid significant losses of uncertain information in inputs and also provide a solution range to enable flexibility in execution the ilp model provided no solution when Ï 0 9 regardless of water pricing level it only generated solutions when water prices stays below 8 times the benchmark under the benchmark water availability this is probably because the solution of the ilp model could only be obtained at the corner of the feasible region making the model unable to simulate policy changes in some cases in comparison icpmp could obtain the simulation results of policy alternatives under different violation risks of water resource constraints it indicated that icpmp was more flexible and had a wider application range compared to ilp model in addition without enough constraints added arbitrarily to correct the model results the solution of the ilp model would have the tendency to deviate from the real situation moreover compared to ilp the icpmp model would result in higher farmers income fig 8 presents the upper and lower bounds of farmers income and total consumption under different credibility levels when the water price equals to the benchmark water price the farmers income and the total water consumption would have an obvious downward trend as the credibility levels increase this indicated icpmp could provide various scenarios to comprehensively analyze the changes of system benefits and other indicators under different violation risks of water resource constraints which could not be obtained by pmp and ilp this approach could help policymakers understand the risks when formulating water pricing policies in agricultural water management a decision maker with a conservative altitude towards water availability may set a low water price which would exacerbate water waste when water is abundant a decision maker with positive preference for water availability tend to set high water prices whereas it may cause a potential risk of constraint violations and fail to meet farmers expected income when water resource is insufficient in general icpmp exhibited advantages over the other two models in terms of improved flexibility in decision making as well as enhanced reliability through reproducing actual situation and handling input uncertainty expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets although this study was the first attempt to provide a new method for analyzing and selecting policy alternatives under uncertainty expressed as interval numbers and fuzzy sets there are still research gaps to be filled in the future studies the icpmp method using the quadratic pmp cost function may result in negative marginal costs over a range of low hectares for a specific crop and region howitt et al 2012 the quadratic pmp cost function can be replaced by the exponential pmp cost function to avoid this problem as for the evaluation part of the simulation evaluation framework the topsis method based on the md method was suitable and adopted in this study because the attribute values were expressed as interval numbers besides other madm methods could also be integrated within the general model framework such as the evidential reasoning zhang et al 2017 and gray relational analysis wei 2011 the selection of methods for policy alternative analysis depends on a number of factors such as data quality and the actual demands 6 conclusions analyzing the impacts of water management policy before implementation can help policy makers make informed decisions to analyze the impacts of water management policies an icpmp method that coupled the standard pmp interval linear programming and fuzzy credibility constrained programming was first proposed in this study the icpmp method improved up the traditional pmp by being able to handle uncertain parameters expressed as intervals and fuzzy sets it also overcame the shortcoming of traditional and inexact linear programming techniques in lacking model calibration subsequently the simulation evaluation modeling method was proposed through integrating the developed icpmp method with the topsis approach to assess and screen out policy alternatives the developed methodology was applied to arid northwestern china where water supply demand contradictions are intense by investigating different water pricing levels under different water availabilities water availability at the benchmark year and those under credibility levels of 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 various water management policy alternatives were generated the impacts of these alternatives were all simulated using the calibrated icpmp model results of various indicators were obtained for preliminary analysis which mainly included farmers income total water consumption benefit per cubic meter of water and fertilizer use based on the analysis of these four indicators forty alternatives were more beneficial which were screened out for in depth evaluation eleven attributes covering the perspectives of socio economy and environment were selected to assess those forty alternatives finally the topsis method was utilized to ultimately rank the alternatives the simulation results demonstrated that as water price increases farmers would take a series of measures to prevent income from being affected e g reducing planting area adopting water saving irrigation technologies and shifting from grain crops to cash crops when available water is equal to the water availability at the benchmark year the total planting area farmers income irrigation water consumption and fertilizer use would decrease as water price rises and the benefit per cubic of water would first increase and then decline under the three credibility levels the total planting area and fertilizer use would first increase slightly and then decrease as water price rises the irrigation water consumption would first remain unchanged then decline farmers income would keep declining the benefit per cubic of water would decline as water prices increase under credibility levels of 0 8 and 0 9 but under credibility levels of 0 7 it would first decrease then rise and then decrease again the best water pricing levels under different water availabilities were obtained from the evaluation model the results indicated that when the decision makers have a positive preference water availabilities remains unchanged or under 0 7 credibility level for water availability the water price at the turning point of water use efficiency i e benefit per cubic of water was recommend when decision makers have conservative attitude towards water availability under 0 8 and 0 9 credibility levels it was recommended to keep the water price unchanged from the base period besides the government should subsidize the losses of farmers income caused by rising water price the icpmp method was compared against the ilp model without calibration process and the pmp model without uncertain inputs the results showed that the icpmp could enhance reliability through reflecting and addressing input uncertainty as well as reproducing actual situation besides icpmp could provide reasonable water price policies under different violation risks of water resource constraints and generate a solution range to enable flexibility in decision making icpmp and the associated simulation evaluation modeling framework developed in this study has potential of wide applications to simulate and assess the implications of diverse types of policies

9481,date palm phoenix dactylifera l growth and production in the arid regions is adversely affected by increasing soil and water salinities although many aspects of date palm nutrition physiology genetics and many more are extensively researched the evaluation of salinity impact on date palm growth and productivity are limited to short duration studies and or focused mostly on the seedling stage a large gap in understanding salinity impact on mature date palms is therefore very evident a long term experiment 2001 2016 was established in 2001 using eighteen local and regional date palm varieties from the arabian peninsula on 2 5 ha to evaluate the impact of three levels of irrigation water salinity 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 ecw on date palm productivity eight years of yield data showed that fruit yield at rutab and maturity stages was severely reduced at high salinity rutab fruit yield ranged from 67 to 146 kg tree 1 at low salinity 5 ds m while at the high salinity 15 ds m 1 ecw yields ranged from 21 to 98 kg tree 1 at maturity fruit yield reduction at the high salinity relative to the low salinity reached 67 the 18 date palm varieties were widely different with regard to the impact of salinity on yield stability regression fitting and principal component analysis pca led to the identification of four different groups of date palm varieties in relation to salinity tolerance and thresholds group 1 including varieties lulu and barhi are high yielding varieties with high salinity tolerance average salinity level at 50 yield reduction was 12 ds m 1 ecw the second group includes the varieties khisab sukkari jabri shahla which are characterized as high yielding varieties with sensitivity to increase in salinity yield decline significantly at elevated salinity average salinity level at 50 yield reduction is 10 ds m 1 ecw the third group includes varieties fardh um al hamam naghal abu maan rhothan which are characterized by medium to high yield potential under low salinity with moderate salinity tolerance average salinity level at 50 yield reduction is 9 ds m 1 ecw the fourth group includes varieties shagri khnizi nabtat saif ajwat al madinah khalas maktoumi which demonstrate low yield potential with low salinity tolerance average salinity level at 50 yield reduction is 8 ds m 1 ecw the present findings will provide a better understanding of the impact of salinity on date palm yield and guide future work on genetic enhancement and the development of integrated crop management approaches for date palm under marginal conditions keywords salinity threshold saline irrigation water rutab and maturity fruit yield arabian peninsula seasonal impact principal component analysis 1 introduction the date palm phoenix dactylifera l is an important fruit tree adapted to arid and desert environmental conditions its existence played a key role in the expansion of humanity into the hot and barren parts of the world dakheel 2005 date palms persisted for over 7000 years in arabia and the middle east they form an important part of a unique plant production system due to their high production and nutritional value long period of productivity multiple uses and high resilience and capacity to tolerate several abiotic stresses globally date palm production covers an area of 1 092 104 ha with estimated number of trees around 110 million trees with a total estimated production at 8 526 218 mt its cultivation expands to asia 648 372 ha africa 435 763 ha europe 947 ha and the americas 7022 ha fao 2020 date palm agroecosystems in various parts of the world are facing increased biotic stresses such as the red weevil and the bayoud fungal disease that have greatly impacted yield and survival of the trees many abiotic stresses such as salinity drought and heat aggravated by climate change are also having detrimental effects on date palm productivity and existence in many parts including the arabian peninsula iraq the jordan valley north africa and others water salinity is a major threat to the date palm production in such regions and its impact is expected to increase with the gradual and unavoidable increases in both water and soil salinity under climate change for example in the arabian peninsula in general and the uae in specific water salinity is very high in old farms more than 15 years reaching levels of 16 20 ds m 1 availability of low salinity water less than 3 ds m 1 is becoming increasingly very limited moreover over irrigation and poor soil management have further aggravated the problem of salinity and led to more deterioration alhammadi and glenn 2008 dakheel 2005 in the arabian peninsula several factors contribute to the increase in groundwater salinity such as expansion of the agricultural production area excessive use of limited groundwater resources and seawater intrusion watanabe et al 2004 youssef and awad 2008 this situation has resulted in declines in productivity and abandonment of a large number of farms several authors reported that date palm phoenix dactylifera l trees exhibit significant salt tolerance and have also shown good growth and yield performance against high temperature drought and the hyper arid and harsh desert environment zaid and de wet 2002a sperling et al 2014 fao 1982 an assessment of the influence of salinity on date palm yield and fruit quality can be obtained from previous studies carried out in different parts of the world where date palm grows however most of these are of limited duration due to the slow growth of the tree and the fact that the salinity gradually increased and in many cases it affected well established trees in the last case the full impact of salinity may take a long time to manifest itself in terms of significant reductions in yield and and or directly impacts on the survival of the trees the most common assessments of the salinity thresholds in date palm were given by ayers and westcot 1985 zaid and de wet 2002b zaid and liebenberg 2005 and the review by maas 1990 the salinity response curves and threshold values were constructed primarily based on information available in the literature rather than actual data from long term assessment the curves give estimates of 50 yield reduction ec50 that should be evaluated for mature plants in the field rather than at the seedling stage or evaluation at a certain point of time salinity impacts date palm growth in part through disruptive osmotic effects physiological drought that are similar to the effects of drought and lead to a reduction in the capacity of plant roots to absorb water from the root medium due to the high solute concentrations caused by the salt the nutrient uptake imbalance photosynthesis and several other physiological and biochemical traits in terrestrial plants are mostly affected following salinity exposure munns and tester 2008 tripler et al 2011 hussain et al 2016 2018 2020 or a combination of these factors karim and al dakheel 2006 maathuis 2006 hussain et al 2016 2018 2020 some authors have suggested that date palm can tolerant high salinity due to ion exclusion at the root level furr et al 1966 tripler et al 2007 a response that is cultivar specific djibril et al 2005 according to tripler et al 2007 seedling growth and water uptake was greatly decreased following salinity exposure at an early seedling stage in the review by alhammadi and kurup 2012 they concluded that despite the existence of salt tolerant cultivars there is a need for systematic approaches to characterize salt tolerance in date palm although date palms have the ability to grow under saline conditions different varieties have displayed distinct levels of tolerance to soil salinity yaish and kumar 2015a 2015b emphasized the vital role of genes phenotypic plasticity and yield stability in indigenous date palm varieties growing in highly saline environments the arabian peninsula has vast genetic diversity in date palm with varieties and accessions that are adapted to the local environmental conditions of the approximately 1500 known date palm varieties fao 2002 there are more than 250 varieties in the gulf countries of the arabian peninsula such diversity provides the ground for exploring this potential along with the development of proper management practices to reach the goal of sustainable date palm agroecosystems in these marginal environments this study represents extensive and sustained efforts over 15 years to evaluate salinity impact and adaptations of eighteen important date palm varieties from the arabian peninsula precise and long term evaluation of salinity impact on different varieties of date palm is therefore a key step in the development of better and more resilient date palm varieties with the use of conventional and most importantly advanced biotechnological tools therefore objective of this research is to determine the long term impact of salinity on date palm growth and productivity and to establish precise salinity thresholds for a diverse range of date palm genetic materials the study included eighteen elite date palm varieties 10 emirate and 8 saudi origin to evaluate long term salt stress on date palm growth and fruit yield to screen salt tolerant and sensitive varieties and established from seedlings in 2001 and 2002 under three salinity levels ranged from 5 to 15 ds m 1 with yield data from 2007 to 2016 2 material and methods in this region as in most part of the uae freshwater resources are scarce therefore for agricultural activities irrigation depends mainly on saline ground water having high degree of salinity 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions about 200 date palm varieties are well recognized in uae and 68 of them are most important commercially because of their fruit yield and quality and nutritional attributes jaradat and zaid 2004 eighteen date palm varieties were selected 10 from uae and 8 from saudi arabia to have a good representation of diversified genetic variability the table 1 showed the date palm varieties selected for this long term salinity evaluation during 2001 and 2002 growing seasons uniform seedlings around 1 m in height of the 18 date palm varieties were planted on a 2 5 ha field at the international center for biosaline agriculture icba experiment station located near dubai united arab emirates 25 13 n and 55 17 e prior to planting the site was harrowed and leveled to ensure an even seedbed the eighteen varieties were planted in eighteen rows one row for each variety and each row contained 15 trees allowing for 5 replicate trees for each of the three irrigation water salinity levels treatments and data collection continued through 2017 the experimental site is described as arid with very low precipitation about 50 mm annually while the annual eto is higher than 1900 mm rainfall impact is minimal on soil water balance in the study location flash rain usually affects the top 60 cm of the soil at maximum and for short duration shahid et al 2009 temperatures are high and rainfall is negligible from april to november karim and al dakheel 2006 the monthly temperature and cumulative precipitation are shown in fig 1 the soil is carbonatic hyperthermic typic torripsamment series moderately alkaline and strongly calcareous the soil is classified as fine sand contains 98 sand of different sizes 1 silt and 1 clay saturation percentage is 26 water retention at 15 bar w15 is 6 50 and available water capacity is 4 13 caco3 equivalents is 53 and ece 0 2 ds m 1 the munsell soil color dry is 10yr 6 4 pale brown which a composite reflection from the dominance is of carbonates and sand with insignificant contribution of organic matter to the color composition due to the sandy nature the soil has very high drainage capacity and is moderate to rapidly permeable shahid et al 2009 2 2 agronomic practices all the routine agronomical practices were carried out according to the prevailing schedule for date palm plantation organic compost manure was applied at the rate of 20 kg per tree from establishment stage and annually thereafter during the last two weeks of october npk fertilizer was applied early october and december yearly at the recommended rate as per normal agronomical practice in uae the trees of each variety were hand pollinated from high quality male trees pollens during all growing seasons pollination extended from early february to late march and the harvest occurred generally during the summer season july september depending on the maturity of individual variety the agronomical measurements were made on all five trees data from three most homogeneous trees per treatment included in the final data selected for analysis 2 3 irrigation water source salinity and experimental design irrigation water salinities were selected based on salinity level of the available water resources and the expected salinity thresholds responses in date palm several early reviews indicated that the first decline in yield from 100 is estimated at ecw between 4 and 5 ds m 1 ayers and westcot 1985 liebenberg and zaid 1999 and mass 1990 followed by a linear phase reduction in yield above the 5 ds m 1 threshold therefore the three targeted salinities 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 were selected to represent conditions that lead to substantial yield reduction and to include the 50 yield reduction thresholds the three salinity levels were obtained by mixing the low salinity municipal water ecw at 2 3 ds m 1 sar 4 mmol l 1 with na and cl concentrations lower than 11 meq l 1 and ph 8 5 with the high salinity groundwater ecw 25 ds m 1 sar 26 mmol l 1 with na and cl concentrations higher than 190 meq l 1 and ph 7 6 the mixed water salinities were checked twice a week using an electrical conductivity ec meter and maintained throughout the experiment the experimental plots were arranged in a split plot design with irrigation water salinity as the main plot factor and variety as the subplot factor there were five replications individual trees for each salinity variety combination salinity was also monitored by direct soil sampling at various depths and through soil moisture and salinity sensors installed in the root zones of date palm varieties starting in 2014 trees were irrigated using a bubbler system with a flow rate of 10 l m 1 and one bubbler tree was used at early growth stages at the start of the productive stages two bubblers tree were used for the tree basins which were approximately 2 m in diameter targeted daily irrigation amount was estimated at 150 etc throughout the year the extra 50 was to account for irrigation system inefficiencies and to add leaching fraction to reduce salt buildup in the root zone al muaini et al 2019a consequently at the start of the productive stages irrigation was scheduled once daily for 5 min during colder months october february and twice daily during march september meteorological data temperature rainfall relative humidity and evapotranspiration were obtained from icba weather station dubai united arab emirates 2 4 trait measurements and data collection the following reproductive fruit characteristics were measured number of main fruit branches per plant weight of main fruit branch bunch plant with fruit weight of sub fruit branches number of fruits per sub branch and fruit yield per tree kg at rutab and maturity stages at the end of the khalal and the beginning of the rutab stage partially browned and softened at the tip and reduced moisture contents a selected number of bunches from each tree were harvested and total yield tree was computed at this stage the total weight of rutab fruits in each bunch was also recorded at maturity a selected set of main fruit bunches were harvested from each tree for estimation of the parameters indicated above total yield per tree kg was obtained from the weight of all fruit branches 2 5 statistical analysis means of three replicates and their standard deviation sd were determined the effects of the date palm variety season year and salinity level s1 s2 and s3 on physiological and yield attributes were analyzed using glm generalized liner model date palm variety year and salinity level were pooled as fixed factors while all the physiological traits and yield parameters were the dependent variables the test of significance between date palm variety and year under the same salinity treatment was conducted using pairwise comparisons in glm at p 0 05 which also used to determine the differences of same variety under different salinity levels the salinity level was set as the independent variable and the relative yield at rutab stage and at maturity stage as the dependent variable all data were analyzed using spss 20 0 for windows spss inc principal component analysis pca was performed on yield means recorded at each salinity level to cluster the tested entries from the date palm varieties note that variate stands for any response variable and individual stands for any variety in this analysis pca helps the selection of entries at 25 intensity of selection based on entries loadings on the first and the second components at each salinity level selection was done at each salinity level independently we selected entries having simultaneous high values for both growth and yield and intensity of selection was 25 the eighteen entries selected and ability of each entry was determined using its loadings on the two components of pca 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic data average temperature and rainfall values during the experiment are presented in fig 1a the highest monthly mean temperature was 44 6 c and the lowest 24 5 c january average annual humidity ranged from 30 to 76 climate could be characterized as typical hyper arid with relatively mild winters and hot dry summer receiving almost all their precipitation during their winter seasons potential monthly evapotranspiration and precipitation are presented in fig 1b for the icba experimental station during the period 2002 2014 the experimental site is described as arid with very low precipitation about 50 mm annually and summer months are characterized by high evapotranspiration up to 200 mm month in a concurrent extensive study conducted on a subgroup of three varieties of the same date palm trial with contrasting response to salinity var lulu khalas and shahla from 2014 to 2017 with tdr probes and salinity sensors installed at depths between 100 and 270 cm it was concluded that there was no trend in salt build up with the use of irrigation at 1 5 etc al muaini et al 2019a 2019b the result indicating effective leaching of salt from the root zone and sustainable rate of irrigation after seventeen years of irrigation with saline water sources up to 15 ds m 1 3 2 date palm fruit yield at rutab and maturity under different salinity conditions the two key economic indicators of date palm cultivation are the fruit yield at rutab and maturity stages therefore the ultimate measure of the impact of salinity and other biotic or abiotic stresses is measured by the degree of yield reduction over a period of at least eight production seasons for each variety the outcome of the data should provide a solid estimation of the impact of salinity on the economic yield of a wide range of important varieties from the arabian peninsula the following sections highlighted the key outcomes 3 2 1 fruit yield at rutab stage date palm fruit at rutab stage has high economic value and it is consumed extensively in the gulf region understanding the impact of salinity at this stage is therefore of great practical importance there was a significant variation in yield at the rutab stage for 16 date palm varieties data for two varieties were excluded due to inconsistency under the three irrigation salinity levels fig 2 the results of field evaluation of yield at rutab stage in 16 date palm varieties under a wide range of salinity stress showed highly negative impact on the yield of all varieties average yield reduction for all varieties at 10 ds m 1 reached 44 and at 15 ds m 1 reached 64 highly significant variations in rutab yield among all the varieties were observed fig 3 rutab yield at the low salinity ranged between 67 and 146 kg tree 1 while at the high salinity 15 ds m 1 it ranged from 18 to 63 kg tree 1 the highest fruit weight at rutab stage fwr were 146 144 and 136 kg that was recorded in lulu barhi and followed by shahla and the lowest 67 kg was obtained in khnizi date palm lulu barhi and khisab varieties produced higher fruit yield at medium salinity 10 ds m 1 while nabtat saif produced the lowest fruit yield 30 kg at 15 ds m 1 the patterns of decrease in fruit yield at rutab stage of stressed date palm were different and highest fruit yield were obtained in khisab sukkari and followed by barhi that produced 62 60 and 59 kg respectively while the lowest 18 kg was produced in khnizi fig 2 table 2 a drastic decrease in fruit weight with the increasing of salinity levels was observed in every variety and maximum reduction was observed at 15 ds m 1 salinity 3 3 fruit yield at maturity the saline water irrigation had a deleterious effect on the fruit yield mean of 8 years at maturity stage fig 3 and significantly differed among the date palm varieties the overall yield reduction at the high salinity 15 ds m 1 relative to the low salinity reached 67 at the lowest salinity level 5 ds m 1 the highest fruit yield was produced by shahla 58 22 kg tree 1 lulu 51 15 kg abu mann 49 kg and khisab 48 86 kg while the barhi rhothan and sukkari varieties produced an average 43 45 kg tree 1 fig 3 table 3 and nabtat sultan produced the lowest fruit yield 10 96 kg at the same salinity level indicating the salt sensitivity of this variety at medium salinity 10 ds m 1 lulu barhi shahla and khisab produced the highest fruit yield of 33 28 27 and 26 kg tree 1 while fruit yields were similar but lower for the jabri rhothan and sukkari varieties which produced 25 kg tree 1 on the average at higher salinity 15 ds m 1 the average fruit yield of lulu barhi and khisab were 22 19 and 16 kg tree 1 while fruit yield was lowest 3 81 kg in nabtat sultan at highest salinity fig 3 according to studies of zaid and arias jimenez 1999 there is strong correlation between fruit load fruit yield per tree and it varies from one to other variety shahin and alhajhoj 2015 showed that khalas sheshi and ruzeiz varieties provided higher fruit yield following irrigation with saline water 2 81 ds m 1 as compared to groundwater and agricultural drainage water 5 04 ds m 1 meanwhile these varieties exhibited higher fruit length and diameter and flesh weight with the less saline irrigation water for the nabtat sultan variety in our study there was a drastic reduction of 65 in average fruit yield over a period of 8 years at higher water salinity indicating the salt sensitivity of this variety al muaini et al 2019a 2019b demonstrated that use of saline water for irrigation reduces the water consumption and palm growth due to possible osmotic gradients between the soil and the plants meanwhile they found a 48 increase in fruit yield in lulu variety following exposure to 5 ds m 1 water salinity as compared to higher salinity 15 ds m 1 gribaa et al 2013 showed that deficit watering is advisable during fruit bunch development stage as the fruits grow slowly and may not require much water however inadequate watering after this phase can result in small fruits and lower yields al yahyai and al kharousi 2012 reported that the total dry matter content of khalas dates increased significantly under water stress conditions however there was no difference in total soluble solids tss or the sugar content of the fruit in our study the jabri shahla and sukkari varieties had similar fruit yields average of 15 kg tree 1 under irrigation with 15ds m 1 water the rhothan variety yielded relatively well at low and medium salinity but its fruit yield reduced 71 significantly at high salinity 15 ds m 1 3 4 regression fitting and correlations of fruit yield over time and irrigation water salinity ecw correlations among all growth and yield traits including fruit yield at rutab and maturity were performed the full results are given in table 4 summarizes the results for fruit yield at maturity and its correlations with other growth and yield parameters were performed the highest positive correlations obtained were for fruit yield at maturity as related to fruit yield at the rutab stage trunk height was the only trait that showed a weak positive correlation with fruit yield at maturity leaf number old leaf length and new length exhibited positive but very low correlations with fruit yield at maturity such a contrast in correlations requires careful consideration of the data and the conclusion to be made correlations within each individual environment are more informative and reflect the response for it correlations between fruit yield and fruit traits such as fruit length width volume etc all showed negative correlations with total fruit yield per tree table 4 fruit thinning on the bunch during growth stage was not practiced in order to observe the biological capacity in fruit yield under salinity without external effects under such situations a tradeoff between fruit yield components is expected pallas et al 2013 the most common tradeoff is between number of fruits and fruit weight whole bunch fruit and strand thinning are common practices in date palm to increase fruit size and quality mostafa and el akkad 2011 the limitations of the source sink capacity in most fruit trees require such practices depending on the fruit characteristics targeted limited sink capacity the bunch and fruits or limited sources of supply can lead to the negative relations observed the dynamics of source sink relations and its impact on date palm fruit yield under salinity condition is the subject of further investigation in this project finding the optimum target value for each of the fruit components that optimize yield under salinity conditions is an important target the components of yield and growth traits will be further used in developing comprehensive date palm management under low and high stress conditions 3 5 regression fitting of fruit yield averaged over time and salinity level the 7 8 years yield data of the different varieties with a contrasting response to salinity impact represent a unique opportunity to develop response curves to salinity and identify key thresholds for each variety evaluated date palm fruit yield response to salinity over 7 8 harvest seasons 2007 2015 for 8 selected date palm varieties from the arabian peninsula which represent the diversity in response to salinity as seen in the previous section are presented in fig 4 linear regression lines are fitted to each yield series for the three salinity levels as seen in the graph the eight varieties represent different production capacity at low stress conditions and mode of response to salinity increase similar response curves for the other varieties that are not presented were observed generally fruit yield at low salinity has a wider range and narrowed at the higher salinity level however tolerant varieties showed wider ranges even at the high salinity linear regressions were fit to the data to identify the constants of yield reduction yield at zero salinity and salinity value when yield diminishes polynomial fittings can give higher correlations but will lead to high estimates of the aforementioned values based on the response observed and the linear fit relative yield graphs were developed for each variety to determine the thresholds that can be obtain namely the salinity at 50 yield reduction and the salinity when yield approach zero examples of such relative yield response are given in fig 5 the key objectives of this research were to assess the long term salinity tolerance of a diverse set of date palm varieties to reach substantiated conclusions on the impact of salinity on date palm productivity and quality and to fill a gap in the knowledge related to the variation in threshold values amongst date palm varieties such knowledge will not only help in developing better strategies for date palm future and management approaches but also to provide the key knowledge about genetic variations and how it might be used in genetic enhancement programs through conventional and advanced biotechnological techniques as indicated earlier research dealing with salinity impact on date palm trees is limited particularly long term evaluation and monitoring most studies dealt with salinity impact at the seedling stage such as aljuburi 1992 1993 1996a 1996b and aljuburi and al masry 1995 1996a 1996b 2000 were focused on the effects of different salinity levels on seedlings growth of a limited number of date palm varieties similarly hassan and el azayem 1990 hassan and el samnoudi 1997 hussein et al 1995 1999 al khateeb and al khateeb 2001 and abdulwahid 2012 reported on work related to screening different date palm varieties for salinity tolerance and the effects of different salinity levels on growth and mineral composition of date palm varieties mattar et al 2021 reported impact of three level of irrigation water type on single date palm variety succary with a maximum salinity in irrigation water up to 3 94 ds m 1 and for the duration of a single season in reviews by alhammadi and kurup 2012 and by yaish and kumar 2015a 2015b in both cases the authors concluded that despite the prominent importance and long history of date palm work on salinity adaptation and mechanisms are very limited they concluded that this area of research is a black box that needs to be decoded 3 6 establishing salinity thresholds for different date palm varieties date palm fruit yield data over eight years were characterized based on the response of fruit yield of each variety to salinity over eight years and the relative yield regression fitting a summary of the absolute and relative fruit yield at different salinity levels salinity threshold for 50 yield reduction and yield reduction per unit increase in salinity is presented table 5 the actual and relative yields of a wide range of date palm genetic diversity at 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 along with projected yields at the lower salinity levels and the level when yield diminishes are identified such estimates are based on linear fittings of yield verses salinity although the initial phase of salinity response may not be linear maas and hoffman 1977 the salinity levels from 5 to 15 ds m 1 are expected to be within the linear phase of decline in yield estimated salinity at 50 yield reduction for all varieties ranged between 8 3 and 11 8 ds m 1 for the linear fit and 100 relative yields estimates the slope values of yield reduction percentage per unit of salinity increase 1 ds m 1 ranged from 4 5 to 6 1 the values of salinity at 50 yield reduction based on the three points measured certainly gave higher estimates that ranged from 10 45 to 13 8 ds m 1 such estimates are acceptable if date palm yield is not affected up to the 5 ds m 1 level of irrigation water salinity however previous indications suggested a linear decline ayers and westcot 1985 also the long term cumulative impact of salinity will invariably make the yield at 5 ds m 1 less than at levels close to freshwater salinity less than 1 ds m 1 the estimates of salinity level at which the fruit yield diminishes are also estimated based on linear regressions table 5 the values ranged from 16 6 ds m 1 in the sensitive variety um al hamam to over 22 ds m 1in the tolerant varieties like lulu and barhi the one estimate is given by ayers and wescott 1985 put such values as high as 32 ds m 1 certainly based on our comprehensive long term data set would be closer to the salinity impact on data palm survival and productivity in the uae farms where salinity of irrigation water reached level above 25 ds m 1 have been abandoned or their yield declined sharply dakheel 2005 based on the salinity thresholds identified in table 5 and the yield response to salinity observed earlier the response to salinity of the collection of 18 date palm varieties can be recognized into four distinct groups fig 6 summarizes the four groups and their salinity tolerance levels and thresholds the specific salinity response and thresholds for each group are presented in fig 7 the specific yield traits tolerance to salinity and threshold at 50 yield reduction are summarized in table 6 below clearly such groups demonstrate that date palm varieties vary widely in their response to salinity like any other conventional crop and no single generalization can be applied to all cases and salinity situations this can be considered a unique outcome that provides a comprehensive assessment of salinity impact on date palm that is largely do not exists the table shows that the varieties lulu and barhi are the most salt tolerant and stable varieties to further asses the feasibility of such grouping of varieties a principal component analysis pca was performed on the 18 varieties under the three salinity environments and overall years the results are presented in fig 7 3 7 principal component analysis pca the score and loading plots of principal component analysis pca to evaluate the effects of various levels of irrigation water salinity ecw treatments on fruit yield at rutab and at maturity characteristics of date palm varieties are given in fig 8 the pca biplot shows the distribution of the 18 date palm varieties in all corners of the scatter plot along the axes of factor 1 and factor 2 fig 8a b the fruit yield at rutab stage fyrut measured from the date palm varieties showed 86 5 of the observed variation and could be explained by first principal component pc1 moreover principal component pc2 depicted 9 47 of the total variation regarding this attribute fig 8a among the date palm varieties lulu was the best representative for fruit yield at maturity fymat this was revealed by its location at the extreme of the axis for factor 1 it was followed by the barhi that fall very close to lulu in the biplot graph in contrast maktoumi showed the highest representation lowest yield for the same trait on the axis for factor 2 the fymat measured from all 18 date palm varieties showed 88 of the observed variation could be explained by first principal component pc1 moreover the second principal component pc2 depicted 8 43 of the total variation among all the date palm varieties regarding this attribute fig 8a salinity applies a gradual selection pressure on the varieties more variance captured when salinity increased each principal component accounted for a proportion of the variation and was correlated to different degrees to the measured attributes pca analysis of the fymat of 18 date palm varieties against three salinity levels indicated distinct variation the group iii included the date palm varieties fig 8b that had highest fymat and posses uniformity in their fymat at all salinities indicating successful adaptation of these varieties under medium and high salinity all of the salinity treatments s1 s2 s3 were distributed successfully by first two principal components this distribution of treatments gave a clear indication that increasing level of salinity had significant effects on fruit yield of date fig 8a b the varieties in the group iii khisab sukkari and barhi included the date palm varieties that performed out of class regarding fyrut and possess uniformity in their fymat at all salinities indicating successful adaptation of these varieties at medium and high salinity these date palm varieties proved to be higher fruit yielders at both rutab and maturity stage and were more suitable for medium and high saline environment date palm variety khalas was the most susceptible variety and showed very poor response across at all salinity levels for both traits fyrut and fymat as compared to all other varieties the results of the pca confirm the grouping of varieties according to their tolerance concluded in the previous section 4 conclusions the nature and long life span in date palm make long term studies complicated and require time and resources such an approach for long term impact assessment was undertaken in the present studies the results obtained have established solid conclusions about the negative impacts of increasing salinity levels on growth water use and fruit yield yield reductions can exceed 67 at salinity levels around 15 ds m 1 ecw in certain varieties tolerant and sensitive varieties to salinity were identified four distinct groups in terms of their salinity tolerance potential and thresholds were identified salinity thresholds based on irrigation water salinity ecw50 and ecw0 were identified for the different varieties and most importantly it is now well documented that substantial variations exists among date palm varieties in their salinity tolerance the minimum estimates for 50 yield reduction ranged from 8 6 to 12 ds m 1 ecw and at the maximum ranged from 10 5 to 14 ds m 1 ecw the previously reported limits were shown to be higher than the findings of this work the long term salinity assessment certainly adds more accuracy to the conclusions drawn yield reduction percentages at different salinity levels were established and will be of great practical importance for date palm management meanwhile saline water decreases the growth and fruit yield in date palm displayed different morphological and physiological responses to each salt stress level being different among varieties initial results on the estimation of date palm actual water use and demands under the local environmental conditions demonstrated that the amount of irrigation practices applied more than double the actual needs in addition previous results from the same experiment with different agro physiological traits al muaini et al 2019b showed that under irrigation with high salinity water 15 ds m 1 ecw the actual water use by three selected varieties declined by 43 46 such findings have great implications for water management under saline conditions we believe that the outcome of this work is a benchmark in salinity impact on date palm the results of this study

9481,date palm phoenix dactylifera l growth and production in the arid regions is adversely affected by increasing soil and water salinities although many aspects of date palm nutrition physiology genetics and many more are extensively researched the evaluation of salinity impact on date palm growth and productivity are limited to short duration studies and or focused mostly on the seedling stage a large gap in understanding salinity impact on mature date palms is therefore very evident a long term experiment 2001 2016 was established in 2001 using eighteen local and regional date palm varieties from the arabian peninsula on 2 5 ha to evaluate the impact of three levels of irrigation water salinity 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 ecw on date palm productivity eight years of yield data showed that fruit yield at rutab and maturity stages was severely reduced at high salinity rutab fruit yield ranged from 67 to 146 kg tree 1 at low salinity 5 ds m while at the high salinity 15 ds m 1 ecw yields ranged from 21 to 98 kg tree 1 at maturity fruit yield reduction at the high salinity relative to the low salinity reached 67 the 18 date palm varieties were widely different with regard to the impact of salinity on yield stability regression fitting and principal component analysis pca led to the identification of four different groups of date palm varieties in relation to salinity tolerance and thresholds group 1 including varieties lulu and barhi are high yielding varieties with high salinity tolerance average salinity level at 50 yield reduction was 12 ds m 1 ecw the second group includes the varieties khisab sukkari jabri shahla which are characterized as high yielding varieties with sensitivity to increase in salinity yield decline significantly at elevated salinity average salinity level at 50 yield reduction is 10 ds m 1 ecw the third group includes varieties fardh um al hamam naghal abu maan rhothan which are characterized by medium to high yield potential under low salinity with moderate salinity tolerance average salinity level at 50 yield reduction is 9 ds m 1 ecw the fourth group includes varieties shagri khnizi nabtat saif ajwat al madinah khalas maktoumi which demonstrate low yield potential with low salinity tolerance average salinity level at 50 yield reduction is 8 ds m 1 ecw the present findings will provide a better understanding of the impact of salinity on date palm yield and guide future work on genetic enhancement and the development of integrated crop management approaches for date palm under marginal conditions keywords salinity threshold saline irrigation water rutab and maturity fruit yield arabian peninsula seasonal impact principal component analysis 1 introduction the date palm phoenix dactylifera l is an important fruit tree adapted to arid and desert environmental conditions its existence played a key role in the expansion of humanity into the hot and barren parts of the world dakheel 2005 date palms persisted for over 7000 years in arabia and the middle east they form an important part of a unique plant production system due to their high production and nutritional value long period of productivity multiple uses and high resilience and capacity to tolerate several abiotic stresses globally date palm production covers an area of 1 092 104 ha with estimated number of trees around 110 million trees with a total estimated production at 8 526 218 mt its cultivation expands to asia 648 372 ha africa 435 763 ha europe 947 ha and the americas 7022 ha fao 2020 date palm agroecosystems in various parts of the world are facing increased biotic stresses such as the red weevil and the bayoud fungal disease that have greatly impacted yield and survival of the trees many abiotic stresses such as salinity drought and heat aggravated by climate change are also having detrimental effects on date palm productivity and existence in many parts including the arabian peninsula iraq the jordan valley north africa and others water salinity is a major threat to the date palm production in such regions and its impact is expected to increase with the gradual and unavoidable increases in both water and soil salinity under climate change for example in the arabian peninsula in general and the uae in specific water salinity is very high in old farms more than 15 years reaching levels of 16 20 ds m 1 availability of low salinity water less than 3 ds m 1 is becoming increasingly very limited moreover over irrigation and poor soil management have further aggravated the problem of salinity and led to more deterioration alhammadi and glenn 2008 dakheel 2005 in the arabian peninsula several factors contribute to the increase in groundwater salinity such as expansion of the agricultural production area excessive use of limited groundwater resources and seawater intrusion watanabe et al 2004 youssef and awad 2008 this situation has resulted in declines in productivity and abandonment of a large number of farms several authors reported that date palm phoenix dactylifera l trees exhibit significant salt tolerance and have also shown good growth and yield performance against high temperature drought and the hyper arid and harsh desert environment zaid and de wet 2002a sperling et al 2014 fao 1982 an assessment of the influence of salinity on date palm yield and fruit quality can be obtained from previous studies carried out in different parts of the world where date palm grows however most of these are of limited duration due to the slow growth of the tree and the fact that the salinity gradually increased and in many cases it affected well established trees in the last case the full impact of salinity may take a long time to manifest itself in terms of significant reductions in yield and and or directly impacts on the survival of the trees the most common assessments of the salinity thresholds in date palm were given by ayers and westcot 1985 zaid and de wet 2002b zaid and liebenberg 2005 and the review by maas 1990 the salinity response curves and threshold values were constructed primarily based on information available in the literature rather than actual data from long term assessment the curves give estimates of 50 yield reduction ec50 that should be evaluated for mature plants in the field rather than at the seedling stage or evaluation at a certain point of time salinity impacts date palm growth in part through disruptive osmotic effects physiological drought that are similar to the effects of drought and lead to a reduction in the capacity of plant roots to absorb water from the root medium due to the high solute concentrations caused by the salt the nutrient uptake imbalance photosynthesis and several other physiological and biochemical traits in terrestrial plants are mostly affected following salinity exposure munns and tester 2008 tripler et al 2011 hussain et al 2016 2018 2020 or a combination of these factors karim and al dakheel 2006 maathuis 2006 hussain et al 2016 2018 2020 some authors have suggested that date palm can tolerant high salinity due to ion exclusion at the root level furr et al 1966 tripler et al 2007 a response that is cultivar specific djibril et al 2005 according to tripler et al 2007 seedling growth and water uptake was greatly decreased following salinity exposure at an early seedling stage in the review by alhammadi and kurup 2012 they concluded that despite the existence of salt tolerant cultivars there is a need for systematic approaches to characterize salt tolerance in date palm although date palms have the ability to grow under saline conditions different varieties have displayed distinct levels of tolerance to soil salinity yaish and kumar 2015a 2015b emphasized the vital role of genes phenotypic plasticity and yield stability in indigenous date palm varieties growing in highly saline environments the arabian peninsula has vast genetic diversity in date palm with varieties and accessions that are adapted to the local environmental conditions of the approximately 1500 known date palm varieties fao 2002 there are more than 250 varieties in the gulf countries of the arabian peninsula such diversity provides the ground for exploring this potential along with the development of proper management practices to reach the goal of sustainable date palm agroecosystems in these marginal environments this study represents extensive and sustained efforts over 15 years to evaluate salinity impact and adaptations of eighteen important date palm varieties from the arabian peninsula precise and long term evaluation of salinity impact on different varieties of date palm is therefore a key step in the development of better and more resilient date palm varieties with the use of conventional and most importantly advanced biotechnological tools therefore objective of this research is to determine the long term impact of salinity on date palm growth and productivity and to establish precise salinity thresholds for a diverse range of date palm genetic materials the study included eighteen elite date palm varieties 10 emirate and 8 saudi origin to evaluate long term salt stress on date palm growth and fruit yield to screen salt tolerant and sensitive varieties and established from seedlings in 2001 and 2002 under three salinity levels ranged from 5 to 15 ds m 1 with yield data from 2007 to 2016 2 material and methods in this region as in most part of the uae freshwater resources are scarce therefore for agricultural activities irrigation depends mainly on saline ground water having high degree of salinity 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions about 200 date palm varieties are well recognized in uae and 68 of them are most important commercially because of their fruit yield and quality and nutritional attributes jaradat and zaid 2004 eighteen date palm varieties were selected 10 from uae and 8 from saudi arabia to have a good representation of diversified genetic variability the table 1 showed the date palm varieties selected for this long term salinity evaluation during 2001 and 2002 growing seasons uniform seedlings around 1 m in height of the 18 date palm varieties were planted on a 2 5 ha field at the international center for biosaline agriculture icba experiment station located near dubai united arab emirates 25 13 n and 55 17 e prior to planting the site was harrowed and leveled to ensure an even seedbed the eighteen varieties were planted in eighteen rows one row for each variety and each row contained 15 trees allowing for 5 replicate trees for each of the three irrigation water salinity levels treatments and data collection continued through 2017 the experimental site is described as arid with very low precipitation about 50 mm annually while the annual eto is higher than 1900 mm rainfall impact is minimal on soil water balance in the study location flash rain usually affects the top 60 cm of the soil at maximum and for short duration shahid et al 2009 temperatures are high and rainfall is negligible from april to november karim and al dakheel 2006 the monthly temperature and cumulative precipitation are shown in fig 1 the soil is carbonatic hyperthermic typic torripsamment series moderately alkaline and strongly calcareous the soil is classified as fine sand contains 98 sand of different sizes 1 silt and 1 clay saturation percentage is 26 water retention at 15 bar w15 is 6 50 and available water capacity is 4 13 caco3 equivalents is 53 and ece 0 2 ds m 1 the munsell soil color dry is 10yr 6 4 pale brown which a composite reflection from the dominance is of carbonates and sand with insignificant contribution of organic matter to the color composition due to the sandy nature the soil has very high drainage capacity and is moderate to rapidly permeable shahid et al 2009 2 2 agronomic practices all the routine agronomical practices were carried out according to the prevailing schedule for date palm plantation organic compost manure was applied at the rate of 20 kg per tree from establishment stage and annually thereafter during the last two weeks of october npk fertilizer was applied early october and december yearly at the recommended rate as per normal agronomical practice in uae the trees of each variety were hand pollinated from high quality male trees pollens during all growing seasons pollination extended from early february to late march and the harvest occurred generally during the summer season july september depending on the maturity of individual variety the agronomical measurements were made on all five trees data from three most homogeneous trees per treatment included in the final data selected for analysis 2 3 irrigation water source salinity and experimental design irrigation water salinities were selected based on salinity level of the available water resources and the expected salinity thresholds responses in date palm several early reviews indicated that the first decline in yield from 100 is estimated at ecw between 4 and 5 ds m 1 ayers and westcot 1985 liebenberg and zaid 1999 and mass 1990 followed by a linear phase reduction in yield above the 5 ds m 1 threshold therefore the three targeted salinities 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 were selected to represent conditions that lead to substantial yield reduction and to include the 50 yield reduction thresholds the three salinity levels were obtained by mixing the low salinity municipal water ecw at 2 3 ds m 1 sar 4 mmol l 1 with na and cl concentrations lower than 11 meq l 1 and ph 8 5 with the high salinity groundwater ecw 25 ds m 1 sar 26 mmol l 1 with na and cl concentrations higher than 190 meq l 1 and ph 7 6 the mixed water salinities were checked twice a week using an electrical conductivity ec meter and maintained throughout the experiment the experimental plots were arranged in a split plot design with irrigation water salinity as the main plot factor and variety as the subplot factor there were five replications individual trees for each salinity variety combination salinity was also monitored by direct soil sampling at various depths and through soil moisture and salinity sensors installed in the root zones of date palm varieties starting in 2014 trees were irrigated using a bubbler system with a flow rate of 10 l m 1 and one bubbler tree was used at early growth stages at the start of the productive stages two bubblers tree were used for the tree basins which were approximately 2 m in diameter targeted daily irrigation amount was estimated at 150 etc throughout the year the extra 50 was to account for irrigation system inefficiencies and to add leaching fraction to reduce salt buildup in the root zone al muaini et al 2019a consequently at the start of the productive stages irrigation was scheduled once daily for 5 min during colder months october february and twice daily during march september meteorological data temperature rainfall relative humidity and evapotranspiration were obtained from icba weather station dubai united arab emirates 2 4 trait measurements and data collection the following reproductive fruit characteristics were measured number of main fruit branches per plant weight of main fruit branch bunch plant with fruit weight of sub fruit branches number of fruits per sub branch and fruit yield per tree kg at rutab and maturity stages at the end of the khalal and the beginning of the rutab stage partially browned and softened at the tip and reduced moisture contents a selected number of bunches from each tree were harvested and total yield tree was computed at this stage the total weight of rutab fruits in each bunch was also recorded at maturity a selected set of main fruit bunches were harvested from each tree for estimation of the parameters indicated above total yield per tree kg was obtained from the weight of all fruit branches 2 5 statistical analysis means of three replicates and their standard deviation sd were determined the effects of the date palm variety season year and salinity level s1 s2 and s3 on physiological and yield attributes were analyzed using glm generalized liner model date palm variety year and salinity level were pooled as fixed factors while all the physiological traits and yield parameters were the dependent variables the test of significance between date palm variety and year under the same salinity treatment was conducted using pairwise comparisons in glm at p 0 05 which also used to determine the differences of same variety under different salinity levels the salinity level was set as the independent variable and the relative yield at rutab stage and at maturity stage as the dependent variable all data were analyzed using spss 20 0 for windows spss inc principal component analysis pca was performed on yield means recorded at each salinity level to cluster the tested entries from the date palm varieties note that variate stands for any response variable and individual stands for any variety in this analysis pca helps the selection of entries at 25 intensity of selection based on entries loadings on the first and the second components at each salinity level selection was done at each salinity level independently we selected entries having simultaneous high values for both growth and yield and intensity of selection was 25 the eighteen entries selected and ability of each entry was determined using its loadings on the two components of pca 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic data average temperature and rainfall values during the experiment are presented in fig 1a the highest monthly mean temperature was 44 6 c and the lowest 24 5 c january average annual humidity ranged from 30 to 76 climate could be characterized as typical hyper arid with relatively mild winters and hot dry summer receiving almost all their precipitation during their winter seasons potential monthly evapotranspiration and precipitation are presented in fig 1b for the icba experimental station during the period 2002 2014 the experimental site is described as arid with very low precipitation about 50 mm annually and summer months are characterized by high evapotranspiration up to 200 mm month in a concurrent extensive study conducted on a subgroup of three varieties of the same date palm trial with contrasting response to salinity var lulu khalas and shahla from 2014 to 2017 with tdr probes and salinity sensors installed at depths between 100 and 270 cm it was concluded that there was no trend in salt build up with the use of irrigation at 1 5 etc al muaini et al 2019a 2019b the result indicating effective leaching of salt from the root zone and sustainable rate of irrigation after seventeen years of irrigation with saline water sources up to 15 ds m 1 3 2 date palm fruit yield at rutab and maturity under different salinity conditions the two key economic indicators of date palm cultivation are the fruit yield at rutab and maturity stages therefore the ultimate measure of the impact of salinity and other biotic or abiotic stresses is measured by the degree of yield reduction over a period of at least eight production seasons for each variety the outcome of the data should provide a solid estimation of the impact of salinity on the economic yield of a wide range of important varieties from the arabian peninsula the following sections highlighted the key outcomes 3 2 1 fruit yield at rutab stage date palm fruit at rutab stage has high economic value and it is consumed extensively in the gulf region understanding the impact of salinity at this stage is therefore of great practical importance there was a significant variation in yield at the rutab stage for 16 date palm varieties data for two varieties were excluded due to inconsistency under the three irrigation salinity levels fig 2 the results of field evaluation of yield at rutab stage in 16 date palm varieties under a wide range of salinity stress showed highly negative impact on the yield of all varieties average yield reduction for all varieties at 10 ds m 1 reached 44 and at 15 ds m 1 reached 64 highly significant variations in rutab yield among all the varieties were observed fig 3 rutab yield at the low salinity ranged between 67 and 146 kg tree 1 while at the high salinity 15 ds m 1 it ranged from 18 to 63 kg tree 1 the highest fruit weight at rutab stage fwr were 146 144 and 136 kg that was recorded in lulu barhi and followed by shahla and the lowest 67 kg was obtained in khnizi date palm lulu barhi and khisab varieties produced higher fruit yield at medium salinity 10 ds m 1 while nabtat saif produced the lowest fruit yield 30 kg at 15 ds m 1 the patterns of decrease in fruit yield at rutab stage of stressed date palm were different and highest fruit yield were obtained in khisab sukkari and followed by barhi that produced 62 60 and 59 kg respectively while the lowest 18 kg was produced in khnizi fig 2 table 2 a drastic decrease in fruit weight with the increasing of salinity levels was observed in every variety and maximum reduction was observed at 15 ds m 1 salinity 3 3 fruit yield at maturity the saline water irrigation had a deleterious effect on the fruit yield mean of 8 years at maturity stage fig 3 and significantly differed among the date palm varieties the overall yield reduction at the high salinity 15 ds m 1 relative to the low salinity reached 67 at the lowest salinity level 5 ds m 1 the highest fruit yield was produced by shahla 58 22 kg tree 1 lulu 51 15 kg abu mann 49 kg and khisab 48 86 kg while the barhi rhothan and sukkari varieties produced an average 43 45 kg tree 1 fig 3 table 3 and nabtat sultan produced the lowest fruit yield 10 96 kg at the same salinity level indicating the salt sensitivity of this variety at medium salinity 10 ds m 1 lulu barhi shahla and khisab produced the highest fruit yield of 33 28 27 and 26 kg tree 1 while fruit yields were similar but lower for the jabri rhothan and sukkari varieties which produced 25 kg tree 1 on the average at higher salinity 15 ds m 1 the average fruit yield of lulu barhi and khisab were 22 19 and 16 kg tree 1 while fruit yield was lowest 3 81 kg in nabtat sultan at highest salinity fig 3 according to studies of zaid and arias jimenez 1999 there is strong correlation between fruit load fruit yield per tree and it varies from one to other variety shahin and alhajhoj 2015 showed that khalas sheshi and ruzeiz varieties provided higher fruit yield following irrigation with saline water 2 81 ds m 1 as compared to groundwater and agricultural drainage water 5 04 ds m 1 meanwhile these varieties exhibited higher fruit length and diameter and flesh weight with the less saline irrigation water for the nabtat sultan variety in our study there was a drastic reduction of 65 in average fruit yield over a period of 8 years at higher water salinity indicating the salt sensitivity of this variety al muaini et al 2019a 2019b demonstrated that use of saline water for irrigation reduces the water consumption and palm growth due to possible osmotic gradients between the soil and the plants meanwhile they found a 48 increase in fruit yield in lulu variety following exposure to 5 ds m 1 water salinity as compared to higher salinity 15 ds m 1 gribaa et al 2013 showed that deficit watering is advisable during fruit bunch development stage as the fruits grow slowly and may not require much water however inadequate watering after this phase can result in small fruits and lower yields al yahyai and al kharousi 2012 reported that the total dry matter content of khalas dates increased significantly under water stress conditions however there was no difference in total soluble solids tss or the sugar content of the fruit in our study the jabri shahla and sukkari varieties had similar fruit yields average of 15 kg tree 1 under irrigation with 15ds m 1 water the rhothan variety yielded relatively well at low and medium salinity but its fruit yield reduced 71 significantly at high salinity 15 ds m 1 3 4 regression fitting and correlations of fruit yield over time and irrigation water salinity ecw correlations among all growth and yield traits including fruit yield at rutab and maturity were performed the full results are given in table 4 summarizes the results for fruit yield at maturity and its correlations with other growth and yield parameters were performed the highest positive correlations obtained were for fruit yield at maturity as related to fruit yield at the rutab stage trunk height was the only trait that showed a weak positive correlation with fruit yield at maturity leaf number old leaf length and new length exhibited positive but very low correlations with fruit yield at maturity such a contrast in correlations requires careful consideration of the data and the conclusion to be made correlations within each individual environment are more informative and reflect the response for it correlations between fruit yield and fruit traits such as fruit length width volume etc all showed negative correlations with total fruit yield per tree table 4 fruit thinning on the bunch during growth stage was not practiced in order to observe the biological capacity in fruit yield under salinity without external effects under such situations a tradeoff between fruit yield components is expected pallas et al 2013 the most common tradeoff is between number of fruits and fruit weight whole bunch fruit and strand thinning are common practices in date palm to increase fruit size and quality mostafa and el akkad 2011 the limitations of the source sink capacity in most fruit trees require such practices depending on the fruit characteristics targeted limited sink capacity the bunch and fruits or limited sources of supply can lead to the negative relations observed the dynamics of source sink relations and its impact on date palm fruit yield under salinity condition is the subject of further investigation in this project finding the optimum target value for each of the fruit components that optimize yield under salinity conditions is an important target the components of yield and growth traits will be further used in developing comprehensive date palm management under low and high stress conditions 3 5 regression fitting of fruit yield averaged over time and salinity level the 7 8 years yield data of the different varieties with a contrasting response to salinity impact represent a unique opportunity to develop response curves to salinity and identify key thresholds for each variety evaluated date palm fruit yield response to salinity over 7 8 harvest seasons 2007 2015 for 8 selected date palm varieties from the arabian peninsula which represent the diversity in response to salinity as seen in the previous section are presented in fig 4 linear regression lines are fitted to each yield series for the three salinity levels as seen in the graph the eight varieties represent different production capacity at low stress conditions and mode of response to salinity increase similar response curves for the other varieties that are not presented were observed generally fruit yield at low salinity has a wider range and narrowed at the higher salinity level however tolerant varieties showed wider ranges even at the high salinity linear regressions were fit to the data to identify the constants of yield reduction yield at zero salinity and salinity value when yield diminishes polynomial fittings can give higher correlations but will lead to high estimates of the aforementioned values based on the response observed and the linear fit relative yield graphs were developed for each variety to determine the thresholds that can be obtain namely the salinity at 50 yield reduction and the salinity when yield approach zero examples of such relative yield response are given in fig 5 the key objectives of this research were to assess the long term salinity tolerance of a diverse set of date palm varieties to reach substantiated conclusions on the impact of salinity on date palm productivity and quality and to fill a gap in the knowledge related to the variation in threshold values amongst date palm varieties such knowledge will not only help in developing better strategies for date palm future and management approaches but also to provide the key knowledge about genetic variations and how it might be used in genetic enhancement programs through conventional and advanced biotechnological techniques as indicated earlier research dealing with salinity impact on date palm trees is limited particularly long term evaluation and monitoring most studies dealt with salinity impact at the seedling stage such as aljuburi 1992 1993 1996a 1996b and aljuburi and al masry 1995 1996a 1996b 2000 were focused on the effects of different salinity levels on seedlings growth of a limited number of date palm varieties similarly hassan and el azayem 1990 hassan and el samnoudi 1997 hussein et al 1995 1999 al khateeb and al khateeb 2001 and abdulwahid 2012 reported on work related to screening different date palm varieties for salinity tolerance and the effects of different salinity levels on growth and mineral composition of date palm varieties mattar et al 2021 reported impact of three level of irrigation water type on single date palm variety succary with a maximum salinity in irrigation water up to 3 94 ds m 1 and for the duration of a single season in reviews by alhammadi and kurup 2012 and by yaish and kumar 2015a 2015b in both cases the authors concluded that despite the prominent importance and long history of date palm work on salinity adaptation and mechanisms are very limited they concluded that this area of research is a black box that needs to be decoded 3 6 establishing salinity thresholds for different date palm varieties date palm fruit yield data over eight years were characterized based on the response of fruit yield of each variety to salinity over eight years and the relative yield regression fitting a summary of the absolute and relative fruit yield at different salinity levels salinity threshold for 50 yield reduction and yield reduction per unit increase in salinity is presented table 5 the actual and relative yields of a wide range of date palm genetic diversity at 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 along with projected yields at the lower salinity levels and the level when yield diminishes are identified such estimates are based on linear fittings of yield verses salinity although the initial phase of salinity response may not be linear maas and hoffman 1977 the salinity levels from 5 to 15 ds m 1 are expected to be within the linear phase of decline in yield estimated salinity at 50 yield reduction for all varieties ranged between 8 3 and 11 8 ds m 1 for the linear fit and 100 relative yields estimates the slope values of yield reduction percentage per unit of salinity increase 1 ds m 1 ranged from 4 5 to 6 1 the values of salinity at 50 yield reduction based on the three points measured certainly gave higher estimates that ranged from 10 45 to 13 8 ds m 1 such estimates are acceptable if date palm yield is not affected up to the 5 ds m 1 level of irrigation water salinity however previous indications suggested a linear decline ayers and westcot 1985 also the long term cumulative impact of salinity will invariably make the yield at 5 ds m 1 less than at levels close to freshwater salinity less than 1 ds m 1 the estimates of salinity level at which the fruit yield diminishes are also estimated based on linear regressions table 5 the values ranged from 16 6 ds m 1 in the sensitive variety um al hamam to over 22 ds m 1in the tolerant varieties like lulu and barhi the one estimate is given by ayers and wescott 1985 put such values as high as 32 ds m 1 certainly based on our comprehensive long term data set would be closer to the salinity impact on data palm survival and productivity in the uae farms where salinity of irrigation water reached level above 25 ds m 1 have been abandoned or their yield declined sharply dakheel 2005 based on the salinity thresholds identified in table 5 and the yield response to salinity observed earlier the response to salinity of the collection of 18 date palm varieties can be recognized into four distinct groups fig 6 summarizes the four groups and their salinity tolerance levels and thresholds the specific salinity response and thresholds for each group are presented in fig 7 the specific yield traits tolerance to salinity and threshold at 50 yield reduction are summarized in table 6 below clearly such groups demonstrate that date palm varieties vary widely in their response to salinity like any other conventional crop and no single generalization can be applied to all cases and salinity situations this can be considered a unique outcome that provides a comprehensive assessment of salinity impact on date palm that is largely do not exists the table shows that the varieties lulu and barhi are the most salt tolerant and stable varieties to further asses the feasibility of such grouping of varieties a principal component analysis pca was performed on the 18 varieties under the three salinity environments and overall years the results are presented in fig 7 3 7 principal component analysis pca the score and loading plots of principal component analysis pca to evaluate the effects of various levels of irrigation water salinity ecw treatments on fruit yield at rutab and at maturity characteristics of date palm varieties are given in fig 8 the pca biplot shows the distribution of the 18 date palm varieties in all corners of the scatter plot along the axes of factor 1 and factor 2 fig 8a b the fruit yield at rutab stage fyrut measured from the date palm varieties showed 86 5 of the observed variation and could be explained by first principal component pc1 moreover principal component pc2 depicted 9 47 of the total variation regarding this attribute fig 8a among the date palm varieties lulu was the best representative for fruit yield at maturity fymat this was revealed by its location at the extreme of the axis for factor 1 it was followed by the barhi that fall very close to lulu in the biplot graph in contrast maktoumi showed the highest representation lowest yield for the same trait on the axis for factor 2 the fymat measured from all 18 date palm varieties showed 88 of the observed variation could be explained by first principal component pc1 moreover the second principal component pc2 depicted 8 43 of the total variation among all the date palm varieties regarding this attribute fig 8a salinity applies a gradual selection pressure on the varieties more variance captured when salinity increased each principal component accounted for a proportion of the variation and was correlated to different degrees to the measured attributes pca analysis of the fymat of 18 date palm varieties against three salinity levels indicated distinct variation the group iii included the date palm varieties fig 8b that had highest fymat and posses uniformity in their fymat at all salinities indicating successful adaptation of these varieties under medium and high salinity all of the salinity treatments s1 s2 s3 were distributed successfully by first two principal components this distribution of treatments gave a clear indication that increasing level of salinity had significant effects on fruit yield of date fig 8a b the varieties in the group iii khisab sukkari and barhi included the date palm varieties that performed out of class regarding fyrut and possess uniformity in their fymat at all salinities indicating successful adaptation of these varieties at medium and high salinity these date palm varieties proved to be higher fruit yielders at both rutab and maturity stage and were more suitable for medium and high saline environment date palm variety khalas was the most susceptible variety and showed very poor response across at all salinity levels for both traits fyrut and fymat as compared to all other varieties the results of the pca confirm the grouping of varieties according to their tolerance concluded in the previous section 4 conclusions the nature and long life span in date palm make long term studies complicated and require time and resources such an approach for long term impact assessment was undertaken in the present studies the results obtained have established solid conclusions about the negative impacts of increasing salinity levels on growth water use and fruit yield yield reductions can exceed 67 at salinity levels around 15 ds m 1 ecw in certain varieties tolerant and sensitive varieties to salinity were identified four distinct groups in terms of their salinity tolerance potential and thresholds were identified salinity thresholds based on irrigation water salinity ecw50 and ecw0 were identified for the different varieties and most importantly it is now well documented that substantial variations exists among date palm varieties in their salinity tolerance the minimum estimates for 50 yield reduction ranged from 8 6 to 12 ds m 1 ecw and at the maximum ranged from 10 5 to 14 ds m 1 ecw the previously reported limits were shown to be higher than the findings of this work the long term salinity assessment certainly adds more accuracy to the conclusions drawn yield reduction percentages at different salinity levels were established and will be of great practical importance for date palm management meanwhile saline water decreases the growth and fruit yield in date palm displayed different morphological and physiological responses to each salt stress level being different among varieties initial results on the estimation of date palm actual water use and demands under the local environmental conditions demonstrated that the amount of irrigation practices applied more than double the actual needs in addition previous results from the same experiment with different agro physiological traits al muaini et al 2019b showed that under irrigation with high salinity water 15 ds m 1 ecw the actual water use by three selected varieties declined by 43 46 such findings have great implications for water management under saline conditions we believe that the outcome of this work is a benchmark in salinity impact on date palm the results of this study have demonstrated the negative impacts of increasing irrigation water salinity on date palm fruit yield and in guiding further work on genetic enhancement and the development of integrated management

9482,in recent years the impacts of climate change and socio economic development on the water energy food nexus have been a hot topic forecasting future food and energy production and water withdrawal trends under a range of climate and socio economic scenarios is a critical step for formulating agricultural industrial and environmental policy however published studies are imprecise due to the complexity of the changeable environment and nexus system here we conducted a systematic review and meta analysis based on 97 studies 1253 observations published before september 2021 to evaluate the effects of climate change factors on food yield and irrigation water as well as the influence of socioeconomic development on energy production and water withdrawal the study shows that the most serious impact of climate change on food yield occurred under the rcp8 5 scenario with an average decrease of 1 73 4 17 and 4 56 in the 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively similar to the prediction of food yield the irrigation water requirement of food production under the influence of climate change in the rcp8 5 scenario 12 22 18 01 is higher than that in rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 under the five socio economic future scenarios the average energy generation is projected to increase from 77 41 ej 2010 to 334 11 ej 2100 water withdrawals for electricity generation range from 347 km3 ssp1 to 1263 km3 ssp5 population and gdp were significantly and positively correlated with power generation and water withdrawal p 0 001 to some extent increases in co2 concentration and precipitation could compensate for the negative impact of rising temperatures on food yield climate change as well as economic and social growth will provide substantial challenges to the future water energy food nexus in particular the water resource risk at its core will create significant uncertainty in the future water energy food nexus to ensure the security and stability of the nexus we advocate for quick adoption of innovative technologies as well as a multi sectoral coordinated strategy for adaptation we believe that the findings of this paper will provide effective and reliable data support for future policy formulation graphical abstract ga1 keywords water energy food nexus meta analysis future prediction water withdrawals food yield 1 introduction global water energy and nexus wefn are highly interconnected wichelns 2017 nexus is driven and constrained by both climate change and socio economic development bhaduri et al 2015 biggs et al 2015 population growth urbanization and economic development have aggravated the shortage of global nexus resources it is expected that by 2050 the global demand for food and energy will increase by 60 and 80 respectively ferroukhi et al 2015 more critically stockholm environment institute sei 2015 pointed out that available water was the core element of the nexus climate change has greatly affected the availability of water resources which has become a critical constraint for food and energy production it is estimated that climate change and water shortages will leave 120 million people undernourished schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 in addition to water constraints the energy system is also driven by population economic growth and structural change therefore to ensure wefn security and mitigate the impact of uncertainties such as climate change and population expansion we need to further explore the following three questions 1 how will climate change affect food yields and irrigation water in the future 2 what is the response of energy production and water withdrawal to economic society 3 what are the key drivers the wefn faces in a changing environment studies have quantified the impact of future climate change on food yields and irrigation water and a variety of methods have been applied among them crop models were the most widely used araya et al 2015 chenu et al 2017 compared with other methods crop models can effectively simulate the physiological process of crop production at each development stage and evaluate the changing trend of crops under climate change scenarios but in fact discrepancies in scenarios study areas and methods contributed to the variability of the existing research findings the distinction is not only numerical but also in opposite directions a global assessment has found that food yields will increase in the future tian et al 2021 however deryng et al 2011 stated that future climate change might diminish yields some studies in north america anticipated that yields would fall in mexico kai 2018 oklahoma rasoulzadeh gharibdousti et al 2019 and canada brassard and singh 2007 but several other studies in mexico murray tortarolo et al 2018 the united states johnston et al 2015 and canada qian et al 2016 have forecast an increase in food yields food irrigation water use is expected to grow in china zhao et al 2014 and iran ahmadi et al 2021 as a result of climate change while another study in the united states predicted a decrease in water use johnston et al 2015 the same is true for energy production projections taking electricity generation as an example while scholars predict that electricity generation and water withdrawal will increase under various ssps scenarios the values of different studies fluctuate significantly for example graham et al 2018 anticipated 950 km3 of water withdrawal for electricity generation under the ssp5 scenario by 2100 while another study predicted 1942 km3 ando et al 2017 despite the fact that studies have predicted the effects of climate change and socio economic factors on the wefn or the nexus subsystem the disparities in prediction results create challenges for decision makers to pick a choice given the increasing concerns about the security of the wefn this study intends to standardize the impacts of uncertain elements climate change and socio economic factors on prediction results by constructing a meta regression model as well as explain the causes for the disparities in prediction results meta regression analysis mra is a valuable method for summarizing results and assessing consensus in the literature stanley and jarrell 2005 thompson and higgins 2002 it emerged from meta analysis and remains primarily a regression analysis method but its strength is in its capacity to systematically explain a complex set of underlying factors that may influence dependent variables loomis and white 1996 therefore mra can recount the results of multiple studies on the same research topic and identify the sources of heterogeneity baker et al 2009 gurevitch et al 2018 meanwhile the application of mra can avoid some of the deviations in the original literature while similar studies are being conducted to assess the impact of climate change on crop yield wilcox and makowski 2014 food demand van dijk et al 2021 crop water efficiency fan et al 2018 and energy demand menegaki 2014 there have been few studies on mra from the perspective of wefn especially the comprehensive influence of climate change and socioeconomic factors on wefn in the framework of mra this study attempts to synthesize peer reviewed findings food yields irrigation water energy production and water withdrawal were forecasted under changing environmental conditions the implications of climate change and socio economic development were also considered in this paper potential future wefn challenges and corresponding countermeasures are proposed to provide support for ensuring wefn collaboration security 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature identifying and screening to select relevant studies on future global food grain energy electricity production and water use projections we identify review questions search strategies and inclusion exclusion criteria following the systematic review guidelines developed by epi centre we asked what are the global trends in food and energy production as well as water use up to the year 2100 what are the driving elements influencing their evolution based on the above questions this study combined two search engines web of science and google scholar a systematic search strategy for identifying peer reviewed and gray literature was devised in searching the peer reviewed literature the keywords used in various combinations were wheat rice corn maize electricity electric power yield generation climate change economic development future population water demand irrigation water requirement water withdrawal etc details are given in appendix a1 no time period was set for this search so all relevant publications through september 27 2021 were selected 35 142 papers were retrieved from web of science and 86 201 papers from google scholar we extracted the top 500 relevant results from google scholar for screening after removing duplicates 35 485 related references were selected we used the following criteria for screening 1 exclude publications that are unrelated to wheat corn rice electricity and water requirements i e articles that focus on other crops or energy products 2 only quantitative evaluation was included 3 articles that restrict the quantitative study to specific historical years should be excluded 4 for electricity generation studies the focus of this review is on global studies and therefore country and regional studies will be excluded however for the studies of food production the statistics in this paper are not limited to worldwide data thus there is no need to exclude them 5 relevant data can be extracted or calculated from the publication and the data contains at least one variable such as temperature precipitation and population specific data screening principles can be found in appendix a2 if there are multiple climate scenarios time scales or crop varieties in the same study these results are extracted as independent samples in the literature screening the first reviewer will screen the entire text of the studies that have been identified as relevant after initially reviewing the titles and abstracts the studies under review will be assessed by a second reviewer if there is any doubt during the screening process if needed the research teams will discuss the details of the studies after screening 97 research studies 1253 observations met the selection criteria fig 1 with detailed information summarized in appendix a3 2 2 data extraction in this study the percentage change of grain yield and irrigation water requirement electricity generation and water withdrawal during power generation were selected as indicators to explore the trend of wefn in the future changing environment the following information is systematically extracted from the screening results basic information of the article author institution and published year study area forecast year and baseline model method forecast scenario such as sres rcp ssp or others percentage change in grain yield and irrigation water requirement global electricity generation and water withdrawal during power generation this database will be the foundation for descriptive analysis temperature precipitation and co2 concentration all have an impact on grain yield and irrigation requirements in a changing climate global electricity generation will be influenced by gdp and population increase in order to find explanatory variables that might influence the response of food and energy to changing environment this study extracted driving variables corresponding to each observation sample from the collected studies however at least one of these variables was missing in many studies so the full sample observation value restricted dataset corresponding to these variables was 598 table 1 we used the restricted dataset to establish a meta regression model note many studies contain more than one variable thus the sum of the literature is 97 rather than 110 2 3 meta regression analysis a mixed effects model is one in which the independent variables have both fixed and random effects fox and weisberg 2018 fixed effects are essentially predictor variables this is the effect of interest after considering random variability and random effects are described as noise in the data these are effects caused by uncontrolled variability within the sample in this study based on the lmertest kuznetsova et al 2017 and lme4 bates et al 2014 packages of r v 4 1 2 a linear mixed effect model was constructed to identify the driving factors of food energy production and water requirement trends the mathematical formulation of its model is y i Î² 0 Î² 1 x 1 i Î² p x pi Î± 0 z 1 i Î± p z pi Îµ where y i denotes the dependent variable Î² 0 is the intercept Î² 1 Î² p are the fixed effect coefficients and x 1 i x pi are the fixed effect regressors Î± 0 Î± p are the random effect and z 1 i z pi are the random effect regressors and Îµ is residual error random term we estimated separate linear mixed models for each of the four indicators for electricity generation and water withdrawal the fixed effects in the model are population and gdp while the random effects comprise prediction models and future ssp scenarios the fixed effects for food production and irrigation water requirements include average temperature change precipitation change and carbon dioxide concentration change random effects include prediction models study sites climate scenarios and crop categories 3 results 3 1 overview of studies we ultimately selected 97 publications for meta analysis the number of studies has increased dramatically during the last 20 years and related research has been expanded fig s1 especially after 2014 the issues of food security energy security and water shortage have attracted people s attention triggering academics to debate future food yields energy production and water use fig 2 most studies used models to simulate the future water energy food change trend and the dssat model is the most widely used n 37 fig s2 this model has been utilized in more than 100 countries around the world for over 20 years and has been applied to the simulation of the crop growth process for a long time patel et al 2017 as a sub module of the dssat model ceres series models have been updated and widely used to evaluate the influence of climate change on crop yield timsina and humphreys 2006 in addition to the dssat model it also includes the apsim aquacrop oryza aim cge model and precis models thereinto the aim cge model is mainly applied to forecast the future production of energy to further explore the change characteristics of the selected literature research topics this study obtained the time zone map of keywords based on citespace5 7 r2 software chen 2014 its development can be summed up in two stages the first period lasted from 2003 to 2014 related research was in the preliminary stage and there were few publications and keywords this stage primarily forecasts the trend of crop yield change in the context of climate change the concept of water energy and food nexus was formally proposed at the bonn conference in 2011 and fao expanded on it in terms of food security in 2014 raising concerns regarding related issues subsequently relevant studies entered the development stage from 2015 to 2021 in the second stage from 2015 to 2021 the number and content of keywords are more abundant than in the previous stage with the proposal of the concept of wefn scholars no longer focus only on the development trend of food yields but gradually launch research directions such as water demand and energy demand meanwhile as future scenarios the terms rcp scenario and common socio economic routes were frequently employed comprehensive analysis shows that its research scope and methods have been enriched and the wefn has become a research hotspot however as this study only conducts keyword analysis on the 97 studies obtained in the final screening the results are more targeted at the relevant studies that meet the screening conditions of this study the collected data related to energy in this study is global scale so the study area is not analyzed however food yield forecasts are often affected by temperature and precipitation the assessment scales are smaller in this study the number of food yield datasets in different regions of the final selected literature was counted fig 3 shows that the datasets are mainly concentrated in asian countries especially china 234 observations 31 79 and india 66 observations 8 96 the number of datasets was much higher than those of other regions one of the main reasons is that as china and india are the most populous countries in the world changes in food production will have a significant impact on local food security secondly from the perspective of data collection the data of chinese and indian literature are more comprehensive and easier to obtain aside from asia africa s unique geographical location makes its food production vulnerable to drought and extreme weather furthermore as one of the most food insecure states in the world africa has attracted the interest of academics the number of datasets in this region is second only to that of asia accounting for 13 17 of the total the united states as the world s largest food producer produces 40 of the world s corn karlen et al 2012 scholars are concerned about the future food production capacity of the united states we finally extracted 44 observations from the united states datasets it can be found that hot spots are areas with prominent food security or significant contribution to food production 3 2 projections of global food yield and irrigation water use considering all rcps scenarios future food yield declines by 1 82 with confidence intervals ranging from 0 81 to 2 83 the magnitude of the yield change generally increases with time 2 28 and 2 62 of average yield change in the 2050 s and 2080 s compared with 0 27 for the 2020s table 2 for the second half of the century more systematic and aggressive adaptation to climate change impacts may be required to avoid food security risks caused by significant declines in average food yields note n is the number of observations 95 ci stands for 95 confidence intervals given that different crops respond depending on various climate scenarios we extracted yield change trends of different crops wheat maize and rice under various climate change scenarios over multiple periods 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s fig 4 the declining trend of maize 3 89 3 25 was greater than that of wheat 0 93 4 41 and rice 1 05 4 81 this is mainly due to the higher water demand of maize and its tendency to grow without irrigation making it more sensitive to climate patterns heavy irrigation of wheat in countries such as china and india explains the milder effects of weather patterns unlike wheat rice yields are less affected by climate change than maize yields because rice is typically grown in water rich areas so precipitation is less limiting to rice production than maize anderson et al 2019 also discovered that maize is the crop most vulnerable to failure due to climate change 18 of the annual change in maize yield is the result of climate variation while the wheat yield reduction caused by climate variation only accounts for 6 of the global total yield change this conclusion also confirms our findings variability in yield changes under different climate scenarios due to variable levels of projected climate change according to ur rahman et al 2018 the rcp8 5 scenario has more effect on climate than other rcps our research also found that the rcp8 5 scenario had the most serious impact on food yield with an average decrease of 1 73 4 17 and 4 56 for the 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively in rcp 4 5 climate change would increase food yield by 1 23 0 23 and 0 07 in the 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively this result is due to the greater degree of warming under the rcp8 5 with higher temperatures negatively impacting food production baek et al 2013 showed that compared to 1986 2005 the temperature increased by 4 6 in the rcp 8 5 scenario at the end of the 21st century 2081 2100 while the temperature only increased by 1 4 and 2 6 in rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively especially under the rcp 2 6 scenario global temperature changes tend to be flat at the end of the 21st century the disparity in results between the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios emphasizes the importance of developing feasible ghg emission policies globally agriculture is a major user of water according to statistics water withdrawal for food has increased 7 3 times in the past century fao 2014 the future increase in irrigation water requirements for food production combined with the effects of climate change will exacerbate global water scarcity fig 5 depicts the evolution of crop irrigation water requirements with time ranging from the 2020 s to the 2080 s and different rcps it can be found that the irrigation water requirements will become prominent over time the effect of climate change on irrigation water requirements for food production under the rcp8 5 scenario 12 22 18 01 is higher than that under the rcp4 5 9 43 17 02 and rcp2 6 scenarios 6 65 15 54 this is also consistent with the forecasts for food production 3 3 projections of global energy generation and water withdrawal ssps describe five plausible future worlds that are defined by narrative storylines and quantitative information and can be characterized by two indices socio economic challenges for adaptation and mitigation riahi et al 2017 for example ssp1 is characterized by low levels of socioeconomic challenges in both mitigation and adaptation implying a reasonably optimistic perspective of future climate change conditions smaller populations faster economic growth more advanced energy technologies and a variety of other variables all support this viewpoint ssp3 on the other hand is marked by a high level of mitigation and adaptation challenges therefore ssp1 has the lowest population with an estimated 7 billion people by 2100 and ssp3 has the largest population with 12 6 billion people in ssp4 there is strong income inequality and high adaptation challenges ssp5 has the fastest economic growth with global gdp expected to reach 1014 trillion us 2005 in 2100 whereas ssp2 is in the middle of the other four scenarios based on the meta analysis method this study integrated and compared the predicted ranges of energy production and water withdrawal by scholars and mapped them to ssps for further analysis the results show that if all ssps are considered average electricity generation is expected to increase to 334 11 ej by 2100 furthermore all ssps project an increase in electricity generation in comparison with the 2010 levels but the magnitudes of these increases vary fig 6 under the fossil fueled rapid growth scenario ssp5 electricity generation will peak at 482 67 ej in 2100 a 5 24 fold increase over the base year following that is the future world characterized by inequality ssp4 and business as usual development ssp2 with electricity generation reaching 320 44 ej and 318 51 ej in 2100 respectively however under the regional rivalry ssp3 and sustainability scenarios ssp1 the increase of electricity generation is low especially under the ssp1 scenario the increase tends to moderate after 2075 water withdrawal of electricity generation in 2100 ranged from 347 km3 ssp1 to 1263 km3 ssp5 in the ssp1 scenario advancements in water withdrawal technology mitigate the increasing trend of water withdrawal for electricity generation with water withdrawal for electricity generation declining from 2010 to 2100 furthermore by comparing generation withdrawals under two scenarios with no and maximum water use efficiency improvements bijl et al 2016 found that improving water use efficiency can reduce water withdrawal by 40 in addition a study by graham et al 2018 showed that in the same scenario technological advancements would significantly reduce water withdrawal however for the ssp5 scenario although the improvement of wue restrains the increase in water withdrawal it remains the largest due to the rapid growth of gdp and power generation the power generation of ssp4 and ssp2 scenarios is similar nevertheless due to the high reliance of ssp4 power generation on renewable energy the water withdrawal of ssp4 627 km3 is expected to be lower than ssp2 763 km3 ssp3 is considered to be a world of slow technological progress with water withdrawal reaching 724 km3 by 2100 overall the results of electricity generation and water withdrawal results are consistent with the ssps narrative 3 4 regression analysis in addition to the water efficiency discussed in the previous section the rate of economic and social development has a significant impact on electricity generation and water withdrawal based on the mixed effect model this study constructed regression models of power generation and water withdrawal with economic and social development factors population gdp future scenarios method models etc tables 3 and 4 power generation and water withdrawal are positively correlated with population and gdp growth p 0 001 electricity generation and water withdrawal will increase by 0 02 ej and 0 11 km3 respectively for every million population increase when gdp increases by 1 trillion us 2005 electricity generation and water withdrawal will increase by 0 41 ej and 1 21 km3 respectively it has been discovered that both have a clear driving effect previous studies have used various methodological models to set up a variety of potential future scenarios to predict global electricity generation and water withdrawal our simulation results show that there are significant differences in generation capacity and water withdrawal between different ssps scenarios and models the differences caused by ssps scenarios are mainly affected by the speed of future social development and relevant policies for example in the ssp1 scenario the focus of global economic growth shifts to human well being consumption is oriented towards low energy intensity the increase in global electricity generation is effectively alleviated and water withdrawal decreases in contrast to the ssp3 scenario consumption at this stage tends to be resource intensive and water efficiency improvement is a low priority this successfully explains why the ssp3 and ssp1 scenarios have similar electricity generation in 2100 but double the amount of water withdrawal energy forecasting models such as gcam and aim cge are widely used the characteristics of the model drive the diversity in results to be specific gcam is distinguished by its comprehensiveness especially the detailed descriptions of the agricultural and land use sectors whereas alm cge is characterized by its full consideration of the interaction among production factors based on the mixed effects model with limited data sets we found that the negative effects of warming on grain yield could be compensated for by increasing co2 concentration and precipitation precipitation is the main environmental factor affecting crop production for every 1 increase in precipitation grain yield will increase by 0 12 certainly heavy rainfall can cause disasters such as floods and landslides which may hamper food yields temperature is negatively correlated with grain yield under a high temperature environment the growth period of crops is shorter and the quality and yield of crops are decreased for every 1 increase in average temperature grain yield will decrease by 1 60 carbon dioxide has a positive impact on crop yields carbon dioxide can increase crop yield by enhancing photosynthesis and decreasing stomatal conductance deryng et al 2016 although carbon dioxide will increase crop yield to some extent in this study it is simulated that every 1 ppm increase in co2 concentration will increase grain yield by 0 01 it should also be mentioned that when the carbon dioxide concentration exceeds a certain critical value it no longer benefits crop growth and if the temperature keeps climbing food yield will decrease challinor et al 2014 in addition to the above mentioned climate parameters influencing food yield various research models study areas climate scenarios and crop types all affect the degree of yield change table 5 the variance in random effects research models study areas and climate scenarios were 560 84 180 12 and 12 27 respectively with statistical significance p 0 001 crop models and study areas are the main sources of uncertainty about the impact of climate change on crop yield the selection of crop models by scholars is diverse dssat aquacrop and other complex models are widely used different model principles or parameter settings in crop models will lead to inconsistent results for the study areas the study shows that climate change increasing temperatures or decreasing precipitation will have a greater negative influence on crop yields in arid or semi arid regions than in other regions babel and turyatunga 2015 poor countries that are less resilient to climate change also face larger food security challenges under climate change crop irrigation water will increase by 13 10 compared to the baseline scenario this indicates that climate change has a significant impact on global irrigation water requirements crop irrigation water is proportional to temperature increase higher temperatures will increase irrigation water by increasing crop photorespiration and reducing water use efficiency for every 1 increase in temperature irrigation water will increase by 9 77 furthermore the decrease in precipitation will directly lead to an increase in irrigation water winter et al 2017 it is predicted that for every 1 decrease in precipitation in the future irrigation water use will increase by 0 28 the variability of water for food production between different models and rcp scenarios is large but the variability between study areas is small table 6 4 discussion 4 1 challenges of water food and energy security climate change economic and social pressures on wefn are compounding food production is often constrained by climate change natural disasters soil and water according to the ipcc 2007 the impact of climate change on food production will worsen in the coming decades our study also found that food yield is declining as a result of climate change at the demand level population increase urbanization changes in dietary structure and consumption levels can all contribute to food insecurity ortiz bobea et al 2021 even cautioned that food supply would face unprecedented strain as the world s population reaches 10 billion by 2050 and food demand approaches the limitations of modern agricultural development according to tian et al 2021 the food gap will increase to 1 26 billion tons in 2050 making it challenging to achieve the balance between global food supply and demand therefore strategies to reduce food demand and adapt to climate change are urgently needed we also need to recognize that food is both water and energy intensive agricultural irrigation accounts for approximately 70 of global human freshwater consumption hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 farm machinery and irrigation consume energy in the food production process statistics show that irrigation accounts for 23 48 of the energy consumption from agriculture singh et al 2002 shortages of energy and water in production will also limit food production there is also a supply demand imbalance in the energy system according to our findings electricity generation will increase however due to population and economic expansion energy demand will increase by 50 in 2030 marien 2013 energy production will be unable to keep pace with population growth leaving about 3 billion people without access to safe and reliable energy furthermore water scarcity will jeopardize global energy security especially in electricity production water withdrawal for electricity generation accounts for 88 of that from the energy industry oecd 2016 aside from the water withdrawal of thermal power generation uranium mining and processing steam cooling and other links in nuclear power production all consume a significant quantity of water with the rapid increase in food and energy demand competition for limited water resources will intensify and the unpredictability of water supply will become the primary risk source of energy production it is necessary to adjust the energy structure and reduce the water demand water is a key constraint to food and energy production population increase urbanization and economic development will alter the original demand pattern for water supplies the underlying difficulty is not merely fluctuations in water demand climate change s influence on water resources will be superimposed on population growth urbanization and globalization falkenmark 2013 extreme weather and unpredictable precipitation intensity will exacerbate the insecurity and vulnerability of water resources taken together the relevance and complexity of the nexus particularly the water resource risk at its core provide significant uncertainty to the future security of wefn scholars and policymakers should think about how to balance the nexus relationship 4 2 a way forward for water energy food nexus adaptation strategies and technologies climate change economic and social development pose greater challenges to wefn developing adaptation strategies and new technological breakthroughs are the way forward for wefn fig 7 the way forward for the wefn is to develop adaptation strategies and new technologies first the application of efficient technologies can help to reduce the negative impacts of climate change and economic society on water energy and food drought resistant crops no till crops water saving irrigation technologies and the development of sustainable energy can cut energy and water usage while increasing yields furthermore altering the planting period and selecting the correct crop types can help to mitigate the effects of climate change early seeding for example resulted in stronger root development and less stress from heat and drought in some locations kirkegaard et al 2014 zeleke 2021 in addition to agriculture technical advancements are critical for the generation of power and the usage of water especially under the condition of water scarcity promoting water saving and recycling technology as well as striving for zero wastewater discharge will reduce water consumption in the energy production process alleviate the competition degree between food and energy for water and reduce the environmental impact certainly we must not only enhance water efficiency but also accelerate the replacement of fossil fuels at the source to achieve structural transformation of the electricity industry the principles of safety cleanliness and efficiency must be followed however fossil fuels especially coal will continue to dominate electricity production in the short term this will eventually result in tremendous carbon dioxide emissions carbon capture and storage ccs could alleviate the problem the international energy agency said ccs contributes 14 of the global decrease in co2 emissions bui et al 2018 therefore green coal power technologies based on ccs and integrated gasification combined cycle igcc will play a key role in the gradual transition of the energy mix to renewables not only new technologies but also adaptation strategies are required to deal with the changing environment and assure wefn security in particular there is a dynamic relationship between water energy and food the behavior of one system frequently has an effect on one or both other systems for example biomass fuels while relieving energy pressures will compete with food for available farmland and irrigation water which may threaten food security large scale bioenergy production must be built on the synergy of food and energy security policy scott et al 2015 therefore we need to start by recognizing the interdependence of water energy and food and then weigh and coordinate appropriate responses to a changing environment secondly inter sector and stakeholder synergies should be brought into play rasul and sharma 2016 in order to attain single sector agricultural sector energy sector or water sector goals current policymaking frequently disregards inter departmental cooperation the resource risks and challenges posed by environmental economic and social development on the other hand demonstrate that management of a single sector leads to the separation of regulatory measures furthermore the concept of resource management centered on a single sector makes it impossible to achieve sustainable goals as a result the nexus based collaborative management theory is critical for improving the present single system management mode and adequately protecting and managing the security of multi resource nexus systems to maximize mutual advantages policymakers should strengthen synergies across the water energy and food sectors as well as establish comprehensive multi sectoral adaptation strategies 4 3 uncertainty and consistency in projections due to uncertainties in climate scenarios social development scenarios scenario setting model selection parameter setting and other aspects the reliability of studies on the impact of climate change and socio economic development on wefn will be greatly affected by specific objects and regions the meta analysis of this study quantified the trends of food and energy production as well as water withdrawal in a changing environment identified the main driving forces and proposed adaptation strategies for future climate change and socio economic development the meta analysis method was applied to comprehensively analyze existing research results in this study which can significantly increase the universality and reliability of research results however we accept that there is still some uncertainty in forecasts this is due to two factors one is due to data collection restrictions for example not all regions of the world have access to the food production data predicted by academics furthermore our data only included peer reviewed articles before the retrieval period and additional studies produced by experts may be published in the future even though a new study may not significantly alter the conclusions it can further complement the existing statistics gray literature such as reports or books are also useful to support our findings but were not included due to data collecting limitations therefore we suggest that subsequent studies can continue to enrich and complement our foundation relevant publications or peer reviewed articles published in languages other than english can also be included in subsequent studies another source of uncertainty is the disparity between models and data sources that predict production and water withdrawal food and energy production projections as well as water withdrawal forecasts all depend on future climate change economic and population estimates for the prediction of food yield under climate change many studies have used multiple gcm climate models based on coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 other studies have opted for individual climate models different choices may lead to different results furthermore multiple climate scenarios such as ipcc sres and rcps are widely used although multiple climate change scenarios can be mapped to rcp scenarios changes in input data may still cause findings to deviate similarly energy predictions for ssps scenarios are inevitably influenced by data sources for example many studies use projections from the world bank or the oecd while some scholars prefer to use their own calculated demographic projections the results of all of these data will be biased in different ways despite these limitations as challinor et al 2007 asserted it is extremely challenging to directly compare the impacts of climate change social economic and other factors on agricultural and other industries although the data are limited the results are valid for the geographic area covered furthermore since high quality quantitative studies are primarily published in peer reviewed journals the inclusion of reports or other language studies may not dramatically alter the conclusions of this study therefore the conclusion based on the existing research results has certain credibility however more accurate and comprehensive research on wefn projections in changing environments is still needed in the future 5 conclusions based on meta regression approaches this study quantifies the changes in food energy production and water withdrawal under climate change and socio economic development scenarios as well as the implications of climate socio economic and other uncertainties the findings are indicative and illustrative for the future this can indicate the direction and magnitude of the impact of climate change and economic development on the wefn and improve the accuracy of decision makers in formulating adaptation strategies for instance the findings reveal that future food production will decline while global food demand will continue to rise consistently exacerbating the supply demand conflict considering maize is more strongly affected by climate than other crops optimizing planting structure may be able to alleviate the existing issue of conflicting food supply and demand to some extent similarly energy production and generation show a stronger dependence on energy mix water use efficiency and the degree of economic and social development this also serves as a reference point for policymakers using meta analysis this study primarily explores the effects of climate and economic factors on the wefn at the production level and provides an effective basis for policy formation a consumer based meta analysis on the other hand will be required in the future examining how population growth and economic development influence food and energy demand for instance government authorities may be more interested in comparing performance on the production and consumption sides we also consider that tackling complex wefn concerns with multidisciplinary methodologies like meta analysis is critical in solving climate change supply demand conflicts and water scarcity credit authorship contribution

9482,in recent years the impacts of climate change and socio economic development on the water energy food nexus have been a hot topic forecasting future food and energy production and water withdrawal trends under a range of climate and socio economic scenarios is a critical step for formulating agricultural industrial and environmental policy however published studies are imprecise due to the complexity of the changeable environment and nexus system here we conducted a systematic review and meta analysis based on 97 studies 1253 observations published before september 2021 to evaluate the effects of climate change factors on food yield and irrigation water as well as the influence of socioeconomic development on energy production and water withdrawal the study shows that the most serious impact of climate change on food yield occurred under the rcp8 5 scenario with an average decrease of 1 73 4 17 and 4 56 in the 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively similar to the prediction of food yield the irrigation water requirement of food production under the influence of climate change in the rcp8 5 scenario 12 22 18 01 is higher than that in rcp4 5 and rcp2 6 under the five socio economic future scenarios the average energy generation is projected to increase from 77 41 ej 2010 to 334 11 ej 2100 water withdrawals for electricity generation range from 347 km3 ssp1 to 1263 km3 ssp5 population and gdp were significantly and positively correlated with power generation and water withdrawal p 0 001 to some extent increases in co2 concentration and precipitation could compensate for the negative impact of rising temperatures on food yield climate change as well as economic and social growth will provide substantial challenges to the future water energy food nexus in particular the water resource risk at its core will create significant uncertainty in the future water energy food nexus to ensure the security and stability of the nexus we advocate for quick adoption of innovative technologies as well as a multi sectoral coordinated strategy for adaptation we believe that the findings of this paper will provide effective and reliable data support for future policy formulation graphical abstract ga1 keywords water energy food nexus meta analysis future prediction water withdrawals food yield 1 introduction global water energy and nexus wefn are highly interconnected wichelns 2017 nexus is driven and constrained by both climate change and socio economic development bhaduri et al 2015 biggs et al 2015 population growth urbanization and economic development have aggravated the shortage of global nexus resources it is expected that by 2050 the global demand for food and energy will increase by 60 and 80 respectively ferroukhi et al 2015 more critically stockholm environment institute sei 2015 pointed out that available water was the core element of the nexus climate change has greatly affected the availability of water resources which has become a critical constraint for food and energy production it is estimated that climate change and water shortages will leave 120 million people undernourished schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 in addition to water constraints the energy system is also driven by population economic growth and structural change therefore to ensure wefn security and mitigate the impact of uncertainties such as climate change and population expansion we need to further explore the following three questions 1 how will climate change affect food yields and irrigation water in the future 2 what is the response of energy production and water withdrawal to economic society 3 what are the key drivers the wefn faces in a changing environment studies have quantified the impact of future climate change on food yields and irrigation water and a variety of methods have been applied among them crop models were the most widely used araya et al 2015 chenu et al 2017 compared with other methods crop models can effectively simulate the physiological process of crop production at each development stage and evaluate the changing trend of crops under climate change scenarios but in fact discrepancies in scenarios study areas and methods contributed to the variability of the existing research findings the distinction is not only numerical but also in opposite directions a global assessment has found that food yields will increase in the future tian et al 2021 however deryng et al 2011 stated that future climate change might diminish yields some studies in north america anticipated that yields would fall in mexico kai 2018 oklahoma rasoulzadeh gharibdousti et al 2019 and canada brassard and singh 2007 but several other studies in mexico murray tortarolo et al 2018 the united states johnston et al 2015 and canada qian et al 2016 have forecast an increase in food yields food irrigation water use is expected to grow in china zhao et al 2014 and iran ahmadi et al 2021 as a result of climate change while another study in the united states predicted a decrease in water use johnston et al 2015 the same is true for energy production projections taking electricity generation as an example while scholars predict that electricity generation and water withdrawal will increase under various ssps scenarios the values of different studies fluctuate significantly for example graham et al 2018 anticipated 950 km3 of water withdrawal for electricity generation under the ssp5 scenario by 2100 while another study predicted 1942 km3 ando et al 2017 despite the fact that studies have predicted the effects of climate change and socio economic factors on the wefn or the nexus subsystem the disparities in prediction results create challenges for decision makers to pick a choice given the increasing concerns about the security of the wefn this study intends to standardize the impacts of uncertain elements climate change and socio economic factors on prediction results by constructing a meta regression model as well as explain the causes for the disparities in prediction results meta regression analysis mra is a valuable method for summarizing results and assessing consensus in the literature stanley and jarrell 2005 thompson and higgins 2002 it emerged from meta analysis and remains primarily a regression analysis method but its strength is in its capacity to systematically explain a complex set of underlying factors that may influence dependent variables loomis and white 1996 therefore mra can recount the results of multiple studies on the same research topic and identify the sources of heterogeneity baker et al 2009 gurevitch et al 2018 meanwhile the application of mra can avoid some of the deviations in the original literature while similar studies are being conducted to assess the impact of climate change on crop yield wilcox and makowski 2014 food demand van dijk et al 2021 crop water efficiency fan et al 2018 and energy demand menegaki 2014 there have been few studies on mra from the perspective of wefn especially the comprehensive influence of climate change and socioeconomic factors on wefn in the framework of mra this study attempts to synthesize peer reviewed findings food yields irrigation water energy production and water withdrawal were forecasted under changing environmental conditions the implications of climate change and socio economic development were also considered in this paper potential future wefn challenges and corresponding countermeasures are proposed to provide support for ensuring wefn collaboration security 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature identifying and screening to select relevant studies on future global food grain energy electricity production and water use projections we identify review questions search strategies and inclusion exclusion criteria following the systematic review guidelines developed by epi centre we asked what are the global trends in food and energy production as well as water use up to the year 2100 what are the driving elements influencing their evolution based on the above questions this study combined two search engines web of science and google scholar a systematic search strategy for identifying peer reviewed and gray literature was devised in searching the peer reviewed literature the keywords used in various combinations were wheat rice corn maize electricity electric power yield generation climate change economic development future population water demand irrigation water requirement water withdrawal etc details are given in appendix a1 no time period was set for this search so all relevant publications through september 27 2021 were selected 35 142 papers were retrieved from web of science and 86 201 papers from google scholar we extracted the top 500 relevant results from google scholar for screening after removing duplicates 35 485 related references were selected we used the following criteria for screening 1 exclude publications that are unrelated to wheat corn rice electricity and water requirements i e articles that focus on other crops or energy products 2 only quantitative evaluation was included 3 articles that restrict the quantitative study to specific historical years should be excluded 4 for electricity generation studies the focus of this review is on global studies and therefore country and regional studies will be excluded however for the studies of food production the statistics in this paper are not limited to worldwide data thus there is no need to exclude them 5 relevant data can be extracted or calculated from the publication and the data contains at least one variable such as temperature precipitation and population specific data screening principles can be found in appendix a2 if there are multiple climate scenarios time scales or crop varieties in the same study these results are extracted as independent samples in the literature screening the first reviewer will screen the entire text of the studies that have been identified as relevant after initially reviewing the titles and abstracts the studies under review will be assessed by a second reviewer if there is any doubt during the screening process if needed the research teams will discuss the details of the studies after screening 97 research studies 1253 observations met the selection criteria fig 1 with detailed information summarized in appendix a3 2 2 data extraction in this study the percentage change of grain yield and irrigation water requirement electricity generation and water withdrawal during power generation were selected as indicators to explore the trend of wefn in the future changing environment the following information is systematically extracted from the screening results basic information of the article author institution and published year study area forecast year and baseline model method forecast scenario such as sres rcp ssp or others percentage change in grain yield and irrigation water requirement global electricity generation and water withdrawal during power generation this database will be the foundation for descriptive analysis temperature precipitation and co2 concentration all have an impact on grain yield and irrigation requirements in a changing climate global electricity generation will be influenced by gdp and population increase in order to find explanatory variables that might influence the response of food and energy to changing environment this study extracted driving variables corresponding to each observation sample from the collected studies however at least one of these variables was missing in many studies so the full sample observation value restricted dataset corresponding to these variables was 598 table 1 we used the restricted dataset to establish a meta regression model note many studies contain more than one variable thus the sum of the literature is 97 rather than 110 2 3 meta regression analysis a mixed effects model is one in which the independent variables have both fixed and random effects fox and weisberg 2018 fixed effects are essentially predictor variables this is the effect of interest after considering random variability and random effects are described as noise in the data these are effects caused by uncontrolled variability within the sample in this study based on the lmertest kuznetsova et al 2017 and lme4 bates et al 2014 packages of r v 4 1 2 a linear mixed effect model was constructed to identify the driving factors of food energy production and water requirement trends the mathematical formulation of its model is y i Î² 0 Î² 1 x 1 i Î² p x pi Î± 0 z 1 i Î± p z pi Îµ where y i denotes the dependent variable Î² 0 is the intercept Î² 1 Î² p are the fixed effect coefficients and x 1 i x pi are the fixed effect regressors Î± 0 Î± p are the random effect and z 1 i z pi are the random effect regressors and Îµ is residual error random term we estimated separate linear mixed models for each of the four indicators for electricity generation and water withdrawal the fixed effects in the model are population and gdp while the random effects comprise prediction models and future ssp scenarios the fixed effects for food production and irrigation water requirements include average temperature change precipitation change and carbon dioxide concentration change random effects include prediction models study sites climate scenarios and crop categories 3 results 3 1 overview of studies we ultimately selected 97 publications for meta analysis the number of studies has increased dramatically during the last 20 years and related research has been expanded fig s1 especially after 2014 the issues of food security energy security and water shortage have attracted people s attention triggering academics to debate future food yields energy production and water use fig 2 most studies used models to simulate the future water energy food change trend and the dssat model is the most widely used n 37 fig s2 this model has been utilized in more than 100 countries around the world for over 20 years and has been applied to the simulation of the crop growth process for a long time patel et al 2017 as a sub module of the dssat model ceres series models have been updated and widely used to evaluate the influence of climate change on crop yield timsina and humphreys 2006 in addition to the dssat model it also includes the apsim aquacrop oryza aim cge model and precis models thereinto the aim cge model is mainly applied to forecast the future production of energy to further explore the change characteristics of the selected literature research topics this study obtained the time zone map of keywords based on citespace5 7 r2 software chen 2014 its development can be summed up in two stages the first period lasted from 2003 to 2014 related research was in the preliminary stage and there were few publications and keywords this stage primarily forecasts the trend of crop yield change in the context of climate change the concept of water energy and food nexus was formally proposed at the bonn conference in 2011 and fao expanded on it in terms of food security in 2014 raising concerns regarding related issues subsequently relevant studies entered the development stage from 2015 to 2021 in the second stage from 2015 to 2021 the number and content of keywords are more abundant than in the previous stage with the proposal of the concept of wefn scholars no longer focus only on the development trend of food yields but gradually launch research directions such as water demand and energy demand meanwhile as future scenarios the terms rcp scenario and common socio economic routes were frequently employed comprehensive analysis shows that its research scope and methods have been enriched and the wefn has become a research hotspot however as this study only conducts keyword analysis on the 97 studies obtained in the final screening the results are more targeted at the relevant studies that meet the screening conditions of this study the collected data related to energy in this study is global scale so the study area is not analyzed however food yield forecasts are often affected by temperature and precipitation the assessment scales are smaller in this study the number of food yield datasets in different regions of the final selected literature was counted fig 3 shows that the datasets are mainly concentrated in asian countries especially china 234 observations 31 79 and india 66 observations 8 96 the number of datasets was much higher than those of other regions one of the main reasons is that as china and india are the most populous countries in the world changes in food production will have a significant impact on local food security secondly from the perspective of data collection the data of chinese and indian literature are more comprehensive and easier to obtain aside from asia africa s unique geographical location makes its food production vulnerable to drought and extreme weather furthermore as one of the most food insecure states in the world africa has attracted the interest of academics the number of datasets in this region is second only to that of asia accounting for 13 17 of the total the united states as the world s largest food producer produces 40 of the world s corn karlen et al 2012 scholars are concerned about the future food production capacity of the united states we finally extracted 44 observations from the united states datasets it can be found that hot spots are areas with prominent food security or significant contribution to food production 3 2 projections of global food yield and irrigation water use considering all rcps scenarios future food yield declines by 1 82 with confidence intervals ranging from 0 81 to 2 83 the magnitude of the yield change generally increases with time 2 28 and 2 62 of average yield change in the 2050 s and 2080 s compared with 0 27 for the 2020s table 2 for the second half of the century more systematic and aggressive adaptation to climate change impacts may be required to avoid food security risks caused by significant declines in average food yields note n is the number of observations 95 ci stands for 95 confidence intervals given that different crops respond depending on various climate scenarios we extracted yield change trends of different crops wheat maize and rice under various climate change scenarios over multiple periods 2020 s 2050 s and 2080 s fig 4 the declining trend of maize 3 89 3 25 was greater than that of wheat 0 93 4 41 and rice 1 05 4 81 this is mainly due to the higher water demand of maize and its tendency to grow without irrigation making it more sensitive to climate patterns heavy irrigation of wheat in countries such as china and india explains the milder effects of weather patterns unlike wheat rice yields are less affected by climate change than maize yields because rice is typically grown in water rich areas so precipitation is less limiting to rice production than maize anderson et al 2019 also discovered that maize is the crop most vulnerable to failure due to climate change 18 of the annual change in maize yield is the result of climate variation while the wheat yield reduction caused by climate variation only accounts for 6 of the global total yield change this conclusion also confirms our findings variability in yield changes under different climate scenarios due to variable levels of projected climate change according to ur rahman et al 2018 the rcp8 5 scenario has more effect on climate than other rcps our research also found that the rcp8 5 scenario had the most serious impact on food yield with an average decrease of 1 73 4 17 and 4 56 for the 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively in rcp 4 5 climate change would increase food yield by 1 23 0 23 and 0 07 in the 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively this result is due to the greater degree of warming under the rcp8 5 with higher temperatures negatively impacting food production baek et al 2013 showed that compared to 1986 2005 the temperature increased by 4 6 in the rcp 8 5 scenario at the end of the 21st century 2081 2100 while the temperature only increased by 1 4 and 2 6 in rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios respectively especially under the rcp 2 6 scenario global temperature changes tend to be flat at the end of the 21st century the disparity in results between the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios emphasizes the importance of developing feasible ghg emission policies globally agriculture is a major user of water according to statistics water withdrawal for food has increased 7 3 times in the past century fao 2014 the future increase in irrigation water requirements for food production combined with the effects of climate change will exacerbate global water scarcity fig 5 depicts the evolution of crop irrigation water requirements with time ranging from the 2020 s to the 2080 s and different rcps it can be found that the irrigation water requirements will become prominent over time the effect of climate change on irrigation water requirements for food production under the rcp8 5 scenario 12 22 18 01 is higher than that under the rcp4 5 9 43 17 02 and rcp2 6 scenarios 6 65 15 54 this is also consistent with the forecasts for food production 3 3 projections of global energy generation and water withdrawal ssps describe five plausible future worlds that are defined by narrative storylines and quantitative information and can be characterized by two indices socio economic challenges for adaptation and mitigation riahi et al 2017 for example ssp1 is characterized by low levels of socioeconomic challenges in both mitigation and adaptation implying a reasonably optimistic perspective of future climate change conditions smaller populations faster economic growth more advanced energy technologies and a variety of other variables all support this viewpoint ssp3 on the other hand is marked by a high level of mitigation and adaptation challenges therefore ssp1 has the lowest population with an estimated 7 billion people by 2100 and ssp3 has the largest population with 12 6 billion people in ssp4 there is strong income inequality and high adaptation challenges ssp5 has the fastest economic growth with global gdp expected to reach 1014 trillion us 2005 in 2100 whereas ssp2 is in the middle of the other four scenarios based on the meta analysis method this study integrated and compared the predicted ranges of energy production and water withdrawal by scholars and mapped them to ssps for further analysis the results show that if all ssps are considered average electricity generation is expected to increase to 334 11 ej by 2100 furthermore all ssps project an increase in electricity generation in comparison with the 2010 levels but the magnitudes of these increases vary fig 6 under the fossil fueled rapid growth scenario ssp5 electricity generation will peak at 482 67 ej in 2100 a 5 24 fold increase over the base year following that is the future world characterized by inequality ssp4 and business as usual development ssp2 with electricity generation reaching 320 44 ej and 318 51 ej in 2100 respectively however under the regional rivalry ssp3 and sustainability scenarios ssp1 the increase of electricity generation is low especially under the ssp1 scenario the increase tends to moderate after 2075 water withdrawal of electricity generation in 2100 ranged from 347 km3 ssp1 to 1263 km3 ssp5 in the ssp1 scenario advancements in water withdrawal technology mitigate the increasing trend of water withdrawal for electricity generation with water withdrawal for electricity generation declining from 2010 to 2100 furthermore by comparing generation withdrawals under two scenarios with no and maximum water use efficiency improvements bijl et al 2016 found that improving water use efficiency can reduce water withdrawal by 40 in addition a study by graham et al 2018 showed that in the same scenario technological advancements would significantly reduce water withdrawal however for the ssp5 scenario although the improvement of wue restrains the increase in water withdrawal it remains the largest due to the rapid growth of gdp and power generation the power generation of ssp4 and ssp2 scenarios is similar nevertheless due to the high reliance of ssp4 power generation on renewable energy the water withdrawal of ssp4 627 km3 is expected to be lower than ssp2 763 km3 ssp3 is considered to be a world of slow technological progress with water withdrawal reaching 724 km3 by 2100 overall the results of electricity generation and water withdrawal results are consistent with the ssps narrative 3 4 regression analysis in addition to the water efficiency discussed in the previous section the rate of economic and social development has a significant impact on electricity generation and water withdrawal based on the mixed effect model this study constructed regression models of power generation and water withdrawal with economic and social development factors population gdp future scenarios method models etc tables 3 and 4 power generation and water withdrawal are positively correlated with population and gdp growth p 0 001 electricity generation and water withdrawal will increase by 0 02 ej and 0 11 km3 respectively for every million population increase when gdp increases by 1 trillion us 2005 electricity generation and water withdrawal will increase by 0 41 ej and 1 21 km3 respectively it has been discovered that both have a clear driving effect previous studies have used various methodological models to set up a variety of potential future scenarios to predict global electricity generation and water withdrawal our simulation results show that there are significant differences in generation capacity and water withdrawal between different ssps scenarios and models the differences caused by ssps scenarios are mainly affected by the speed of future social development and relevant policies for example in the ssp1 scenario the focus of global economic growth shifts to human well being consumption is oriented towards low energy intensity the increase in global electricity generation is effectively alleviated and water withdrawal decreases in contrast to the ssp3 scenario consumption at this stage tends to be resource intensive and water efficiency improvement is a low priority this successfully explains why the ssp3 and ssp1 scenarios have similar electricity generation in 2100 but double the amount of water withdrawal energy forecasting models such as gcam and aim cge are widely used the characteristics of the model drive the diversity in results to be specific gcam is distinguished by its comprehensiveness especially the detailed descriptions of the agricultural and land use sectors whereas alm cge is characterized by its full consideration of the interaction among production factors based on the mixed effects model with limited data sets we found that the negative effects of warming on grain yield could be compensated for by increasing co2 concentration and precipitation precipitation is the main environmental factor affecting crop production for every 1 increase in precipitation grain yield will increase by 0 12 certainly heavy rainfall can cause disasters such as floods and landslides which may hamper food yields temperature is negatively correlated with grain yield under a high temperature environment the growth period of crops is shorter and the quality and yield of crops are decreased for every 1 increase in average temperature grain yield will decrease by 1 60 carbon dioxide has a positive impact on crop yields carbon dioxide can increase crop yield by enhancing photosynthesis and decreasing stomatal conductance deryng et al 2016 although carbon dioxide will increase crop yield to some extent in this study it is simulated that every 1 ppm increase in co2 concentration will increase grain yield by 0 01 it should also be mentioned that when the carbon dioxide concentration exceeds a certain critical value it no longer benefits crop growth and if the temperature keeps climbing food yield will decrease challinor et al 2014 in addition to the above mentioned climate parameters influencing food yield various research models study areas climate scenarios and crop types all affect the degree of yield change table 5 the variance in random effects research models study areas and climate scenarios were 560 84 180 12 and 12 27 respectively with statistical significance p 0 001 crop models and study areas are the main sources of uncertainty about the impact of climate change on crop yield the selection of crop models by scholars is diverse dssat aquacrop and other complex models are widely used different model principles or parameter settings in crop models will lead to inconsistent results for the study areas the study shows that climate change increasing temperatures or decreasing precipitation will have a greater negative influence on crop yields in arid or semi arid regions than in other regions babel and turyatunga 2015 poor countries that are less resilient to climate change also face larger food security challenges under climate change crop irrigation water will increase by 13 10 compared to the baseline scenario this indicates that climate change has a significant impact on global irrigation water requirements crop irrigation water is proportional to temperature increase higher temperatures will increase irrigation water by increasing crop photorespiration and reducing water use efficiency for every 1 increase in temperature irrigation water will increase by 9 77 furthermore the decrease in precipitation will directly lead to an increase in irrigation water winter et al 2017 it is predicted that for every 1 decrease in precipitation in the future irrigation water use will increase by 0 28 the variability of water for food production between different models and rcp scenarios is large but the variability between study areas is small table 6 4 discussion 4 1 challenges of water food and energy security climate change economic and social pressures on wefn are compounding food production is often constrained by climate change natural disasters soil and water according to the ipcc 2007 the impact of climate change on food production will worsen in the coming decades our study also found that food yield is declining as a result of climate change at the demand level population increase urbanization changes in dietary structure and consumption levels can all contribute to food insecurity ortiz bobea et al 2021 even cautioned that food supply would face unprecedented strain as the world s population reaches 10 billion by 2050 and food demand approaches the limitations of modern agricultural development according to tian et al 2021 the food gap will increase to 1 26 billion tons in 2050 making it challenging to achieve the balance between global food supply and demand therefore strategies to reduce food demand and adapt to climate change are urgently needed we also need to recognize that food is both water and energy intensive agricultural irrigation accounts for approximately 70 of global human freshwater consumption hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 farm machinery and irrigation consume energy in the food production process statistics show that irrigation accounts for 23 48 of the energy consumption from agriculture singh et al 2002 shortages of energy and water in production will also limit food production there is also a supply demand imbalance in the energy system according to our findings electricity generation will increase however due to population and economic expansion energy demand will increase by 50 in 2030 marien 2013 energy production will be unable to keep pace with population growth leaving about 3 billion people without access to safe and reliable energy furthermore water scarcity will jeopardize global energy security especially in electricity production water withdrawal for electricity generation accounts for 88 of that from the energy industry oecd 2016 aside from the water withdrawal of thermal power generation uranium mining and processing steam cooling and other links in nuclear power production all consume a significant quantity of water with the rapid increase in food and energy demand competition for limited water resources will intensify and the unpredictability of water supply will become the primary risk source of energy production it is necessary to adjust the energy structure and reduce the water demand water is a key constraint to food and energy production population increase urbanization and economic development will alter the original demand pattern for water supplies the underlying difficulty is not merely fluctuations in water demand climate change s influence on water resources will be superimposed on population growth urbanization and globalization falkenmark 2013 extreme weather and unpredictable precipitation intensity will exacerbate the insecurity and vulnerability of water resources taken together the relevance and complexity of the nexus particularly the water resource risk at its core provide significant uncertainty to the future security of wefn scholars and policymakers should think about how to balance the nexus relationship 4 2 a way forward for water energy food nexus adaptation strategies and technologies climate change economic and social development pose greater challenges to wefn developing adaptation strategies and new technological breakthroughs are the way forward for wefn fig 7 the way forward for the wefn is to develop adaptation strategies and new technologies first the application of efficient technologies can help to reduce the negative impacts of climate change and economic society on water energy and food drought resistant crops no till crops water saving irrigation technologies and the development of sustainable energy can cut energy and water usage while increasing yields furthermore altering the planting period and selecting the correct crop types can help to mitigate the effects of climate change early seeding for example resulted in stronger root development and less stress from heat and drought in some locations kirkegaard et al 2014 zeleke 2021 in addition to agriculture technical advancements are critical for the generation of power and the usage of water especially under the condition of water scarcity promoting water saving and recycling technology as well as striving for zero wastewater discharge will reduce water consumption in the energy production process alleviate the competition degree between food and energy for water and reduce the environmental impact certainly we must not only enhance water efficiency but also accelerate the replacement of fossil fuels at the source to achieve structural transformation of the electricity industry the principles of safety cleanliness and efficiency must be followed however fossil fuels especially coal will continue to dominate electricity production in the short term this will eventually result in tremendous carbon dioxide emissions carbon capture and storage ccs could alleviate the problem the international energy agency said ccs contributes 14 of the global decrease in co2 emissions bui et al 2018 therefore green coal power technologies based on ccs and integrated gasification combined cycle igcc will play a key role in the gradual transition of the energy mix to renewables not only new technologies but also adaptation strategies are required to deal with the changing environment and assure wefn security in particular there is a dynamic relationship between water energy and food the behavior of one system frequently has an effect on one or both other systems for example biomass fuels while relieving energy pressures will compete with food for available farmland and irrigation water which may threaten food security large scale bioenergy production must be built on the synergy of food and energy security policy scott et al 2015 therefore we need to start by recognizing the interdependence of water energy and food and then weigh and coordinate appropriate responses to a changing environment secondly inter sector and stakeholder synergies should be brought into play rasul and sharma 2016 in order to attain single sector agricultural sector energy sector or water sector goals current policymaking frequently disregards inter departmental cooperation the resource risks and challenges posed by environmental economic and social development on the other hand demonstrate that management of a single sector leads to the separation of regulatory measures furthermore the concept of resource management centered on a single sector makes it impossible to achieve sustainable goals as a result the nexus based collaborative management theory is critical for improving the present single system management mode and adequately protecting and managing the security of multi resource nexus systems to maximize mutual advantages policymakers should strengthen synergies across the water energy and food sectors as well as establish comprehensive multi sectoral adaptation strategies 4 3 uncertainty and consistency in projections due to uncertainties in climate scenarios social development scenarios scenario setting model selection parameter setting and other aspects the reliability of studies on the impact of climate change and socio economic development on wefn will be greatly affected by specific objects and regions the meta analysis of this study quantified the trends of food and energy production as well as water withdrawal in a changing environment identified the main driving forces and proposed adaptation strategies for future climate change and socio economic development the meta analysis method was applied to comprehensively analyze existing research results in this study which can significantly increase the universality and reliability of research results however we accept that there is still some uncertainty in forecasts this is due to two factors one is due to data collection restrictions for example not all regions of the world have access to the food production data predicted by academics furthermore our data only included peer reviewed articles before the retrieval period and additional studies produced by experts may be published in the future even though a new study may not significantly alter the conclusions it can further complement the existing statistics gray literature such as reports or books are also useful to support our findings but were not included due to data collecting limitations therefore we suggest that subsequent studies can continue to enrich and complement our foundation relevant publications or peer reviewed articles published in languages other than english can also be included in subsequent studies another source of uncertainty is the disparity between models and data sources that predict production and water withdrawal food and energy production projections as well as water withdrawal forecasts all depend on future climate change economic and population estimates for the prediction of food yield under climate change many studies have used multiple gcm climate models based on coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 other studies have opted for individual climate models different choices may lead to different results furthermore multiple climate scenarios such as ipcc sres and rcps are widely used although multiple climate change scenarios can be mapped to rcp scenarios changes in input data may still cause findings to deviate similarly energy predictions for ssps scenarios are inevitably influenced by data sources for example many studies use projections from the world bank or the oecd while some scholars prefer to use their own calculated demographic projections the results of all of these data will be biased in different ways despite these limitations as challinor et al 2007 asserted it is extremely challenging to directly compare the impacts of climate change social economic and other factors on agricultural and other industries although the data are limited the results are valid for the geographic area covered furthermore since high quality quantitative studies are primarily published in peer reviewed journals the inclusion of reports or other language studies may not dramatically alter the conclusions of this study therefore the conclusion based on the existing research results has certain credibility however more accurate and comprehensive research on wefn projections in changing environments is still needed in the future 5 conclusions based on meta regression approaches this study quantifies the changes in food energy production and water withdrawal under climate change and socio economic development scenarios as well as the implications of climate socio economic and other uncertainties the findings are indicative and illustrative for the future this can indicate the direction and magnitude of the impact of climate change and economic development on the wefn and improve the accuracy of decision makers in formulating adaptation strategies for instance the findings reveal that future food production will decline while global food demand will continue to rise consistently exacerbating the supply demand conflict considering maize is more strongly affected by climate than other crops optimizing planting structure may be able to alleviate the existing issue of conflicting food supply and demand to some extent similarly energy production and generation show a stronger dependence on energy mix water use efficiency and the degree of economic and social development this also serves as a reference point for policymakers using meta analysis this study primarily explores the effects of climate and economic factors on the wefn at the production level and provides an effective basis for policy formation a consumer based meta analysis on the other hand will be required in the future examining how population growth and economic development influence food and energy demand for instance government authorities may be more interested in comparing performance on the production and consumption sides we also consider that tackling complex wefn concerns with multidisciplinary methodologies like meta analysis is critical in solving climate change supply demand conflicts and water scarcity credit authorship contribution

9483,different nutrient application levels on okra s abelmoschus esculentus growth and yield under drip fertigation was evaluated with a field experiment in comparison with flood irrigation results showed that drip fertigation improved the okra s yield by 142 compared to surface flood channel irrigation and that this increase was statistically significant an increase in nutrient applications above a recommended dose of fertilizers also significantly improved the yield by up to 100 the hydrus model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data and various statistical parameters were used for comparing observed and predicted soil water content data the volumetric soil water contents calculated using the hydrus model showed a good agreement with values measured at different horizontal and vertical distances from the drip emitter the results also confirmed that soil water contents under drip irrigation were uniformly distributed within the root zone i e 45 cm both vertically and horizontally from the plants however soil water contents were relatively low and showed larger variations within the plants root zone under flood irrigation irrigation scheduling was simulated for the demonstration plots using the calibrated hydrus model for their respective soil conditions and validated with field observed soil water contents an application of nutrients through drip fertigation improved crop yields in all demonstration plots and an increase in yield over the control flood irrigation ranged from 13 to 317 the benefit cost ratio of drip fertigation for demonstration plots ranged from 2 05 to 3 50 for selected crops our study highlights that the adoption of drip fertigation with proper irrigation and nutrient scheduling evaluated using hydrus increases crop productivity and ensures higher efficiency of water nutrients soil fertility environment sustainability and profitable farming in kerala graphical abstract ga1 keywords drip fertigation wetting pattern irrigation scheduling yield economics sustainability hydrus okra 1 introduction the average productivity of most crops in the kerala state of india is low when compared to the national average as a result the state s farming community is in a difficult situation fighting for its survival the older generation of farmers is losing interest in farming due to serious unresolved problems such as high labor and cultivation costs the new generation has deserted farming because of the cultural change and is moving into service sectors and new areas such as information technology there is an urgent need for effective government interventions with people s participation to improve crop productivity and resolve the farmers crisis in kerala lack of irrigation and low fertility of lateritic soils are few of the most important variables contributing to this low productivity only 17 of the kerala state s cropped area is irrigated state planning board 2016 there are several significant limitations to the use of conventional surface irrigation methods in the state such as rolling topography water scarcity during summer months march to may high infiltration rates low water holding capacity of the lateritic soils the major soil type in the state mixed cropping patterns limited root zone depth and small landholding sizes etc although an annual mean rainfall of 3000 mm is observed in kerala its distribution is quite uneven both spatially and temporally the state experiences a very long dry period december may resulting in a 4 6 months moisture stress period this leads to a significant reduction in crop yields and a considerable economic loss to the growers rajagopal and kasturibai 2002 during summer march to may the soil moisture deficit coupled with atmospheric parameter changes increased air temperature and evaporative demand because of change in wind speed direction and less relative humidity aggravates the situation leading to soil and atmospheric drought hence irrigation during the summer months becomes vital for improving crop productivity however water scarcity experienced in many parts of the state imposes severe restrictions on farmers to adopt traditional irrigation methods since the priority will be set for meeting the domestic demands for drinking and other uses and also water requirement for flood irrigation is high another reason is that undulating topography makes the practice of flood irrigation is difficult this is the primary reason why only approximately 20 of the cultivated area under coconut the important crop under the upland cropping system in kerala is irrigated under these circumstances micro irrigation methods such as drip irrigation have high relevance in the state for improving crop productivity madhavachandran and surendran 2016 the area under drip irrigation in kerala is minimal 15 885 ha compared to other indian states such as maharashtra karnataka gujarat and tamil nadu thus the potential to increase the area under micro irrigation in the state is substantial rane 2011 however if we analyze the reasons for drip adoption it was found that the adoption is high in critical water scarcity areas and with the high value crops profit oriented horticultural crops narayanamoorthy 2001 this implies that either water scarcity or profitability is the major driving force behind the adoption of drip irrigation by farmers madhavachandran and surendran 2016 non adoption of drip irrigation was due to many reasons the perception has been so far that drip irrigation s benefits as communicated by extension workers are related mainly to saving water rather than improving productivity usually farmers get their irrigation water from the government distribution system and it is free hence there is less interest in adopting this capital intensive technology unless it becomes necessary hence the focus of the promotion of drip irrigation needs to shift from the water saving technology to higher crop productivity and profitability to the farmers i e higher profits with precise quantities of water and nutrients drip irrigation is economically viable for high value horticultural crops since even a marginal increase in productivity results in a significant increase in net returns madhavachandran and surendran 2016 surendran et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2014 2015 2017 however the desired economic benefits can also be achieved for field crops provided proper drip fertigation when 4 rs are adopted i e right time right source right rate and right place madhavachandran and surendran 2016 these are seldom practiced and hence profitability gets reduced despite high capital investments a small improvement in profitability for drip irrigation alone without adopting proper nutrient applications could be one reason for the slow adoption of drip irrigation systems by farmers surendran et al 2016 the low soil fertility in kerala the undulating and sloping topography coupled with high intensity rainfall accelerates surface runoff processes erosion of topsoil and organic matter and leaching of nutrients from agricultural areas during the rainy season june to november the average sediment loss from kerala s western ghats region is estimated at 15 20 tonnes ha 1 yr 1 cwrdm 1992 hence the efficiency of using organic and inorganic sources of nutrients added to the soil during the rainy season is very low in kerala all these factors lead to the high rate of soil degradation in the state and hence the agricultural lands are mostly deficient in nutrients resulting in low productivity the adoption of drip fertigation can simultaneously address both fertilizer and water applications resulting in improved crop productivity and enhancing the water and nutrient use efficiency surendran et al 2014 2017 jayakumar et al 2014 2015 2017 under drip fertigation it is possible to regulate the quantity of water and nutrients based on crop requirements however kerala s field level observations revealed that drip fertigation was not popular among farmers madhavachandran and surendran 2016 hence demonstrating drip fertigation technology at farmer s field will help to improve the adoption rate it is in this context that this work was done with the following objectives a to assess different application levels of nutrients on the growth and yield of okra by field experiment b to use field experiment data to calibrate the hydrus model c to use the calibrated model to prepare an optimal irrigation schedule for drip fertigation demonstration plots and d to carry out farmer managed demonstrations on drip fertigation in kerala and evaluate its performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment using okra for calibration and validation of hydrus a greenhouse experiment was carried out at cwrdm located in kozhikode district 110 17 22 n and 750 52 20 e to assess the impact of different methods of irrigation and graded levels of nutrients this was carried out in a rbd randomized block design with 7 treatments and 3 replications using three irrigation methods i e surface and subsurface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation via channel

consortia m s probio india p ltd to match with the recommended dose of fertilizers remaining doses were applied as basal application using farm yard manure fym n p and k quantity was rounded off to nearby whole number the drip irrigation system was designed according to standard procedures and design specifications the distance between the laterals was 1 2 m and the diameter of the laterals used was 16 mm single line of lateral consist of 30 drippers emitters with a spacing of 60 cm between the drippers in the beginning of each lateral to control water flow flow control valves using a tap system were installed inline drippers with a discharge rate of 2 lh 1 were used for irrigation with respect to sub surface drip irrigation also lateral consist of 30 drippers emitters with a spacing of 60 cm between the drippers were installed as per the treatment schedule this sub surface drip irrigation laterals were placed beneath the soil surface at a depth of 15 cm and plant geometry were similar to the surface drip irrigation required pressure of 101 325 kpa was maintained using 746 watts pump application efficiency considered for surface subsurface drip irrigation and surface flood

the study location surendran et al 2019 application efficiency considered for surface subsurface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation was 90 95 and 50 respectively sivanappan 1994 specific area is the area of the plot in which the treatments were imposed soil moisture measurements were made at different depths after irrigation and then 24 48 and 72 h after irrigation using an mp 306 soil moisture sensor probe ict international ltd australia using standing wave principle of measurement the moisture measurements were taken both horizontally 0 25 and 50 cm from the drippers and vertically 0 15 30 and 45 cm depth using point measurement probe in addition few sets of continuous soil moisture probe along with data logger were also fixed to assess the soil moisture changes continuously using the data logger gravimetric soil moisture measurements were taken and used for calibration of the moisture probe for understanding the bulk density soil core samples undisturbed were taken from each soil layer and the mass of dry soil was divided by the bulk volume of soil in 3 replicates soil moisture differences 1 2 and 3 days after irrigation for different locations were analyzed using excel and instat software comparing the mean values for each treatment was performed using the lsd test at 1 and 5 significance levels okra seeds were planted during the last week of december crop growth parameters biometrics such as plant height number of internodes number of leaves leaf area and leaf area index lai were carried out 30 60 and 90 days after planting using standard procedures briefly plant height leaf length and leaf width are measured using a meter scale number of internodes and leaves are measured by counting plant height is the length measured from the ground level to the top of the maximally expanded leaf of the plant leaf length and leaf width of the plant is measured by considering the secondary fully developed leaf the fruit weight was determined at harvest picking was done after maturity and the total yield was calculated by combining all pickings all cultural practices including gap filling weeding plant protection measures and other practices were done based on the package of practices recommendations of kerala agricultural university kau 2016 soil samples were taken from different soil horizon in all the treatment plots up to a depth of 0 90 cm varying for different crops using a soil auger from different points the samples were processed as per the standard procedure and larger particles than 2 mm were removed with a sieve and then used for analysis in the soil laboratory of the water management agriculture division of cwrdm kozhikode for the parameters listed in table 2 using standard analytical procedures similarly stage wise plant samples have also been collected and kept for nutrient uptake pattern analysis n p and k content in plant parts were analyses using standard analytical procedures table 2 and expressed as percentage on dry weight basis and computed to kg ha 1 precipitation soil water contents wetting patterns emission uniformity crop biometrics post harvest soil fertility and yield attributes were studied using standard procedures surendran et al 2017 the data on irrigation and soil water contents were used to calibrate the hydrus model the calibrated model was then used to develop irrigation schedules for drip fertigation demonstration plots the various growth yield and quality parameters were recorded at appropriate stages using standard procedures in stat software version 3 36 were used for statistical analysis and for estimating average standard errors and for identifying the statistical significance using anova tests 2 2 description of the hydrus model windows based software package hydrus 2d model was used in the current study simunek et al 2016 this model simulates solute and water movement of variably saturated media porous in a two dimensional 2 d way using different numerical and mathematical techniques many researchers evaluated the software and analyzed its potential to predict simulate water and nutrient movement from different methods of drip irrigation e g skaggs et al 2004 kandelous and simunek 2010 simunek et al 2016 the hydrus model explains and uses numerically the richards equation for both saturated and unsaturated flow of water apart from using

domain was a rectangular domain 100 cm wide and 45 cm deep water infiltration and redistribution under surface drip irrigation was modeled using the hydrus 2d software the location of the semicircle as mentioned in fig 3 in the domain indicates the position of the emitter initial conditions were fixed as constant water level equal to the soil s field capacity based on the soil physical property analysis using the pressure plate apparatus in the process of irrigation at the emitter a time variable flux boundary condition was used the water flux was estimated by water discharge divided with the surface area of the dripper hydraulic parameters were estimated from the soil texture percentage of clay silt and sand and bulk density using the rosetta software implemented into hydrus the emitter boundary become an atmospheric boundary at the end of the irrigation event a time variable boundary condition was used in hydrus 2d to simulate irrigation events depending on irrigation water requirements during irrigation and no irrigation periods the no flux boundary condition was fixed on the vertical side of soil profile s boundaries because the soil water movement is symmetrical along these boundaries the bottom boundary was fixed as free drainage boundary condition an atmospheric boundary condition was used at the soil surface and an evaporation flux based on the calculated et values using the cropwat model was considered during and after irrigation field observed data of soil water contents were matched with the simulated values by the hydrus model for surface drip irrigation at different soil depths both horizontally and vertically from the dripper emitter 2 2 1 details about the demonstration plots the details about the drip fertigation demonstration plots are given in table 3 the project was implemented in collaboration with the agriculture department of the government of kerala the department assisted cwrdm in identifying farmers plots for the demonstration project and helped in arranging farmers for the seminars workshop and field visits organized at the plots the selected plots were initially assessed for water and power availability based on the field conditions a suitable system of drip fertigation was designed installation of the system was carried out at the demonstration plots and training was provided to the farmers to operate the drip fertigation system in all 21 plots farmers were asked to manage the other field operations starting from land preparation sowing weeding intercultural operations and harvesting according to their standard practice the project was considered to be a farmer managed demonstration in a participatory mode the fertigation schedule was prepared by considering the experimental plot s soil test values and crop requirements soil samples were taken from different soil horizon and up to a depth of 0 90 cm varying for different crops using a soil auger from different points from the plot 8 12 samples distributed over the entire field and then mixed into one composite sample the samples were processed as per the standard procedure as stated earlier in the experimental plot and larger particles than 2 mm were removed with a sieve and then used for analysis in the soil laboratory of the water management agriculture division of cwrdm kozhikode for the parameters listed in table 2 using standard analytical procedures all essential nutrients major and micronutrients were considered for fertigation depending upon the soil test values table 4 in most plots the organic carbon content was low and soils were sandy in texture see detailed characteristics in table 4 the drip fertigation technique was compared with the standard farmer s practice adopted and that was considered as control plot the methodology adopted for irrigation and fertigation scheduling was as follows water requirements of crops were estimated using the fao model cropwat and irrigation was provided at 100 of the crop water requirement crop characteristics used for the selected crops such as coconut banana brinjal are given in table 3 data on weather parameters were collected from the nearest agro meteorological station in each district similar to the experiment data here also et c was calculated by multiplying et 0 with the crop coefficient k c for the selected crops at different growth stages and growing environments surendran et al 2014 2017 the wetting pattern was simulated using hydrus for all demonstration plots using their particular soil characteristics however in this manuscript only two demonstration plots are described brinjal vegetable plot in palakkad and a coconut plot in the thiruvananthapuram district of kerala the farmers were informed about the amount of water to be applied during each irrigation in most cases variations in the crops water requirements were regulated by increasing or decreasing the duration of irrigation volumetric water contents were measured in demonstration plots similar to the experiment with okra field observed data of soil moisture were compared with the hydrus model simulations data on nutrient status moisture content growth and crop yield parameters were collected from demonstration plots as described in the experimental plot surendran et al 2016 benefit cost ratio bcr was worked out for demonstration plots by using the formula suggested by palaniappan 1985 6 bcr gross return total cost of cultivation data collection was carried out for four years for coconut one plant and one ratoon crop two years for banana and two seasons for brinjal 2 3 water productivity details about the methodology for irrigation water requirements can be found in surendran et al 2016 and jayakumar et al 2017 water productivity is calculated based on the production of crops yield and its ratio with water use as per the treatment structure fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 total water used for each treatment were computed by adding on the quantum of water applied during each irrigation similarly for demonstration plots also this was computed water productivity 7 water productivity crop yield kg ha 1 total wate r used m 3 ha 1 kg m 3 2 4 statistical analysis the data collected from the experiment was subjected to statistical analysis and interpretation of data was done using the fischer s method of analysis of variance technique as described by gomez and gomez 1984 the level of significance used in f and t test was p 0 05 the mean values for main plot sub plot and interactions were separately subjected to duncan multiple range test dmrt using corresponding error mean sum of square and degrees of freedom with respect to post harvest soil fertility analysis of nutrients geo statistical analysis was conducted using the extension of arcgis 10 0 tool geo statistical analyst and it was carried out to produce the semi variograms using krigging for understanding the impact of spatial variability three statistical indicators were used to assess the validity of the model hydrus 2d software i e ae average error rmse root mean square error and the c eff coefficient of efficiency these three indicators were used to compare the actual and predicted or simulated values smaller values for errors indicate that the model fits the actual values well and vice versa the ae rmse and c eff were calculated using the standard equations 3 results and discussion 3 1 green house experiment data at cwrdm the results showed that different treatments influenced the yield significantly and 100 of rdif through surface drip irrigation provided the highest yield this was on par with the 100 of the rdif through subsurface drip irrigation and 125 rdif respectively fig 2 this showed that these three treatments did not differ significantly in yield the lowest yield was obtained with surface flood irrigation treatment control the yield improvement was 142 than the surface flood channel irrigation method and was statistically significant the soil moisture content did not varied in all drip fertigation treatments since irrigation was supplied daily but in the case of flood irrigation the crops might have been affected by moisture and nutrient availability since the irrigation interval was high the soil moisture status observed immediately after the drip and surface flood channel irrigation application is presented in fig 3 the results showed that immediately after irrigation the soil moisture content was relatively uniform across the root zone under both drip and flood irrigation however the soil moisture measurement at 3rd day after 48 hrs showed that the soil moisture content varied largely under flood irrigation and a reduction in moisture content was also observed but in the case of the drip irrigation even though a slight reduction was noticed it was relatively uniform across the root zone i e 45 cm both vertically and horizontally from plants furthermore soil moisture and soil temperature of the surface soil was monitored continuously with soil moisture probes at an interval of 30 min under both drip and flood irrigation using a data logger and continuous soil moisture probe one of the sample observation results are shown in fig 4 the results showed a reduction in the soil water content from 28 8 to 7 3 under flood irrigation on fourth day fig 3 during the first day moisture gradually decreased under both drip and flood irrigation however after that the water content under drip irrigation was maintained since under drip irrigation it was daily irrigation fig 3 similarly an increase in nutrient levels improved okra yield which was confirmed by the polynomial regression with an r 2 value of 0 98 however the yield improvement was not seen at 125 of the recommended dose of inorganic fertilizer rdif fig 5 confirms that the nutrient uptake was higher under drip irrigation with increased fertigation levels than under control in which flood irrigation was practiced the highest nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake was found with the 125 of the recommended dose rdf of npk and were statistically significant than under surface irrigation at all okra crop growth stages data are shown only for a post harvest stage even though the uptake was higher for 125 rdf it was statistically similar to 100 rdf and resulted in on par effect the uptake of p and k also had a similar pattern as that of uptake of nitrogen at different growth stages of crop and at harvest soil moisture largely determines the uptake of most of the plant essential nutrients since it influences the soil solution phase which governs the nutrient availability apart from its concentration in the soil in this study also soil water content and moisture levels were maintained because of the continuous supply of water through drip fertigation and in addition to the water nutrients were also applied resulting in optimal availability of both water and nutrients in the soil as per the requirement of the crop and thereby contributing for higher uptake of nutrients by the crop these factors resulted in higher biomass production and ultimately leading to higher crop productivity in addition to the above factors fertilizers were applied in split doses more frequent application in small doses which might have contributed for higher uptake and nutrient losses by other mechanisms such as leaching and volatilization is minimized thereby making them available continuously to the crop for its uptake the results showed that drip fertigation resulted in statistically significant higher yield than control soil application and this might be due to the higher uptake of nutrients increase in overall use efficiency of fertilizers fue of nutrients derived from fertilizer right source of fertilizers compared with control soil application of fertilizers jayakumar et al 2017 post harvest soil fertility data available n p k and organic carbon for the entire experimental plot obtained from soil analysis were interpolated by kriging using arcgis version 10 2 the results showed that fertigation created a gradient in nutrient availability within the treatments fig 6 the lowest value of available soil n was observed in the plot region of 75 of rdf inorganic npk and the highest value was observed in the treatment of 100 of rdf inorganic npk through subsurface drip irrigation this indicated that the quantity of fertilizers applied through fertigation influences the soil available n status similarly p k and carbon showed variation between treatments this confirms that the quantity of fertilizers applied through drip fertigation influences post harvest soil fertility post harvest soil available npk were higher in drip fertigated plots when compared with the surface irrigation and the soil application of fertilizers plot control the possible reason could be leaching of nutrients under flood irrigation compared to drip irrigation as mentioned earlier more frequent application of water and nutrients in smaller quantities through drip fertigation created favorable conditions making nutrients available in the soil to the maximum surendran et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2017 3 2 calibration and validation of hydrus for soil water distribution calibration and validation of hydrus were carried out using the okra experimental data the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated table 5 from texture of clay silt and sand and bulk density using a rosetta module a pedotransfer function module implemented in hydrus the accuracy of hydrus simulations was evaluated for water infiltration and redistribution in a sandy clay loam soil of the experimental field with okra under drip irrigation fig 7 shows simulated volumetric water contents for this field experiment 4 and 24 h after irrigation hydrus predictions and observed values were close to each other at the start of the drip irrigation i e when water starts infiltrating into the soil near to the dripper the soil water content in this region was higher than elsewhere in the soil profile and at that point the predicted and observed values matches precisely figs 8a and 8b however differences between measured and simulated water contents increased when the wetting front reaches far away from the dripper i e the drier soil after the end of irrigation soil water contents were measured at specified distances from the dripper and the data are depicted in fig 8a and b as mentioned earlier the correspondence between measured and simulated water contents was good at a location near the dripper rmse 1 349 ae 0 134 and c eff 0 81 when compared to that the predictability ws less at other distances from the dripper since it showed higher rmse ae and ceff values rmse 2 984 ae 0 346 and c eff 0 51 the possible reason for this is the uncertainty in soil hydraulic parameters predicted using the pedotransfer functions which cannot account for gravel larger size particles present in the field since the soil is of lateritic nature 3 3 soil wetting pattern in the drip fertigation demonstration plots using hydrus the input parameters used in hydrus for planning the irrigation scheduling in demonstration plots are given in table 6 similar to the okra experiment the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated table 5 from texture of clay silt and sand and bulk density using a rosetta module a pedotransfer function module available in hydrus this module of hydrus gives the hydraulic parameters of soil needed for simulation of water flow in an easy and quick manner the input parameters used in hydrus for planning the irrigation scheduling in demonstration plots are given in table 6 3 4 the demonstration plot with coconut in the thiruvananthapuram district the soil had a sandy texture with an available water capacity of 2 1 the soil wetting patterns for the coconut plot at thiruvananthapuram were simulated using hydrus and are presented in fig 9a irrigation using a dripper with a discharge of 4 liters per hour for 4 h resulted in the soil water content of about 0 38 cm3 cm3 the wetting patterns during irrigation and after irrigation of simulated by the model and observed values are shown in fig 9a and b water contents simulated by hydrus model were nearer to the observed water contents in the field and statistically also the ae rmse were less as expected for sandy soil the vertical flow was much faster than the horizontal flow the entire root zone down to the 120 cm depth reached this wetness level after just 4 hrs farmers are doubtful that whether 60 liters of water per palm per day may be sufficient to coconut or not surendran et al 2019 however this simulation analysis confirmed that this quantity of water was adequate and the entire effective root zone of 120 cm had the soil water content of 0 37 cm3 cm3 when the modeled results were explained to the farmers they felt convinced the same soil was then allowed to dry out and hydrus was used to study how soil moisture changes over the drying period the results showed that after one day i e 24 h the surface soil s water content nearly reached the wilting point of 0 04 cm3 cm3 and then continued decreasing over the next few days this indicates that this sandy soil requires daily irrigation to maximize the crop productivity of coconut accordingly daily drip irrigation has been adopted for this plot and trained the farmer to practice the same 3 5 the demonstration plot with vegetables in the palakkad district the soil had a sandy loam texture with an available water capacity of 8 7 the soil wetting patterns simulated for this plot using hydrus are presented in fig 9 when water infiltrated into the soil at the beginning of irrigation the soil water contents were higher close to the emitter than elsewhere water contents simulated by hydrus model were nearer to the observed water contents in the field the wetting patterns during irrigation and after irrigation of simulated by the model are shown in fig 10 a dripper with a discharge rate of 2 liters per hour irrigating for 45 min resulted in a soil water content of about 0 39 cm3 cm3 the same soil profile was then allowed to dry out to determine how soil moisture changes over time during the drying period the results show that after one day i e 24 h after irrigation the surface soil water content is 0 18 cm3 cm3 by the end of the next day the soil water content is 0 11 cm3 cm3 reaching the wilting point and then decreases further observed soil moisture data showed a close correlation with model predicted values this indicates that this soil requires daily irrigation to maximize crop productivity of vegetables based on this finding the recommendation of daily irrigations was made for this demonstration plot 3 6 statistical validation of hydrus in demonstration plots soil water contents were also observed and simulated using hydrus for different soil depths in experimental and demonstration plots fig 11 the results showed a close correlation between observed and model predicted values except for a few points the regression analysis was carried out to quantify the agreement statistically and the regression coefficient r 2 0 81 0 87 between observed and predicted volumetric water content suggests that the model is valid fig 12 the model performance in simulating water contents of the soil was assessed by comparing the measured and predicted values the values of ae and rmse were 0 184 and 1 759 respectively for the demonstration sites of thiruvanthapuram alappuzha palakkad and thrissur the rmse values were 0 179 1 689 0 184 and 3 456 respectively and the ae were 0 148 0 124 0 112 and 0 231 respectively these low values of ae and rmse indicate that the actual and simulated values of water contents were very close the output from the current study falls in agreement with the findings of many other studies for example kandelous and simunek 2010 reported that hydrus 2d model predicts well the soil water contents in the soil profile under drip irrigation in laboratory and field conditions phogat et al 2013 also reported that water contents predicted with hydrus 3d matched statistically well with the observed data from the lysimeter experimental plot planted with orange tree in this study the coefficient of efficiency or the model s efficiency was equal to 59 under field conditions even though the efficiency is little lower probably this might be due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in the field because the presence of gravels in it however it can be concluded that the simulated and observed soil water content is optimal and suggested to practice for field implementation in some cases as evident from figs 11 to 12 very low soil water contents and values at greater distances from the dripper were slightly over or under estimated possibly due to different factors such as presence of gravels in the field because of lateritic soil difference in rate of decomposition organic matter soil crust and cracks etc khaledian et al 2009 chen et al 2020 these studies confirmed that if the input data e g hydraulic attributes of the soil boundary conditions initial for the hydrus model are satisfactorily provided the model predicted data will be more accurate simunek et al 2016 the water contents observed in the field and the water contents predicted by the hydrus 2d model followed a similar pattern depending on the soil physical properties wetting pattern shape simulations with hydrus 2d were acceptable with lower values of rmse and significant r 2 fig 12 from this experiment it can be stated that hydrus 2d model predicts the soil wetting patterns in a acceptable manner and could be selected for predicting soil water contents wetting patterns and irrigation schedules based on this hydrus 2d in combination with cropwat can be used as a predictive model for new locations to have a preliminary understanding and also for design of suitable drip irrigation technology systems for irrigation 3 7 yield and profit from demonstration plots the yield data obtained from selected demonstration plots are shown in table 7 reported mean yield data for coconut were collected over four years for banana for one plant and one ratoon crop and for vegetables for two seasons an increase in yield under drip fertigation demonstration plots in comparison to the control plots soil application of nutrients and flood irrigation may be attributed to the better availability of nutrients and its uptake resulting in higher photosynthesis growth of leaves and mobilization of nutrients to sink source to sink frequent supply of nutrients by drip fertigation resulted in their enhanced availability to the crops this coupled with sufficient soil moisture resulted in increased nutrient absorption by the crop in the formation and mobilization of assimilates from source to reproductory parts sink and yielding higher productivity under fertigation drip fertigation i e supply of nutrients through drip irrigation systems has been reported to improve the productivity yield of several crops water productivity wp uptake of nutrients and fue fertilizer use efficiency surendran et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2014 2015 irrigation systems such as drip irrigation allow frequent small doses of fertilizer injections at timely intervals without much labor cost there by risk of leaching can be reduced to a larger extent or even nil compared to fertilizers given through a single bulk application this may have been the possible reason for the improvement in post harvest soil fertility status of these soils data not shown nutrient applications through drip fertigation improved the crop yield of all demonstration plots an increase in yield over the control ranged from 13 to 317 some of the yield data not shown the reasons for low yield under control plots surface irrigation with soil application of fertilizers are decrease in photosynthetic activity metabolites and reduction in absorption and mobilization of nutrients from the soil to the plant i e the beneficial effects observed under drip fertigation may not exist here shen et al 2020 usually under flood irrigation the crops used to face excess moisture at the initial days and stress after few days after irrigation because of the wider irrigation interval resulting in reduced cell division and cell elongation and affecting all the physiological activities and ultimately leading to low production in an experiment of deficit irrigation ali et al 2018 in contrast during the initial period of flood irrigation also the crop will be suffering from excess moisture and lack of oxygen which will hamper the nutrient absorption processes hence this intermittent stress due to lack of moisture excess moisture and lack of aeration and non availability of nutrients might be the causative factor for low yield this is in accordance with few earlier studies on micro irrigation methods which showed higher yield under drip irrigation than the sprinkler and surface flood irrigation smith et al 1991 kamilov et al 2003 jayakumar et al 2014 3 8 water productivity and n use efficiency data from the greenhouse field experiment with okra showed the highest water productivity wp under drip fertigation while the lowest wp was registered in conventional control flood irrigation table 8 a similar improvement in water productivity was also observed in demonstration plots data not shown drip irrigation of coconut proved to be an economically efficient irrigation method saving 34 of water compared to basin irrigation in kerala s lateritic soils dhanapal et al 2003 2004ab studies by nagwekar et al 2006 and nainanayake et al 2008 also indicate that drip irrigation can save about 45 50 of water compared to surface irrigation without any significant yield reduction one additional hectare can be brought under irrigation with the saved water thereby increasing farmers net income data from the greenhouse field experiment with okra similarly showed the highest n use efficiency for 100 of rdif under subsurface drip fertigation t6 comparable with that for 100 of rdif under surface drip irrigation t2 the lowest n use efficiency was recorded for the control t7 conventional flood irrigation table 7 this is in agreement with many earlier findings which showed improvements in water productivity and nutrient use efficiency for drip fertigation smith et al 1991 janat and somi 2002 kamilov et al 2003 jayakumar et al 2014 jayakumar et al 2017 sandhu et al 2019 higher water productivity and nutrient use efficiency for drip fertigation compared to flood irrigation were mainly due to saving irrigation water losses through percolation and evaporation were minimized under drip fertigation and timely application of nutrients using a split application improving the biomass production drip fertigation has been reported to minimize n losses through leaching and denitrification due to small n doses in several splits and less irrigation surendran et al 2016 sandhu et al 2019 increases in wp and nutrient use efficiency result from both an increase in yield and saving in irrigation water while in the studies with coconut in kerala mentioned earlier dhanapal et al 2003 dhanapal et al 2004a dhanapal et al 2004b there was a reduction in yield under some drip irrigation treatments in this study the yield improved the possible reason may be that only drip irrigation without fertigation was practiced in most of the studies another possible reason might be due to over excess irrigation without carefully designed irrigation schedules for the drip irrigation with reference to specific crop and soil type however in this study drip fertigation with frequent split doses of nutrients resulted in higher productivity and the saving of chemical fertilizers ensuring higher efficiency of water and nutrients under coconut since coconut is a perennial crop this long term study confirms that drip fertigation will improve crop and water productivity all other crops have responded in a similar way with respect to improvement in the crop and water productivity the maximum benefit cost ratio bcr was obtained for the drip fertigation demonstration plots compared with the control plots table 8 drip fertigation noticeably influenced the mean net returns and the bcr banana registered the maximum net returns 399 408 rs ha 1 and bcr of 3 50 whereas the control demonstration plot of banana registered a net return of only 248 332 rs ha 1 with bcr of 2 82 the drip fertigation demonstration plots have clearly indicated that higher economic returns and profitability can be achieved by drip fertigation irrespective of the difference in various parameters madhavachandran and surendran 2016 4 conclusions different application levels of nutrients on the growth and yield of okra was evaluated by drip fertigation mainly to assess the impact of drip fertigation on crop and water productivity in addition farmer managed demonstrations on drip fertigation in kerala were also caried out and evaluated its performance the greenhouse experiment results showed that the yield was 142 higher than for the surface flood channel irrigation method and the difference was statistically significant the results also confirmed that soil moisture under drip irrigation was uniformly distributed within the root zone i e 45 cm both vertically and horizontally from the plants on the other hand the water content was comparatively low under flood irrigation and there were greater variations in soil moisture within the root zone of plants this experimental data was used for calibration and validation of hydrus volumetric soil water contents calculated with the hydrus model showed an agreeable match according to rmse ae ce and r 2 with measured values at different lateral and vertical distances from the emitter throughout the soil profile during the establishment stage of irrigation similarly soil water contents simulated using hydrus for the selected demonstration plots and observed values were also in close agreement drip fertigation water and nutrient application improved the crop productivity in all the demonstration plots an increase in yield over the control flood irrigation ranged from 13 to 317 crop biometrics yield attributes and yields were significantly influenced by drip fertigation compared to the conventional practice in all demonstration plots the benefit cost ratio under the drip fertigation demonstration plots ranged from 2 05 to 3 50 for selected crops the novelty of the current study is that this is the first time the hydrus model was utilized to implement field irrigation scheduling with farmers participatory approach it is concluded that the adoption of drip fertigation with precise irrigation and nutrient management simulated using the hydrus model will improve the crop and water productivity besides ensuring higher efficiency of nutrients and thereby maintaining soil fertility environmental sustainability and economically profitable farming in

9483,different nutrient application levels on okra s abelmoschus esculentus growth and yield under drip fertigation was evaluated with a field experiment in comparison with flood irrigation results showed that drip fertigation improved the okra s yield by 142 compared to surface flood channel irrigation and that this increase was statistically significant an increase in nutrient applications above a recommended dose of fertilizers also significantly improved the yield by up to 100 the hydrus model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data and various statistical parameters were used for comparing observed and predicted soil water content data the volumetric soil water contents calculated using the hydrus model showed a good agreement with values measured at different horizontal and vertical distances from the drip emitter the results also confirmed that soil water contents under drip irrigation were uniformly distributed within the root zone i e 45 cm both vertically and horizontally from the plants however soil water contents were relatively low and showed larger variations within the plants root zone under flood irrigation irrigation scheduling was simulated for the demonstration plots using the calibrated hydrus model for their respective soil conditions and validated with field observed soil water contents an application of nutrients through drip fertigation improved crop yields in all demonstration plots and an increase in yield over the control flood irrigation ranged from 13 to 317 the benefit cost ratio of drip fertigation for demonstration plots ranged from 2 05 to 3 50 for selected crops our study highlights that the adoption of drip fertigation with proper irrigation and nutrient scheduling evaluated using hydrus increases crop productivity and ensures higher efficiency of water nutrients soil fertility environment sustainability and profitable farming in kerala graphical abstract ga1 keywords drip fertigation wetting pattern irrigation scheduling yield economics sustainability hydrus okra 1 introduction the average productivity of most crops in the kerala state of india is low when compared to the national average as a result the state s farming community is in a difficult situation fighting for its survival the older generation of farmers is losing interest in farming due to serious unresolved problems such as high labor and cultivation costs the new generation has deserted farming because of the cultural change and is moving into service sectors and new areas such as information technology there is an urgent need for effective government interventions with people s participation to improve crop productivity and resolve the farmers crisis in kerala lack of irrigation and low fertility of lateritic soils are few of the most important variables contributing to this low productivity only 17 of the kerala state s cropped area is irrigated state planning board 2016 there are several significant limitations to the use of conventional surface irrigation methods in the state such as rolling topography water scarcity during summer months march to may high infiltration rates low water holding capacity of the lateritic soils the major soil type in the state mixed cropping patterns limited root zone depth and small landholding sizes etc although an annual mean rainfall of 3000 mm is observed in kerala its distribution is quite uneven both spatially and temporally the state experiences a very long dry period december may resulting in a 4 6 months moisture stress period this leads to a significant reduction in crop yields and a considerable economic loss to the growers rajagopal and kasturibai 2002 during summer march to may the soil moisture deficit coupled with atmospheric parameter changes increased air temperature and evaporative demand because of change in wind speed direction and less relative humidity aggravates the situation leading to soil and atmospheric drought hence irrigation during the summer months becomes vital for improving crop productivity however water scarcity experienced in many parts of the state imposes severe restrictions on farmers to adopt traditional irrigation methods since the priority will be set for meeting the domestic demands for drinking and other uses and also water requirement for flood irrigation is high another reason is that undulating topography makes the practice of flood irrigation is difficult this is the primary reason why only approximately 20 of the cultivated area under coconut the important crop under the upland cropping system in kerala is irrigated under these circumstances micro irrigation methods such as drip irrigation have high relevance in the state for improving crop productivity madhavachandran and surendran 2016 the area under drip irrigation in kerala is minimal 15 885 ha compared to other indian states such as maharashtra karnataka gujarat and tamil nadu thus the potential to increase the area under micro irrigation in the state is substantial rane 2011 however if we analyze the reasons for drip adoption it was found that the adoption is high in critical water scarcity areas and with the high value crops profit oriented horticultural crops narayanamoorthy 2001 this implies that either water scarcity or profitability is the major driving force behind the adoption of drip irrigation by farmers madhavachandran and surendran 2016 non adoption of drip irrigation was due to many reasons the perception has been so far that drip irrigation s benefits as communicated by extension workers are related mainly to saving water rather than improving productivity usually farmers get their irrigation water from the government distribution system and it is free hence there is less interest in adopting this capital intensive technology unless it becomes necessary hence the focus of the promotion of drip irrigation needs to shift from the water saving technology to higher crop productivity and profitability to the farmers i e higher profits with precise quantities of water and nutrients drip irrigation is economically viable for high value horticultural crops since even a marginal increase in productivity results in a significant increase in net returns madhavachandran and surendran 2016 surendran et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2014 2015 2017 however the desired economic benefits can also be achieved for field crops provided proper drip fertigation when 4 rs are adopted i e right time right source right rate and right place madhavachandran and surendran 2016 these are seldom practiced and hence profitability gets reduced despite high capital investments a small improvement in profitability for drip irrigation alone without adopting proper nutrient applications could be one reason for the slow adoption of drip irrigation systems by farmers surendran et al 2016 the low soil fertility in kerala the undulating and sloping topography coupled with high intensity rainfall accelerates surface runoff processes erosion of topsoil and organic matter and leaching of nutrients from agricultural areas during the rainy season june to november the average sediment loss from kerala s western ghats region is estimated at 15 20 tonnes ha 1 yr 1 cwrdm 1992 hence the efficiency of using organic and inorganic sources of nutrients added to the soil during the rainy season is very low in kerala all these factors lead to the high rate of soil degradation in the state and hence the agricultural lands are mostly deficient in nutrients resulting in low productivity the adoption of drip fertigation can simultaneously address both fertilizer and water applications resulting in improved crop productivity and enhancing the water and nutrient use efficiency surendran et al 2014 2017 jayakumar et al 2014 2015 2017 under drip fertigation it is possible to regulate the quantity of water and nutrients based on crop requirements however kerala s field level observations revealed that drip fertigation was not popular among farmers madhavachandran and surendran 2016 hence demonstrating drip fertigation technology at farmer s field will help to improve the adoption rate it is in this context that this work was done with the following objectives a to assess different application levels of nutrients on the growth and yield of okra by field experiment b to use field experiment data to calibrate the hydrus model c to use the calibrated model to prepare an optimal irrigation schedule for drip fertigation demonstration plots and d to carry out farmer managed demonstrations on drip fertigation in kerala and evaluate its performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment using okra for calibration and validation of hydrus a greenhouse experiment was carried out at cwrdm located in kozhikode district 110 17 22 n and 750 52 20 e to assess the impact of different methods of irrigation and graded levels of nutrients this was carried out in a rbd randomized block design with 7 treatments and 3 replications using three irrigation methods i e surface and subsurface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation via channel during the dry season the treatment details and experiment layout is provided in fig 1 the following graded nutrient levels were studied 75 t1 100 t2 and 125 t3 of the recommended dose of inorganic

consortia m s probio india p ltd to match with the recommended dose of fertilizers remaining doses were applied as basal application using farm yard manure fym n p and k quantity was rounded off to nearby whole number the drip irrigation system was designed according to standard procedures and design specifications the distance between the laterals was 1 2 m and the diameter of the laterals used was 16 mm single line of lateral consist of 30 drippers emitters with a spacing of 60 cm between the drippers in the beginning of each lateral to control water flow flow control valves using a tap system were installed inline drippers with a discharge rate of 2 lh 1 were used for irrigation with respect to sub surface drip irrigation also lateral consist of 30 drippers emitters with a spacing of 60 cm between the drippers were installed as per the treatment schedule this sub surface drip irrigation laterals were placed beneath the soil surface at a depth of 15 cm and plant geometry were similar to the surface drip irrigation required pressure of 101 325 kpa was maintained using 746 watts pump application efficiency considered for surface subsurface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation was 90 95 and 50 respectively sivanappan 1994 the quantity of water was calculated using the fao cropwat model fao 2009 which uses the penman monteith pm equation to calculate reference

the study location surendran et al 2019 application efficiency considered for surface subsurface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation was 90 95 and 50 respectively sivanappan 1994 specific area is the area of the plot in which the treatments were imposed soil moisture measurements were made at different depths after irrigation and then 24 48 and 72 h after irrigation using an mp 306 soil moisture sensor probe ict international ltd australia using standing wave principle of measurement the moisture measurements were taken both horizontally 0 25 and 50 cm from the drippers and vertically 0 15 30 and 45 cm depth using point measurement probe in addition few sets of continuous soil moisture probe along with data logger were also fixed to assess the soil moisture changes continuously using the data logger gravimetric soil moisture measurements were taken and used for calibration of the moisture probe for understanding the bulk density soil core samples undisturbed were taken from each soil layer and the mass of dry soil was divided by the bulk volume of soil in 3 replicates soil moisture differences 1 2 and 3 days after irrigation for different locations were analyzed using excel and instat software comparing the mean values for each treatment was performed using the lsd test at 1 and 5 significance levels okra seeds were planted during the last week of december crop growth parameters biometrics such as plant height number of internodes number of leaves leaf area and leaf area index lai were carried out 30 60 and 90 days after planting using standard procedures briefly plant height leaf length and leaf width are measured using a meter scale number of internodes and leaves are measured by counting plant height is the length measured from the ground level to the top of the maximally expanded leaf of the plant leaf length and leaf width of the plant is measured by considering the secondary fully developed leaf the fruit weight was determined at harvest picking was done after maturity and the total yield was calculated by combining all pickings all cultural practices including gap filling weeding plant protection measures and other practices were done based on the package of practices recommendations of kerala agricultural university kau 2016 soil samples were taken from different soil horizon in all the treatment plots up to a depth of 0 90 cm varying for different crops using a soil auger from different points the samples were processed as per the standard procedure and larger particles than 2 mm were removed with a sieve and then used for analysis in the soil laboratory of the water management agriculture division of cwrdm kozhikode for the parameters listed in table 2 using standard analytical procedures similarly stage wise plant samples have also been collected and kept for nutrient uptake pattern analysis n p and k content in plant parts were analyses using standard analytical procedures table 2 and expressed as percentage on dry weight basis and computed to kg ha 1 precipitation soil water contents wetting patterns emission uniformity crop biometrics post harvest soil fertility and yield attributes were studied using standard procedures surendran et al 2017 the data on irrigation and soil water contents were used to calibrate the hydrus model the calibrated model was then used to develop irrigation schedules for drip fertigation demonstration plots the various growth yield and quality parameters were recorded at appropriate stages using standard procedures in stat software version 3 36 were used for statistical analysis and for estimating average standard errors and for identifying the statistical significance using anova tests 2 2 description of the hydrus model windows based software package hydrus 2d model was used in the current study simunek et al 2016 this model simulates solute and water movement of variably saturated media porous in a two dimensional 2 d way using different numerical and mathematical techniques many researchers evaluated the software and analyzed its potential to predict simulate water and nutrient movement from different methods of drip irrigation e g skaggs et al 2004 kandelous and simunek 2010 simunek et al 2016 the hydrus model explains and uses numerically the richards equation for both saturated and unsaturated flow of water apart from using

domain was a rectangular domain 100 cm wide and 45 cm deep water infiltration and redistribution under surface drip irrigation was modeled using the hydrus 2d software the location of the semicircle as mentioned in fig 3 in the domain indicates the position of the emitter initial conditions were fixed as constant water level equal to the soil s field capacity based on the soil physical property analysis using the pressure plate apparatus in the process of irrigation at the emitter a time variable flux boundary condition was used the water flux was estimated by water discharge divided with the surface area of the dripper hydraulic parameters were estimated from the soil texture percentage of clay silt and sand and bulk density using the rosetta software implemented into hydrus the emitter boundary become an atmospheric boundary at the end of the irrigation event a time variable boundary condition was used in hydrus 2d to simulate irrigation events depending on irrigation water requirements during irrigation and no irrigation periods the no flux boundary condition was fixed on the vertical side of soil profile s boundaries because the soil water movement is symmetrical along these boundaries the bottom boundary was fixed as free drainage boundary condition an atmospheric boundary condition was used at the soil surface and an evaporation flux based on the calculated et values using the cropwat model was considered during and after irrigation field observed data of soil water contents were matched with the simulated values by the hydrus model for surface drip irrigation at different soil depths both horizontally and vertically from the dripper emitter 2 2 1 details about the demonstration plots the details about the drip fertigation demonstration plots are given in table 3 the project was implemented in collaboration with the agriculture department of the government of kerala the department assisted cwrdm in identifying farmers plots for the demonstration project and helped in arranging farmers for the seminars workshop and field visits organized at the plots the selected plots were initially assessed for water and power availability based on the field conditions a suitable system of drip fertigation was designed installation of the system was carried out at the demonstration plots and training was provided to the farmers to operate the drip fertigation system in all 21 plots farmers were asked to manage the other field operations starting from land preparation sowing weeding intercultural operations and harvesting according to their standard practice the project was considered to be a farmer managed demonstration in a participatory mode the fertigation schedule was prepared by considering the experimental plot s soil test values and crop requirements soil samples were taken from different soil horizon and up to a depth of 0 90 cm varying for different crops using a soil auger from different points from the plot 8 12 samples distributed over the entire field and then mixed into one composite sample the samples were processed as per the standard procedure as stated earlier in the experimental plot and larger particles than 2 mm were removed with a sieve and then used for analysis in the soil laboratory of the water management agriculture division of cwrdm kozhikode for the parameters listed in table 2 using standard analytical procedures all essential nutrients major and micronutrients were considered for fertigation depending upon the soil test values table 4 in most plots the organic carbon content was low and soils were sandy in texture see detailed characteristics in table 4 the drip fertigation technique was compared with the standard farmer s practice adopted and that was considered as control plot the methodology adopted for irrigation and fertigation scheduling was as follows water requirements of crops were estimated using the fao model cropwat and irrigation was provided at 100 of the crop water requirement crop characteristics used for the selected crops such as coconut banana brinjal are given in table 3 data on weather parameters were collected from the nearest agro meteorological station in each district similar to the experiment data here also et c was calculated by multiplying et 0 with the crop coefficient k c for the selected crops at different growth stages and growing environments surendran et al 2014 2017 the wetting pattern was simulated using hydrus for all demonstration plots using their particular soil characteristics however in this manuscript only two demonstration plots are described brinjal vegetable plot in palakkad and a coconut plot in the thiruvananthapuram district of kerala the farmers were informed about the amount of water to be applied during each irrigation in most cases variations in the crops water requirements were regulated by increasing or decreasing the duration of irrigation volumetric water contents were measured in demonstration plots similar to the experiment with okra field observed data of soil moisture were compared with the hydrus model simulations data on nutrient status moisture content growth and crop yield parameters were collected from demonstration plots as described in the experimental plot surendran et al 2016 benefit cost ratio bcr was worked out for demonstration plots by using the formula suggested by palaniappan 1985 6 bcr gross return total cost of cultivation data collection was carried out for four years for coconut one plant and one ratoon crop two years for banana and two seasons for brinjal 2 3 water productivity details about the methodology for irrigation water requirements can be found in surendran et al 2016 and jayakumar et al 2017 water productivity is calculated based on the production of crops yield and its ratio with water use as per the treatment structure fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 total water used for each treatment were computed by adding on the quantum of water applied during each irrigation similarly for demonstration plots also this was computed water productivity 7 water productivity crop yield kg ha 1 total wate r used m 3 ha 1 kg m 3 2 4 statistical analysis the data collected from the experiment was subjected to statistical analysis and interpretation of data was done using the fischer s method of analysis of variance technique as described by gomez and gomez 1984 the level of significance used in f and t test was p 0 05 the mean values for main plot sub plot and interactions were separately subjected to duncan multiple range test dmrt using corresponding error mean sum of square and degrees of freedom with respect to post harvest soil fertility analysis of nutrients geo statistical analysis was conducted using the extension of arcgis 10 0 tool geo statistical analyst and it was carried out to produce the semi variograms using krigging for understanding the impact of spatial variability three statistical indicators were used to assess the validity of the model hydrus 2d software i e ae average error rmse root mean square error and the c eff coefficient of efficiency these three indicators were used to compare the actual and predicted or simulated values smaller values for errors indicate that the model fits the actual values well and vice versa the ae rmse and c eff were calculated using the standard equations 3 results and discussion 3 1 green house experiment data at cwrdm the results showed that different treatments influenced the yield significantly and 100 of rdif through surface drip irrigation provided the highest yield this was on par with the 100 of the rdif through subsurface drip irrigation and 125 rdif respectively fig 2 this showed that these three treatments did not differ significantly in yield the lowest yield was obtained with surface flood irrigation treatment control the yield improvement was 142 than the surface flood channel irrigation method and was statistically significant the soil moisture content did not varied in all drip fertigation treatments since irrigation was supplied daily but in the case of flood irrigation the crops might have been affected by moisture and nutrient availability since the irrigation interval was high the soil moisture status observed immediately after the drip and surface flood channel irrigation application is presented in fig 3 the results showed that immediately after irrigation the soil moisture content was relatively uniform across the root zone under both drip and flood irrigation however the soil moisture measurement at 3rd day after 48 hrs showed that the soil moisture content varied largely under flood irrigation and a reduction in moisture content was also observed but in the case of the drip irrigation even though a slight reduction was noticed it was relatively uniform across the root zone i e 45 cm both vertically and horizontally from plants furthermore soil moisture and soil temperature of the surface soil was monitored continuously with soil moisture probes at an interval of 30 min under both drip and flood irrigation using a data logger and continuous soil moisture probe one of the sample observation results are shown in fig 4 the results showed a reduction in the soil water content from 28 8 to 7 3 under flood irrigation on fourth day fig 3 during the first day moisture gradually decreased under both drip and flood irrigation however after that the water content under drip irrigation was maintained since under drip irrigation it was daily irrigation fig 3 similarly an increase in nutrient levels improved okra yield which was confirmed by the polynomial regression with an r 2 value of 0 98 however the yield improvement was not seen at 125 of the recommended dose of inorganic fertilizer rdif fig 5 confirms that the nutrient uptake was higher under drip irrigation with increased fertigation levels than under control in which flood irrigation was practiced the highest nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake was found with the 125 of the recommended dose rdf of npk and were statistically significant than under surface irrigation at all okra crop growth stages data are shown only for a post harvest stage even though the uptake was higher for 125 rdf it was statistically similar to 100 rdf and resulted in on par effect the uptake of p and k also had a similar pattern as that of uptake of nitrogen at different growth stages of crop and at harvest soil moisture largely determines the uptake of most of the plant essential nutrients since it influences the soil solution phase which governs the nutrient availability apart from its concentration in the soil in this study also soil water content and moisture levels were maintained because of the continuous supply of water through drip fertigation and in addition to the water nutrients were also applied resulting in optimal availability of both water and nutrients in the soil as per the requirement of the crop and thereby contributing for higher uptake of nutrients by the crop these factors resulted in higher biomass production and ultimately leading to higher crop productivity in addition to the above factors fertilizers were applied in split doses more frequent application in small doses which might have contributed for higher uptake and nutrient losses by other mechanisms such as leaching and volatilization is minimized thereby making them available continuously to the crop for its uptake the results showed that drip fertigation resulted in statistically significant higher yield than control soil application and this might be due to the higher uptake of nutrients increase in overall use efficiency of fertilizers fue of nutrients derived from fertilizer right source of fertilizers compared with control soil application of fertilizers jayakumar et al 2017 post harvest soil fertility data available n p k and organic carbon for the entire experimental plot obtained from soil analysis were interpolated by kriging using arcgis version 10 2 the results showed that fertigation created a gradient in nutrient availability within the treatments fig 6 the lowest value of available soil n was observed in the plot region of 75 of rdf inorganic npk and the highest value was observed in the treatment of 100 of rdf inorganic npk through subsurface drip irrigation this indicated that the quantity of fertilizers applied through fertigation influences the soil available n status similarly p k and carbon showed variation between treatments this confirms that the quantity of fertilizers applied through drip fertigation influences post harvest soil fertility post harvest soil available npk were higher in drip fertigated plots when compared with the surface irrigation and the soil application of fertilizers plot control the possible reason could be leaching of nutrients under flood irrigation compared to drip irrigation as mentioned earlier more frequent application of water and nutrients in smaller quantities through drip fertigation created favorable conditions making nutrients available in the soil to the maximum surendran et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2017 3 2 calibration and validation of hydrus for soil water distribution calibration and validation of hydrus were carried out using the okra experimental data the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated table 5 from texture of clay silt and sand and bulk density using a rosetta module a pedotransfer function module implemented in hydrus the accuracy of hydrus simulations was evaluated for water infiltration and redistribution in a sandy clay loam soil of the experimental field with okra under drip irrigation fig 7 shows simulated volumetric water contents for this field experiment 4 and 24 h after irrigation hydrus predictions and observed values were close to each other at the start of the drip irrigation i e when water starts infiltrating into the soil near to the dripper the soil water content in this region was higher than elsewhere in the soil profile and at that point the predicted and observed values matches precisely figs 8a and 8b however differences between measured and simulated water contents increased when the wetting front reaches far away from the dripper i e the drier soil after the end of irrigation soil water contents were measured at specified distances from the dripper and the data are depicted in fig 8a and b as mentioned earlier the correspondence between measured and simulated water contents was good at a location near the dripper rmse 1 349 ae 0 134 and c eff 0 81 when compared to that the predictability ws less at other distances from the dripper since it showed higher rmse ae and ceff values rmse 2 984 ae 0 346 and c eff 0 51 the possible reason for this is the uncertainty in soil hydraulic parameters predicted using the pedotransfer functions which cannot account for gravel larger size particles present in the field since the soil is of lateritic nature 3 3 soil wetting pattern in the drip fertigation demonstration plots using hydrus the input parameters used in hydrus for planning the irrigation scheduling in demonstration plots are given in table 6 similar to the okra experiment the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated table 5 from texture of clay silt and sand and bulk density using a rosetta module a pedotransfer function module available in hydrus this module of hydrus gives the hydraulic parameters of soil needed for simulation of water flow in an easy and quick manner the input parameters used in hydrus for planning the irrigation scheduling in demonstration plots are given in table 6 3 4 the demonstration plot with coconut in the thiruvananthapuram district the soil had a sandy texture with an available water capacity of 2 1 the soil wetting patterns for the coconut plot at thiruvananthapuram were simulated using hydrus and are presented in fig 9a irrigation using a dripper with a discharge of 4 liters per hour for 4 h resulted in the soil water content of about 0 38 cm3 cm3 the wetting patterns during irrigation and after irrigation of simulated by the model and observed values are shown in fig 9a and b water contents simulated by hydrus model were nearer to the observed water contents in the field and statistically also the ae rmse were less as expected for sandy soil the vertical flow was much faster than the horizontal flow the entire root zone down to the 120 cm depth reached this wetness level after just 4 hrs farmers are doubtful that whether 60 liters of water per palm per day may be sufficient to coconut or not surendran et al 2019 however this simulation analysis confirmed that this quantity of water was adequate and the entire effective root zone of 120 cm had the soil water content of 0 37 cm3 cm3 when the modeled results were explained to the farmers they felt convinced the same soil was then allowed to dry out and hydrus was used to study how soil moisture changes over the drying period the results showed that after one day i e 24 h the surface soil s water content nearly reached the wilting point of 0 04 cm3 cm3 and then continued decreasing over the next few days this indicates that this sandy soil requires daily irrigation to maximize the crop productivity of coconut accordingly daily drip irrigation has been adopted for this plot and trained the farmer to practice the same 3 5 the demonstration plot with vegetables in the palakkad district the soil had a sandy loam texture with an available water capacity of 8 7 the soil wetting patterns simulated for this plot using hydrus are presented in fig 9 when water infiltrated into the soil at the beginning of irrigation the soil water contents were higher close to the emitter than elsewhere water contents simulated by hydrus model were nearer to the observed water contents in the field the wetting patterns during irrigation and after irrigation of simulated by the model are shown in fig 10 a dripper with a discharge rate of 2 liters per hour irrigating for 45 min resulted in a soil water content of about 0 39 cm3 cm3 the same soil profile was then allowed to dry out to determine how soil moisture changes over time during the drying period the results show that after one day i e 24 h after irrigation the surface soil water content is 0 18 cm3 cm3 by the end of the next day the soil water content is 0 11 cm3 cm3 reaching the wilting point and then decreases further observed soil moisture data showed a close correlation with model predicted values this indicates that this soil requires daily irrigation to maximize crop productivity of vegetables based on this finding the recommendation of daily irrigations was made for this demonstration plot 3 6 statistical validation of hydrus in demonstration plots soil water contents were also observed and simulated using hydrus for different soil depths in experimental and demonstration plots fig 11 the results showed a close correlation between observed and model predicted values except for a few points the regression analysis was carried out to quantify the agreement statistically and the regression coefficient r 2 0 81 0 87 between observed and predicted volumetric water content suggests that the model is valid fig 12 the model performance in simulating water contents of the soil was assessed by comparing the measured and predicted values the values of ae and rmse were 0 184 and 1 759 respectively for the demonstration sites of thiruvanthapuram alappuzha palakkad and thrissur the rmse values were 0 179 1 689 0 184 and 3 456 respectively and the ae were 0 148 0 124 0 112 and 0 231 respectively these low values of ae and rmse indicate that the actual and simulated values of water contents were very close the output from the current study falls in agreement with the findings of many other studies for example kandelous and simunek 2010 reported that hydrus 2d model predicts well the soil water contents in the soil profile under drip irrigation in laboratory and field conditions phogat et al 2013 also reported that water contents predicted with hydrus 3d matched statistically well with the observed data from the lysimeter experimental plot planted with orange tree in this study the coefficient of efficiency or the model s efficiency was equal to 59 under field conditions even though the efficiency is little lower probably this might be due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties in the field because the presence of gravels in it however it can be concluded that the simulated and observed soil water content is optimal and suggested to practice for field implementation in some cases as evident from figs 11 to 12 very low soil water contents and values at greater distances from the dripper were slightly over or under estimated possibly due to different factors such as presence of gravels in the field because of lateritic soil difference in rate of decomposition organic matter soil crust and cracks etc khaledian et al 2009 chen et al 2020 these studies confirmed that if the input data e g hydraulic attributes of the soil boundary conditions initial for the hydrus model are satisfactorily provided the model predicted data will be more accurate simunek et al 2016 the water contents observed in the field and the water contents predicted by the hydrus 2d model followed a similar pattern depending on the soil physical properties wetting pattern shape simulations with hydrus 2d were acceptable with lower values of rmse and significant r 2 fig 12 from this experiment it can be stated that hydrus 2d model predicts the soil wetting patterns in a acceptable manner and could be selected for predicting soil water contents wetting patterns and irrigation schedules based on this hydrus 2d in combination with cropwat can be used as a predictive model for new locations to have a preliminary understanding and also for design of suitable drip irrigation technology systems for irrigation 3 7 yield and profit from demonstration plots the yield data obtained from selected demonstration plots are shown in table 7 reported mean yield data for coconut were collected over four years for banana for one plant and one ratoon crop and for vegetables for two seasons an increase in yield under drip fertigation demonstration plots in comparison to the control plots soil application of nutrients and flood irrigation may be attributed to the better availability of nutrients and its uptake resulting in higher photosynthesis growth of leaves and mobilization of nutrients to sink source to sink frequent supply of nutrients by drip fertigation resulted in their enhanced availability to the crops this coupled with sufficient soil moisture resulted in increased nutrient absorption by the crop in the formation and mobilization of assimilates from source to reproductory parts sink and yielding higher productivity under fertigation drip fertigation i e supply of nutrients through drip irrigation systems has been reported to improve the productivity yield of several crops water productivity wp uptake of nutrients and fue fertilizer use efficiency surendran et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2014 2015 irrigation systems such as drip irrigation allow frequent small doses of fertilizer injections at timely intervals without much labor cost there by risk of leaching can be reduced to a larger extent or even nil compared to fertilizers given through a single bulk application this may have been the possible reason for the improvement in post harvest soil fertility status of these soils data not shown nutrient applications through drip fertigation improved the crop yield of all demonstration plots an increase in yield over the control ranged from 13 to 317 some of the yield data not shown the reasons for low yield under control plots surface irrigation with soil application of fertilizers are decrease in photosynthetic activity metabolites and reduction in absorption and mobilization of nutrients from the soil to the plant i e the beneficial effects observed under drip fertigation may not exist here shen et al 2020 usually under flood irrigation the crops used to face excess moisture at the initial days and stress after few days after irrigation because of the wider irrigation interval resulting in reduced cell division and cell elongation and affecting all the physiological activities and ultimately leading to low production in an experiment of deficit irrigation ali et al 2018 in contrast during the initial period of flood irrigation also the crop will be suffering from excess moisture and lack of oxygen which will hamper the nutrient absorption processes hence this intermittent stress due to lack of moisture excess moisture and lack of aeration and non availability of nutrients might be the causative factor for low yield this is in accordance with few earlier studies on micro irrigation methods which showed higher yield under drip irrigation than the sprinkler and surface flood irrigation smith et al 1991 kamilov et al 2003 jayakumar et al 2014 3 8 water productivity and n use efficiency data from the greenhouse field experiment with okra showed the highest water productivity wp under drip fertigation while the lowest wp was registered in conventional control flood irrigation table 8 a similar improvement in water productivity was also observed in demonstration plots data not shown drip irrigation of coconut proved to be an economically efficient irrigation method saving 34 of water compared to basin irrigation in kerala s lateritic soils dhanapal et al 2003 2004ab studies by nagwekar et al 2006 and nainanayake et al 2008 also indicate that drip irrigation can save about 45 50 of water compared to surface irrigation without any significant yield reduction one additional hectare can be brought under irrigation with the saved water thereby increasing farmers net income data from the greenhouse field experiment with okra similarly showed the highest n use efficiency for 100 of rdif under subsurface drip fertigation t6 comparable with that for 100 of rdif under surface drip irrigation t2 the lowest n use efficiency was recorded for the control t7 conventional flood irrigation table 7 this is in agreement with many earlier findings which showed improvements in water productivity and nutrient use efficiency for drip fertigation smith et al 1991 janat and somi 2002 kamilov et al 2003 jayakumar et al 2014 jayakumar et al 2017 sandhu et al 2019 higher water productivity and nutrient use efficiency for drip fertigation compared to flood irrigation were mainly due to saving irrigation water losses through percolation and evaporation were minimized under drip fertigation and timely application of nutrients using a split application improving the biomass production drip fertigation has been reported to minimize n losses through leaching and denitrification due to small n doses in several splits and less irrigation surendran et al 2016 sandhu et al 2019 increases in wp and nutrient use efficiency result from both an increase in yield and saving in irrigation water while in the studies with coconut in kerala mentioned earlier dhanapal et al 2003 dhanapal et al 2004a dhanapal et al 2004b there was a reduction in yield under some drip irrigation treatments in this study the yield improved the possible reason may be that only drip irrigation without fertigation was practiced in most of the studies another possible reason might be due to over excess irrigation without carefully designed irrigation schedules for the drip irrigation with reference to specific crop and soil type however in this study drip fertigation with frequent split doses of nutrients resulted in higher productivity and the saving of chemical fertilizers ensuring higher efficiency of water and nutrients under coconut since coconut is a perennial crop this long term study confirms that drip fertigation will improve crop and water productivity all other crops have responded in a similar way with respect to improvement in the crop and water productivity the maximum benefit cost ratio bcr was obtained for the drip fertigation demonstration plots compared with the control plots table 8 drip fertigation noticeably influenced the mean net returns and the bcr banana registered the maximum net returns 399 408 rs ha 1 and bcr of 3 50 whereas the control demonstration plot of banana registered a net return of only 248 332 rs ha 1 with bcr of 2 82 the drip fertigation demonstration plots have clearly indicated that higher economic returns and profitability can be achieved by drip fertigation irrespective of the difference in various parameters madhavachandran and surendran 2016 4 conclusions different application levels of nutrients on the growth and yield of okra was evaluated by drip fertigation mainly to assess the impact of drip fertigation on crop and water productivity in addition farmer managed demonstrations on drip fertigation in kerala were also caried out and evaluated its performance the greenhouse experiment results showed that the yield was 142 higher than for the surface flood channel irrigation method and the difference was statistically significant the results also confirmed that soil moisture under drip irrigation was uniformly distributed within the root zone i e 45 cm both vertically and horizontally from the plants on the other hand the water content was comparatively low under flood irrigation and there were greater variations in soil moisture within the root zone of plants this experimental data was used for calibration and validation of hydrus volumetric soil water contents calculated with the hydrus model showed an agreeable match according to rmse ae ce and r 2 with measured values at different lateral and vertical distances from the emitter throughout the soil profile during the establishment stage of irrigation similarly soil water contents simulated using hydrus for the selected demonstration plots and observed values were also in close agreement drip fertigation water and nutrient application improved the crop productivity in all the demonstration plots an increase in yield over the control flood irrigation ranged from 13 to 317 crop biometrics yield attributes and yields were significantly influenced by drip fertigation compared to the conventional practice in all demonstration plots the benefit cost ratio under the drip fertigation demonstration plots ranged from 2 05 to 3 50 for selected crops the novelty of the current study is that this is the first time the hydrus model was utilized to implement field irrigation scheduling with farmers participatory approach it is concluded that the adoption of drip fertigation with precise irrigation and nutrient management simulated using the hydrus model will improve the crop and water productivity besides ensuring higher efficiency of nutrients and thereby maintaining soil fertility environmental sustainability and economically profitable farming in

chaudhary and hantush 2017 besides conflict between increasing demand and limited supply for environmental capacity has intensified the competition among pollution sources which brings about detrimental pressures on efficient water quality management traditional command and control cac instruments can be efficient when emission standards are chosen however the costs of achieving effluent limits for pollution sources can vary substantially between cases identical environmental penalties risk discouraging innovation and fail to provide continuous incentives to reduce pollution effluent trading potentially achieves optimal configuration for discharge permits by encouraging transition of permits from low to high value uses it has potential to provide flexibility and incentives to adopt pollution abatement and gain in economic efficiency for agricultural watersheds corrales et al 2017 horan and shortle 2017 zhang et al 2019 system analysis provides a powerful means for optimal

example gunawardena et al 2018 proposed a hydro economic model combining an economic optimization model with a hydrological model a cost effective effluent trading policy was determined xu et al 2020 optimized cropland use and non agricultural production levels using effluent trading and controlled the total emission quantity through a robust optimization model in real world problems the trading effort is often restricted by inherent uncertainties due to randomness of natural processes e g precipitation pollutant loadings decisions thus have to be made in the face of an uncertain and risky future a number of stochastic mathematical programming methods are thus developed zeng et al 2017 archibald and marshall 2018 for example two stage stochastic programming tsp provides an effective nexus between the economic activities and the associated environmental penalties through introducing a recourse action zeng et al 2015 2018 nematian 2016 li et al 2019 multistage stochastic programming generalizes the two stage problem to a sequence of recourse decisions torres rincÃ³n et al 2021 dual stochastic programming tackles multiple uncertainties expressed as dual intervals and probability distributions gao et al 2018 chance constrained programming ccp reflects the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints under random uncertainty ma et al 2020 the random of pollutant loading derives from random and heterogeneous factors such as precipitation and surface runoff it can lead to system risks such as economic and excess effluent risks economic risk denotes risk of system benefit loss due to high average value of pollutant loading excess effluent risk denotes risk of system benefit loss due to the variability of pollutant loading however traditional stochastic programming methods can be restricted when the decision maker is risk averse under multiple system risks risk control analysis methods ram provide an attractive approach to deal with the above shortcomings they are widely used to include risk aversion in optimization process in pollution control and water resources management they include downside risk theory xie et al 2018 value at risk naserizade et al 2018 conditional value at risk yazdi et al 2016 chance constrained programming alizadeh et al 2018 robust optimization song et al 2019 and financial risk management barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a 2004b among them financial risk management and robust optimization both account for system risks due to random loadings specifically financial risk management addresses economic consequences of high pollutant emission it controls the production scales and reduces the related pollutant discharge to avoid the huge losses incurred after the high excess pollutant discharge occurs liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 robust optimization can further consider the variability of pollutant loading with a variance term this could keep the actual environmental discharge of the realized scenario close to the optimal discharge ahmed and sahinidis 1998 kara and onut 2010 he et al 2020 if the consideration of system risks is lacking economic and excess effluent risks may pose great challenges to efficient decision making nevertheless no comprehensive analysis based on multi risk aversion and management is reported in supporting effluent trading planning therefore this study first conducts a comprehensive analysis of optimal effluent trading considering multi risk aversion for an agricultural watershed bayesian dual risk aversion based stochastic programming bdrsp is developed to achieve this innovation bdrsp incorporates bayesian based nutrient fate simulation dual risk aversion based stochastic programming drsp multi dimensional risk analysis for nutrient pollution and risk management bdrsp is applied to a real case of daguhe watershed china the objectives are i investigating the effect of dual risks i e economic and excess effluent risks on trading system and ii disclosing the optimal risk management schemes considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its spatial pattern 2 methodology the steps involved in bayesian dual risk aversion based stochastic programming bdrsp are illustrated in fig 1 2 1 swat based on bayesian inference the bayesian paradigm can help generate posterior probability density functions pdfs

maximize the average normalized jumping distance in each chain vrugt et al 2009 the detailed principles for nutrient simulation based on swat are provided in appendix a 2 2 dual risk aversion based stochastic programming effluent trading planning needs to address incomplete data due to inexact factors this inexactness can be expressed using interval numbers and trade can be optimized using interval parameter programming ipp in addition two groups of decision variables exist in effluent trading planning the first stage decision variables are economic activity scales that are determined before the realizations of random pollutant discharges the second stage decision variables are excess pollutant loadings which are of random characteristics environmental penalties can be calculated with the excess loadings which are recourse actions against violation of discharge permit due to particular realizations of the random pollutant discharges two stage stochastic programming tsp can deal with such complexities therefore by introducing the ipp an inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp model can be formulated as follows zhang et al 2019 2a max f i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k d j y j k subject to 2b i 1 n 1 a r i x i b r r 1 2 m 1 2c i 1 n 1 a t i x i j 1 n 2 a t j y j k w t 1 2 m 2 k 1 2 k 2d x i 0 i 1 2 n 1 2e y j k 0 j 1 2 n 2 k 1 2 k where superscripts and represent the lower and upper bounds of the interval parameters respectively f is the expected system benefit over the planning horizon x i are economic activity scales which are first stage decision variables e g crop area livestock production area of fisheries y j k represent excess pollutant loadings which are second stage decision variables c i and d j denote the sets of coefficients in the objective function e g net benefit for production of agriculture animal husbandry and fishery penalties per ton of excess loading a r i b r a t i a t j are sets of parameters in the constraints e g pollutant generation rate allowance of pollutant emission w are discharge permits after trading program the probability level h k measures the probability of pollutant loading k is the number of probability levels i and j denote the pollution sources n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of i and j and n 1 can be equal to n 2 t and r are indices of constraints model 2a is the objective function that maximizes the system benefit considering the first stage economic activity targets and the second stage recourse actions model 2b provides limitations for the first stage variables of effluent trading planning i e the emission allowance restricts the pollutant loadings and the associated economic activity scales model 2c describes relations between variables of the two stages i e the excess pollutant loadings are calculated with the loadings related to first stage variables that exceed the discharge permit after trading because pollutant loadings are random the excess pollutant loadings can take discretization values under different probability levels h k after their probability density functions are known model 2d and 2e can ensure that all the variables in effluent trading planning are nonnegative model 2 searches for optimal first and second stage variables to maximize the system benefit the optimization process balances the decision variables of the two stages the economic activity scales can be corrected by decision makers against the violation of discharge permit through the recourse actions the itsp can be converted into two submodels corresponding to lower and upper bounds of the objective function values as recommended in huang and loucks 2000 interval solutions can then be obtained by solving the two submodels sequentially in practical effluent trading pollutant loadings may vary with time due to their randomness thus the associated environmental penalty can be high the itsp does not reflect any control for risk caused by random pollutant loading such a benefit would be lower than the expectation of the decision makers who would rather obtain less money with lower economic activity than bear the huge losses incurred after the excess pollutant discharge occurs thus a financial risk management strategy is introduced to deal with the economic risk as follows barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a zeng et al 2017 3 r i s k k x Î· p b k x Î· 4 b k x i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k k 1 2 k where b k x is the actual benefit i e the benefit has been obtained after the uncertainty being unveiled under scenario k Î· denotes the targeted benefit p is the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit under scenario k the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit can describe an individual scenario it can also describe a set of scenarios the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit can be expressed as 5 r i s k x Î· k 1 k r i s k k x Î· k 1 k p b k x Î· in design of any scenario if the benefit is either greater than or equal to the target level the corresponding probability is zero otherwise it would be 1 thus the definition of risk can be rewritten as follows 6 r i s k x Î· k 1 k h k v k x Î· 7 v k x Î· 0 if i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· 1 otherwise k 1 2 k where v k is a binary variable defined for each scenario k the financial risk management strategy is designed as follows barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a 8a i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· u b k v k k 1 2 k 8b i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· u b k 1 v k k 1 2 k 8c k 1 k h k v k Îµ 8d v k x Î· 0 if i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· 1 otherwise k 1 2 k where Îµ is the allowable risk exposure level which is used to change the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit level Î· when Îµ is raised v k will be permitted to be equal to one under more scenarios this can be expressed by model 8c and 8d then actual benefit i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k will be less than the targeted benefit level i e i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· thus production scale and the related pollutant discharge can be decreased to reduce the system risk this process can be expressed by model 8b an upper bound benefit under each scenario u b k is used in model 8a to provide a lower limit for the actual benefit when v k 0 under certain scenarios i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k would be either greater than or equal to Î· this process can be expressed by model 8a model 8b then is designed to provide an upper limit for the actual benefit barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a parameters in model 8 are expressed with intervals with lower and upper bound value which corresponds to the two submodels of ipp method respectively financial risk management addresses economic consequence of high excess effluent through controlling production scale first stage variables and reducing pollutant discharge however the reduced pollutant discharge still remains random characteristics and the variability of excess effluent exists thus the associated environmental penalty may be highly variable robust optimization can further consider the higher moments of the pollutant loading distribution through introducing a variance term to control the variability of excess effluent second stage variables the variance term is formulated as 9 varianceterm Ï j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k v j k Ï j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k d j y j k k 1 k h k d j y j k where Ï is a goal programming weight through varying the Ï level the decision maker can then control the variability of excess effluent v j k is positive deviation of a given scenario k s penalty from the recourse penalty for pollution source j the variance term can be included in the objective function to control the variability of excess effluent therefore based on financial risk management strategy robust optimization and itsp a dual risk aversion based stochastic programming drsp for effluent trading planning can be formulated as follows 10a max f i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k d j y j k Ï j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k v

al 2020 the multi dimensional risk measures the spatial correlation of nutrient pollution and is considered in a comprehensive evaluation for selecting the optimal risk management schemes the use of the copula function reduces the modelling of an arbitrary multivariate distribution to two steps the estimation of marginal distributions and the description of the dependence structure of marginals via an appropriate copula function sklar s theorem states that any n dimensional distribution function f can be formulated through its continuous marginal distributions and a copula function c which is expressed as follows sklar 1959 fan et al 2016 li et al 2020 11 f u 1 u 2 u n c f x 1 u 1 f x 2 u 2 f x n u n where f x 1 u 1 f x 2 u 2 f x n u n are marginal distributions of random vectors u 1 u 2 u n the widely applied copula classes include gaussian normal copula student s t copula and archimedean copulas student s t copulas and gaussian copulas are generally applicable to describe random variables with symmetrical tail dependence while t copulas also describe random variables with heavy tails kim and jung 2016 archimedean copulas are easily derived and are capable of capturing wide ranges of dependence i e lower or upper tail dependences in this study three single parameter bivariate archimedean copulas i e clayton frank and gumbel hougaard copulas are considered borgomeo et al 2015 the clayton copula is asymmetric meaning that it exhibits greater dependence for values at the lower tail of the distribution the frank copula on the other hand is symmetric it shows the same dependence at both ends of the distribution the gumbel hougaard copula exhibits greater dependence in the upper tail of the distribution tosunoglu and onof 2017 rehana and dhanya 2018 the clayton copula is 12 c u 1 u 2 Î¸ u 1 Î¸ u 2 Î¸ 1 1 Î¸ where Î¸ 1 0 is the parameter of the clayton copula the frank copula is 13 c u 1 u 2 Î¸ 1 Î¸ ln 1 e Î¸ u 1 1 e Î¸ u 2 1 e Î¸ 1 where Î¸ 0 is the

akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are used to evaluate the performance of the theoretical joint cumulative distributions obtained using copula functions karmakar and simonovic 2009 more details of the three measures are provided in appendix b 3 case study 3 1 overview of the study system dagu river being the green ecological defense of qingdao is the largest river of all the rivers entering jiaozhou bay it flows through laixi pingdu jiaozhou and jimo counties with a length of more than 150 km daguhe watershed is located between latitudes of 36 10 n 37 12 n and longtitudes of 120 03 e 120 25 e with a total area of 6131 3 km2 accounting for 45 of the total area of qingdao chen et al 2010 li et al 2018 fig 2 the region has an average annual precipitation of 707 4 mm and an average annual temperature of 10 11 with a warm temperate coastal humid monsoon climate brown soil tidal soil and sandy ginger and black soil are the main soil types liao et al 2010 as an agricultural watershed daguhe watershed has the main industries of planting industry animal husbandry and fishery nutrients including nh3 n and tp from these sources pollute the river and lead to eutrophication in jiaozhou bay ocean and fishery administration of qingdao 2018 3 2 modeling formulation according to the designated functional zones and channel characteristics dagu river is segmented into four sections which are marked i to iv in fig 2 the planning horizon is one year which is sorted into two periods nonflood season november to may of the following year and flood season june to october multiple main crops are considered associated with different fertilizer application irrigation cost and agricultural benefit they are wheat corn peanut cabbage celery carrot potato apple pear peach and grape pigs poultry dairy cattle and cows are the main livestock breeding species ten main pollution sources along the river are involved in effluent trading including three fishery zones four planting zones and three livestock breeding zones nh3 n is considered and its transport behavior will be predicted with swat with mcmc in real world problems downstream sources can pose greater pollution consequences than upstream sources due to river self purification trading ratio is introduced to account for this issue and ensure an equivalent environmental effect after trading the trading ratio is defined as the number of units of pollutant reduction a source must purchase from the other source in order to receive a discharge permit for one unit increase in its load hung and shaw 2005 mesbah et al 2009 in this study trading ratios are estimated according to zonal based trading ratios ztr proposed by zhang et al 2013 according to zhang et al 2013 the trading ratios are greater than one for upstream dischargers who sell permits to downstream ones downstream dischargers would obtain less discharge permits than their purchase amount with trading ratios larger than one then pollution from upstream and downstream sources can have equivalent environmental effects ztrs are smaller than one when an upstream discharger buys discharge permits from a downstream discharger this can allow concentration of permits and lead to risk of hot spots for example when an upstream discharger purchase 1 ton of permit from a downstream discharger it would receive 1 25 tons of permit with a trading ratio of 0 8 this means more pollution can be emitted which can violate the allowance in the trading ratio system designed by hung and shaw 2005 effluent tradings from downstream to upstream are not allowed because there is no trading ratio for such kinds of trades this could hinder the effluent trading market scale therefore trading ratios for trading from downstream to upstream are assumed to be one the environmental allowance can then remain strict and water quality of the watershed can be improved in this study the pollutant discharges from nonpoint sources are conceptualized as random due to two reasons a randomness exist in pollutant discharge of practical effluent trading nonpoint source pollutants fluctuate and are difficult to be traced they enter the receiving water over an extensive area with sporadic time frames and are influenced by random factors such as precipitation and surface runoff b the measured and deterministic value represent the processes that have occurred and cannot support effluent trading design and risk management for the planning year thus the random characteristic of pollutant discharges are analyzed through uncertain simulation based on measured data and provided to the proposed bdrsp for effluent trading planning the random nutrient discharge forms two types of risk i e economic and excess effluent risks bdrsp can deal with the two risks by incorporating financial risk management and robust optimization in addition water quality of adjacent sub watersheds are closely related due to the correlation of their meteorological and hydrological processes specifically nutrient loss from upstream land use will flow along the river and cause water degradation in downstream discharges from local point sources may spread over a large area through river networks such correlation leads to the transmission and accumulation of water quality issue among watersheds bdrsp can analyze multi dimensional risk for nutrient pollution the bdrsp can be formulated as follows 15a m a x i 1 4 j 1 11 t 1 2 a b j x i j Î´ x o i j t n 1 3 r 1 4 t 1 2 w r n n r Î´ n m n r t p 1 3 t 1 2 s b p z p Î´ z

participating in permit trading as well as excess effluent risk thus the optimal scheme is obtained with economic benefit being maximized as well as total discharges and the related risk for all pollution sources being minimized the higher moments of the random loading distribution and decision maker s preferences toward risk are considered in obtaining the optimal objective the constraints of bdrsp can be categorized into the following seven groups a constraints for trading rules 15b a c e n i t t n i i t a 1 3 t n a i t t n a i t n i a t n 1 3 t n b n i t t n n i t n s i n t p 1 3 t n

series of general meteorological data with regard to model inputs are required for watershed hydrological and water quality simulation they include daily rainfall data as well as maximum and minimum temperature during the period of 1991 2018 the meteorological data were collected from china meteorological data service center the physical characteristics flow direction and hydrographic network were derived from digital elevation model dem the dem data set was obtained from geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn with a resolution of 90 m land use data sets for the years 2000 2010 and 2018 were provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn the soil map of 1 1 million was collected from soil and terrain soter database zhang and zhao 2008 the related economic data for each pollution source which are expressed as interval values due to the uncertainties in the gained information were collected from historical records e g qingdao statistical yearbook and by field investigation allowances of nh3 n emission for tributaries and main stream of dagu river industries as well as the whole watershed were collected from environmental protection plan of dagu river basin and local researches yang 2010 allowances of nh3 n emission provide total quantities for initial allocation of discharge permits the initial permits of planting zones livestock breeding zones and fishery zones are determined based on their weight coefficients production scale pollutant emission economic and ecological benefit of all zones are considered to calculate their weight coefficients 4 results and discussion 4 1 uncertain simulation for nh3 n loading swat model using bayesian inference to estimate parameters is used for uncertain prediction of nh3 n loading sensitivity analysis with latin hypercube is implemented for 37 parameters in modeling nutrient loading these parameters represent important processes of hydrology sediment and water quality such as surface runoff soil water groundwater soil erosion and nitrogen cycle the sensitivities of swat model parameters are described by t stat and p values which is illustrated in fig 3 t stat provides a measure of sensitivity with larger absolute values indicating more sensitive parameters p values determine the significance of the sensitivity a value close to zero is more statistically significant the results imply that overland flow generation soil water nitrogen cycle groundwater water routing peak runoff and nutrient uptake by plants are the most important processes for modeling nh3 n loading in daguhe watershed the top ten parameters of the sensitivity ranking are involved in bayesian inference with dream algorithm for parameter uncertainty analysis they are presented in table 1 the prior densities are assumed to be uniform over their limit value ranges to represent vague prior knowledge the uncertainty analysis is performed in the calibration period with the monthly nh3 n loading data from 2002 to 2006 the validation period is from 2007 to 2009 and the prediction period is from 2010 to 2025 in this study parameters are estimated with eight markov chains containing 20 000 iterations for each parameter the first 10 of which are removed as burn in period gelman rubin criterion involves both the between chain variance and the within chain variance gelman rubin criterion is used to diagnose if each parameter converges to a stationary distribution gelman and rubin 1992 the r statistic for the markov chains of the ten parameters is also presented in table 1 the results indicate that all the chains converge the markov chains and posterior distributions for the ten parameters are illustrated in fig 4 parameters markov chains are beside their posterior distributions from the results parameters posterior distributions are different from their prior distributions besides almost all the posterior distributions are not normally distributed associated with obvious skewness several posterior distributions appear to be bimodal such as the distributions of cn2 gwqmn ch k2 the results indicate that posterior distributions of almost all parameters would spread over a wide range within their limit value ranges this may be because of limited monthly nh3 n loading data for the calibration this would lead to more accepted candidate points in the implementation of dream algorithm fig 5 depicts the 95 ci confidence interval of monthly nh3 n loading due to parameter uncertainty for years of 1991 2025 parameter uncertainty is analyzed based on the monthly data for nh3 n loading from 2002 to 2012 from xielaqiao gauge station which is highlighted with red circles 51 22 of monthly observed loading and 70 of annual data are within the uncertainty range which is deemed to provide sufficient performance of nh3 n loading for this demonstration log pearson type iii gamma generalized extreme value and the 2 parameter lognormal distributions are used to fit the pdfs of lower and upper bounds of nh3 n loading s 95 ci i e 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles from the results a generalized extreme value distribution is found to be the best fit for each of the two time series the cumulative probability distribution functions cdfs are also presented in fig 5 the discretization values of nh3 n loading provide input i e e k in constraint 15 e for effluent trading planning with statistical analysis 4 2 optimal trading scheme the trading ratios are estimated based on the uncertain simulation through calculating ratio between environmental damages at the watershed outlet that are caused by two sources table 2 presents the trading ratio among different pollution sources the optimal trading schemes including optimal economic activity scales first stage variables annual excess nh3 n loading second stage variables optimal buying and selling processes under different risk levels are disclosed in this section fig 6 illustrates optimized production scale of planting zone livestock breeding zone and fishery zone different economic risk levels i e Îµ and excess effluent risk levels i e Ï the production scales below economic risk level of 0 65 and excess effluent risk level of 0 6 are basically same besides the production scales for livestock breeding zone and fishery zone remain constant during both the flood and non flood seasons from the results dual risk levels would obviously influence the production scales production scales would generally decrease as risk levels are raised for example planting area in jiaozhou would be 112 007 and 93 607 under Îµ 0 Ï 0 and Îµ 0 75 Ï 0 7 under Îµ 1 Ï 1 the planting area would be 92 487 nonflood season and 93 134 flood season in addition the influence on planting and livestock breeding scale in pingdu and fishery scale in jiaozhou are most obvious for example when Ï is raised from 0 3 to 0 7 and Îµ is raised from 0 35 to 0 75 46 570 pingdu 0 529 jimo 18 390 jiaozhou and 0 laixi 103 ha of farmland would be reduced fig 7 illustrates cross industry effluent trading amount for nh3 n under different risk levels the positive value represents the amount of buyer s market the negative value represents the amount of seller s market the results indicate that trading schemes would change with different risk levels this implies that decision maker s attitude towards risk changes the behavior of purchase and sale besides compared with nonflood season more discharge permit would be traded during flood season for example when Îµ 0 25 and Ï 0 2 10 428 11 921 tons and 9 017 83 266 tons of permit would be sold to livestock breeding zones during nonflood season and flood season respectively this is because precipitation influences nh3 n discharge load from planting zone livestock breeding zone and fishery zone their emission ratios would be larger in flood season than those in nonflood season more trading would thus occur to reduce environmental cost from excess emissions in addition the trading amount for planting zone would be negative indicating that planting zone would be the main seller the results also indicate that livestock breeding zone would be the main buyer for example when Îµ 0 55 and Ï 0 5 under nonflood season the trading amount would be 2 218 13 348 ton 1 529 12 048 ton and 0 689 0 989 ton for planting zone livestock breeding zone and fishery zone respectively this is mainly because more initial permit is allocated to planting zones considering benefit and pollutant emission planting zones would have surplus permit during nonflood and flood seasons as shown by zero annual excess nh3 n loading in fig 8 the excess nh3 n loading denotes the difference between discharge permit and actual emission the results indicate that there would be few excess loading for planting zones this implies that their initial permit is sufficient such that they can sell the permit even in flood season when there is more discharge load in addition livestock breeding zones have potential to gain more benefit than fishery zones thus they would purchase more permits from planting zones fig 9 illustrates the detailed optimal buying and selling processes under different levels of economic and excess effluent risk the abbreviation of pollution sources is described in nomenclature colored ribbons denote the trading processes and the seller has the same color as the ribbon for example in plot a the green ribbon show the discharge permits that are sold from lxa to lxl from the results economic and excess effluent risks would have important impact on the detailed buying and selling processes in addition lxa pda and jza would be the main seller lxl and pdl purchase the most within the watershed for example when Îµ 0 65 and Ï 0 6 4 196 tons of discharge permit would be sold from lxa to lxl pdl would purchase 6 078 tons of permit from jza besides jzf and lxf are the main fishery buyers the average purchase amounts for the 16 risk levels are 0 417 ton 0 146 ton and 0 534 ton for lxf pdf and jzf respectively the result can be due to the higher yield as well as larger effluent emission of two fishery zones the calculation of benefit per ton of emission involves information about yield and effluent emissions the benefits per ton of emission can be calculated with the developed bdrsp which are provided by tables 3 and 4 the result indicates that the benefits per ton of emission of lxl and pdl are the largest in livestock breeding zones and jzf has the largest benefit per ton of emission in fishery zones from the results it can be implied that the pollution source with higher net benefit per ton of emission would become the main buyer 4 3 optimal risk management scheme the optimal risk management schemes are determined based on a comprehensive evaluation considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its multi dimensional risk fig 10 illustrates system benefit unit revenue and nh3 n loading under different economic and excess effluent risks from the results of plot a and b system benefit decreases as both the two risk levels are raised for example the system benefit would be 23 474 29 039 109 Îµ 0 Ï 0 19 864 26 203 109 Îµ 0 65 Ï 0 6 and 19 127 26 138 109 Îµ 1 Ï 1 rmb respectively this is mainly because raised economic risk reduces actual benefit a higher excess effluent risk level denotes an enforced robustness level and an increased risk control level this implies that the maximized benefit would be obtained when no risk control activity is conducted Îµ 0 Ï 0 the maximum is 23 474 29 039 109 rmb however the maximized benefit would not correspond to the optimal risk management scheme the details for nh3 n loading under different risk levels is presented in fig 10 c d from the results nh3 n loading would be decreased as both the two risk levels are raised for example the loading would be 1205 005 Îµ 0 Ï 0 1086 192 Îµ 1 Ï 0 1081 242 Îµ 1 Ï 1 ton respectively fig 10 e f illustrate unit revenues under different risk levels the unit revenues defined as the system benefit per ton of nh3 n loading is used to investigate the efficiency of effluent trading from the results the unit revenue affected by nh3 n loading shows different change patterns from system benefit the optimum upper bound unit revenue would be 24 200 106 rmb ton which would be obtained under Îµ 1 Ï 0 8 the optimum lower bound unit revenue would be 19 480 106 rmb ton which would be obtained under Îµ 0 Ï 0 in addition the results indicate that economic risk and excess effluent risk have interactive effects on the unit revenue under low excess effluent risk level high unit revenue would be obtained under low economic risk under high excess effluent risk level high unit revenue would be obtained under high economic risk for example when Ï 0 2 high unit revenue would be obtained under Îµ 0 which is 19 129 24 096 106 rmb ton when Ï 0 8 high lower bound unit revenue would be obtained under Îµ 0 65 i e 19 218 106 rmb ton high upper bound unit revenue would be obtained under Îµ 1 i e 24 200 106 rmb ton the results imply that higher unit revenue would be obtained under risk management schemes of low Îµ and low Ï or high Îµ and high Ï in detail low Îµ and low Ï levels correspond to high system benefit and high nutrient emission high Îµ and high Ï levels correspond to low benefit and pollution an ecological conservation redline has been established in daguhe watershed since 2018 the schemes of low Îµ and low Ï is not suitable for daguhe watershed risk management schemes of high economic and excess effluent risk levels are thus recommended due to high unit revenue and low pollution multi dimensional nh3 n pollution risk that measures spatial correlation of the risk has also been investigated to select the optimal risk management schemes nh3 n loadings at state controlled sections of mawanqiao and xielaqiao are predicted with swat based on the actual emissions under different economic and excess effluent risks then three archimedean copulas i e clayton frank gumbel hougaard are considered to quantify the dependence between the loadings at the two sections the most appropriate copulas would be chosen based on the results of rmse aic and bic as shown in table 5 mawanqiao is located in jiaodong town jiaozhou city and is used to monitor the water quality of dagu river after the confluence of south jiaolai river xielaqiao is located at the outlet of daguhe watershed and is used to monitor the pollutants discharged into the sea from the results clayton copula is the best fit copula function for all risk levels and the estimated parameter values are also provided in table 5 the joint probability based on clayton copula between nh3 n loadings at mawanqiao and xielaqiao is provided in fig 11 the x axis denotes nh3 n loading at mawanqiao 102 ton and y axis denotes nh3 n loading at xielaqiao 102 ton nh3 n loadings at the two stations are predicted based on pollutant discharge under different economic and excess effluent risks then joint exceedance probability i e p x x y y can be calculated based on the estimated copula to describe the probability of the two locations exceeding environmental capacity simultaneously which is illustrated in fig 12 from the results lower joint exceedance probability would be obtained under high economic and excess effluent risks for example the joint exceedance probability would be 0 514 Îµ 0 85 Ï 0 8 0 514 Îµ 0 85 Ï 1 0 491 Îµ 1 Ï 0 8 and 0 497 Îµ 1 Ï 1 the lowest joint exceedance probability would be 0 4908 when Îµ 1 Ï 0 8 this indicates that the joint exceeding probability would be controlled as dual risk levels are raised this is mainly because nutrient emissions from pingdu and laixi county would contribute nh3 n loading in mawanqiao nh3 n loadings from jimo and jiaozhou county would be transferred to the confluences that locate in the middle of mawanqiao and xielaqiao and then flow into the sea at xielaqiao raised risk levels would restrain the loadings from the four counties and the annual loading at mawanqiao and xielaqiao would thus be reduced the results imply that raised dual risk levels would not only reduce the nutrient loadings but also hinder the propagation of water pollution risk the optimal risk management schemes are determined based on topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution it measures the euclidean distance and aims at arriving at an alternative which is closest to the positive ideal solution pis and farthest from the negative ideal solution nis firstly the topsis is implemented for 36 dual risk levels including 6 economic risk levels and 6 excess effluent risk levels the performance of each dual risk level is evaluated considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its multi dimensional risk secondly the topsis is implemented for nine risk areas the performance of each risk area is evaluated considering the euclidean distances of 4 dual risk levels the results of the comprehensive evaluation are presented in table 6 the performance for a risk area is obtained integrating the four risk levels in the table the performance of a risk area are beside the performance of the risk level for example the euclidean distance for the first risk area i e 0 Îµ 0 25 0 Ï 0 2 is 0 574 from the results the optimal risk level is when Îµ 0 85 Ï 0 4 with the maximum euclidean distance being 0 704 the optimal two risk areas is when 0 85 Îµ 1 0 4 Ï 0 6 and 0 85 Îµ 1 0 8 Ï 1 with the largest two euclidean distance being 0 948 and 0 918 respectively effluent trading planning considering high economic and excess effluent risk control levels i e 0 85 Îµ 1 0 4 Ï 0 6 and 0 85 Îµ 1 0 8 Ï 1 is recommended table 7 presents the optimal risk management schemes including production scale pollution discharge and trading structure under the optimal risk control levels compared with scheme of risk neutral attitude i e Îµ 0 Ï 0 the production scale and the related pollution discharge for planting zones would be reduced by 6 573 12 414 nonflood season and 6 428 10 910 flood season the annual reduction would be 7 315 9 730 for planting zones 18 204 for livestock breeding zones and 6 222 for fishery zones respectively besides under optimal risk levels the trading structure would also be different from that of the risk neutral scheme from the results the proportion of cross industry trading would be increased by 2 052 7 516 nonflood season and 5 100 19 496 flood season and the proportion of intra industry trading would be decreased accordingly this is because cross industry trading can transit discharge permits to high value uses under the optimal risk levels when production scale and system benefit is reduced 5 conclusions in this study a bayesian dual risk aversion based stochastic programming bdrsp is proposed for selecting optimal trading and risk management schemes in an agricultural watershed bdrsp has advantages in i predicting nutrient transport behaviors from the propagation of model parameter uncertainties with dream ii analyzing specific variations of system benefit unit revenues nh3 n loading as well as its multi dimensional risk under the effect of dual risk iii disclosing the optimal buying and selling processes between every potential pair of sources iv selecting the optimal risk management schemes based on a comprehensive evaluation method bdrsp has been demonstrated through its application to the daguhe watershed in china the contributions lie in i obtaining optimal effluent trading schemes under the dual risks ii identifying multi dimensional risk of nutrient pollution based on joint probability distributions with copulas iii generating optimal risk management schemes considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its multi dimensional risk several findings can be revealed a planting zone would be the main seller and livestock breeding zone would be the main buyer pollution sources with higher net benefit per ton of emission would become the main buyer and the sources with surplus discharge permit would be the main seller b more discharge permit would be traded during flood season than that during nonflood season emission ratio would be larger during flood season c economic and excess effluent risks would have obvious impact on system benefit unit revenues nh3 n loading as well as its multi dimensional risk d higher unit revenue would be obtained when the two risk factors both take low or high levels and raised dual risk levels would not only reduce the nutrient loadings but also hinder the propagation of water pollution risk e the optimal risk management schemes under high economic and excess effluent risk control levels i e 0 85 Îµ 1 0 4 Ï 0 6 and 0 85 Îµ 1 0 8 Ï 1 are recommended specifically the recommendations for the policy makers are i the effluent trading amount in flooding season should be enlarged the emission ratios are larger in flood season than those in nonflood season more trading can reduce environmental cost from excess emissions ii more initial permits should be allocated to livestock breeding zones and effective emission control practice should be applied for them iii to achieve optimal risk management schemes the annual production scale and the related pollution discharge should be reduced the cross industry effluent trading should be encouraged the recommended reduction would be 7 315 9 730 for planting zones 18 204 for livestock breeding zones and 6 222 for fishery zones respectively nevertheless there are potential extensions in the study the generated optimal risk management scheme makes a tradeoff among system benefit emission and system risks it cannot eliminate the system risks and the risk value is not zero various uncertainties that exists in factors of trading system can have important effects on system risk values for example uncertainties exist in estimation of trading ratio which are derived from meteorological conditions that vary temporally and underlying surface that changes spatially trading ratio as a central regulatory feature of effluent trading influences system benefit trading amount as well as the structure of the trading process zhang et al 2019 the effect of trading ratio s uncertainties on system risks needs to be further examined this can help better

9484,increasing amounts of wastewater are discharged to water bodies with a risk of exceeding their capacity to cope with such loads nutrient discharge forms two types of risk i e economic and excess

laixi pingdu and jiaozhou 1 introduction increasing amounts of nonpoint source pollutants are discharged to water bodies with a risk of exceeding their capacity to cope with such loads liu et al 2016 chaudhary and hantush 2017 besides conflict between increasing demand and limited supply for environmental capacity has intensified the competition among pollution sources which brings about detrimental pressures on efficient water quality management traditional command and control cac instruments can be efficient when emission standards are chosen however the costs of achieving effluent limits for pollution sources can vary substantially between cases identical environmental penalties risk discouraging innovation and fail to provide continuous incentives to reduce pollution effluent trading potentially achieves optimal configuration for discharge permits by encouraging transition of permits from low to high value uses it has potential to provide flexibility and incentives to adopt pollution abatement and gain in economic efficiency for agricultural watersheds corrales et al 2017 horan and shortle 2017 zhang et al 2019 system analysis provides a powerful means for optimal effluent trading design and planning which has received broad attention zaidi and demonsabert 2015 raffensperger et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 heberling et al 2018 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 for example gunawardena et al 2018 proposed a hydro economic model combining an economic optimization model with a hydrological model a cost effective effluent trading policy was determined xu et al 2020 optimized cropland use and non agricultural production levels using effluent trading and controlled the total emission quantity through a robust optimization model in real world problems the trading effort is often restricted by inherent uncertainties due to randomness of natural processes e g precipitation pollutant loadings decisions thus have to be made in the face of an uncertain and risky future a number of stochastic mathematical programming methods are thus developed zeng et al 2017 archibald and marshall 2018 for example two stage stochastic programming tsp provides an effective nexus between the economic activities and the associated environmental penalties through introducing a recourse action zeng et al 2015 2018 nematian 2016 li et al 2019 multistage stochastic programming generalizes the two stage problem to a sequence of recourse decisions torres rincÃ³n et al 2021 dual stochastic programming tackles multiple uncertainties expressed as dual intervals and probability distributions gao et al 2018 chance constrained programming ccp reflects the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints under random uncertainty ma et al 2020 the random of pollutant loading derives from random and heterogeneous factors such as precipitation and surface runoff it can lead to system risks such as economic and excess effluent risks economic risk denotes risk of system benefit loss due to high average value of pollutant loading excess effluent risk denotes risk of system benefit loss due to the variability of pollutant loading however traditional stochastic programming methods can be restricted when the decision maker is risk averse under multiple system risks risk control analysis methods ram provide an attractive approach to deal with the above shortcomings they are widely used to include risk aversion in optimization process in pollution control and water resources management they include downside risk theory xie et al 2018 value at risk naserizade et al 2018 conditional value at risk yazdi et al 2016 chance constrained programming alizadeh et al 2018 robust optimization song et al 2019 and financial risk management barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a 2004b among them financial risk management and robust optimization both account for system risks due to random loadings specifically financial risk management addresses economic consequences of high pollutant emission it controls the production scales and reduces the related pollutant discharge to avoid the huge losses incurred after the high excess pollutant discharge occurs liu et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 robust optimization can further consider the variability of pollutant loading with a variance term this could keep the actual environmental discharge of the realized scenario close to the optimal discharge ahmed and sahinidis 1998 kara and onut 2010 he et al 2020 if the consideration of system risks is lacking economic and excess effluent risks may pose great challenges to efficient decision making nevertheless no comprehensive analysis based on multi risk aversion and management is reported in supporting effluent trading planning therefore this study first conducts a comprehensive analysis of optimal effluent trading considering multi risk aversion for an agricultural watershed bayesian dual risk aversion based stochastic programming bdrsp is developed to achieve this innovation bdrsp incorporates bayesian based nutrient fate simulation dual risk aversion based stochastic programming drsp multi dimensional risk analysis for nutrient pollution and risk management bdrsp is applied to a real case of daguhe watershed china the objectives are i investigating the effect of dual risks i e economic and excess effluent risks on trading system and ii disclosing the optimal risk management schemes considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its spatial pattern 2 methodology the steps involved in bayesian dual risk aversion based stochastic programming bdrsp are illustrated in fig 1 2 1 swat based on bayesian inference the bayesian paradigm can help generate posterior probability density functions pdfs which combine useful information about uncertainty and prior knowledge about the process based parameters the bayesian theorem is expressed as follows li et al 2015 1 f p o s t Ï Ï f p r i Ï f m Ï Ï f p r i Ï f m Ï Ï d Ï where Ï Î¸ Ï in which Î¸ denotes the hydrological model parameters and Ï represents statistical parameters the bayesian approach implements statistical inference

conditions are accounted for the effect of the prior density i e f p r i Ï tends to vanish when dealing with large samples the likelihood function i e f m Ï Ï is key in bayesian inference which is defined as with the distribution of residuals integrating marginal distribution and conditional distribution the posterior density might have a complicated functional form which is difficult to calculate markov chain monte carlo mcmc can deal with the above obstacles its basic idea is to carefully construct a markov chain based on formal likelihood measures the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm is a multi chain mcmc sampler it automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution during the search it can also adapt subspace sampling to maximize the average normalized jumping distance in each chain vrugt et al 2009 the detailed principles for nutrient simulation based on swat are provided in appendix a 2 2 dual risk aversion based stochastic programming effluent trading planning needs to address incomplete data due to inexact factors this inexactness can be expressed using interval numbers and trade can be optimized using interval parameter programming ipp in addition two groups of decision variables exist in effluent trading planning the first stage decision variables are economic activity scales that are determined before the realizations of random pollutant discharges the second stage decision variables are excess pollutant loadings which are of random characteristics environmental penalties can be calculated with the excess loadings which are recourse actions against violation of discharge permit due to particular realizations of the random pollutant discharges two stage stochastic programming tsp can deal with such complexities therefore by introducing the ipp an inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp model can be formulated as follows zhang et al 2019 2a max f i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 k 1 k

pollutant generation rate allowance of pollutant emission w are discharge permits after trading program the probability level h k measures the probability of pollutant loading k is the number of probability levels i and j denote the pollution sources n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of i and j and n 1 can be equal to n 2 t and r are indices of constraints model 2a is the objective function that maximizes the system benefit considering the first stage economic activity targets and the second stage recourse actions model 2b provides limitations for the first stage variables of effluent trading planning i e the emission allowance restricts the pollutant loadings and the associated economic activity scales model 2c describes relations between variables of the two stages i e the excess pollutant loadings are calculated with the loadings related to first stage variables that exceed the discharge permit after trading because pollutant loadings are random the excess pollutant loadings can take discretization values under different probability levels h k after their probability density functions are known model 2d and 2e can ensure that all the variables in effluent trading planning are nonnegative model 2 searches for optimal first and second stage variables to maximize the system benefit the optimization process balances the decision variables of the two stages the economic activity scales can be corrected by decision makers against the violation of discharge permit through the recourse actions the itsp can be converted into two submodels corresponding to lower and upper bounds of the objective function values as recommended in huang and loucks 2000 interval solutions can then be obtained by solving the two submodels sequentially in practical effluent trading pollutant loadings may vary with time due to their randomness thus the associated environmental penalty can be high the itsp does not reflect any control for risk caused by random pollutant loading such a benefit would be lower than the expectation of the decision makers who would rather obtain less money with lower economic activity than bear the huge losses incurred after the excess pollutant discharge occurs thus a financial risk management strategy is introduced to deal with the economic risk as follows barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a zeng et al 2017 3 r i s k k x Î· p b k x Î· 4 b k x i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k k 1 2 k where b k x is the actual benefit i e the benefit has been obtained after the uncertainty being unveiled under scenario k Î· denotes the targeted benefit p is the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit under scenario k the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit can describe an individual scenario it can also describe a set of scenarios the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit can be expressed as 5 r i s k x Î· k 1 k r i s k k x Î· k 1 k p b k x Î· in design of any scenario if the benefit is either greater than or equal to the target level the corresponding probability is zero otherwise it would be 1 thus the definition of risk can be rewritten as follows 6 r i s k x Î· k 1 k h k v k x Î· 7 v k x Î· 0 if i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· 1 otherwise k 1 2 k where v k is a binary variable defined for each scenario k the financial risk management strategy is designed as follows barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a 8a i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· u b k v k k 1 2 k 8b i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· u b k 1 v k k 1 2 k 8c k 1 k h k v k Îµ 8d v k x Î· 0 if i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· 1 otherwise k 1 2 k where Îµ is the allowable risk exposure level which is used to change the probability of not meeting the targeted benefit level Î· when Îµ is raised v k will be permitted to be equal to one under more scenarios this can be expressed by model 8c and 8d then actual benefit i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k will be less than the targeted benefit level i e i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k Î· thus production scale and the related pollutant discharge can be decreased to reduce the system risk this process can be expressed by model 8b an upper bound benefit under each scenario u b k is used in model 8a to provide a lower limit for the actual benefit when v k 0 under certain scenarios i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 d j y j k would be either greater than or equal to Î· this process can be expressed by model 8a model 8b then is designed to provide an upper limit for the actual benefit barbaro and bagajewicz 2004a parameters in model 8 are expressed with intervals with lower and upper bound value which corresponds to the two submodels of ipp method respectively financial risk management addresses economic consequence of high excess effluent through controlling production scale first stage variables and reducing pollutant discharge however the reduced pollutant discharge still remains random characteristics and the variability of excess effluent exists thus the associated environmental penalty may be highly variable robust optimization can further consider the higher moments of the pollutant loading distribution through introducing a variance term to control the variability of excess effluent second stage variables the variance term is formulated as 9 varianceterm Ï j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k v j k Ï j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k d j y j k k 1 k h k d j y j k where Ï is a goal programming weight through varying the Ï level the decision maker can then control the variability of excess effluent v j k is positive deviation of a given scenario k s penalty from the recourse penalty for pollution source j the variance term can be included in the objective function to control the variability of excess effluent therefore based on financial risk management strategy robust optimization and itsp a dual risk aversion based stochastic programming drsp for effluent trading planning can be formulated as follows 10a max f i 1 n 1 c i x i j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k d j y j k Ï j 1 n 2 k 1 k h k v

al 2020 the multi dimensional risk measures the spatial correlation of nutrient pollution and is considered in a comprehensive evaluation for selecting the optimal risk management schemes the use of the copula function reduces the modelling of an arbitrary multivariate distribution to two steps the estimation of marginal distributions and the description of the dependence structure of marginals via an appropriate copula function sklar s theorem states that any n dimensional distribution function f can be formulated through its continuous marginal distributions and a copula function c which is expressed as follows sklar 1959 fan et al 2016 li et al 2020 11 f u 1 u 2 u n c f x 1 u 1 f x 2 u 2 f x n u n where f x 1 u 1 f x 2 u 2 f x n u n are marginal distributions of random vectors u 1 u 2 u n the widely applied copula classes include gaussian normal copula student s t copula and archimedean copulas student s t copulas and gaussian copulas are generally applicable to describe random variables with symmetrical tail dependence while t copulas also describe random variables with heavy tails kim and jung 2016 archimedean copulas are easily derived and are capable of capturing wide ranges of dependence i e lower or upper tail dependences in this study three single parameter bivariate archimedean copulas i e clayton frank and gumbel hougaard copulas are considered borgomeo et al 2015 the clayton copula is asymmetric meaning that it exhibits greater dependence for values at the lower tail of the distribution the frank copula on the other hand is symmetric it shows the same dependence at both ends of the distribution the gumbel hougaard copula exhibits greater dependence in the upper tail of the distribution tosunoglu and onof 2017 rehana and dhanya 2018 the clayton copula is 12 c u 1 u 2 Î¸ u 1 Î¸ u 2 Î¸ 1 1 Î¸ where Î¸ 1 0 is the parameter of the clayton copula the frank copula is 13 c u 1 u 2 Î¸ 1 Î¸ ln 1 e Î¸ u 1 1 e Î¸ u 2 1 e Î¸ 1 where Î¸ 0 is the

akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are used to evaluate the performance of the theoretical joint cumulative distributions obtained using copula functions karmakar and simonovic 2009 more details of the three measures are provided in appendix b 3 case study 3 1 overview of the study system dagu river being the green ecological defense of qingdao is the largest river of all the rivers entering jiaozhou bay it flows through laixi pingdu jiaozhou and jimo counties with a length of more than 150 km daguhe watershed is located between latitudes of 36 10 n 37 12 n and longtitudes of 120 03 e 120 25 e with a total area of 6131 3 km2 accounting for 45 of the total area of qingdao chen et al 2010 li et al 2018 fig 2 the region has an average annual precipitation of 707 4 mm and an average annual temperature of 10 11 with a warm temperate coastal humid monsoon climate brown soil tidal soil and sandy ginger and black soil are the main soil types liao et al 2010 as an agricultural watershed daguhe watershed has the main industries of planting industry animal husbandry and fishery nutrients including nh3 n and tp from these sources pollute the river and lead to eutrophication in jiaozhou bay ocean and fishery administration of qingdao 2018 3 2 modeling formulation according to the designated functional zones and channel characteristics dagu river is segmented into four sections which are marked i to iv in fig 2 the planning horizon is one year which is sorted into two periods nonflood season november to may of the following year and flood season june to october multiple main crops are considered associated with different fertilizer application irrigation cost and agricultural benefit they are wheat corn peanut cabbage celery carrot potato apple pear peach and grape pigs poultry dairy cattle and cows are the main livestock breeding species ten main pollution sources along the river are involved in effluent trading including three fishery zones four planting zones and three livestock breeding zones nh3 n is considered and its transport behavior will be predicted with swat with mcmc in real world problems downstream sources can pose greater pollution consequences than upstream sources due to river self purification trading ratio is introduced to account for this issue and ensure an equivalent environmental effect after trading the trading ratio is defined as the number of units of pollutant reduction a source must purchase from the other source in order to receive a discharge permit for one unit increase in its load hung and shaw 2005 mesbah et al 2009 in this study trading ratios are estimated according to zonal based trading ratios ztr proposed by zhang et al 2013 according to zhang et al 2013 the trading ratios are greater than one for upstream dischargers who sell permits to downstream ones downstream dischargers would obtain less discharge permits than their purchase amount with trading ratios larger than one then pollution from upstream and downstream sources can have equivalent environmental effects ztrs are smaller than one when an upstream discharger buys discharge permits from a downstream discharger this can allow concentration of permits and lead to risk of hot spots for example when an upstream discharger purchase 1 ton of permit from a downstream discharger it would receive 1 25 tons of permit with a trading ratio of 0 8 this means more pollution can be emitted which can violate the allowance in the trading ratio system designed by hung and shaw 2005 effluent tradings from downstream to upstream are not allowed because there is no trading ratio for such kinds of trades this could hinder the effluent trading market scale therefore trading ratios for trading from downstream to upstream are assumed to be one the environmental allowance can then remain strict and water quality of the watershed can be improved in this study the pollutant discharges from nonpoint sources are conceptualized as random due to two reasons a randomness exist in pollutant discharge of practical effluent trading nonpoint source pollutants fluctuate and are difficult to be traced they enter the receiving water over an extensive area with sporadic time frames and are influenced by random factors such as precipitation and surface runoff b the measured and deterministic value represent the processes that have occurred and cannot support effluent trading design and risk management for the planning year thus the random characteristic of pollutant discharges are analyzed through uncertain simulation based on measured data and provided to the proposed bdrsp for effluent trading planning the random nutrient discharge forms two types of risk i e economic and excess effluent risks bdrsp can deal with the two risks by incorporating financial risk management and robust optimization in addition water quality of adjacent sub watersheds are closely related due to the correlation of their meteorological and hydrological processes specifically nutrient loss from upstream land use will flow along the river and cause water degradation in downstream discharges from local point sources may spread over a large area through river networks such correlation leads to the transmission and accumulation of water quality issue among watersheds bdrsp can analyze multi dimensional risk for nutrient pollution the bdrsp can be formulated as follows 15a m a x i 1 4 j 1 11 t 1 2 a b j x i j Î´ x o i j t n 1 3 r 1 4 t 1 2 w r n n r Î´ n m n r t p 1 3 t 1 2 s b p z p Î´ z

participating in permit trading as well as excess effluent risk thus the optimal scheme is obtained with economic benefit being maximized as well as total discharges and the related risk for all pollution sources being minimized the higher moments of the random loading distribution and decision maker s preferences toward risk are considered in obtaining the optimal objective the constraints

series of general meteorological data with regard to model inputs are required for watershed hydrological and water quality simulation they include daily rainfall data as well as maximum and minimum temperature during the period of 1991 2018 the meteorological data were collected from china meteorological data service center the physical characteristics flow direction and hydrographic network were derived from digital elevation model dem the dem data set was obtained from geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn with a resolution of 90 m land use data sets for the years 2000 2010 and 2018 were provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn the soil map of 1 1 million was collected from soil and terrain soter database zhang and zhao 2008 the related economic data for each pollution source which are expressed as interval values due to the uncertainties in the gained information were collected from historical records e g qingdao statistical yearbook and by field investigation allowances of nh3 n emission for tributaries and main stream of dagu river industries as well as the whole watershed were collected from environmental protection plan of dagu river basin and local researches yang 2010 allowances of nh3 n emission provide total quantities for initial allocation of discharge permits the initial permits of planting zones livestock breeding zones and fishery zones are determined based on their weight coefficients production scale pollutant emission economic and ecological benefit of all zones are considered to calculate their weight coefficients 4 results and discussion 4 1 uncertain simulation for nh3 n loading swat model using bayesian inference to estimate parameters is used for uncertain prediction of nh3 n loading sensitivity analysis with latin hypercube is implemented for 37 parameters in modeling nutrient loading these parameters represent important processes of hydrology sediment and water quality such as surface runoff soil water groundwater soil erosion and nitrogen cycle the sensitivities of swat model parameters are described by t stat and p values which is illustrated in fig 3 t stat provides a measure of sensitivity with larger absolute values indicating more sensitive parameters p values determine the significance of the sensitivity a value close to zero is more statistically significant the results imply that overland flow generation soil water nitrogen cycle groundwater water routing peak runoff and nutrient uptake by plants are the most important processes for modeling nh3 n loading in daguhe watershed the top ten parameters of the sensitivity ranking are involved in bayesian inference with dream algorithm for parameter uncertainty analysis they are presented in table 1 the prior densities are assumed to be uniform over their limit value ranges to represent vague prior knowledge the uncertainty analysis is performed in the calibration period with the monthly nh3 n loading data from 2002 to 2006 the validation period is from 2007 to 2009 and the prediction period is from 2010 to 2025 in this study parameters are estimated with eight markov chains containing 20 000 iterations for each parameter the first 10 of which are removed as burn in period gelman rubin criterion involves both the between chain variance and the within chain variance gelman rubin criterion is used to diagnose if each parameter converges to a stationary distribution gelman and rubin 1992 the r statistic for the markov chains of the ten parameters is also presented in table 1 the results indicate that all the chains converge the markov chains and posterior distributions for the ten parameters are illustrated in fig 4 parameters markov chains are beside their posterior distributions from the results parameters posterior distributions are different from their prior distributions besides almost all the posterior distributions are not normally distributed associated with obvious skewness several posterior distributions appear to be bimodal such as the distributions of cn2 gwqmn ch k2 the results indicate that posterior distributions of almost all parameters would spread over a wide range within their limit value ranges this may be because of limited monthly nh3 n loading data for the calibration this would lead to more accepted candidate points in the implementation of dream algorithm fig 5 depicts the 95 ci confidence interval of monthly nh3 n loading due to parameter uncertainty for years of 1991 2025 parameter uncertainty is analyzed based on the monthly data for nh3 n loading from 2002 to 2012 from xielaqiao gauge station which is highlighted with red circles 51 22 of monthly observed loading and 70 of annual data are within the uncertainty range which is deemed to provide sufficient performance of nh3 n loading for this demonstration log pearson type iii gamma generalized extreme value and the 2 parameter lognormal distributions are used to fit the pdfs of lower and upper bounds of nh3 n loading s 95 ci i e 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles from the results a generalized extreme value distribution is found to be the best fit for each of the two time series the cumulative probability distribution functions cdfs are also presented in fig 5 the discretization values of nh3 n loading provide input i e e k in constraint 15 e for effluent trading planning with statistical analysis 4 2 optimal trading scheme the trading ratios are estimated based on the uncertain simulation through calculating ratio between environmental damages at the watershed outlet that are caused by two sources table 2 presents the trading ratio among different pollution sources the optimal trading schemes including optimal economic activity scales first stage variables annual excess nh3 n loading second stage variables optimal buying and selling processes under different risk levels are disclosed in this section fig 6 illustrates optimized production scale of planting zone livestock breeding zone and fishery zone different economic risk levels i e Îµ and excess effluent risk levels i e Ï the production scales below economic risk level of 0 65 and excess effluent risk level of 0 6 are basically same besides the production scales for livestock breeding zone and fishery zone remain constant during both the flood and non flood seasons from the results dual risk levels would obviously influence the production scales production scales would generally decrease as risk levels are raised for example planting area in jiaozhou would be 112 007 and 93 607 under Îµ 0 Ï 0 and Îµ 0 75 Ï 0 7 under Îµ 1 Ï 1 the planting area would be 92 487 nonflood season and 93 134 flood season in addition the influence on planting and livestock breeding scale in pingdu and fishery scale in jiaozhou are most obvious for example when Ï is raised from 0 3 to 0 7 and Îµ is raised from 0 35 to 0 75 46 570 pingdu 0 529 jimo 18 390 jiaozhou and 0 laixi 103 ha of farmland would be reduced fig 7 illustrates cross industry effluent trading amount for nh3 n under different risk levels the positive value represents the amount of buyer s market the negative value represents the amount of seller s market the results indicate that trading schemes would change with different risk levels this implies that decision maker s attitude towards risk changes the behavior of purchase and sale besides compared with nonflood season more discharge permit would be traded during flood season for example when Îµ 0 25 and Ï 0 2 10 428 11 921 tons and 9 017 83 266 tons of permit would be sold to livestock breeding zones during nonflood season and flood season respectively this is because precipitation influences nh3 n discharge load from planting zone livestock breeding zone and fishery zone their emission ratios would be larger in flood season than those in nonflood season more trading would thus occur to reduce environmental cost from excess emissions in addition the trading amount for planting zone would be negative indicating that planting zone would be the main seller the results also indicate that livestock breeding zone would be the main buyer for example when Îµ 0 55 and Ï 0 5 under nonflood season the trading amount would be 2 218 13 348 ton 1 529 12 048 ton and 0 689 0 989 ton for planting zone livestock breeding zone and fishery zone respectively this is mainly because more initial permit is allocated to planting zones considering benefit and pollutant emission planting zones would have surplus permit during nonflood and flood seasons as shown by zero annual excess nh3 n loading in fig 8 the excess nh3 n loading denotes the difference between discharge permit and actual emission the results indicate that there would be few excess loading for planting zones this implies that their initial permit is sufficient such that they can sell the permit even in flood season when there is more discharge load in addition livestock breeding zones have potential to gain more benefit than fishery zones thus they would purchase more permits from planting zones fig 9 illustrates the detailed optimal buying and selling processes under different levels of economic and excess effluent risk the abbreviation of pollution sources is described in nomenclature colored ribbons denote the trading processes and the seller has the same color as the ribbon for example in plot a the green ribbon show the discharge permits that are sold from lxa to lxl from the results economic and excess effluent risks would have important impact on the detailed buying and selling processes in addition lxa pda and jza would be the main seller lxl and pdl purchase the most within the watershed for example when Îµ 0 65 and Ï 0 6 4 196 tons of discharge permit would be sold from lxa to lxl pdl would purchase 6 078 tons of permit from jza besides jzf and lxf are the main fishery buyers the average purchase amounts for the 16 risk levels are 0 417 ton 0 146 ton and 0 534 ton for lxf pdf and jzf respectively the result can be due to the higher yield as well as larger effluent emission of two fishery zones the calculation of benefit per ton of emission involves information about yield and effluent emissions the benefits per ton of emission can be calculated with the developed bdrsp which are provided by tables 3 and 4 the result indicates that the benefits per ton of emission of lxl and pdl are the largest in livestock breeding zones and jzf has the largest benefit per ton of emission in fishery zones from the results it can be implied that the pollution source with higher net benefit per ton of emission would become the main buyer 4 3 optimal risk management scheme the optimal risk management schemes are determined based on a comprehensive evaluation considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its multi dimensional risk fig 10 illustrates system benefit unit revenue and nh3 n loading under different economic and excess effluent risks from the results of plot a and b system benefit decreases as both the two risk levels are raised for example the system benefit would be 23 474 29 039 109 Îµ 0 Ï 0 19 864 26 203 109 Îµ 0 65 Ï 0 6 and 19 127 26 138 109 Îµ 1 Ï 1 rmb respectively this is mainly because raised economic risk reduces actual benefit a higher excess effluent risk level denotes an enforced robustness level and an increased risk control level this implies that the maximized benefit would be obtained when no risk control activity is conducted Îµ 0 Ï 0 the maximum is 23 474 29 039 109 rmb however the maximized benefit would not correspond to the optimal risk management scheme the details for nh3 n loading under different risk levels is presented in fig 10 c d from the results nh3 n loading would be decreased as both the two risk levels are raised for example the loading would be 1205 005 Îµ 0 Ï 0 1086 192 Îµ 1 Ï 0 1081 242 Îµ 1 Ï 1 ton respectively fig 10 e f illustrate unit revenues under different risk levels the unit revenues defined as the system benefit per ton of nh3 n loading is used to investigate the efficiency of effluent trading from the results the unit revenue affected by nh3 n loading shows different change patterns from system benefit the optimum upper bound unit revenue would be 24 200 106 rmb ton which would be obtained under Îµ 1 Ï 0 8 the optimum lower bound unit revenue would be 19 480 106 rmb ton which would be obtained under Îµ 0 Ï 0 in addition the results indicate that economic risk and excess effluent risk have interactive effects on the unit revenue under low excess effluent risk level high unit revenue would be obtained under low economic risk under high excess effluent risk level high unit revenue would be obtained under high economic risk for example when Ï 0 2 high unit revenue would be obtained under Îµ 0 which is 19 129 24 096 106 rmb ton when Ï 0 8 high lower bound unit revenue would be obtained under Îµ 0 65 i e 19 218 106 rmb ton high upper bound unit revenue would be obtained under Îµ 1 i e 24 200 106 rmb ton the results imply that higher unit revenue would be obtained under risk management schemes of low Îµ and low Ï or high Îµ and high Ï in detail low Îµ and low Ï levels correspond to high system benefit and high nutrient emission high Îµ and high Ï levels correspond to low benefit and pollution an ecological conservation redline has been established in daguhe watershed since 2018 the schemes of low Îµ and low Ï is not suitable for daguhe watershed risk management schemes of high economic and excess effluent risk levels are thus recommended due to high unit revenue and low pollution multi dimensional nh3 n pollution risk that measures spatial correlation of the risk has also been investigated to select the optimal risk management schemes nh3 n loadings at state controlled sections of mawanqiao and xielaqiao are predicted with swat based on the actual emissions under different economic and excess effluent risks then three archimedean copulas i e clayton frank gumbel hougaard are considered to quantify the dependence between the loadings at the two sections the most appropriate copulas would be chosen based on the results of rmse aic and bic as shown in table 5 mawanqiao is located in jiaodong town jiaozhou city and is used to monitor the water quality of dagu river after the confluence of south jiaolai river xielaqiao is located at the outlet of daguhe watershed and is used to monitor the pollutants discharged into the sea from the results clayton copula is the best fit copula function for all risk levels and the estimated parameter values are also provided in table 5 the joint probability based on clayton copula between nh3 n loadings at mawanqiao and xielaqiao is provided in fig 11 the x axis denotes nh3 n loading at mawanqiao 102 ton and y axis denotes nh3 n loading at xielaqiao 102 ton nh3 n loadings at the two stations are predicted based on pollutant discharge under different economic and excess effluent risks then joint exceedance probability i e p x x y y can be calculated based on the estimated copula to describe the probability of the two locations exceeding environmental capacity simultaneously which is illustrated in fig 12 from the results lower joint exceedance probability would be obtained under high economic and excess effluent risks for example the joint exceedance probability would be 0 514 Îµ 0 85 Ï 0 8 0 514 Îµ 0 85 Ï 1 0 491 Îµ 1 Ï 0 8 and 0 497 Îµ 1 Ï 1 the lowest joint exceedance probability would be 0 4908 when Îµ 1 Ï 0 8 this indicates that the joint exceeding probability would be controlled as dual risk levels are raised this is mainly because nutrient emissions from pingdu and laixi county would contribute nh3 n loading in mawanqiao nh3 n loadings from jimo and jiaozhou county would be transferred to the confluences that locate in the middle of mawanqiao and xielaqiao and then flow into the sea at xielaqiao raised risk levels would restrain the loadings from the four counties and the annual loading at mawanqiao and xielaqiao would thus be reduced the results imply that raised dual risk levels would not only reduce the nutrient loadings but also hinder the propagation of water pollution risk the optimal risk management schemes are determined based on topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution it measures the euclidean distance and aims at arriving at an alternative which is closest to the positive ideal solution pis and farthest from the negative ideal solution nis firstly the topsis is implemented for 36 dual risk levels including 6 economic risk levels and 6 excess effluent risk levels the performance of each dual risk level is evaluated considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its multi dimensional risk secondly the topsis is implemented for nine risk areas the performance of each risk area is evaluated considering the euclidean distances of 4 dual risk levels the results of the comprehensive evaluation are presented in table 6 the performance for a risk area is obtained integrating the four risk levels in the table the performance of a risk area are beside the performance of the risk level for example the euclidean distance for the first risk area i e 0 Îµ 0 25 0 Ï 0 2 is 0 574 from the results the optimal risk level is when Îµ 0 85 Ï 0 4 with the maximum euclidean distance being 0 704 the optimal two risk areas is when 0 85 Îµ 1 0 4 Ï 0 6 and 0 85 Îµ 1 0 8 Ï 1 with the largest two euclidean distance being 0 948 and 0 918 respectively effluent trading planning considering high economic and excess effluent risk control levels i e 0 85 Îµ 1 0 4 Ï 0 6 and 0 85 Îµ 1 0 8 Ï 1 is recommended table 7 presents the optimal risk management schemes including production scale pollution discharge and trading structure under the optimal risk control levels compared with scheme of risk neutral attitude i e Îµ 0 Ï 0 the production scale and the related pollution discharge for planting zones would be reduced by 6 573 12 414 nonflood season and 6 428 10 910 flood season the annual reduction would be 7 315 9 730 for planting zones 18 204 for livestock breeding zones and 6 222 for fishery zones respectively besides under optimal risk levels the trading structure would also be different from that of the risk neutral scheme from the results the proportion of cross industry trading would be increased by 2 052 7 516 nonflood season and 5 100 19 496 flood season and the proportion of intra industry trading would be decreased accordingly this is because cross industry trading can transit discharge permits to high value uses under the optimal risk levels when production scale and system benefit is reduced 5 conclusions in this study a bayesian dual risk aversion based stochastic programming bdrsp is proposed for selecting optimal trading and risk management schemes in an agricultural watershed bdrsp has advantages in i predicting nutrient transport behaviors from the propagation of model parameter uncertainties with dream ii analyzing specific variations of system benefit unit revenues nh3 n loading as well as its multi dimensional risk under the effect of dual risk iii disclosing the optimal buying and selling processes between every potential pair of sources iv selecting the optimal risk management schemes based on a comprehensive evaluation method bdrsp has been demonstrated through its application to the daguhe watershed in china the contributions lie in i obtaining optimal effluent trading schemes under the dual risks ii identifying multi dimensional risk of nutrient pollution based on joint probability distributions with copulas iii generating optimal risk management schemes considering system benefit unit revenue as well as nh3 n loading and its multi dimensional risk several findings can be revealed a planting zone would be the main seller and livestock breeding zone would be the main buyer pollution sources with higher net benefit per ton of emission would become the main buyer and the sources with surplus discharge permit would be the main seller b more discharge permit would be traded during flood season than that during nonflood season emission ratio would be larger during flood season c economic and excess effluent risks would have obvious impact on system benefit unit revenues nh3 n loading as well as its multi dimensional risk d higher unit revenue would be obtained when the two risk factors both take low or high levels and raised dual risk levels would not only reduce the nutrient loadings but also hinder the propagation of water pollution risk e the optimal risk management schemes under high economic and excess effluent risk control levels i e 0 85 Îµ 1 0 4 Ï 0 6 and 0 85 Îµ 1 0 8 Ï 1 are recommended specifically the recommendations for the policy makers are i the effluent trading amount in flooding season should be enlarged the emission ratios are larger in flood season than those in nonflood season more trading can reduce environmental cost from excess emissions ii more initial permits should be allocated to livestock breeding zones and effective emission control practice should be applied for them iii to achieve optimal risk management schemes the annual production scale and the related pollution discharge should be reduced the cross industry effluent trading should be encouraged the recommended reduction would be 7 315 9 730 for planting zones 18 204 for livestock breeding zones and 6 222 for fishery zones respectively nevertheless there are potential extensions in the study the generated optimal risk management scheme makes a tradeoff among system benefit emission and system risks it cannot eliminate the system risks and the risk value is not zero various uncertainties that exists in factors of trading system can have important effects on system risk values for example uncertainties exist in estimation of trading ratio which are derived from meteorological conditions that vary temporally and underlying surface that changes spatially trading ratio as a central regulatory feature of effluent trading influences system benefit trading amount as well as the structure of the trading process zhang et al 2019 the effect of trading ratio s uncertainties on system risks needs to be further examined this can help better understand the system risks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence
