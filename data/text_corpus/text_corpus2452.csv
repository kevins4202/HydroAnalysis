respectively kaushik et al 2008 adsorption using broken concrete cubes as adsorbent removed fluoride up to 80 from an initial concentration of 8 mg l bandyopadhyay et al 2009 cement paste particles of

of fluoride was achieved within an equilibrium time of 1 h at an adsorbent dose of 1 6 mg l for an initial fluoride concentration of 20 mg l using untreated hydrated alumina uha and thermally treated hydrated alumina tha as adsorbents fluoride adsorption capacities of uha and tha were about 7 mg g and 23 mg g respectively shimelis et al 2006 nanoscale aluminium oxide hydroxide nano alooh as an adsorbent removed fluoride with a maximum adsorption capacity of 62 5 mg g at an adsorbent dose of 1 6 g l for an initial fluoride concentration of 20 mg l after 1 h contact 95 removal of fluoride was achieved and the maximum adsorption occurred at ph 7 adeno et al 2014 a maximum fluoride adsorption capacity of 114 54 mg g was achieved by using al2o3 zro2 adsorbent for an initial fluoride concentration of 100 mg l optimum ph and equilibrium time obtained were 2 0 and 4 h respectively zhu et al 2015 when hydrated cement small granules of 1 4 3 mm size bricks powder less than 300 μm particle size and marble powder 50 μm particle size were used as adsorbents they showed removal of more than 90 for arsenic and more than 75 for fluoride from an aqueous solution of 1000 mg l of arsenic and 30 mg l of fluoride at ph 7 0 and 8 with the contact period of 60 min and a dose of 30 g l bibi et al 2015 ce fe bimetal oxides cf31 10 as adsorbent removed fluoride with an adsorption

fluoride was adsorbed at ph 4 5 kofa et al 2017 adsorbent made from a natural nanomaterial montmorillonite clay removed fluoride with a maximum percentage of 83 5 at an optimum ph of 2 the contact time of 50 min and an adsorbent dose of 2 0 g from an initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l at temperature 25 c lamayi et al 2018 it is clear from the literature review that there are various methodologies and technologies available for fluoride removal from water each of these technologies suffers from one or more limitations fluoride removal efficiency also depends upon the characteristics of the water to be treated i e presence and absence of other compounds adsorption and chemical precipitation are among the most practiced methods of defluoridation adopted in household and or small community level water supplies among various adsorbents cement has been recently identified as a potential adsorbent for defluoridation cement granules have been tested in pilot plant scale reactor and recommended for the development of a full scale reactor for fluoride removal from semiconductor and display panel manufacturing plants wastewater nalgonda technique is the most adopted among other precipitation methods of defluoridation portland pozzolana cement is cheaper than ordinary portland cement opc because pozzolanas are cheaply and widely available as wastes volcanic ash fly ash slag etc the present study investigated efficiency and feasibility of adsorbent made from ppc paste coating on mud pot on defluoridation of groundwater collected from a hand pump of an indian village karahari mathura uttar pradesh so as to develop a household container using ppc coated mud pot the primary goal of the research work was to study i effect of initial ph hydration time coexisting ions chloride carbonate bicarbonate sulphate and nitrate and overall efficiency of cement paste defluoridation from fluoride spiked distilled water ii collection and characterization of groundwater from a chosen site iii the efficiency of portland pozzolana cement ppc on defluoridation of groundwater iv dose optimization of various chemicals for fluoride removal by nalgonda technique for the same groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this project were analytical reagent ar grade milli q water having ph of 6 64 was used to prepare all the standard solutions fly ash based portland pozzolana cement ppc and mud pots were purchased from the local market the chemical composition of portland pozzolana cement ppc is given in table 1 grade 1 whatman filter paper whatman 1001 125 was used to filter water samples 2 2 methods fluoride stock solution of 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving 2 21 g naf salt in 1 l milli q water the desired working solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution appropriate number of times the concentration of fluoride throughout the study was determined using the spadns method 2 2 1 adsorbent preparation in the present study it was expected that if a layer of cement paste is provided on the inner surface of the mud pots then the surface area of the adsorbent will increase and this increase in the surface area will enhance the percentage removal of fluoride portland pozzolana cement ppc paste was coated on the inner surface of the mud pots up to a level sufficient to contain 1 l of water cement paste was prepared by adding the required volume of milli q water to arrive at a water cement ratio of 0 4 after coating mud pots were kept for air drying at room temperature the methodology of adsorbent preparation is given in fig 1 fig 2 shows a picture of a mud pot before and after the cement coating 2 2 2 effect of hydration time on defluoridation the inner surface of each of the four mud pots was coated with 50 g cement paste all the mud pots were kept for hydration of the cement first pot for one day a second pot for two days a third pot for three days and fourth pot for four days after the respective hydration period 1 l synthetic fluoride water of 5 mg l concentration was poured in each mud pot and samples were collected after 30 h of contact time all samples were filtered and analyzed for the residual fluoride concentration 2 2 3 batch adsorption study for conducting batch adsorption study a specified amount of cement paste was coated on the inner surface of the required number of mud pots after 3 days of hydration 1 l water having 5 mg l fluoride was poured into each mud pot water in the mud pots was not agitated samples were taken from the pots at equilibrium contact time the samples were filtered through filter paper and analyzed for residual fluoride concentration the batch studies were conducted at room temperature 27 2 c a similar procedure was followed to determine the effect of contact time adsorbent dose co existing ions and initial ph 2 2 3 1 effect of adsorbent dose and initial ph adsorbent doses of 25 50 75 100 and 125 g were coated in 5 mud pots and treated water samples were collected after 27 h of adsorption residual concentration in each sample was found for each dose this method gave us the optimum adsorbent dose in order to identify the effect of ph of water fluoride solutions of 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 13 ph were prepared and poured into 7 mud pots at an optimum adsorbent dose samples were collected after 27 h of the treatment and residual fluoride concentration was recorded 2 2 3 2 effect of coexisting ions due to the presence of anions and cations in water it is expected that columbic repulsion forces between anions and fluoride ions would be enhanced or anions would compete with fluoride ions for active sites on the adsorbent surface the influence of coexisting ions such as sulphate chloride nitrate carbonate and bicarbonate on fluoride adsorption was studied binary solutions each having 5 mg l of fluoride ions and varying concentration of one of the anions sulphate carbonate bicarbonate nitrate and chloride were prepared the varying concentrations were 10 30 50 100 150 mg l for the other anions a blank solution having 5 mg l fluoride concentration of was also prepared at a time five binary solutions and one blank solution containing only fluoride ions were poured into six different mud pots for studying the effect of the co existing ion on adsorption residual fluoride concentrations after 27 h were analyzed for checking the effect of each co existing anion on adsorption 2 2 4 adsorption capacity of adsorbent using cyclic study in order to conduct a cyclic study to measure adsorbent capacity water having fluoride concentration of 5 mg l was treated in cycles with mud pots lined with the adsorbent the pots remained same however a fresh volume of water was used in every cycle the residual fluoride concentration in the solution after each cycle of the experiment was measured and the adsorption capacity of the lined pots at each cycle was calculated using the equation q t c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce are the fluoride concentrations mg l in the solution at time zero and any time t respectively q t is the amount of fluoride adsorbed per unit mass mg g of the adsorbent m is the mass of adsorbent g and v is the volume of water l this process was repeated up to a cycle at which adsorbent got completely exhausted which was observed when the initial and residual concentration did not change much after the treatment the adsorption capacity of adsorbent after exhaustion was calculated by mass balance 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of hydration time fluoride adsorption with respect to different hydration time of cement coating is given in fig 3 highest removal of fluoride was found at hydration time of 3 days after 3 days of hydration removal of fluoride was decreased this decrease in removal of fluoride may be due to a decrease in the porosity of hydrated cement paste with an increase in hydration time kagne et al 2008 has also reported better removal of fluoride at 3 days hydration of cement by using cement granules as adsorbent media 3 2 kinetic study the time profile of adsorption of fluoride along with the variation in ph is presented in fig 4 it was observed that the removal of fluoride was faster for the first 6 h after that removal rate gradually slowed till 27 h no significant removal was noticed after 27 h of contact time after 27 h residual fluoride concentration was 0 68 mg l thus around 86 removal of fluoride was obtained in this duration yadav et al 2006 bandyopadhyay et al 2009 and lamayi et al 2018 have also reported similar trends of fluoride removal using brick powder broken concrete cubes and al2o3 zro2 as adsorbents respectively the initial high rate of removal reveals a high adsorption uptake of fluoride ions by the adsorbent which may be due to availability of vacant sites on the adsorbent surface after 6 h the uptake rate was reduced which might be due to a decrease in a number of sufficient active site as well as the expected decrease in uptake due to the reduction of the solute in water no significant removal was noticed in the last stage after 27 h it may be due to exhaustion of active sites this last stage indicates the saturation or equilibrium stage when the adsorption uptake was almost negligible so 27 h time was considered as the equilibrium time for further experiments it was also observed that the ph of the water increased from an initial ph of 6 64 to a final ph of around 12 after 12 h hydration phases of pozzolana blended cement are similar to that of ordinary portland cement yousuf et al 1995 upon hydration cement produces calcium silicate hydrates c s h gel and calcium hydroxide portlandite and ettringite removal of fluoride may be due to adsorption of fluoride ions on the surface of calcium silicate hydrate gel portlandite and ettringite kang et al 2007 has also reported that various calcium bearing hydrates i e calcium silicate hydrate gel portlandite and ettringite present in the cement paste remove fluoride from water by adsorption 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose from fig 5 it is clear that at 50 g dose maximum removal of fluoride occurs at this dose residual fluoride concentration is 1 08 mg l after 50 g dose there was no incremental removal of fluoride at higher doses of the adsorbent it may be due to the overlapping of active sites at a higher dosage as well as the decrease in the effective surface area resulting in the conglomeration of exchanger particles lamayi et al 2018 kagne et al 2008 so 50 g l dose was found as an optimum dose for all further experiments at 50 g dose of cement paste approximate thickness of the cement layer inside of the mud pot was calculated the approximate thickness of the cement layer was found to be 0 80 0 20 mm 3 4 effect of initial ph fig 6 shows the effect of initial ph on fluoride removal it was observed that adsorbent can bring down the level of fluoride within the limits of drinking water standards over a wide range of ph 2 12 in earlier researches too hydrated cement has shown significant fluoride removal over a wide range of ph 3 10 kagne et al 2008 ppc as an adsorbent can remove fluoride in acidic ph ranges and highest removal occurs at ph 2 as observed in this study this highest removal of fluoride at acidic ph may be due to the presence of alumina kagne et al 2008 however at high alkaline ph removal of fluoride gets decreased sharply this decrease in fluoride removal may be due to competition between hydroxide and fluoride ions gopal and elango 2007 reported that at alkaline ph decrease in fluoride adsorption occurs which may be due to the competition between hydroxide and fluoride ions 3 5 adsorption capacity of adsorbent using cyclic study during the cyclic study it was found that the residual fluoride concentration was 0 88 mg l after the first cycle and 4 49 mg l after the fifth cycle the adsorbent was considered to be exhausted after the fifth cycle as the fifth cycle did not show much removal the adsorption capacity of the cement was found to be 0 25 mg g fig 7 shows the plot of residual fluoride concentration in solution after each cycle plotted against a number of adsorption cycle 3 6 study of adsorption kinetics in order to investigate the kinetics of adsorption of fluoride pseudo first order pseudo second order kinetics models were tested with experimental data the value of correlation coefficient r2 for second order kinetics model was equal to 0 97 which is a better fit than the first order kinetics model the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity qe cal 0 09 mg g was found to be equal to the experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity qe exp 0 09 mg g these results suggest that fluoride adsorption follows second order kinetics second order rate constant k2 is 0 07 g min 1mg 1 the plot for pseudo second order kinetics is given in fig 8 table 2 contains a comparison of pseudo first and pseudo second order reaction parameters and correlation coefficients 3 7 effect of coexisting ions fig 9 shows the effect of co existing ions on the fluoride adsorption from results it was observed that there is no significant effect of sulphate chloride and nitrate on the fluoride adsorption carbonate and bicarbonate ions showed a significant negative effect on fluoride adsorption kagne et al 2008 too observed that bicarbonate and carbonate ions have a negative effect on fluoride adsorption this negative effect may be due to the competition of co ions with fluoride ion for active adsorption site 3 8 removal of fluoride from groundwater using adsorbent till now the above studies have used synthetically prepared fluoride water in the laboratory further studies were conducted on groundwater taken from an indian village to test the efficiency of the adsorbent results of groundwater analysis table 3 shows that the fluoride content in the groundwater sample was more than the upper permissible limit of indian drinking water standards is10500 2012 fluoride concentration beyond the potable limit of 1 5 mg l has been reported in mathura district of uttar pradesh by central groundwater board of india cgwb 1999 for groundwater when the time profile of fluoride adsorption study was plotted it was observed that fluoride removal rate was faster for first 9 h and reduced gradually up to 27 h fig 10 the value of residual fluoride in groundwater was 2 32 mg l after 27 h as compared to 0 68 mg l observed in case of synthetic water removal of fluoride in case of groundwater was less and this could be due to higher ph of groundwater and the presence of other ions in the groundwater kagne et al 2008 it must be noted that in the case of groundwater the residual fluoride concentration is higher than the permissible limit whereas in the case of synthetic water the residual fluoride concentration is within the permissible limit during the treatment the ph value of groundwater was observed to have increased from an initial value of 8 08 to a final value of 9 83 in the first 3 h the final ph value observed was 10 45 after 12 h of treatment this shows that the fluoride removal process increases the ph value of groundwater such an increase in ph was also observed in the case of synthetic water 3 9 alum lime dose optimization for removing fluoride from groundwater using nalgonda technique it is important to understand the efficiency of other widely practiced techniques on the same groundwater to give us a comparative understanding of our proposed method therefore nalgonda technique was used to treat the same groundwater for treating the groundwater by nalgonda technique alum and lime doses were optimized for the groundwater jar test apparatus was used for slow 34 rpm for 15 minutes and rapid 145 rpm for 1 minute mixing fluoride removal increased on increasing the dose of alum from 125 mg l to 1000 mg l however fluoride removal decreased on further increasing the dose of alum a minimum residual fluoride concentration of 1 90 mg l was obtained at 1000 mg l dose of alum for an initial fluoride concentration of 5 06 mg l so the optimum dose of alum was considered to be 1 g l at 1000 mg l dose of alum ph of the groundwater was reduced to 6 11 from an initial ph of 8 08 the lime dose was optimized for a fixed alum dose of 1 g l lime dose optimization data is given in fig 11 doses of lime varying from 25 to 150 mg l were applied to six different beakers having rotating paddles for stirring action the optimized dose of alum 1 g l was applied to each beaker fluoride concentration was reduced to 1 92 mg l from an initial concentration of 5 06 mg l at a lime dose of 25 mg l maximum removal occurred at a lime dose of 125 mg l with a residual fluoride concentration of 1 44 mg l at lime dose higher than 25 mg l residual fluoride concentration remained almost constant even up to a lime dose of 125 mg l the lime dose of 125 mg l was selected as an optimum dose because at this dose ph and residual fluoride of the solution were within the limits of indian drinking water standards is10500 2012 so the optimized doses of lime and alum for the groundwater are 125 mg l and 1 g l respectively 4 conclusion in the study with synthetic water it was found that mud pot with cement paste layer on its inner surface can reduce fluoride concentration up to 0 68 mg l from an initial concentration of 5 mg l after a retention time of 27 h thus an appreciable fluoride removal of 86 was obtained for synthetic water as calculated from the cyclic study results the adsorption capacity of the cement used in this study was found to be 0 25 mg g the ph of treated water increased from an initial ph of 6 64 to a final ph of 11 89 adsorption kinetics follows pseudo second order kinetics with a second order rate constant of 0 07 g min 1mg 1 presence of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in water showed a negative effect on fluoride adsorption further in the study with groundwater it was found that nalgonda technique can reduce fluoride up to 1 44 mg l with a final ph of 6 53 at lime and alum dose of 125 mg l and 1 g l respectively for an initial fluoride concentration of 5 06 mg l a fluoride removal of 71 54 was obtained with residual ph and fluoride concentration within the limit of indian drinking water standards is10500 in the case of adsorption observed values of residual fluoride concentration 2 23 mg l and ph 10 45 were more than the limits of indian drinking water standards however due to low cost zero production of sludge and easy availability of portland pozzolana cement and mud pots ppc as adsorbent used in the present study can be chosen to develop a technique in combination with other defluoridation technique to reduce cost therefore it is suggested to use ppc as an adsorbent in combination with the nalgonda technique to treat the groundwater this combination is expected to bring residual ph and fluoride concentration within the limits of indian drinking water standards

showed significant removal over a wide range of ph 2 12 and highest defluoridation was obtained at a ph of 2 the kinetic study revealed that adsorption of fluoride follows pseudo second order kinetics

adopted among other precipitation methods of defluoridation portland pozzolana cement is cheaper than ordinary portland cement opc because pozzolanas are cheaply and widely available as wastes volcanic ash fly ash slag etc the present study investigated efficiency and feasibility of adsorbent made from ppc paste coating on mud pot on defluoridation of groundwater collected from a hand pump of an indian village karahari mathura uttar pradesh so as to develop a household container using ppc coated mud pot the primary goal of the research work was to study i effect of initial ph hydration time coexisting ions chloride carbonate bicarbonate sulphate and nitrate and overall efficiency of cement paste defluoridation from fluoride spiked distilled water ii collection and characterization of groundwater from a chosen site iii the efficiency of portland pozzolana cement ppc on defluoridation of groundwater iv dose optimization of various chemicals for fluoride removal by nalgonda technique for the same groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this project were analytical reagent ar grade milli q water having ph of 6 64 was used to prepare all the standard solutions fly ash based portland pozzolana cement ppc and mud pots were purchased from the local market the chemical composition of portland pozzolana cement ppc is given in table 1 grade 1 whatman filter paper whatman 1001 125 was used to filter water samples 2 2 methods fluoride stock solution of 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving 2 21 g naf salt in 1 l milli q water the desired working solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution appropriate number of times the concentration of fluoride throughout the study was determined using the spadns method 2 2 1 adsorbent preparation in the present study it was expected that if a layer of cement paste is provided on the inner surface of the mud pots then the surface area of the adsorbent will increase and this increase in the surface area will enhance the percentage removal of fluoride portland pozzolana cement ppc paste was coated on the inner surface of the mud pots up to a level sufficient to contain 1 l of water cement paste was prepared by adding the required volume of milli q water to arrive at a water cement ratio of 0 4 after coating mud pots were kept for air drying at room temperature the methodology of adsorbent preparation is given in fig 1 fig 2 shows a picture of a mud pot before and after the cement coating 2 2 2 effect of hydration time on defluoridation the inner surface of each of the four mud pots was coated with 50 g cement paste all the mud pots were kept for hydration of the cement first pot for one day a second pot for two days a third pot for three days and fourth pot for four days after the respective hydration period 1 l synthetic fluoride water of 5 mg l concentration was poured in each mud pot and samples were collected after 30 h of contact time all samples were filtered and analyzed for the residual fluoride concentration 2 2 3 batch adsorption study for conducting batch adsorption study a specified amount of cement paste was coated on the inner surface of the required number of mud pots after 3 days of hydration 1 l water having 5 mg l fluoride was poured into each mud pot water in the mud pots was not agitated samples were taken from the pots at equilibrium contact time the samples were filtered through filter paper and analyzed for residual fluoride concentration the batch studies were conducted at room temperature 27 2 c a similar procedure was followed to determine the effect of contact time adsorbent dose co existing ions and initial ph 2 2 3 1 effect of adsorbent dose and initial ph adsorbent doses of 25 50 75 100 and 125 g were coated in 5 mud pots and treated water samples were collected after 27 h of adsorption residual concentration in each sample was found for each dose this method gave us the optimum adsorbent dose in order to identify the effect of ph of water fluoride solutions of 2 4 6 8 10 12 and 13 ph were prepared and poured into 7 mud pots at an optimum adsorbent dose samples were collected after 27 h of the treatment and residual fluoride concentration was recorded 2 2 3 2 effect of coexisting ions due to the presence of anions and cations in water it is expected that columbic repulsion forces between anions and fluoride ions would be enhanced or anions would compete with fluoride ions for active sites on the adsorbent surface the influence of coexisting ions such as sulphate chloride nitrate carbonate and bicarbonate on fluoride adsorption was studied binary solutions each having 5 mg l of fluoride ions and varying concentration of one of the anions sulphate carbonate bicarbonate nitrate and chloride were prepared the varying concentrations were 10 30 50 100 150 mg l for the other anions a blank solution having 5 mg l fluoride concentration of was also prepared at a time five binary solutions and one blank solution containing only fluoride ions were poured into six different mud pots for studying the effect of the co existing ion on adsorption residual fluoride concentrations after 27 h were analyzed for checking the effect of each co existing anion on adsorption 2 2 4 adsorption capacity of adsorbent using cyclic study in order to conduct a cyclic study to measure adsorbent capacity water having fluoride concentration of 5 mg l was treated in cycles with mud pots lined with the adsorbent the pots remained same however a fresh volume of water was used in every cycle the residual fluoride concentration in the solution after each cycle of the experiment was measured and the adsorption capacity of the lined pots at each cycle was calculated using the equation q t c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce are the fluoride concentrations mg l in the solution at time zero and any time t respectively q t is the amount of fluoride adsorbed per unit mass mg g of the adsorbent m is the mass of adsorbent g and v is the volume of water l this process was repeated up to a cycle at which adsorbent got completely exhausted which was observed when the initial and residual concentration did not change much after the treatment the adsorption capacity of adsorbent after exhaustion was calculated by mass balance 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of hydration time fluoride adsorption with respect to different hydration time of cement coating is given in fig 3 highest removal of fluoride was found at hydration time of 3 days after 3 days of hydration removal of fluoride was decreased this decrease in removal of fluoride may be due to a decrease in the porosity of hydrated cement paste with an increase in hydration time kagne et al 2008 has also reported better removal of fluoride at 3 days hydration of cement by using cement granules as adsorbent media 3 2 kinetic study the time profile of adsorption of fluoride along with the variation in ph is presented in fig 4 it was observed that the removal of fluoride was faster for the first 6 h after that removal rate gradually slowed till 27 h no significant removal was noticed after 27 h of contact time after 27 h residual fluoride concentration was 0 68 mg l thus around 86 removal of fluoride was obtained in this duration yadav et al 2006 bandyopadhyay et al 2009 and lamayi et al 2018 have also reported similar trends of fluoride removal using brick powder broken concrete cubes and al2o3 zro2 as adsorbents respectively the initial high rate of removal reveals a high adsorption uptake of fluoride ions by the adsorbent which may be due to availability of vacant sites on the adsorbent surface after 6 h the uptake rate was reduced which might be due to a decrease in a number of sufficient active site as well as the expected decrease in uptake due to the reduction of the solute in water no significant removal was noticed in the last stage after 27 h it may be due to exhaustion of active sites this last stage indicates the saturation or equilibrium stage when the adsorption uptake was almost negligible so 27 h time was considered as the equilibrium time for further experiments it was also observed that the ph of the water increased from an initial ph of 6 64 to a final ph of around 12 after 12 h hydration phases of pozzolana blended cement are similar to that of ordinary portland cement yousuf et al 1995 upon hydration cement produces calcium silicate hydrates c s h gel and calcium hydroxide portlandite and ettringite removal of fluoride may be due to adsorption of fluoride ions on the surface of calcium silicate hydrate gel portlandite and ettringite kang et al 2007 has also reported that various calcium bearing hydrates i e calcium silicate hydrate gel portlandite and ettringite present in the cement paste remove fluoride from water by adsorption 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose from fig 5 it is clear that at 50 g dose maximum removal of fluoride occurs at this dose residual fluoride concentration is 1 08 mg l after 50 g dose there was no incremental removal of fluoride at higher doses of the adsorbent it may be due to the overlapping of active sites at a higher dosage as well as the decrease in the effective surface area resulting in the conglomeration of exchanger particles lamayi et al 2018 kagne et al 2008 so 50 g l dose was found as an optimum dose for all further experiments at 50 g dose of cement paste approximate thickness of the cement layer inside of the mud pot was calculated the approximate thickness of the cement layer was found to be 0 80 0 20 mm 3 4 effect of initial ph fig 6 shows the effect of initial ph on fluoride removal it was observed that adsorbent can bring down the level of fluoride within the limits of drinking water standards over a wide range of ph 2 12 in earlier researches too hydrated cement has shown significant fluoride removal over a wide range of ph 3 10 kagne et al 2008 ppc as an adsorbent can remove fluoride in acidic ph ranges and highest removal occurs at ph 2 as observed in this study this highest removal of fluoride at acidic ph may be due to the presence of alumina kagne et al 2008 however at high alkaline ph removal of fluoride gets decreased sharply this decrease in fluoride removal may be due to competition between hydroxide and fluoride ions gopal and elango 2007 reported that at alkaline ph decrease in fluoride adsorption occurs which may be due to the competition between hydroxide and fluoride ions 3 5 adsorption capacity of adsorbent using cyclic study during the cyclic study it was found that the residual fluoride concentration was 0 88 mg l after the first cycle and 4 49 mg l after the fifth cycle the adsorbent was considered to be exhausted after the fifth cycle as the fifth cycle did not show much removal the adsorption capacity of the cement was found to be 0 25 mg g fig 7 shows the plot of residual fluoride concentration in solution after each cycle plotted against a number of adsorption cycle 3 6 study of adsorption kinetics in order to investigate the kinetics of adsorption of fluoride pseudo first order pseudo second order kinetics models were tested with experimental data the value of correlation coefficient r2 for second order kinetics model was equal to 0 97 which is a better fit than the first order kinetics model the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity qe cal 0 09 mg g was found to be equal to the experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity qe exp 0 09 mg g these results suggest that fluoride adsorption follows second order kinetics second order rate constant k2 is 0 07 g min 1mg 1 the plot for pseudo second order kinetics is given in fig 8 table 2 contains a comparison of pseudo first and pseudo second order reaction parameters and correlation coefficients 3 7 effect of coexisting ions fig 9 shows the effect of co existing ions on the fluoride adsorption from results it was observed that there is no significant effect of sulphate chloride and nitrate on the fluoride adsorption carbonate and bicarbonate ions showed a significant negative effect on fluoride adsorption kagne et al 2008 too observed that bicarbonate and carbonate ions have a negative effect on fluoride adsorption this negative effect may be due to the competition of co ions with fluoride ion for active adsorption site 3 8 removal of fluoride from groundwater using adsorbent till now the above studies have used synthetically prepared fluoride water in the laboratory further studies were conducted on groundwater taken from an indian village to test the efficiency of the adsorbent results of groundwater analysis table 3 shows that the fluoride content in the groundwater sample was more than the upper permissible limit of indian drinking water standards is10500 2012 fluoride concentration beyond the potable limit of 1 5 mg l has been reported in mathura district of uttar pradesh by central groundwater board of india cgwb 1999 for groundwater when the time profile of fluoride adsorption study was plotted it was observed that fluoride removal rate was faster for first 9 h and reduced gradually up to 27 h fig 10 the value of residual fluoride in groundwater was 2 32 mg l after 27 h as compared to 0 68 mg l observed in case of synthetic water removal of fluoride in case of groundwater was less and this could be due to higher ph of groundwater and the presence of other ions in the groundwater kagne et al 2008 it must be noted that in the case of groundwater the residual fluoride concentration is higher than the permissible limit whereas in the case of synthetic water the residual fluoride concentration is within the permissible limit during the treatment the ph value of groundwater was observed to have increased from an initial value of 8 08 to a final value of 9 83 in the first 3 h the final ph value observed was 10 45 after 12 h of treatment this shows that the fluoride removal process increases the ph value of groundwater such an increase in ph was also observed in the case of synthetic water 3 9 alum lime dose optimization for removing fluoride from groundwater using nalgonda technique it is important to understand the efficiency of other widely practiced techniques on the same groundwater to give us a comparative understanding of our proposed method therefore nalgonda technique was used to treat the same groundwater for treating the groundwater by nalgonda technique alum and lime doses were optimized for the groundwater jar test apparatus was used for slow 34 rpm for 15 minutes and rapid 145 rpm for 1 minute mixing fluoride removal increased on increasing the dose of alum from 125 mg l to 1000 mg l however fluoride removal decreased on further increasing the dose of alum a minimum residual fluoride concentration of 1 90 mg l was obtained at 1000 mg l dose of alum for an initial fluoride concentration of 5 06 mg l so the optimum dose of alum was considered to be 1 g l at 1000 mg l dose of alum ph of the groundwater was reduced to 6 11 from an initial ph of 8 08 the lime dose was optimized for a fixed alum dose of 1 g l lime dose optimization data is given in fig 11 doses of lime varying from 25 to 150 mg l were applied to six different beakers having rotating paddles for stirring action the optimized dose of alum 1 g l was applied to each beaker fluoride concentration was reduced to 1 92 mg l from an initial concentration of 5 06 mg l at a lime dose of 25 mg l maximum removal occurred at a lime dose of 125 mg l with a residual fluoride concentration of 1 44 mg l at lime dose higher than 25 mg l residual fluoride concentration remained almost constant even up to a lime dose of 125 mg l the lime dose of 125 mg l was selected as an optimum dose because at this dose ph and residual fluoride of the solution were within the limits of indian drinking water standards is10500 2012 so the optimized doses of lime and alum for the groundwater are 125 mg l and 1 g l respectively 4 conclusion in the study with synthetic water it was found that mud pot with cement paste layer on its inner surface can reduce fluoride concentration up to 0 68 mg l from an initial concentration of 5 mg l after a retention time of 27 h thus an appreciable fluoride removal of 86 was obtained for synthetic water as calculated from the cyclic study results the adsorption capacity of the cement used in this study was found to be 0 25 mg g the ph of treated water increased from an initial ph of 6 64 to a final ph of 11 89 adsorption kinetics follows pseudo second order kinetics with a second order rate constant of 0 07 g min 1mg 1 presence of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in water showed a negative effect on fluoride adsorption further in the study with groundwater it was found that nalgonda technique can reduce fluoride up to 1 44 mg l with a final ph of 6 53 at lime and alum dose of 125 mg l and 1 g l respectively for an initial fluoride concentration of 5 06 mg l a fluoride removal of 71 54 was obtained with residual ph and fluoride concentration within the limit of indian drinking water standards is10500 in the case of adsorption observed values of residual fluoride concentration 2 23 mg l and ph 10 45 were more than the limits of indian drinking water standards however due to low cost zero production of sludge and easy availability of portland pozzolana cement and mud pots ppc as adsorbent used in the present study can be chosen to develop a technique in combination with other defluoridation technique to reduce cost therefore it is suggested to use ppc as an adsorbent in combination with the nalgonda technique to treat the groundwater this combination is expected to bring residual ph and fluoride concentration within the limits of indian drinking water standards 
12261,the contamination of several trace elements tes in groundwater is one of the most environmental issues associated with sustainable development in many countries including bangladesh therefore this study aims to elucidate source apportionment of contamination and their potential health risk in rangpur district bangladesh using multivariate statistics and monte carlo simulation the results of the study showed that the average concentrations of iron manganese and barium were exceeded the permissible limits for drinking water set by who and bangladesh standards however the analysis for sources of contamination index principal component analysis correlation coefficient and cluster analysis ca revealed that geogenic sources were much contributed than anthropogenic activities for elevating concentrations of tes in the study area both r mode and q mode of ca was used to show the relationship between the location of the clusters and the sources of contamination the results of non carcinogenic risk evaluation revealed that hazard index hi values for both age groups were exceeded the safe limits 1 0 in several locations set by us epa suggesting a reasonable human health risk the carcinogenic risk value for as exposure surpassed the us epa range of 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 with higher risk for children compared to adults an uncertainty study showed that the concentration of as was the most sensitive parameter affecting the potential health risk in a whole arsenic in drinking water may pose health impacts to some extent in local residents thus special attention and groundwater monitoring should focus on as contamination in groundwater of the study region graphical abstract image 1 keywords source apportionment arsenic contamination trace elements pca rangpur district 1 introduction groundwater contamination with the elevated concentrations of trace elements tes has attracted more and more attention worldwide in recent decades due to anthropogenic activities rahman et al 2017a fallahzadeh et al 2017 jia et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 the increase in anthropogenic input may elevate the concentration of several trace elements such as arsenic as manganese mn and barium ba in groundwater which are posed a potential risk to human health and natural ecosystem islam et al 2017a saha et al 2018 huang et al 2018 groundwater contamination is the main hindrance for sustainable water resources therefore identification of the source of groundwater contamination is important for protecting this precious resource dey et al 2017 ahmed et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2019a generally two types of sources are responsible for the deterioration of groundwater quality the geogenic sources include weathering of parent rock or mineral rock water interaction dissolution ion leaching and exchange islam et al 2017b and anthropogenic sources e g increased population growth municipal wastes fertilizers and pesticides from the agricultural system rapid industrialization and fast urbanization bhattacharya et al 2002 wagh et al 2017 islam et al 2018 bodrud doza et al 2019b however poor water quality is associated with public health concerns primarily resulting in the spread of water borne diseases water related problem is the major cause for spreading these water borne diseases in human who 2011 this situation threatens local people s health thus it is necessary to perform research on the potential source apportionment of groundwater contaminants particularly tes in groundwater systems and associated with health risks groundwater is mainly used in our daily life for cooking drinking and bathing a small quantity of essential tes in groundwater can help in proper functioning of the human body but in excess and expose in long period time can be toxic to human health islam et al 2017c li et al 2018 the tes of water reach human systems through oral ingestion inhalation and dermal adsorption pathways furthermore different tes can be transported through the groundwater infiltrate into the aquifer systems because of the discrepancies in the sources long range transportation long residence time and the contents of different tes can fluctuate significantly from one region to another region tripathee et al 2014 tes pollution particularly arsenic pollution in groundwater has become of increasing global concern this is true for bangladesh where arsenic pollution in groundwater has been widely studied bgs and dphe 2001 bhattacharya et al 2002 harvey et al 2002 reza et al 2010 islam et al 2017c ahmed et al 2019 these previous studies in bangladesh have been frequently reported that excess intake of arsenic from groundwater via drinking and dermal pathways can cause various diseases e g cancer melanosis hyperkeratosis gangrene and hypertension diseases islam et al 2015 rahman et al 2017a and skin cancer islam et al 2017c similarly oral ingestion of mn through drinking water might have potential impacts such as alzheimer s disease dieter et al 2005 annaduzzaman et al 2018 and mental disorder of adolescent children wasserman et al 2006 thus human health risk via ingestion and dermal routes to groundwater contaminants cannot be neglected because of various geogenic and anthropogenic sources groundwater contamination with tes and their impacts on human health are reasonably changeable in space and time it is vital to assess the human health risks of tes in the groundwater systems through oral and dermal routes and to safeguard the residents in terms of health hazard perspective in general univariate and multivariate techniques are usually applied for interpreting large and complex datasets into an easy and simple way to a better understand the concentration of tes in groundwater from the designated locations biswas et al 2012 bodrud doza et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019a these techniques allow the apportionment of probable sources that contribute to sustainable groundwater management and also provide a useful tool for identifying a common source of tes in groundwater rahman et al 2017b islam et al 2017a conducted a study to assess spatial variations of tes of groundwater northern part of bangladesh using several statistical approaches so far there have been no detailed studies on the source apportionment of tes associated with health risk in the rangpur district northern bangladesh this embodies a potential knowledge gap for understanding the probable impacts of tes in the groundwater systems for human health nevertheless due to rapid urbanization and improper management of solid wastewater in the study area over population growth and economic development in bangladesh high contents of tes in groundwater and the corresponding potential health risk for the environment and residents are presumed a significant numbers of researchers have focused on health risks associated with tes in drinking water in various regions of the world karim 2011 wongsasuluk et al 2014 lu et al 2015 vetrimurugan et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 tirkey et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 and little such works have been conducted in bangladesh islam et al 2017c rahman et al 2017a but unfortunately no work has so far been done in this study area however this study aims to elucidate the sources of tes in drinking water and associated health risk in rangpur district bangladesh using multivariate statistics health risk model and monte carlo simulation furthermore sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the most sensitive parameters on the potential health risk it has been anticipated that identifying the sources of tes in groundwater and assessing health risk of these elements would be helpful for protecting of groundwater resources from contamination in the local residents of rangpur district bangladesh 2 data and methods 2 1 study area description rangpur district 25 18 n to 25 56 n and 88 58 n to 89 30 e encompasses the northern region of bangladesh has been chosen for this study fig 1 it includes eight upazilas the smallest administrative unit namely 1 rangpur sadar 2 pirgachha 3 mithapukur 4 pirganj 5 badarganj 6 taraganj 7 gangachara and 8 kaunia these eight upazilas are important agrarian bases mostly producing rice jute fruits and wheat the total populations of about 4 8 million cover an area of 3090 40 km2 bbs 2016 the investigated area experiences a subtropical climate with the mean annual temperatures of 27 28 c the annual rainfall ranged from 1200 to 1700 mm on average which occurs primarily in july august and september respectively bmd 2018 the evapotranspiration in rangpur district varied from 600 to 800 mm this mainly occurs from october to december physiographically it is an alluvial plain with slightly elevated pleistocene terraces which slope towards the south and southeast bgs and dphe 2001 rahman and islam 2019 the overall topography of the study area is more or less flat with an elevation of 32 m above the average sea level land use pattern is mostly agricultural farm land that contains fertile soil islam et al 2014 approximately 80 of the areas are composed of alluvial recent soil and the rest of barind clay geologically the study area contains the rangpur saddle under the indian platform in the sub section of bengal basin bangladesh akhter et al 2019 hydrogeologically the studied area occupies the upper shallow aquifer which is the part of the uplift zone of rangpur saddle the lower part of the aquifer is composed of silt and clay at the bottom and fine sand at the top the lithology of the area concealed under the thin veneer of alluvium alluvium is made up of a variety of material such as silt sand clay and gravel it is usually deposited at the lower portion of the river course salam et al 2019 most of the areas comprise the unconsolidated river borne alluviums and semi consolidated sediment in shallow aquifers the late pleistocene to early holocene aquifer layers is illustrated by coarse grained sands with widespread gravels the plio pleistocene aquifer consists of dupi tila sand formation overlay by the thick silty clay formation of pleistocene time period nevertheless groundwater is mainly extracted for domestic and agricultural purposes and the remaining for drinking uses islam et al 2017a 2 2 sample collection and analytical procedures in the study we collected 47 samples on the vicinity of the urban roadside at a depth range of 10 53 m based on pre selected sampling sites during the dry season april to june in 2016 because dry months are usually hot the utilization and extraction of groundwater are high in the dry season and groundwater recharge is very low because of lack of rainfall and also groundwater level has significantly declined in each year in that season however during the wet season more groundwater recharge and groundwater table are uplifted and rainwater harvesting technique is also used some residents in the study area the local government engineering department lged and well owners were helped to gather information about well depths the samples were obtained accordingly and stored in prewashed bottles each sample was preserved in three bottles at each sample site following the standard procedures apha 2005 six trace elements e g as fe mn al zn and ba in groundwater samples were analyzed directly through the flame atomic absorption spectrometer f aas a 7000 shimadzu japan and the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer gf aas a 7000 shimadzu japan the standard limits of detection lods for as fe mn zn br and al were 0 005 10 0 039 1 652 7 0 and 2 μg l 1 respectively the standard reference materials srm 1640 and srm 1643e of usa were adopted to confirm the investigative accuracy of the data and outcomes used as a part of the quality control each sample was examined four times and these standards were employed as test references material after every 10 samples the srms were provided between 90 and 100 recovery percentage with 2 standard deviation sd inferring that the precision of the data in this study was quite well 2 3 human health risk assessment by us epa models six trace elements in groundwater were employed to evaluate the health risks via drinking and dermal routes of water for the residents of eight upozilas in rangpur district bangladesh the non carcinogenic risk hq and the lifetime cancer risk cr associated with the studied trace elements in this research were evaluated using traditional us epa 2004 models 2 3 1 hazard quotient hq hazard quotient is an estimation of the risk non carcinogenic due to pollutant exposure islam et al 2017c li et al 2018 usepa 2017 zhang et al 2018 the non carcinogenic risks ncr of the analyzed tes in drinking water are computed by the following eq 1 as hazard quotient hq 1 hq cdi ncrfd in this study cdi and ncrfd are the average of chronic daily intake mg l 1 and non carcinogenic reference dose μg kg 1 day 1 for a given trace elements respectively the ncrfd values for the six tes e g as fe mn zn al and ba are 0 3 300 20 300 1000 200 μg kg 1 day 1 respectively for oral ingestion pathway and as 0 123 μg kg 1 day 1 fe 45 μg kg 1 day 1 mn 0 8 μg kg 1 day 1 and al 100 μg kg 1 day 1 for dermal exposure pathway karim 2011 usepa 2017 2 3 2 hazard index hi hazard index hi is defined as the total of potential hazard quotient hq posed by estimated trace elements eq 2 of hi is given below 2 hi hq 1 hq 2 hq n 2 3 3 carcinogenic risk cr the carcinogenic risk cr is measured as a lifetime cancer risk by multiply chronic daily intake cdi and cancer slope factor csf which is measured by incorporated risk info system iris as the below eq 3 3 cr cdi csf the chronic daily intake cdi via both ingestion and dermal routes is computed by the following eqs 4 and 5 4 cdi oral cw ir ed ef bw at 5 c d i d e r m a l c w i r e d e f b w a t where cw is the concentration of the trace elements in groundwater μg l 1 ir is the daily ingestion rate of drinking water lday 1 ed is the exposure duration year ef is the exposure frequency day year 1 bw is the average body weight kg and at is the average time days as the review of earlier literature and the standard values set by us epa 2004 the input parameters associated with the estimation of cdi cr hq and hi were employed in this study the values of ir ed bw at and ef employed in the previous studies are 2 2 l day 1 for adults and 1 l day 1 for children 70 years for adults and 10 years for children 70 kg for adults and 25 kg for children bodrud doza et al 2019b 25 550 days for adults and 3650 days for children and 365 day year 1 for both age groups respectively us epa 2004 karim 2011 however arsenic chromium and nickel are known as a contributor to the development of cancer on the basis of the epidemiologic evidence and beryllium cadmium lead nickel zinc and iron have been also recognized to be carcinogenic elements carcinogenic elements are defined as a substance or agent that tends to produce cancer the csf value for as is 1 5 mg kg day 1 for ingestion pathway and 3 66 mg kg day 1 for dermal exposure route was recommended by us epa 2004 the csf values were not found for other trace elements calculated in this study hence the cancer risk was computed only for arsenic uncertainty and unpredictability can remain in the health risk model thus a potential health risk model based on the monte carlo simulation technique was employed in the present study the findings of conventional health risk model were compared with the potential health risk model using monte carlo simulation to evaluate how much impact of input parameter uncertainty additionally a sensitivity analysis method was deployed to estimate the comparative contribution of input parameters geng et al 2016 which can affect cancer risk calculation in a known set of assumptions the cancer risk cr assessment was performed by the monte carlo simulation model using the software crystal ball version 11 1 2 3 lu et al 2015 geng et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 furthermore the spatial distribution patterns of human health risk through groundwater consumption via different routes exhibit heterogeneity in the study an inverse distance weighting idw interpolation technique was applied to demonstrate the spatial distributions of tes health risk for both age groups in the designated study area the justification for using the idw is that it can interpolate easily and simple way with minimal error which has been widely employed in the past studies for spatial distribution of groundwater quality in northwest bangladesh as well as determination of groundwater quality index of sylhet district using gis technique islam et al 2017b ahmed et al 2019 2 4 statistical analyses to explain the relationship among individual tes sources multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca are generally applied in hydrogeological studies bodrud doza et al 2016 rahman et al 2017b islam et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 the pca a source apportionment technique was used to find qualitative information about the potential sources of tes in groundwater without interpreting the quantitative information it reduces the dimensionality of dataset to produce new dormant variables which are orthogonal and uncorrelated to each other and extracted in the form of the eigenvalues nkansah et al 2010 on the other hand the ca was used to detect classes or clusters of similar sites based on similarities within a group and dissimilarities between various groups lattin et al 2003 a univariate statistical technique like an anova test was used to show the differences among tes which were considered significant at 95 confidence level the dataset was investigated for the assumptions of normality and homogeneity tests in terms of kolmogorov smirnov k s test and the anova test we performed all statistical analyses using spss software version 22 0 in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace element concentrations the concentrations of the studied six trace elements tes in groundwater samples were determined and the basic statistics of six major tes along with the recommended values set by the who 2011 doe 1997 and bis 2012 are outlined in table 1 this study revealed that the concentrations of the studied tes in drinking water samples followed in the sequence e g fe mn ba zn al as respectively which were well agreed with the results of bhuiyan et al 2016 and rahman et al 2017b but disagreed with the findings of reza and jean 2012 this study revealed that as had the lowest concentration followed by al and zn concentrations among the sampling sites the concentrations of fe and mn to some extent surpassed their permissible limits which were about 2 57 and 6 84 times higher than that of their corresponding acceptable limits table 1 the southeastern and southern regions including pirganj and pirgacha upazilas exhibited the high fe and mn fig 1 the main reason is that the high fe and mn occur naturally as a mineral from sediment in these upazilas which are major elements having abundant crustal presence from the chemical weathering of the bedrocks bhattacharya et al 2002 islam et al 2017a bodrud doza et al 2019b the south central and eastern regions e g the mithapukur and kaunia upazila showed the higher concentration of ba than the bangladesh guideline value set by doe 1997 fig 1 these excessive tes concentrations might be an effect of anthropogenic activities merrill et al 2012 reported similar results where the high fe concentrations in drinking water of northern part in bangladesh create a distasteful organoleptic effect the statistical results compared with the bangladesh standard values revealed that no obvious tes pollution was detected in rangpur district except for the concentrations of fe mn and ba table 1 the concentrations of tes were the mean values of 8 80 10 01 as 7726 46 6559 34 fe 684 48 754 74 mn 33 29 38 99 zn 27 44 28 62 al and 44 55 28 60 μg l ba respectively table 1 the skewness was ranged 2 if exceeded it was considered as an extreme condition the concentrations of mn zn al and ba showed highly positive skewed data inferring an extreme condition in the groundwater samples the reason is that these tes concentrations exceeded the skewness range value 2 for the kurtosis all tes concentration belong to leptokurtic 3 except fe concentration the outcomes are echoed with the studies of islam et al 2015 the results are in line with the study of islam et al 2017a where the high contents of fe mn and ba were observed in teesta floodplain of rangpur district bangladesh however these outcomes differ from the results of reza et al 2010 the anova test the most popular statistical approach applied to check the mean differences among the various group of samples where the samples are normally distributed belkhiri and narany 2015 to determine the variations of tes within and between the groundwater the anova was carried out the results showed that there were no significant mean differences in the selected tes e g fe mn as zn al and ba among various sites at p 0 05 supplementary table s1 it exhibits a non significant difference showing that the sampling sites were contributing similarly to the mean tes concentration in groundwater conversely this study indicates that the trace elemental concentrations for different sampling points showed a similar variation supplementary table s2 therefore the isotropic characteristics in the aquifer system may be reasoned for tes contamination in the study area 3 2 source apportionment of tes in groundwater in order to exhibit the associations among the pairs of trace elements the correlation coefficient matrix is used in this study supplementary table s3 arsenic depicts a moderate significant relation with fe and zn r 0 503 r 0 408 p 0 01 and a moderate significant relation with ba r 0 331 p 0 05 while arsenic exhibits a weak positive relation with al and mn r 0 112 r 0 263 p 0 05 these relations depict mix type sources e g natural and anthropogenic sources fe exhibits a strong significant relation with ba r 0 553 p 0 01 whereas fe shows an insignificant relation with other trace elements similar results are reported by the study of haloi and sarma 2012 the contamination of groundwater may be attributed to natural origin from the bedrocks and other non point sources may be due to domestic urban waste and extensive agro practices in the study area mn depicts a weak negative relation with zn r 0 004 p 0 05 while a weak positive relation with al and ba r 0 017 r 0 046 p 0 05 zn shows a weak significant relation with al r 0 301 p 0 05 and an insignificant relation with ba r 0 168 p 0 05 ba exhibits a moderate significant relation with al r 0 449 p 0 01 suggesting a non point source of groundwater contamination this relation may be attributed to the anthropogenic origin as the main sources of groundwater pollution e g small scale industries activities agricultural pesticide and sluggish water it can be assumed that trace elements with a moderate to weak significant relations probably originated from the same kind of sources islam et al 2017a to identify the sources of selected tes in the groundwater systems tes datasets were employed to principal component analysis pca which allowed grouping them using their intrinsic characteristics bodrud doza et al 2016 therefore the pca of the tes data can effectively decrease the contribution of less significant variables for identifying groundwater contaminants however the scree plot was applied to identify the groups to be kept to insight into the basic variable structure fig 2 as given from the scree plot results fig 2a it was found that two pcs were extracted which contributed 56 48 of the total variance table 2 the associations among the analyzed tes in groundwater are displayed in the plot of pc1 versus pc2 fig 2b it is obvious that the tes dataset can be clustered into two numbers of pcs groups based on eigenvalues 1 in the study area fig 2 the first pc elucidating 34 30 of the total variance was strongly positive loaded with al and ba table 2 this pc defined the geogenic origin of the tes through the dissolution of barite and alumino silicate al2o sio4 minerals in the parent rock of aquifer which was confirmed by the moderate correlation with al and ba r ba al 0 449 at 99 confidence level similar observations were reported by islam et al 2017a generally the elevated ba concentrations released into the groundwater from the geogenic source are possibly due to the barite oxidation sakurovs et al 2007 in the deeper aquifer depth 60 m due to the dissolution of barite mineral baso4 in the deep aquifer where bacterial activities are responsible to reduce sulfate mineral baldi et al 1996 on the other hand the high contents of al in groundwater were derived from the point sources which may be due to the dissolution of alumino silicate minerals that found in soil and the bedrock formation which might be responsible for groundwater pollution in the study area islam et al 2017a the zn concentration was moderately loaded which can be derived by anthropogenic inputs like fertilizer application or the leaching of metals from piping and fittings of tube well ceramics industries small scale industrial activities and brick industries bodrud doza et al 2016 the fe had a strong positively correlation with ba at p 0 01 r fe ba 0 553 indicating the geogenic evolution of groundwater like fe oxidation rahman and gagnon 2014b and rainwater through the discharge of secondary salts that seepage into the aquifer which might be the plausible source attributed to groundwater contamination bodrud doza et al 2016 the second pc explained 22 18 of the variance was strongly positive loading with as and mn aqueous arsenic may be originated from the dissolution of carbonate rock in the study site particularly khalish per mine area of pirganj upazila where the release of as might be due to groundwater rock interaction harvey et al 2002 the elevated mn may be released due to chemical weathering of the parent rock and ionic exchange islam et al 2017b in the study area fe was moderately positive loaded originated from natural source that can be released into groundwater by chemical weathering of the bedrock which was also confirmed by the moderate correlation with as r fe as 0 503 at p 0 01 although mn had a weak positive correlation with fe r mn fe 0 025 bacterial activities were also related to releasing mn and fe into the groundwater aquifer islam et al 2013 an interesting result in comparing the pca findings was similar in the pca weight where the concentrations of ba al as and mn revealed the high positive loading in pc1 and pc2 this suggests that similar geogenic source was contributed to groundwater contamination in the study area the analyzed findings indicated that the pca can aid as an important means to recognize the main source distribution influencing groundwater in the designated area 3 3 spatial similarity and distribution among sampling sites in groundwater to show the spatial similarity and grouping among clusters in the groundwater samples the r mode cluster analysis ca was applied based on wards method and squared euclidean distance to predict tes groupings in the groundwater bodrud doza et al 2019b the r model ca was carried out to keep three clusters for tes datasets of analyzed variables and the outcomes were presented in fig 3 a cluster 1 included fe and ba concentrations which might be explained by geogenic processes by bedrock water interaction with ionic exchange into the groundwater the dissolution of fe oxy hydroxide under reducing environments may be release as into groundwater cluster 2 comprised zn and al concentrations which were influenced by anthropogenic inputs such as fertilizers pesticide and bacterial activities that contributed to the groundwater contamination kumar et al 2019 fig 3a cluster 3 contained mn concentration which originated from the natural chemical weathering of the parent rock in this study the ca was quite similar to the pca s result which were described in the earlier part of this section after r model ca q mode ca was performed to recognize the spatial similarities and site groups among the groundwater sample sites specific class exhibited a specific characteristic regarding the studied tes parameters in a sample cluster it divided the 47 sampling points for groundwater into three clusters fig 3b cluster 1 comprised s14 s33 s37 s22 s46 s15 s35 s16 s3 s29 s32 s23 s31 s25 s40 s27 s24 s18 s36 s38 s8 s34 s17 s4 s12 s1 s7 s6 s43 s20 s19 s26 s39 s44 s21 s28 s10 s42 and s30 this cluster 1 was related to groundwater contamination via geogenic evolution of groundwater by the chemical weathering of the bedrock the s1 s3 s4 s6 s7 and s8 sites were found in the proximal part of the urban sewage system shama soundori khal linked to the pleistocene terrace deposit which contaminated by al and zn through anthropogenic activities and the leaching of metals from piping and fittings tube well into the groundwater aquifer on the other hand the s28 s34 s21 s24 s26 and s27 were placed in the distal part which was shown by its linkage distances and contaminated by as fe and mn through natural chemical weathering of bedrocks followed by human activities such as brick industries animal feedings and pesticides cluster 2 had the following 3 sample sites including s2 s5 and s9 whereas clusters 3 comprised 5 sites such as s45 s47 s13 s41 and s11 these sites were less groundwater contaminated may be because of leaching of bedrock and agroecosystem runoffs therefore it was not surprising that clusters 2 and 3 were grouped together into a similar fashion fig 4 also shows the relationship between the location of the clusters and the sources of contamination pathway the cluster map gives better insight of the underlying geochemical processes and anthropogenic inputs responsible for groundwater contamination in the study area the outcomes of spatial distribution are also consistent with the r and q mode analyses in the study area spatial map of the first pc scores revealed a complex spatial pattern where high scores i e values from 0 21 to 3 56 were found at the southern and southwestern parts and low scores i e values from 1 81 to 0 37 were found at the northern and northeastern parts fig 5 a the high score of fe was significantly correlated with ba indicating the geogenic origin the moderate scores were observed in the central regions which comprised moderate scores of al and zn that may be contributed to anthropogenic sources in fact the map exhibited a decreasing trend toward the north this variation may be the non point sources such as fertilizer pesticides and municipal sewage discharges from urban areas the spatial map of the second pc scores showed that the low scores i e values from 1 75 to 0 25 were detected at the central and northern parts while the high scores values from 0 63 to 3 21 were found at the western and northeastern parts fig 5b for example pc2 included very high scores of as and mn were mainly a geogenic origin possibly due to the parent rock groundwater interaction and ionic exchange biswas et al 2012 bodrud doza et al 2019a kumar et al 2019 these outcomes are attained from the similar studies of bhuiyan et al 2016 rahman et al 2017b in southeastern bangladesh the spatial distribution of pc scores of the as mobilization and mn immobilization for each location overlaps in the study area which suggests that this pc factor is occurring in that area however the spatial distribution of second pc scores indicate an occurrence to specific aquifer fig 5b which may indicate that geochemical processes are prevailing in the aquifer in addition relationship between arsenic with trace elements in groundwater depicted an insignificant pair inferring arsenic release into the aquifer which was also further confirmed by pca and ca outcomes described in the earlier section 3 4 human health risk assessment the results of non cr of tes exposure in groundwater through oral and dermal routes for both age groups are shown in fig 6 a and b and the detailed results for each sampling can be found elsewhere supplementary tables s4 and s5 the hq average of oral ingestion and dermal routes peaked for mn and reached its minimum level for al regarding both age groups hq in the study sites was found in the following descending order of mn as fe ba zn al via oral and dermal routes for both age groups respectively supplementary tables s4 s5 s6 and s7 the results showed that children were likely susceptible to as health risk compared to adult e g hq average 1 95 of as was greater than unity in almost all samples indicating non cr impact of tes on children in this area the higher hq mean value may be caused by high arsenic concentration in groundwater and is mostly contributed to rock water interaction and little anthropogenic activities like agrochemicals used in the study area islam et al 2017c in fact hi mean values of all tes via drinking for adults were higher than unity which comprised the 76 59 sample locations fig 7 while children had much higher values 91 48 sample sites of non cr than adults this study also reveals that hi average 1 98 of all sites through oral pathway was greater than 1 demonstrating that the significant non cr was found in the study area supplementary tables s4 and s5 on the contrary hi mean of all sites via dermal exposure pathway was lower than 1 suggesting that there is no substantial non cr in the study region supplementary tables s6 and s7 overall hi from tes was 2 1 times higher for children than adults fig 7 carcinogenic risks cr of the arsenic are illustrated at mean minimum and maximum in supplementary table s8 the mean carcinogenic risks posed by as in groundwater for adults were inferior than those for children resulting in almost 2 times higher combined cr for children compared to adults table s8 although it was observed that most of the samples showed cr far below the tolerable threshold value of 1 0e 04 established by the usepa demonstrating no significant long term health impact for both age groups but the mean cr values through oral ingestion for both age groups were 4 15e 04 and 5 28e 04 respectively which was higher than the maximum reported allowed risk level 1 0e 06 table s8 on the other hand the average cr value via the dermal pathway for both adults and children were 4 61e 06 and 8 16e 06 respectively which was lower than the maximum permissible risk level 1 0e 06 table s9 from this study it suggests that children are more vulnerable to the potential health risk regarding cr or non cr similar results are also found in different regions of bangladesh islam et al 2017c rahman et al 2017a reported that children showed 2 fold higher hi for non cr and 1 fold higher cr than adults the hq values of all tes via oral pathway for children were two orders of magnitudes superior to those of adults supplementary tables s4 and s5 however the hq values of the tes via dermal exposure pathway for children were one fold of magnitudes higher than adults supplementary tables s6 and s7 the findings are alike the most recent related study lu et al 2015 but different from the research works conducted in different regions of china which concluded that the non carcinogenic risk was lower than the cancer risk from heavy metals in drinking water zhang et al 2014 geng et al 2016 though earlier studies reported the minor differences between hi values via oral and dermal exposure pathways islam et al 2017c which were consistent with this finding and this was mainly because of similar absorption factor rahman et al 2017a the risk is higher than 1 for arsenic which might be geogenic activities including rock water interaction and also anthropogenic activities such as the use of pesticides in agricultural field karim 2011 chowdhuri et al 2012 spatial maps of the cr and non cr hi values for two age groups are illustrated in fig 8 in the case of adults the high values of non cr hi 1 were noticed in southern and eastern regions like pirgacha and pirgonj upazilas fig 8a fig 8b demonstrated non cr for children where high hi values were observed in central southwestern and southern regions of mithapukur and pirganj upazilas and the low hi values were detected in northern and northeastern parts of taraganj and gangachara upazilas the higher croral values for adults were found in pirgacha upazila while lower values of croral were observed in northern and northeastern portions including taraganj parts of kaunia rangpur sadar and gangachara upazilas fig 8c on the other hand in case of children it was found that south central and southern regions like badarganj mithapukur and pirganj upazilas were the zone of higher cr values in comparison with other parts of the study area fig 8d the non carcinogenic health risk for both age groups is found in the following order of southern southwestern south central area northern regions of the study area similar spatial patterns were found in the cr maps for both age groups these results are echoed by the findings of rahman et al 2016 and islam et al 2015 the previous studies reported that low to medium cr and non cr for both age groups are due to the elevated as concentration in groundwater which is correlated to fe and other trace elements das et al 2004 the cancer risk associated with the arsenic was studied using the monte carlo simulation model in rangpur district bangladesh the predicted probability of the cancer risk model for arsenic for both age groups are illustrated in rangpur district fig 9 a and b the calculated mean croral value for the arsenic was 8 65e 04 for adults and 1 04e 03 for children respectively which was higher than the priority risk level 10 4 this clearly implies high potential health risks particularly children from arsenic in oral ingestion water suggesting that the arsenic requires devoted attention the findings are similar to the other related studies in bangladesh which confirmed that cr was comparatively higher than non cr from trace element in drinking groundwater karim 2011 islam et al 2017c rahman et al 2017a the 5th percentile value signifies low end exposure risk and 95th percentile value represents the high level of the cancer risk durmusoglu et al 2010 for example the 5th percentile values of the cancer risk were 181 times and 81 times higher than the acceptable risk of 1 in 10 000in children and adults respectively similarly the corresponding estimates of 95th percentile values were observed to be 448 times and 204 times more than the acceptable risk fig 9a and b the estimated risks of 5 and 95 were found as many as 8 14e 04 and 2 04e 03 for adults and 1 93e 03 and 2 44e 03 for children respectively this risk value was also more than the maximum reported acceptable risk level 1 10 6 geng et al 2016 the related results are reported by muhammad et al 2011 in pakistan fallahzadeh et al 2017 in iran tirkey et al 2017 in india and zhang et al 2014 in china the finding of this study was contradictory with the results of lu et al 2015 where an analogous study conducted in shenzhen china and found a lower cancer risk than the present research work although further study is required to validate these outcomes evaluates to the elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater via oral ingestion and dermal exposure routes in rangpur district bangladesh should be considered a quantitative sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of the variability and uncertainty of input parameters on the estimation of lifetime cancer risk such an estimation for the arsenic in the study area showed that three factors arsenic concentration at and bw for adults and two factors arsenic concentration and ef were the most sensitive factors on the lifetime cancer risk the concentration of 89 1 at of 3 2 and bw of 3 2 for adults had the highest positive and negative effects on the lifetime cr estimation compared to other input parameters fig 10 a conversely the concentration of 90 5 and ef of 3 1 for children had the maximum positive impacts on the carcinogenic risk calculation fig 10b a study conducted by lu et al 2015 assessed the sensitivities of health risk through ingestion water in shenzhen china and found that arsenic concentration had the highest positive effect on the lifetime carcinogenic risk another study carried out by fallahzadeh et al 2017 evaluated the human health risk of trace metals concentration through oral ingestion in five cities of iran and revealed that heavy metal concentration and bw were the highest positive and negative effects on the probable cancer estimation similar to the present study 4 conclusion source apportionment and potential health risks of groundwater through oral ingestion and dermal routes from rangpur district in bangladesh in terms of tes concentrations were appraised the results showed that the concentrations of tes had followed in the order of fe and mn ba zn al and as respectively the concentrations of fe mn and ba exceeded the permissible limits for drinking water quality set by the who and the doe finding of this study suggested that fe mn ba and as originated from geogenic sources while zn and al came from anthropogenic activities in fact pca results clearly depicted that geogenic contributions e g hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater and rock water interaction with ionic exchange were much higher than anthropogenic activities which might be responsible for groundwater contamination in the study sites the r mode and q mode of ca was further employed to explain the relationships between the parameters and similarities between observed parameters the non carcinogenic risk evaluation depicted that there were some non carcinogenic risks to humans through oral intake and dermal absorption pathways i e hq oral hq dermal and hi 1 children were more vulnerable than adults to the non carcinogenic risks based on the hq and hi values for both age groups however the carcinogenic risk values of as concentration in the study area surpassed the guideline range values suggested by the us epa 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 overall the sensitivity analysis outcome for the cr of as in both age population was in good agreement with the traditional health risk evaluation outcome in general the results indicate that the concentration of as and the parameters at and bw for adults and concentration of as and the parameter ef for children require special attention in to monitor and proper management strategies to control groundwater contamination

12261,the contamination of several trace elements tes in groundwater is one of the most environmental issues associated with sustainable development in many countries including bangladesh therefore this study aims to elucidate source apportionment of contamination and their potential health risk in rangpur district bangladesh using multivariate statistics and monte carlo simulation the results of the study showed that the average concentrations of iron manganese and barium were exceeded the permissible limits for drinking water set by who and bangladesh standards however the analysis for sources of contamination index principal component analysis correlation coefficient and cluster analysis ca revealed that geogenic sources were much contributed than anthropogenic activities for elevating concentrations of tes in the study area both r mode and q mode of ca was used to show the relationship between the location of the clusters and the sources of contamination the results of non carcinogenic risk evaluation revealed that hazard index hi values for both age groups were exceeded the safe limits 1 0 in several locations set by us epa suggesting a reasonable human health risk the carcinogenic risk value for as exposure surpassed the us epa range of 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 with higher risk for children compared to adults an uncertainty study showed that the concentration of as was the most sensitive parameter affecting the potential health risk in a whole arsenic in drinking water may pose health impacts to some extent in local residents thus special attention and groundwater monitoring should focus on as contamination in groundwater of the study region graphical abstract image 1 keywords source apportionment arsenic contamination trace elements pca rangpur district 1 introduction groundwater contamination with the elevated concentrations of trace elements tes has attracted more and more attention worldwide in recent decades due to anthropogenic activities rahman et al 2017a fallahzadeh et al 2017 jia et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 the increase in anthropogenic input may elevate the concentration of several trace elements such as arsenic as manganese mn and barium ba in groundwater which are posed a potential risk to human health and natural ecosystem islam et al 2017a saha et al 2018 huang et al 2018 groundwater contamination is the main hindrance for sustainable water resources therefore identification of the source of groundwater contamination is important for protecting this precious resource dey et al 2017 ahmed et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2019a generally two types of sources are responsible for the deterioration of groundwater quality the geogenic sources include weathering of parent rock or mineral rock water interaction dissolution ion leaching and exchange islam et al 2017b and anthropogenic sources e g increased population growth municipal wastes fertilizers and pesticides from the agricultural system rapid industrialization and fast urbanization bhattacharya et al 2002 wagh et al 2017 islam et al 2018 bodrud doza et al 2019b however poor water quality is associated with public health concerns primarily resulting in the spread of water borne diseases water related problem is the major cause for spreading these water borne diseases in human who 2011 this situation threatens local people s health thus it is necessary to perform research on the potential source apportionment of groundwater contaminants particularly tes in groundwater systems and associated with health risks groundwater is mainly used in our daily life for cooking drinking and bathing a small quantity of essential tes in groundwater can help in proper functioning of the human body but in excess and expose in long period time can be toxic to human health islam et al 2017c li et al 2018 the tes of water reach human systems through oral ingestion inhalation and dermal adsorption pathways furthermore different tes can be transported through the groundwater infiltrate into the aquifer systems because of the discrepancies in the sources long range transportation long residence time and the contents of different tes can fluctuate significantly from one region to another region tripathee et al 2014 tes pollution particularly arsenic pollution in groundwater has become of increasing global concern this is true for bangladesh where arsenic pollution in groundwater has been widely studied bgs and dphe 2001 bhattacharya et al 2002 harvey et al 2002 reza et al 2010 islam et al 2017c ahmed et al 2019 these previous studies in bangladesh have been frequently reported that excess intake of arsenic from groundwater via drinking and dermal pathways can cause various diseases e g cancer melanosis hyperkeratosis gangrene and hypertension diseases islam et al 2015 rahman et al 2017a and skin cancer islam et al 2017c similarly oral ingestion of mn through drinking water might have potential impacts such as alzheimer s disease dieter et al 2005 annaduzzaman et al 2018 and mental disorder of adolescent children wasserman et al 2006 thus human health risk via ingestion and dermal routes to groundwater contaminants cannot be neglected because of various geogenic and anthropogenic sources groundwater contamination with tes and their impacts on human health are reasonably changeable in space and time it is vital to assess the human health risks of tes in the groundwater systems through oral and dermal routes and to safeguard the residents in terms of health hazard perspective in general univariate and multivariate techniques are usually applied for interpreting large and complex datasets into an easy and simple way to a better understand the concentration of tes in groundwater from the designated locations biswas et al 2012 bodrud doza et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019a these techniques allow the apportionment of probable sources that contribute to sustainable groundwater management and also provide a useful tool for identifying a common source of tes in groundwater rahman et al 2017b islam et al 2017a conducted a study to assess spatial variations of tes of groundwater northern part of bangladesh using several statistical approaches so far there have been no detailed studies on the source apportionment of tes associated with health risk in the rangpur district northern bangladesh this embodies a potential knowledge gap for understanding the probable impacts of tes in the groundwater systems for human health nevertheless due to rapid urbanization and improper management of solid wastewater in the study area over population growth and economic development in bangladesh high contents of tes in groundwater and the corresponding potential health risk for the environment and residents are presumed a significant numbers of researchers have focused on health risks associated with tes in drinking water in various regions of the world karim 2011 wongsasuluk et al 2014 lu et al 2015 vetrimurugan et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 tirkey et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 and little such works have been conducted in bangladesh islam et al 2017c rahman et al 2017a but unfortunately no work has so far been done in this study area however this study aims to elucidate the sources of tes in drinking water and associated health risk in rangpur district bangladesh using multivariate statistics health risk model and monte carlo simulation furthermore sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the most sensitive parameters on the potential health risk it has been anticipated that identifying the sources of tes in groundwater and assessing health risk of these elements would be helpful for protecting of groundwater resources from contamination in the local residents of rangpur district bangladesh 2 data and methods 2 1 study area description rangpur district 25 18 n to 25 56 n and 88 58 n to 89 30 e encompasses the northern region of bangladesh has been chosen for this study fig 1 it includes eight upazilas the smallest administrative unit namely 1 rangpur sadar 2 pirgachha 3 mithapukur 4 pirganj 5 badarganj 6 taraganj 7 gangachara and 8 kaunia these eight upazilas are important agrarian bases mostly producing rice jute fruits and wheat the total populations of about 4 8 million cover an area of 3090 40 km2 bbs 2016 the investigated area experiences a subtropical climate with the mean annual temperatures of 27 28 c the annual rainfall ranged from 1200 to 1700 mm on average which occurs primarily in july august and september respectively bmd 2018 the evapotranspiration in rangpur district varied from 600 to 800 mm this mainly occurs from october to december physiographically it is an alluvial plain with slightly elevated pleistocene terraces which slope towards the south and southeast bgs and dphe 2001 rahman and islam 2019 the overall topography of the study area is more or less flat with an elevation of 32 m above the average sea level land use pattern is mostly agricultural farm land that contains fertile soil islam et al 2014 approximately 80 of the areas are composed of alluvial recent soil and the rest of barind clay geologically the study area contains the rangpur saddle under the indian platform in the sub section of bengal basin bangladesh akhter et al 2019 hydrogeologically the studied area occupies the upper shallow aquifer which is the part of the uplift zone of rangpur saddle the lower part of the aquifer is composed of silt and clay at the bottom and fine sand at the top the lithology of the area concealed under the thin veneer of alluvium alluvium is made up of a variety of material such as silt sand clay and gravel it is usually deposited at the lower portion of the river course salam et al 2019 most of the areas comprise the unconsolidated river borne alluviums and semi consolidated sediment in shallow aquifers the late pleistocene to early holocene aquifer layers is illustrated by coarse grained sands with widespread gravels the plio pleistocene aquifer consists of dupi tila sand formation overlay by the thick silty clay formation of pleistocene time period nevertheless groundwater is mainly extracted for domestic and agricultural purposes and the remaining for drinking uses islam et al 2017a 2 2 sample collection and analytical procedures in the study we collected 47 samples on the vicinity of the urban roadside at a depth range of 10 53 m based on pre selected sampling sites during the dry season april to june in 2016 because dry months are usually hot the utilization and extraction of groundwater are high in the dry season and groundwater recharge is very low because of lack of rainfall and also groundwater level has significantly declined in each year in that season however during the wet season more groundwater recharge and groundwater table are uplifted and rainwater harvesting technique is also used some residents in the study area the local government engineering department lged and well owners were helped to gather information about well depths the samples were obtained accordingly and stored in prewashed bottles each sample was preserved in three bottles at each sample site following the standard procedures apha 2005 six trace elements e g as fe mn al zn and ba in groundwater samples were analyzed directly through the flame atomic absorption spectrometer f aas a 7000 shimadzu japan and the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer gf aas a 7000 shimadzu japan the standard limits of detection lods for as fe mn zn br and al were 0 005 10 0 039 1 652 7 0 and 2 μg l 1 respectively the standard reference materials srm 1640 and srm 1643e of usa were adopted to confirm the investigative accuracy of the data and outcomes used as a part of the quality control each sample was examined four times and these standards were employed as test references material after every 10 samples the srms were provided between 90 and 100 recovery percentage with 2 standard deviation sd inferring that the precision of the data in this study was quite well 2 3 human health risk assessment by us epa models six trace elements in groundwater were employed to evaluate the health risks via drinking and dermal routes of water for the residents of eight upozilas in rangpur district bangladesh the non carcinogenic risk hq and the lifetime cancer risk cr associated with the studied trace elements in this research were evaluated using traditional us epa 2004 models 2 3 1 hazard quotient hq hazard quotient is an estimation of the risk non carcinogenic due to pollutant exposure islam et al 2017c li et al 2018 usepa 2017 zhang et al 2018 the non carcinogenic risks ncr of the analyzed tes in drinking water are computed by the following eq 1 as hazard quotient hq 1 hq cdi ncrfd in this study cdi and ncrfd are the average of chronic daily intake mg l 1 and non carcinogenic reference dose μg kg 1 day 1 for a given trace elements respectively the ncrfd values for the six tes e g as fe mn zn al and ba are 0 3 300 20 300 1000 200 μg kg 1 day 1 respectively for oral ingestion pathway and as 0 123 μg kg 1 day 1 fe 45 μg kg 1 day 1 mn 0 8 μg kg 1 day 1 and al 100 μg kg 1 day 1 for dermal exposure pathway karim 2011 usepa 2017 2 3 2 hazard index hi hazard index hi is defined as the total of potential hazard quotient hq posed by estimated trace elements eq 2 of hi is given below 2 hi hq 1 hq 2 hq n 2 3 3 carcinogenic risk cr the carcinogenic risk cr is measured as a lifetime cancer risk by multiply chronic daily intake cdi and cancer slope factor csf which is measured by incorporated risk info system iris as the below eq 3 3 cr cdi csf the chronic daily intake cdi via both ingestion and dermal routes is computed by the following eqs 4 and 5 4 cdi oral cw ir ed ef bw at 5 c d i d e r m a l c w i r e d e f b w a t where cw is the concentration of the trace elements in groundwater μg l 1 ir is the daily ingestion rate of drinking water lday 1 ed is the exposure duration year ef is the exposure frequency day year 1 bw is the average body weight kg and at is the average time days as the review of earlier literature and the standard values set by us epa 2004 the input parameters associated with the estimation of cdi cr hq and hi were employed in this study the values of ir ed bw at and ef employed in the previous studies are 2 2 l day 1 for adults and 1 l day 1 for children 70 years for adults and 10 years for children 70 kg for adults and 25 kg for children bodrud doza et al 2019b 25 550 days for adults and 3650 days for children and 365 day year 1 for both age groups respectively us epa 2004 karim 2011 however arsenic chromium and nickel are known as a contributor to the development of cancer on the basis of the epidemiologic evidence and beryllium cadmium lead nickel zinc and iron have been also recognized to be carcinogenic elements carcinogenic elements are defined as a substance or agent that tends to produce cancer the csf value for as is 1 5 mg kg day 1 for ingestion pathway and 3 66 mg kg day 1 for dermal exposure route was recommended by us epa 2004 the csf values were not found for other trace elements calculated in this study hence the cancer risk was computed only for arsenic uncertainty and unpredictability can remain in the health risk model thus a potential health risk model based on the monte carlo simulation technique was employed in the present study the findings of conventional health risk model were compared with the potential health risk model using monte carlo simulation to evaluate how much impact of input parameter uncertainty additionally a sensitivity analysis method was deployed to estimate the comparative contribution of input parameters geng et al 2016 which can affect cancer risk calculation in a known set of assumptions the cancer risk cr assessment was performed by the monte carlo simulation model using the software crystal ball version 11 1 2 3 lu et al 2015 geng et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 furthermore the spatial distribution patterns of human health risk through groundwater consumption via different routes exhibit heterogeneity in the study an inverse distance weighting idw interpolation technique was applied to demonstrate the spatial distributions of tes health risk for both age groups in the designated study area the justification for using the idw is that it can interpolate easily and simple way with minimal error which has been widely employed in the past studies for spatial distribution of groundwater quality in northwest bangladesh as well as determination of groundwater quality index of sylhet district using gis technique islam et al 2017b ahmed et al 2019 2 4 statistical analyses to explain the relationship among individual tes sources multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca are generally applied in hydrogeological studies bodrud doza et al 2016 rahman et al 2017b islam et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 the pca a source apportionment technique was used to find qualitative information about the potential sources of tes in groundwater without interpreting the quantitative information it reduces the dimensionality of dataset to produce new dormant variables which are orthogonal and uncorrelated to each other and extracted in the form of the eigenvalues nkansah et al 2010 on the other hand the ca was used to detect classes or clusters of similar sites based on similarities within a group and dissimilarities between various groups lattin et al 2003 a univariate statistical technique like an anova test was used to show the differences among tes which were considered significant at 95 confidence level the dataset was investigated for the assumptions of normality and homogeneity tests in terms of kolmogorov smirnov k s test and the anova test we performed all statistical analyses using spss software version 22 0 in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace element concentrations the concentrations of the studied six trace elements tes in groundwater samples were determined and the basic statistics of six major tes along with the recommended values set by the who 2011 doe 1997 and bis 2012 are outlined in table 1 this study revealed that the concentrations of the studied tes in drinking water samples followed in the sequence e g fe mn ba zn al as respectively which were well agreed with the results of bhuiyan et al 2016 and rahman et al 2017b but disagreed with the findings of reza and jean 2012 this study revealed that as had the lowest concentration followed by al and zn concentrations among the sampling sites the concentrations of fe and mn to some extent surpassed their permissible limits which were about 2 57 and 6 84 times higher than that of their corresponding acceptable limits table 1 the southeastern and southern regions including pirganj and pirgacha upazilas exhibited the high fe and mn fig 1 the main reason is that the high fe and mn occur naturally as a mineral from sediment in these upazilas which are major elements having abundant crustal presence from the chemical weathering of the bedrocks bhattacharya et al 2002 islam et al 2017a bodrud doza et al 2019b the south central and eastern regions e g the mithapukur and kaunia upazila showed the higher concentration of ba than the bangladesh guideline value set by doe 1997 fig 1 these excessive tes concentrations might be an effect of anthropogenic activities merrill et al 2012 reported similar results where the high fe concentrations in drinking water of northern part in bangladesh create a distasteful organoleptic effect the statistical results compared with the bangladesh standard values revealed that no obvious tes pollution was detected in rangpur district except for the concentrations of fe mn and ba table 1 the concentrations of tes were the mean values of 8 80 10 01 as 7726 46 6559 34 fe 684 48 754 74 mn 33 29 38 99 zn 27 44 28 62 al and 44 55 28 60 μg l ba respectively table 1 the skewness was ranged 2 if exceeded it was considered as an extreme condition the concentrations of mn zn al and ba showed highly positive skewed data inferring an extreme condition in the groundwater samples the reason is that these tes concentrations exceeded the skewness range value 2 for the kurtosis all tes concentration belong to leptokurtic 3 except fe concentration the outcomes are echoed with the studies of islam et al 2015 the results are in line with the study of islam et al 2017a where the high contents of fe mn and ba were observed in teesta floodplain of rangpur district bangladesh however these outcomes differ from the results of reza et al 2010 the anova test the most popular statistical approach applied to check the mean differences among the various group of samples where the samples are normally distributed belkhiri and narany 2015 to determine the variations of tes within and between the groundwater the anova was carried out the results showed that there were no significant mean differences in the selected tes e g fe mn as zn al and ba among various sites at p 0 05 supplementary table s1 it exhibits a non significant difference showing that the sampling sites were contributing similarly to the mean tes concentration in groundwater conversely this study indicates that the trace elemental concentrations for different sampling points showed a similar variation supplementary table s2 therefore the isotropic characteristics in the aquifer system may be reasoned for tes contamination in the study area 3 2 source apportionment of tes in groundwater in order to exhibit the associations among the pairs of trace elements the correlation coefficient matrix is used in this study supplementary table s3 arsenic depicts a moderate significant relation with fe and zn r 0 503 r 0 408 p 0 01 and a moderate significant relation with ba r 0 331 p 0 05 while arsenic exhibits a weak positive relation with al and mn r 0 112 r 0 263 p 0 05 these relations depict mix type sources e g natural and anthropogenic sources fe exhibits a strong significant relation with ba r 0 553 p 0 01 whereas fe shows an insignificant relation with other trace elements similar results are reported by the study of haloi and sarma 2012 the contamination of groundwater may be attributed to natural origin from the bedrocks and other non point sources may be due to domestic urban waste and extensive agro practices in the study area mn depicts a weak negative relation with zn r 0 004 p 0 05 while a weak positive relation with al and ba r 0 017 r 0 046 p 0 05 zn shows a weak significant relation with al r 0 301 p 0 05 and an insignificant relation with ba r 0 168 p 0 05 ba exhibits a moderate significant relation with al r 0 449 p 0 01 suggesting a non point source of groundwater contamination this relation may be attributed to the anthropogenic origin as the main sources of groundwater pollution e g small scale industries activities agricultural pesticide and sluggish water it can be assumed that trace elements with a moderate to weak significant relations probably originated from the same kind of sources islam et al 2017a to identify the sources of selected tes in the groundwater systems tes datasets were employed to principal component analysis pca which allowed grouping them using their intrinsic characteristics bodrud doza et al 2016 therefore the pca of the tes data can effectively decrease the contribution of less significant variables for identifying groundwater contaminants however the scree plot was applied to identify the groups to be kept to insight into the basic variable structure fig 2 as given from the scree plot results fig 2a it was found that two pcs were extracted which contributed 56 48 of the total variance table 2 the associations among the analyzed tes in groundwater are displayed in the plot of pc1 versus pc2 fig 2b it is obvious that the tes dataset can be clustered into two numbers of pcs groups based on eigenvalues 1 in the study area fig 2 the first pc elucidating 34 30 of the total variance was strongly positive loaded with al and ba table 2 this pc defined the geogenic origin of the tes through the dissolution of barite and alumino silicate al2o sio4 minerals in the parent rock of aquifer which was confirmed by the moderate correlation with al and ba r ba al 0 449 at 99 confidence level similar observations were reported by islam et al 2017a generally the elevated ba concentrations released into the groundwater from the geogenic source are possibly due to the barite oxidation sakurovs et al 2007 in the deeper aquifer depth 60 m due to the dissolution of barite mineral baso4 in the deep aquifer where bacterial activities are responsible to reduce sulfate mineral baldi et al 1996 on the other hand the high contents of al in groundwater were derived from the point sources which may be due to the dissolution of alumino silicate minerals that found in soil and the bedrock formation which might be responsible for groundwater pollution in the study area islam et al 2017a the zn concentration was moderately loaded which can be derived by anthropogenic inputs like fertilizer application or the leaching of metals from piping and fittings of tube well ceramics industries small scale industrial activities and brick industries bodrud doza et al 2016 the fe had a strong positively correlation with ba at p 0 01 r fe ba 0 553 indicating the geogenic evolution of groundwater like fe oxidation rahman and gagnon 2014b and rainwater through the discharge of secondary salts that seepage into the aquifer which might be the plausible source attributed to groundwater contamination bodrud doza et al 2016 the second pc explained 22 18 of the variance was strongly positive loading with as and mn aqueous arsenic may be originated from the dissolution of carbonate rock in the study site particularly khalish per mine area of pirganj upazila where the release of as might be due to groundwater rock interaction harvey et al 2002 the elevated mn may be released due to chemical weathering of the parent rock and ionic exchange islam et al 2017b in the study area fe was moderately positive loaded originated from natural source that can be released into groundwater by chemical weathering of the bedrock which was also confirmed by the moderate correlation with as r fe as 0 503 at p 0 01 although mn had a weak positive correlation with fe r mn fe 0 025 bacterial activities were also related to releasing mn and fe into the groundwater aquifer islam et al 2013 an interesting result in comparing the pca findings was similar in the pca weight where the concentrations of ba al as and mn revealed the high positive loading in pc1 and pc2 this suggests that similar geogenic source was contributed to groundwater contamination in the study area the analyzed findings indicated that the pca can aid as an important means to recognize the main source distribution influencing groundwater in the designated area 3 3 spatial similarity and distribution among sampling sites in groundwater to show the spatial similarity and grouping among clusters in the groundwater samples the r mode cluster analysis ca was applied based on wards method and squared euclidean distance to predict tes groupings in the groundwater bodrud doza et al 2019b the r model ca was carried out to keep three clusters for tes datasets of analyzed variables and the outcomes were presented in fig 3 a cluster 1 included fe and ba concentrations which might be explained by geogenic processes by bedrock water interaction with ionic exchange into the groundwater the dissolution of fe oxy hydroxide under reducing environments may be release as into groundwater cluster 2 comprised zn and al concentrations which were influenced by anthropogenic inputs such as fertilizers pesticide and bacterial activities that contributed to the groundwater contamination kumar et al 2019 fig 3a cluster 3 contained mn concentration which originated from the natural chemical weathering of the parent rock in this study the ca was quite similar to the pca s result which were described in the earlier part of this section after r model ca q mode ca was performed to recognize the spatial similarities and site groups among the groundwater sample sites specific class exhibited a specific characteristic regarding the studied tes parameters in a sample cluster it divided the 47 sampling points for groundwater into three clusters fig 3b cluster 1 comprised s14 s33 s37 s22 s46 s15 s35 s16 s3 s29 s32 s23 s31 s25 s40 s27 s24 s18 s36 s38 s8 s34 s17 s4 s12 s1 s7 s6 s43 s20 s19 s26 s39 s44 s21 s28 s10 s42 and s30 this cluster 1 was related to groundwater contamination via geogenic evolution of groundwater by the chemical weathering of the bedrock the s1 s3 s4 s6 s7 and s8 sites were found in the proximal part of the urban sewage system shama soundori khal linked to the pleistocene terrace deposit which contaminated by al and zn through anthropogenic activities and the leaching of metals from piping and fittings tube well into the groundwater aquifer on the other hand the s28 s34 s21 s24 s26 and s27 were placed in the distal part which was shown by its linkage distances and contaminated by as fe and mn through natural chemical weathering of bedrocks followed by human activities such as brick industries animal feedings and pesticides cluster 2 had the following 3 sample sites including s2 s5 and s9 whereas clusters 3 comprised 5 sites such as s45 s47 s13 s41 and s11 these sites were less groundwater contaminated may be because of leaching of bedrock and agroecosystem runoffs therefore it was not surprising that clusters 2 and 3 were grouped together into a similar fashion fig 4 also shows the relationship between the location of the clusters and the sources of contamination pathway the cluster map gives better insight of the underlying geochemical processes and anthropogenic inputs responsible for groundwater contamination in the study area the outcomes of spatial distribution are also consistent with the r and q mode analyses in the study area spatial map of the first pc scores revealed a complex spatial pattern where high scores i e values from 0 21 to 3 56 were found at the southern and southwestern parts and low scores i e values from 1 81 to 0 37 were found at the northern and northeastern parts fig 5 a the high score of fe was significantly correlated with ba indicating the geogenic origin the moderate scores were observed in the central regions which comprised moderate scores of al and zn that may be contributed to anthropogenic sources in fact the map exhibited a decreasing trend toward the north this variation may be the non point sources such as fertilizer pesticides and municipal sewage discharges from urban areas the spatial map of the second pc scores showed that the low scores i e values from 1 75 to 0 25 were detected at the central and northern parts while the high scores values from 0 63 to 3 21 were found at the western and northeastern parts fig 5b for example pc2 included very high scores of as and mn were mainly a geogenic origin possibly due to the parent rock groundwater interaction and ionic exchange biswas et al 2012 bodrud doza et al 2019a kumar et al 2019 these outcomes are attained from the similar studies of bhuiyan et al 2016 rahman et al 2017b in southeastern bangladesh the spatial distribution of pc scores of the as mobilization and mn immobilization for each location overlaps in the study area which suggests that this pc factor is occurring in that area however the spatial distribution of second pc scores indicate an occurrence to specific aquifer fig 5b which may indicate that geochemical processes are prevailing in the aquifer in addition relationship between arsenic with trace elements in groundwater depicted an insignificant pair inferring arsenic release into the aquifer which was also further confirmed by pca and ca outcomes described in the earlier section 3 4 human health risk assessment the results of non cr of tes exposure in groundwater through oral and dermal routes for both age groups are shown in fig 6 a and b and the detailed results for each sampling can be found elsewhere supplementary tables s4 and s5 the hq average of oral ingestion and dermal routes peaked for mn and reached its minimum level for al regarding both age groups hq in the study sites was found in the following descending order of mn as fe ba zn al via oral and dermal routes for both age groups respectively supplementary tables s4 s5 s6 and s7 the results showed that children were likely susceptible to as health risk compared to adult e g hq average 1 95 of as was greater than unity in almost all samples indicating non cr impact of tes on children in this area the higher hq mean value may be caused by high arsenic concentration in groundwater and is mostly contributed to rock water interaction and little anthropogenic activities like agrochemicals used in the study area islam et al 2017c in fact hi mean values of all tes via drinking for adults were higher than unity which comprised the 76 59 sample locations fig 7 while children had much higher values 91 48 sample sites of non cr than adults this study also reveals that hi average 1 98 of all sites through oral pathway was greater than 1 demonstrating that the significant non cr was found in the study area supplementary tables s4 and s5 on the contrary hi mean of all sites via dermal exposure pathway was lower than 1 suggesting that there is no substantial non cr in the study region supplementary tables s6 and s7 overall hi from tes was 2 1 times higher for children than adults fig 7 carcinogenic risks cr of the arsenic are illustrated at mean minimum and maximum in supplementary table s8 the mean carcinogenic risks posed by as in groundwater for adults were inferior than those for children resulting in almost 2 times higher combined cr for children compared to adults table s8 although it was observed that most of the samples showed cr far below the tolerable threshold value of 1 0e 04 established by the usepa demonstrating no significant long term health impact for both age groups but the mean cr values through oral ingestion for both age groups were 4 15e 04 and 5 28e 04 respectively which was higher than the maximum reported allowed risk level 1 0e 06 table s8 on the other hand the average cr value via the dermal pathway for both adults and children were 4 61e 06 and 8 16e 06 respectively which was lower than the maximum permissible risk level 1 0e 06 table s9 from this study it suggests that children are more vulnerable to the potential health risk regarding cr or non cr similar results are also found in different regions of bangladesh islam et al 2017c rahman et al 2017a reported that children showed 2 fold higher hi for non cr and 1 fold higher cr than adults the hq values of all tes via oral pathway for children were two orders of magnitudes superior to those of adults supplementary tables s4 and s5 however the hq values of the tes via dermal exposure pathway for children were one fold of magnitudes higher than adults supplementary tables s6 and s7 the findings are alike the most recent related study lu et al 2015 but different from the research works conducted in different regions of china which concluded that the non carcinogenic risk was lower than the cancer risk from heavy metals in drinking water zhang et al 2014 geng et al 2016 though earlier studies reported the minor differences between hi values via oral and dermal exposure pathways islam et al 2017c which were consistent with this finding and this was mainly because of similar absorption factor rahman et al 2017a the risk is higher than 1 for arsenic which might be geogenic activities including rock water interaction and also anthropogenic activities such as the use of pesticides in agricultural field karim 2011 chowdhuri et al 2012 spatial maps of the cr and non cr hi values for two age groups are illustrated in fig 8 in the case of adults the high values of non cr hi 1 were noticed in southern and eastern regions like pirgacha and pirgonj upazilas fig 8a fig 8b demonstrated non cr for children where high hi values were observed in central southwestern and southern regions of mithapukur and pirganj upazilas and the low hi values were detected in northern and northeastern parts of taraganj and gangachara upazilas the higher croral values for adults were found in pirgacha upazila while lower values of croral were observed in northern and northeastern portions including taraganj parts of kaunia rangpur sadar and gangachara upazilas fig 8c on the other hand in case of children it was found that south central and southern regions like badarganj mithapukur and pirganj upazilas were the zone of higher cr values in comparison with other parts of the study area fig 8d the non carcinogenic health risk for both age groups is found in the following order of southern southwestern south central area northern regions of the study area similar spatial patterns were found in the cr maps for both age groups these results are echoed by the findings of rahman et al 2016 and islam et al 2015 the previous studies reported that low to medium cr and non cr for both age groups are due to the elevated as concentration in groundwater which is correlated to fe and other trace elements das et al 2004 the cancer risk associated with the arsenic was studied using the monte carlo simulation model in rangpur district bangladesh the predicted probability of the cancer risk model for arsenic for both age groups are illustrated in rangpur district fig 9 a and b the calculated mean croral value for the arsenic was 8 65e 04 for adults and 1 04e 03 for children respectively which was higher than the priority risk level 10 4 this clearly implies high potential health risks particularly children from arsenic in oral ingestion water suggesting that the arsenic requires devoted attention the findings are similar to the other related studies in bangladesh which confirmed that cr was comparatively higher than non cr from trace element in drinking groundwater karim 2011 islam et al 2017c rahman et al 2017a the 5th percentile value signifies low end exposure risk and 95th percentile value represents the high level of the cancer risk durmusoglu et al 2010 for example the 5th percentile values of the cancer risk were 181 times and 81 times higher than the acceptable risk of 1 in 10 000in children and adults respectively similarly the corresponding estimates of 95th percentile values were observed to be 448 times and 204 times more than the acceptable risk fig 9a and b the estimated risks of 5 and 95 were found as many as 8 14e 04 and 2 04e 03 for adults and 1 93e 03 and 2 44e 03 for children respectively this risk value was also more than the maximum reported acceptable risk level 1 10 6 geng et al 2016 the related results are reported by muhammad et al 2011 in pakistan fallahzadeh et al 2017 in iran tirkey et al 2017 in india and zhang et al 2014 in china the finding of this study was contradictory with the results of lu et al 2015 where an analogous study conducted in shenzhen china and found a lower cancer risk than the present research work although further study is required to validate these outcomes evaluates to the elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater via oral ingestion and dermal exposure routes in rangpur district bangladesh should be considered a quantitative sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of the variability and uncertainty of input parameters on the estimation of lifetime cancer risk such an estimation for the arsenic in the study area showed that three factors arsenic concentration at and bw for adults and two factors arsenic concentration and ef were the most sensitive factors on the lifetime cancer risk the concentration of 89 1 at of 3 2 and bw of 3 2 for adults had the highest positive and negative effects on the lifetime cr estimation compared to other input parameters fig 10 a conversely the concentration of 90 5 and ef of 3 1 for children had the maximum positive impacts on the carcinogenic risk calculation fig 10b a study conducted by lu et al 2015 assessed the sensitivities of health risk through ingestion water in shenzhen china and found that arsenic concentration had the highest positive effect on the lifetime carcinogenic risk another study carried out by fallahzadeh et al 2017 evaluated the human health risk of trace metals concentration through oral ingestion in five cities of iran and revealed that heavy metal concentration and bw were the highest positive and negative effects on the probable cancer estimation similar to the present study 4 conclusion source apportionment and potential health risks of groundwater through oral ingestion and dermal routes from rangpur district in bangladesh in terms of tes concentrations were appraised the results showed that the concentrations of tes had followed in the order of fe and mn ba zn al and as respectively the concentrations of fe mn and ba exceeded the permissible limits for drinking water quality set by the who and the doe finding of this study suggested that fe mn ba and as originated from geogenic sources while zn and al came from anthropogenic activities in fact pca results clearly depicted that geogenic contributions e g hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater and rock water interaction with ionic exchange were much higher than anthropogenic activities which might be responsible for groundwater contamination in the study sites the r mode and q mode of ca was further employed to explain the relationships between the parameters and similarities between observed parameters the non carcinogenic risk evaluation depicted that there were some non carcinogenic risks to humans through oral intake and dermal absorption pathways i e hq oral hq dermal and hi 1 children were more vulnerable than adults to the non carcinogenic risks based on the hq and hi values for both age groups however the carcinogenic risk values of as concentration in the study area surpassed the guideline range values suggested by the us epa 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 overall the sensitivity analysis outcome for the cr of as in both age population was in good agreement with the traditional health risk evaluation outcome in general the results indicate that the concentration of as and the parameters at and bw for adults and concentration of as and the parameter ef for children require special attention in to monitor and proper management strategies to control groundwater contamination

12262,the occurrence of elevated concentrations of fluoride in the drinking water supply in many regions of the world has caused widespread prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis in this article the extensive literature on the routes of fluoride exposure geographic regions with excess fluoride in water sources and various defluoridation techniques has been reviewed it appears that important economic regions on all continents are affected by unsafe fluoride levels in fresh waters that are current or potential sources for drinking water supply the widely accepted limit for fluoride in drinking water is 1 5 mg l though higher levels are also permitted especially in low income water scarce countries we have discussed fluoride mobilization mechanisms in groundwater and soil environments which could be helpful in assessing the potential long term potability of water from certain wells finally it is evident from the literature survey that no single fluoride removal technique fits for diverse technical and socioeconomic situations and there is a pressing need to develop suitable defluoridation techniques for household and community level water supply systems in order to prevent fluorosis graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride fluorosis groundwater drinking water 1 introduction fluoride may be beneficial or detrimental for human health depending on its concentration and the total amount of fluoride ingested over time dwivedi et al 2010 jha et al 2013 lugwisha and lunyungu 2016 ali et al 2019 the body weight activity level nutritional factors and the rate of skeletal growth and remodeling are also important factors at the level of an individual response to fluoride exposure den besten 1994 nureddin 2018 fluoride taken in low concentrations 0 5 mg l may cause dental caries limited growth and fertility problems if fluoride is taken within world health organization who permissible limits 0 5 1 5 mg l it is beneficial for the formation and maintenance of healthy bones and teeth while excessive intake of fluoride 1 5 mg l can result in fluorosis chandrajith et al 2012 dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 2007 dissanayake 1996 this means that according to who the acceptable level of fluoride range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l and therefore fluoride has a relatively narrow range between the concentration which is beneficial and that which has adverse effects jacks 2016 jha et al 2013 lavecchia et al 2012 tomar and kumar 2013 the standard concentration of fluoride in drinking water according to the who range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l mohammad and majumder 2014 who 2011 but it may range from 0 5 to 1 0 mg l depending on the climatic conditions such as temperature mehari et al 2014a 2014b the who guidelines suggest the two different maximum fluoride concentration levels of 1 and 1 5 mg l for warmer and cooler climates respectively biswas et al 2010 the difference is caused by the higher water consumption in warmer climates than in cooler climates jacks 2016 lavecchia et al 2012 the who recommends a concentration of 1 5 mg l as the maximum permissible level of fluoride in drinking water based on a daily water consumption rate of 2 l day it is important to consider climatic conditions which influence the volume of water intake and regional diets when setting national standards for fluoride kheradpisheh et al 2018 fluoride maintains healthy bones and teeth by displacing the hydroxide ions from hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh the principal mineral constituent of teeth and bones to form the fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f which is harder and tougher than hydroxyapatite 1 c a 5 p o 4 3 o h f c a 5 p o 4 3 f o h fluorapatite is less soluble and more resistant to acid attack than hydroxyapatite because of its hardness and toughness therefore it is useful in strengthening the enamel and protects it against acids from food remains in the mouth however this is only beneficial when fluoride is present in low amounts if fluoride is present in high concentration large amount of the hydroxyapatite is converted into fluorapatite and may cause the reaction to go beyond replacement of hydroxide 2 c a 5 p o 4 3 f 9 f c a 5 f 10 3 p o 4 3 this process makes the teeth and the bones denser harder and more brittle a condition known as fluorosis caverzasio et al 1998 emmanuel et al 2015 kaseva 2006b thole 2013 the toxicity of fluoride will depend on the concentration and duration of exposure to fluoride jha et al 2013 sehn 2008 elevated levels of fluoride 1 5 mg l can cause dental 1 5 4 0 mg l and skeletal fluorosis 4 0 10 0 mg l fluoride levels beyond 10 mg l result in crippling fluorosis which is characterized by bending of the bones and stiff joints with difficulties in walking chandrajith et al 2012 dissanayake 1991 1996 apart from the health effects associated with high fluoride uptake excess fluoride in water sources has socio economic implications as well for example in tanzania there has been a decline in the implementation of water supply programmes in the high fluoride regions of kilimanjaro arusha shinyanga mwanza and mara this is because the large parts of these regions are semi arid and depend mostly on groundwater as source of water and unfortunately the groundwater has high levels of fluoride as a consequence of this many shallow and deep boreholes costing millions of shillings to drill have being abandoned due to high concentrations of fluoride gumbo and mkongo 1995 over the past decades extensive studies have been carried out on the distribution of fluoride and defluoridation techniques but health and socio economic effects caused by higher concentration of fluoride in drinking water are still reported in many parts of the world also the information on fluoride and defluoridation is randomly scattered in literature hence this paper aims to collate review and share the state of the art on the routes of exposure to fluoride regions with excess fluoride in their water sources and various defluoridation techniques which are available today this will contribute towards shedding light on reasons why the problem still exists and what can be done in order to solve this problem 2 regulatory limits for fluoride in drinking water sources most countries have adopted a standard of fluoride in drinking water which is based on the who guideline of 1 5 mg l shorter 2011 however some countries due to shortage of enough water sources allow consumption of drinking water with concentrations above 1 5 mg l kaseva 2006a in 1950 s tanzania adopted a temporary standard of 8 0 mg l of fluoride in water to be used for domestic purposes in rural areas where no alternative water sources were available this is because removal methods for excess fluoride from water were not yet established and a number of water supply sources were contaminated with high fluoride concentrations if the guidelines set by the who were adopted at that time in tanzania around 30 of its known water sources would have been deemed as unsuitable for domestic consumption and have to be closed ayoob and gupta 2006 kaseva 2006b mwakabona et al 2014 thole et al 2013 for now the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water in tanzania has been revised from 8 mg l to 4 mg l ghiglieri et al 2012 tbs 2009 this was possible after the discovery of alternative sources of safe groundwater e g mkuru aquifer with fluoride concentration of 3 1 mg l in arumeru district ghiglieri et al 2008 and improvement of access to unpolluted water by providing more drilled wells and improved the springs catchment ghiglieri et al 2010 3 fluoride exposure routes the main principal route of exposure to fluoride in human is through drinking water nielsen and dahi 2002 this means that in order to prevent human exposure to fluoride and fluorosis it is necessary to control the quality of drinking water sehn 2008 beside drinking water fluoride from other sources such as food sujana and anand 2011 and beverages pendrys 2001 may also contribute to fluorosis in some areas kaseva 2006a apart from that the effect of attitude dietary habits such as the use of fluoride rich trona in food preparation can contribute to the total intake of fluoride in some areas such as tanzania other studies have shown that in areas where the fluoride in drinking water is low dental fluorosis can occur purely due to the use of trona kaseva 2006a fluoride can also enter the human body through dental products such as mouthwash and toothpaste fluoride supplements such as fluoride tablets professionally applied fluoride gel and air brindha and elango 2011 murray 1986 in order to prevent fluorosis all sources of exposure must be taken into account kario and pickering 2000 4 fluoride occurrences on a global scale the major source of fresh water on the earth is the groundwater ayoob and gupta 2006 and most of the people use groundwater for drinking maity et al 2018 and irrigation purposes singh et al 2015 according to different reports more than 25 countries in the world have high concentrations of fluoride within water sources fig 1 and about 200 million people rely on water sources that contain excessive fluoride which are having serious health consequences for the consumers ayoob and gupta 2006 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 2015b 4 1 africa most of african countries have regions reported to have fluoride concentrations higher than the 1 5 mg l limit recommended by who table 1 the east african rift valley is a naturally high fluoride zone jacks 2016 kut et al 2016 and over 80 million people in the east african rift exhibit varying degrees of fluorosis symptoms kut et al 2016 the studies show that up to 8 million out of 10 million people living in the ethiopian rift valley primarily in the main ethiopian rift or mer are at risk from regular exposure to high levels of naturally occurring fluoride in the groundwater they consume ayenew et al 2008 rango et al 2012 4 2 asia in asia the countries with high fluoride concentrations in the groundwater and surface water include india china korea thailand sri lanka indonesia yemen pakistan iraq turkey syria jordan palestine bangladesh iran and saudi arabia qian 1999 smet 1990 india and china which are the two most populous countries and the worst affected ayoob and gupta 2006 mumtaz et al 2014 2015 as indicated in table 2 about 66 million people in india edmunds and smedley 2013 majumdar 2011 and 45 million people in china edmunds and smedley 2013 are at risk of fluorosis endemic fluorosis has been reported in all provinces autonomous regions and municipalities of china except shanghai ganvir and das 2011 the endemic fluorosis in china is caused by high fluoride water pollution from coal burning nccp 2014 and drinking brick tea in excess yi and cao 2008 4 3 north america some areas in united states mexico and canada need water defluoridation because of high concentration in their groundwater table 3 about 5 million people are at risk of fluoride contamination in mexico farooqi 2015 the us environmental protection agency epa established a maximum contaminant level goal mclg and a maximum contaminant level mcl for fluoride at a concentration of 4 mg l to protect against crippling skeletal fluorosis and a non enforceable secondary mcl smcl of 2 mg l to protect against objectionable dental fluorosis edmunds and smedley 2013 epa 2014 ozsvath 2009 valasek 2012 however over 200 000 americans live in communities where drinking water supply have fluoride content of more than 4 mg l nas 2006 while water fluoridation is necessary for some places in canada due to lack of natural fluoride alabdulaaly et al 2013 elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water have been reported in some communities in rigolet labrador ismail and messer 1996 4 4 latin america some countries from latin america like peru ecuador and argentina van weert et al 2009 contain groundwater with high concentration of fluoride argentina is one of the most affected countries in latin america and about 1 2 million inhabitants in argentina drink groundwater with fluoride contents that exceed not only argentinian but also international guideline values borgnino et al 2013 the concentration of fluoride reported in different latin american countries is given in table 4 4 5 europe excess fluoride in groundwater is not a common problem in european countries in some areas of europe water fluoridation is necessary due to lack of natural fluoride but some areas of the countries like spain e g icod de los vinos tenerife island hardisson et al 2001 and norway e g hordaland county bårdsen et al 1999 contain groundwater with excess amount of fluoride apart from spain sweden and norway some areas in germany also contain high concentrations of fluoride in their groundwater for example the large number of rural wells examination in the muenster region of germany were found to have elevated fluoride levels with concentrations up to 8 8 mg l queste et al 2001 table 5 shows the concentration of fluoride in different countries in europe 5 fluoride dissipation in the groundwater and soil 5 1 natural sources and processes for fluoride mobilization in groundwater and soil the elevated concentration of fluoride in groundwater can be attributed to natural and or anthropogenic sources kagne et al 2009 kamble et al 2010 ku and chiou 2002 but the elevated fluoride content in groundwater and soil is mainly from natural contaminations and the majority of fluoride related health problems occur as a result of ingesting fluoride water from the natural sources ozsvath 2009 5 1 1 fluorine bearing minerals in the rocks fluoride is a primary constituent in chemical formulas of large number of minerals or included as an impurity garcía and borgnino 2015 fluorite caf2 fluoroapatite ca5 po4 3f micas amphiboles cryolite na3alf6 villiaumite naf topaz al2 sio4 f2 bastnaesite ce la co3 f and sellaite mgf2 are fluoride rich minerals which occur in rocks and sediments apambire et al 1997 rao 2003 ozsvath 2009 among the minerals amphiboles e g hornblende tremolite topaz al2 sio4 f2 and cryolite na3alf6 are considered to be less abundant fluoride bearing minerals garcía and borgnino 2015 fluorite caf2 is the principle fluoride mineral bearer and is found in granitic rocks such as granite granite gneisses and pegmatite narsimha and sudarshan 2016 the rocks containing fluoride rich minerals are considered as the largest fluoride reserve vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 2015b and high fluoride concentration in groundwater is likely in those areas where fluoride bearing minerals are abundant in the rocks msonda et al 2007 the interaction of water with fluoride bearing minerals in rocks is considered to be the main cause of fluoride into groundwater and soil kumar et al 2016 saxena and ahmed 2003 normally when rocks are exposed to the weather agents e g water a series of geochemical processes start which may lead to the alteration of the rock minerals and the release of dissolved components garcía and borgnino 2015 during rock water interaction hydrolysis precipitation dissociation and dissolution are the main geochemical processes which take place and cause the occurrence of fluoride in groundwater saxena and ahmed 2001 2003 factors such as water chemistry chemical composition of the rocks and the residence time of interaction can affect the geochemical processes and hence the fluoride concentration of groundwater kim and jeong 2005 saxena and ahmed 2003 5 1 1 1 fluoride mobility in groundwater fluoride occurs in almost all groundwater at different concentration ranging from trace 1 mg l to high concentrations 35 mg l ozsvath 2009 sivasankar et al 2016 the types of fluoride bearing minerals solubility of fluorine bearing minerals concentration of fluoride in the mineral residence time anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials oh for f and climate are the primary controls on dissolved fluoride concentration but the overall water quality e g ph aqueous ionic species ionic strength has an important role because of its influence on mineral solubility complexation and sorption exchange reactions handa 1975 ozsvath 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a the solubility of fluoride bearing mineral differs from one mineral source to another for example fluorite is much more soluble than apatite micas and amphiboles apambire et al 1997 few fluoride bearing minerals e g hf sif4 and naf are fairly soluble although many others e g caf2 mgf2 and na3alf6 are sparingly soluble in water under normal conditions of temperature and pressure farooqi 2015 however the solubility of sparingly soluble minerals can increase under certain physico chemical conditions the solubility of fluoride bearing mineral such as fluorite and cryolite increase in alkaline ph and therefore enhances the dissolution of fluoride from these minerals originated from fluoride rich rocks the alkaline ph is more favourable for fluorite dissolution activity farooqi 2015 sivasankar et al 2016 the alkaline water can mobilize fluoride from soils and weathered rocks into groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a villiamite naf which is an almost infinitely soluble mineral in water 40 g l may contribute greatly to fluoride concentration in groundwater associated with certain peralkaline intrusive bodies farooqi 2015 garcía and borgnino 2015 such waters are common in areas with generally alkaline soils jacks et al 2005 the case is different for apatite micas and amphiboles where the dissolution of fluoride from these minerals is most pronounced in acidic condition apambire et al 1997 farooqi 2015 apart from ph the presence of other aqueous ions in groundwater can also influence the fluorite dissolution saxena and ahmed 2003 for example the ratio between bicarbonate hco3 sodium na and calcium ca2 in groundwater play a significant role in fluorite dissolution in groundwater the dissociation activity of fluorite will be high in the presence of excessive bicarbonate hco3 and sodium na and low calcium ca2 in groundwater due to removal of ca by precipitation of calcite caco3 jacks et al 2005 saxena and ahmed 2003 sivasankar et al 2016 the chemical reactions for the dissolution of fluorite in the presence of high hco3 and na and low ca2 content is as follows mkungu et al 2014 3 n a h c o 3 n a h c o 3 4 c a f 2 2 n a h c o 3 c a c o 3 2 n a 2 f h 2 o c o 2 the influence of climate on fluoride concentration in groundwater is largely attributed to the effect that rainfall has on recharge rate and groundwater flow areas of high rainfall such as humid tropical regions are expected to have low fluoride concentration in groundwater because soluble ions such as fluoride are leached out and diluted conversely many arid and semi arid environments have been found to have high fluoride content in groundwater because they have low recharge rates of groundwater which lead to prolonged water mineral interaction and higher salinities which enhance mineral dissolution ozsvath 2009 also most of the arid and semi arid regions have oxidizing aquifers which provide conditions suitable for the lease of fluoride in groundwater das et al 2018 kumar et al 2016 also due to the effects of minerals weathering and high evaporation rate arid and semi arid environments have high ph value ph 8 5 which favour the dissolution of fluoride smedley and kinniburgh 2002 camargo 2003 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a the high evaporation can also cause calcium ions to precipitate out as caco3 which can result in low concentration of ca2 in groundwater as a result the solubility control of caf2 on fluoride enrichment in the aqueous phase become weaker and allowing fluoride to increase jacks et al 2005 jacks and bhattacharya 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a as shown in fig 2 the precipitation of the secondary minerals such as sepiolite and palygorskite can also cause dissolution of fluoride in arid climates jacks et al 2005 the effect of temperature on the solubility of fluorine bearing minerals can also be regarded as another influence of climate on fluoride concentration in groundwater this occurs because there is a relationship between the mineral solubility and temperature for example the fluorite solubility is directly proportional to the temperature therefore roughly 30 more fluoride will dissolve from fluorite into groundwater if the temperature is raised from 10 to 25 c because the equilibrium constant for fluorite increases from 10 10 80 to10 10 57 respectively jha et al 2011 ozsvath 2009 sivasankar et al 2016 also the anion exchange between oh and f involving various types of clay minerals weathered mica and oxyhydroxides found in residual soils and sedimentary deposits can affect the amount of fluoride in groundwater and lead to very high concentration of fluoride in groundwater up to 30 mg l apambire et al 1997 ozsvath 2009 fluoride ions and hydroxyl ions may replace each other in the octahedral sheet of mineral structures as they have the same charge and nearly the same radius garcía and borgnino 2015 in acidic ph hydroxide ions are desorbed from minerals into groundwater while fluoride ions are adsorbed onto minerals from the groundwater which decrease the concentration of fluoride in groundwater the case is different in alkaline ph where by the hydroxide ions are adsorbed onto minerals while fluoride ions are desorbed from minerals which increase the concentrations of fluoride in groundwater das et al 2018 sivasankar et al 2016 for example the reaction for anion exchange between oh and f in muscovite in alkaline ph is as follows vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 2015b 5 k a l 2 a l s i 3 o 10 f 2 2 o h k a l 2 a l s i 3 o 10 o h 2 2 f 5 1 1 2 fluoride mobility in soil soil fluoride concentrations typically vary between 20 and 500 mg kg although the fluorine content of most rocks ranges from 100 to 1 300 mg kg muller et al 1998 ozsvath 2009 higher concentrations 1 000 g kg can sometime occur in soils that are derived from rocks with high fluorine contents or in soils affected by anthropogenic inputs such as industrial pollution cronin et al 2000 phosphate fertilizers jha et al 2011 and sewage sludge ozsvath 2009 most of the fluoride found in soils can occur within minerals in the soil or adsorbed to clays and oxyhydroxides with only a few percent or less dissolved in the soil solution the soil s sorption capacity which varies with ph the types of sorbents present and soil salinity can affect the fluoride mobility in soil generally fine grained soils have higher clay and oxyhydroxide contents than do sandy soils and therefore retain more fluoride than sandy soils the minimum ph for fluoride mobility in fine grained soils is 6 0 6 5 pickering 1985 ozsvath 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a at ph values less than 6 cationic alf2 and alf2 complexes will be formed which will inhibit adsorption ozsvath 2009 high salinity ionic strength affects fluoride mobility in the soil by enhancing the potential for fluoride complexes to form and by increasing the number of ions that compete with fluoride for soil sorption sites the effect of evapotranspiration which raises the salinity of soil solutions can increase the concentrations of fluoride reaching groundwater by lowering the amount of fluoride adsorbed by the soil ozsvath 2009 5 1 2 geogenic sources geogenic occurrence of fluoride is often linked to volcanic activity fumarolic gases and presence of geothermal waters thole 2013 varieties of gases containing h2o co2 so2 hcl nh3 h2s h2 nh3 co hf nh4f sif4 nh4 2sif6 nasif6 k2sif6 and kbf4 and few other minor constituents e g sulphate can be emitted during volcanic activities nordstrom and jenne 1977 d alessandro 2006 garcía and borgnino 2015 witham et al 2005 and when the fresh erupted tephra contact with water the significant amounts of soluble elements e g s cl f ca na mg p k and al can be released ayris and delmelle 2012 the concentration of these elements and gases vary for individual eruptions and between volcanoes depending on several factors including style of eruption cronin et al 2003 magma type and tephra composition plume concentration gas to particles ratio temperature and chemical history environmental conditions e g wind and humidity particle size fractions and surface area porosity and texture of the particles witham et al 2005 the annual global emissions of gaseous fluoride compounds from volcanic sources is estimated to range from 60 000 to 6 million tons garcía and borgnino 2015 these emitted gases interact rapidly with the ash particles of the volcanic plume and form extremely thin salt coatings which are composed of relatively soluble sulfate and halide salts mixed with sparingly soluble fluorine compounds such as caf2 alf3 and ca5 po4 3f cronin et al 2003 delmelle et al 2007 the aerial emission of fluoride in the form of volcanic ash formed during volcanic eruption reaches the surface by fall out of particulate fluorides and during rainfall from the soil surface this fluoride will reach the groundwater zone easily along with percolating rainwater brindha and elango 2011 as a result the water in contact with volcanic ash deposits usually contains high concentrations of fluoride wolff boenisch et al 2004 the generation of fluorine rich lavas in the calc alkaline volcanoes typical of continental rift east africa hot spot and continental margin andes or island arc japan has been reported garcía and borgnino 2015 sivasankar et al 2016 geothermal waters which are other source of fluoride are associated with active areas of volcanic activity hot water and stream both containing dissolved solutes and gases are examples of geothermal fluids that rise to the surface garcía and borgnino 2015 the hydrothermal vein deposits and rocks that crystallize from highly evolved magmas contain fluorite fluorapatite and fluoride enriched micas and or amphiboles vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a because of this some of the areas affected by geothermal activity have the highest dissolved fluoride concentrations ozsvath 2009 for example a geothermal field of los azufres in michoacán state in the mexican volcanic belt has fluoride concentration of 17 and 16 3 mg l in geothermal well and surface water respectively armienta and segovia 2008 and hydrothermal system of ruapehu volcano in new zealand has fluoride concentration range between 90 and 450 μg g cronin et al 2003 other examples are thermal springs occurring along the border of lake victoria between musoma and mwanza in tanzania the thermal waters from these springs have high fluoride content which indicate their interaction with rocks of granitic composition chandrasekhar 2014 this occurs because the evolved magmas and their associated hydrothermal solutions are rich in fluorine as meteoric waters come in contact with these types of magma bodies or solutions they can acquire fluoride contained in them up to the limit imposed by fluorite solubility ayenew 2008 lottermoser and cleverley 2007 thus geothermal hot springs often contain fluoride concentrations above 1 mg l ozsvath 2009 only small amounts of geothermal water may be derived from gases that were originally dissolved in magmas however most geothermal water correspond to rainwater that descends through faults to considerable depths and then is heated by the magma attaining high temperatures 250 c and pressures alkali chloride solutions with near neutral ph values are the most common types of geothermal water edmunds and smedley 2013 even though they depict great variability in the chemical composition and in the range of ph weathering of the bedrock and the inflow of geothermal waters produce lakes that are characterized by high sodium and bicarbonate concentrations near neutral to alkaline ph values and under saturation with respect to fluorite gizaw 1996 these conditions are conducive to high fluoride concentrations which are further increased through evaporation acidic geothermal waters can also contain high fluoride concentrations nordstrom et al 2005 but for a different reason under low ph conditions fluoride solubility is enhanced by the formation of complexes with hydrogen silicon and aluminum which prevent fluorite from forming ozsvath 2009 features which are common to most high temperature waters include unusually high proportions of li rb cs si b as f and nh4 the fluoride concentration in geothermal waters is closely linked to the solubility equilibria of fluorite which in turn also depends on the fluid temperature garcía and borgnino 2015 5 2 anthropogenic sources apart from natural sources anthropogenic activities are considered to contribute a considerable amount of fluoride into groundwater and soil the anthropogenic activities which can cause fluoride contamination in groundwater include industrial rao and metre 2014 and agricultural activities saxena and ahmed 2003 5 2 1 industrial activities the industrial activities which can cause fluoride contamination in drinking water include effluents from industries which are involved with manufacturing of fertilizers semiconductor glass ceramic pesticides disinfectants tv picture tubes bricks plastics textile dyeing electroplating wood preservatives etc çengeloğlu et al 2002 mann and mandal 2014 sujana et al 2009 these industries can release fluorine to the environment either as gaseous e g hf sif4 f2 and h2sif4 or particulate e g caf2 naf and na2sif6 species ozsvath 2009 5 2 2 agricultural activities agricultural activities can contribute to fluoride content in the soil and groundwater through application of fluoride containing fertilizers and pesticides farooqi 2015 the most important source of fluoride contamination to agricultural lands is the phosphatic fertilizers especially the super phosphates jha et al 2011 the remarkable amount of fluoride often contained as impurity in phosphatic fertilizers dar et al 2011 which are extensively used in agriculture are being leached down to the saturated zone by return irrigation flows when interaction with water fluoride can form a number of complexes or exist in free form eventually precipitating as fluorite saxena and ahmed 2003 this can result into the elevated fluoride concentration in groundwater located in agricultural fields than the domestic wells sivasankar et al 2016 the agricultural activities can also increase the fluoride concentration in groundwater because of heavy withdrawal of water for agricultural activities associated with poor recharging rate due to shortage of rainfall ganvir and das 2011 6 water defluoridation there are several adverse effects on human health caused by excess fluoride in drinking water rao 2003 parlikar and mokashi 2015 the corrective measures to control fluorosis where fluoride levels of potable water are consistently beyond permissible levels is necessary one possibility is source substitution i e to search for safe water source locally or transport from a distant safe source through a piped water supply system and blending high fluoride with low fluoride water dual water sources can also be used to solve this problem where the water source with low fluoride concentration is used for drinking and cooking while the one with high fluoride concentration is used for other domestic activities macdonald and kavanaugh 1994 another potential option is rainwater harvesting jacks 2016 jacks et al 2005 however in some cases where there are no possible water source alternatives available defluoridation is left as the only option alagumuthu and rajan 2010 bansiwal et al 2010 peter 2009 defluoridation should be considered only where other options are not possible or as a temporary measure if the other options require a long time for planning and implementation shorter 2011 this is because until now there is no any defluoridation method which meets all the requirements for standard defluoridation method some of the requirements are modest investment low maintenance cost simple design easy to operate ability to reduce fluoride content e g from 5 to 0 5 mg l improved water quality in general and ingredients maintainable for acceptable period bjorvatn and bårdsen 1995 parlikar and mokashi 2015 6 1 water defluoridation methods the defluoridation techniques include precipitation coagulation techniques e g nalgonda technique calcium hydroxide aluminium hydroxide adsorption techniques e g activated alumina activated carbons other natural and synthetic adsorbents ion exchange techniques e g strong basic anion exchange resin with quaternary ammonium functional groups membrane techniques e g reverse osmosis nanofiltration and electrochemical techniques e g electro dialysis electro coagulation liao and shi 2005 al rawajfeh et al 2013 habuda stanić et al 2014 islam and patel 2007 each technique has its own advantages and limitations table 6 there is not a single method which meets all the requirements for standard defluoridation technique mehari et al 2014a 2014b but adsorption is generally considered to be an appropriate technique for small community water source defluoridation compared to other techniques due to its simplicity of design operation is easier availability of wide range of adsorbents and reasonable running and investment cost bhatnagar et al 2011 habuda stanić et al 2014 lavecchia et al 2012 similar opinions have been presented for the removal of arsenic from groundwater for small scale systems that could be adapted for fluoride removal from drinking water sources ahmad et al 2018 2019 among the wide range of adsorbent materials that have been used for fluoride uptake selection is based on cost capital investment and running cost removal capacity design and operation simplicity locally availability of materials and chemicals by products during the course of the treatment acceptance by the community and user preference mehari et al 2014a 2014b miretzky and cirelli 2011 however some of the adsorbent materials for defluoridation currently available are not cost effective and technically not feasible in rural areas ghorai and pant 2005 nevertheless the applicability of low cost adsorbents is limited either due to their low removal capacity or lack of public acceptance for instance adsorption of fluoride using activated alumina ghorai and pant 2005 bone char leyva ramos et al 2010 mbabaye et al 2017 and clay materials meenakshi et al 2008 was investigated and none of them is used in large scale application therefore it is still essential to identify materials that are both effective and applicable in low income communities at large scale kebede et al 2014 6 2 optimum conditions for fluoride adsorption the adsorption of fluoride depends on many different factors like the ph dose of the adsorbent contact time initial fluoride concentration and the presence of various contaminants present in the water mody et al 2010 each adsorbent has its optimum conditions ph temperature dose of the adsorbent contact time and initial fluoride concentration which give maximum adsorption the optimum conditions for fluoride adsorption of different adsorbents are given in table 7 7 conclusion despite the awareness of the potential risk of fluoride contamination in drinking water for half a century fluorosis still represents a serious and widespread health problem particularly to rural communities which depend on untreated water supplies there is a wide range of techniques developed for removing fluoride from potable water in areas with no alternative sources of water the applications of the existing technologies require some research at local level because communities differ in socio economic status further research is therefore required to establish suitability and sustainability of the existing research results in pilot and full scale plants acknowledgement this work was supported by swedish

12262,the occurrence of elevated concentrations of fluoride in the drinking water supply in many regions of the world has caused widespread prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis in this article the extensive literature on the routes of fluoride exposure geographic regions with excess fluoride in water sources and various defluoridation techniques has been reviewed it appears that important economic regions on all continents are affected by unsafe fluoride levels in fresh waters that are current or potential sources for drinking water supply the widely accepted limit for fluoride in drinking water is 1 5 mg l though higher levels are also permitted especially in low income water scarce countries we have discussed fluoride mobilization mechanisms in groundwater and soil environments which could be helpful in assessing the potential long term potability of water from certain wells finally it is evident from the literature survey that no single fluoride removal technique fits for diverse technical and socioeconomic situations and there is a pressing need to develop suitable defluoridation techniques for household and community level water supply systems in order to prevent fluorosis graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride fluorosis groundwater drinking water 1 introduction fluoride may be beneficial or detrimental for human health depending on its concentration and the total amount of fluoride ingested over time dwivedi et al 2010 jha et al 2013 lugwisha and lunyungu 2016 ali et al 2019 the body weight activity level nutritional factors and the rate of skeletal growth and remodeling are also important factors at the level of an individual response to fluoride exposure den besten 1994 nureddin 2018 fluoride taken in low concentrations 0 5 mg

maintenance of healthy bones and teeth while excessive intake of fluoride 1 5 mg l can result in fluorosis chandrajith et al 2012 dharmagunawardhane and dissanayake 2007 dissanayake 1996 this means that according to who the acceptable level of fluoride range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l and therefore fluoride has a relatively narrow range between the concentration which is beneficial and that which has adverse effects jacks 2016 jha et al 2013 lavecchia et al 2012 tomar and kumar 2013 the standard concentration of fluoride in drinking water according to the who range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l mohammad and majumder 2014 who 2011 but it may range from 0 5 to 1 0 mg l depending on the climatic conditions such as temperature mehari et al 2014a 2014b the who guidelines suggest the two different maximum fluoride concentration levels of 1 and 1 5 mg l for warmer and cooler climates respectively biswas et al 2010 the difference is caused by the higher water consumption in warmer climates than in cooler climates jacks 2016 lavecchia et al 2012 the who recommends a concentration of 1 5 mg l as the maximum permissible level of fluoride in drinking water based on a daily water consumption rate of 2 l day it is important to consider climatic conditions which influence the volume of water intake and regional diets when setting national standards for fluoride kheradpisheh et al 2018 fluoride maintains healthy bones and teeth by displacing the hydroxide ions from hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh the principal mineral constituent of teeth and bones to form the fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f which is harder and tougher than hydroxyapatite 1 c a 5 p o 4 3 o h f c a 5 p o 4 3 f o h fluorapatite is less soluble and more resistant to acid attack than hydroxyapatite because of its hardness and toughness therefore it is useful in strengthening the enamel and protects it against acids from food remains in the mouth however this is only beneficial when fluoride is present in low amounts if fluoride is present in high concentration large amount of the hydroxyapatite is converted into fluorapatite and may cause the reaction to go beyond replacement of hydroxide 2 c a 5 p o 4 3 f 9 f c a 5 f 10 3 p o 4 3 this process makes the teeth and the bones denser harder and more brittle a condition known as fluorosis caverzasio et al 1998 emmanuel et al 2015 kaseva 2006b thole 2013 the toxicity of fluoride will depend on the concentration and duration of exposure to fluoride jha et al 2013 sehn 2008 elevated levels of fluoride 1 5 mg l can cause dental 1 5 4 0 mg l and skeletal fluorosis 4 0 10 0 mg l fluoride levels beyond 10 mg l result in crippling fluorosis which is characterized by bending of the bones and stiff joints with difficulties in walking chandrajith et al 2012 dissanayake 1991 1996 apart from the health effects associated with high fluoride uptake excess fluoride in water sources has socio economic implications as well for example in tanzania there has been a decline in the implementation of water supply programmes in the high fluoride regions of kilimanjaro arusha shinyanga mwanza and mara this is because the large parts of these regions are semi arid and depend mostly on groundwater as source of water and unfortunately the groundwater has high levels of fluoride as a consequence of this many shallow and deep boreholes costing millions of shillings to drill have being abandoned due to high concentrations of fluoride gumbo and mkongo 1995 over the past decades extensive studies have been carried out on the distribution of fluoride and defluoridation techniques but health and socio economic effects caused by higher concentration of fluoride in drinking water are still reported in many parts of the world also the information on fluoride and defluoridation is randomly scattered in literature hence this paper aims to collate review and share the state of the art on the routes of exposure to fluoride regions with excess fluoride in their water sources and various defluoridation techniques which are available today this will contribute towards shedding light on reasons why the problem still exists and what can be done in order to solve this problem 2 regulatory limits for fluoride in drinking water sources most countries have adopted a standard of fluoride in drinking water which is based on the who guideline of 1 5 mg l shorter 2011 however some countries due to shortage of enough water sources allow consumption of drinking water with concentrations above 1 5 mg l kaseva 2006a in 1950 s tanzania adopted a temporary standard of 8 0 mg l of fluoride in water to be used for domestic purposes in rural areas where no alternative water sources were available this is because removal methods for excess fluoride from water were not yet established and a number of water supply sources were contaminated with high fluoride concentrations if the guidelines set by the who were adopted at that time in tanzania around 30 of its known water sources would have been deemed as unsuitable for domestic consumption and have to be closed ayoob and gupta 2006 kaseva 2006b mwakabona et al 2014 thole et al 2013 for now the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water in tanzania has been revised from 8 mg l to 4 mg l ghiglieri et al 2012 tbs 2009 this was possible after the discovery of alternative sources of safe groundwater e g mkuru aquifer with fluoride concentration of 3 1 mg l in arumeru district ghiglieri et al 2008 and improvement of access to unpolluted water by providing more drilled wells and improved the springs catchment ghiglieri et al 2010 3 fluoride exposure routes the main principal route of exposure to fluoride in human is through drinking water nielsen and dahi 2002 this means that in order to prevent human exposure to fluoride and fluorosis it is necessary to control the quality of drinking water sehn 2008 beside drinking water fluoride from other sources such as food sujana and anand 2011 and beverages pendrys 2001 may also contribute to fluorosis in some areas kaseva 2006a apart from that the effect of attitude dietary habits such as the use of fluoride rich trona in food preparation can contribute to the total intake of fluoride in some areas such as tanzania other studies have shown that in areas where the fluoride in drinking water is low dental fluorosis can occur purely due to the use of trona kaseva 2006a fluoride can also enter the human body through dental products such as mouthwash and toothpaste fluoride supplements such as fluoride tablets professionally applied fluoride gel and air brindha and elango 2011 murray 1986 in order to prevent fluorosis all sources of exposure must be taken into account kario and pickering 2000 4 fluoride occurrences on a global scale the major source of fresh water on the earth is the groundwater ayoob and gupta 2006 and most of the people use groundwater for drinking maity et al 2018 and irrigation purposes singh et al 2015 according to different reports more than 25 countries in the world have high concentrations of fluoride within water sources fig 1 and about 200 million people rely on water sources that contain excessive fluoride which are having serious health consequences for the consumers ayoob and gupta 2006 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 2015b 4 1 africa most of african countries have regions reported to have fluoride concentrations higher than the 1 5 mg l limit recommended by who table 1 the east african rift valley is a naturally high fluoride zone jacks 2016 kut et al 2016 and over 80 million people in the east african rift exhibit varying degrees of fluorosis symptoms kut et al 2016 the studies show that up to 8 million out of 10 million people living in the ethiopian rift valley primarily in the main ethiopian rift or mer are at risk from regular exposure to high levels of naturally occurring fluoride in the groundwater they consume ayenew et al 2008 rango et al 2012 4 2 asia in asia the countries with high fluoride concentrations in the groundwater and surface water include india china korea thailand sri lanka indonesia yemen pakistan iraq turkey syria jordan palestine bangladesh iran and saudi arabia qian 1999 smet 1990 india and china which are the two most populous countries and the worst affected ayoob and gupta 2006 mumtaz et al 2014 2015 as indicated in table 2 about 66 million people in india edmunds and smedley 2013 majumdar 2011 and 45 million people in china edmunds and smedley 2013 are at risk of fluorosis endemic fluorosis has been reported in all provinces autonomous regions and municipalities of china except shanghai ganvir and das 2011 the endemic fluorosis in china is caused by high fluoride water pollution from coal burning nccp 2014 and drinking brick tea in excess yi and cao 2008 4 3 north america some areas in united states mexico and canada need water defluoridation because of high concentration in their groundwater table 3 about 5 million people are at risk of fluoride contamination in mexico farooqi 2015 the us environmental protection agency epa established a maximum contaminant level goal mclg and a maximum contaminant level mcl for fluoride at a concentration of 4 mg l to protect against crippling skeletal fluorosis and a non enforceable secondary mcl smcl of 2 mg l to protect against objectionable dental fluorosis edmunds and smedley 2013 epa 2014 ozsvath 2009 valasek 2012 however over 200 000 americans live in communities where drinking water supply have fluoride content of more than 4 mg l nas 2006 while water fluoridation is necessary for some places in canada due to lack of natural fluoride alabdulaaly et al 2013 elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water have been reported in some communities in rigolet labrador ismail and messer 1996 4 4 latin america some countries from latin america like peru ecuador and argentina van weert et al 2009 contain groundwater with high concentration of fluoride argentina is one of the most affected countries in latin america and about 1 2 million inhabitants in argentina drink groundwater with fluoride contents that exceed not only argentinian but also international guideline values borgnino et al 2013 the concentration of fluoride reported in different latin american countries is given in table 4 4 5 europe excess fluoride in groundwater is not a common problem in european countries in some areas of europe water fluoridation is necessary due to lack of natural fluoride but some areas of the countries like spain e g icod de los vinos tenerife island hardisson et al 2001 and norway e g hordaland county bårdsen et al 1999 contain groundwater with excess amount of fluoride apart from spain sweden and norway some areas in germany also contain high concentrations of fluoride in their groundwater for example the large number of rural wells examination in the muenster region of germany were found to have elevated fluoride levels with concentrations up to 8 8 mg l queste et al 2001 table 5 shows the concentration of fluoride in different countries in europe 5 fluoride dissipation in the groundwater and soil 5 1 natural sources and processes for fluoride mobilization in groundwater and soil the elevated concentration of fluoride in groundwater can be attributed to natural and or anthropogenic sources kagne et al 2009 kamble et al 2010 ku and chiou 2002 but the elevated fluoride content in groundwater and soil is mainly from natural contaminations and the majority of fluoride related health problems occur as a result of ingesting fluoride water from the natural sources ozsvath 2009 5 1 1 fluorine bearing minerals in the rocks fluoride is a primary constituent in chemical formulas of large number of minerals or included as an impurity garcía and borgnino 2015 fluorite caf2 fluoroapatite ca5 po4 3f micas amphiboles cryolite na3alf6 villiaumite naf topaz al2 sio4 f2 bastnaesite ce la co3 f and sellaite mgf2 are fluoride rich minerals which occur in rocks and sediments apambire et al 1997 rao 2003 ozsvath 2009 among the minerals amphiboles e g hornblende tremolite topaz al2 sio4 f2 and cryolite na3alf6 are considered to be less abundant fluoride bearing minerals garcía and borgnino 2015 fluorite caf2 is the principle fluoride mineral bearer and is found in granitic rocks such as granite granite gneisses and pegmatite narsimha and sudarshan 2016 the rocks containing fluoride rich minerals are considered as the largest fluoride reserve vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 2015b and high fluoride concentration in groundwater is likely in those areas where fluoride bearing minerals are abundant in the rocks msonda et al 2007 the interaction of water with fluoride bearing minerals in rocks is considered to be the main cause of fluoride into groundwater and soil kumar et al 2016 saxena and ahmed 2003 normally when rocks are exposed to the weather agents e g water a series of geochemical processes start which may lead to the alteration of the rock minerals and the release of dissolved components garcía and borgnino 2015 during rock water interaction hydrolysis precipitation dissociation and dissolution are the main geochemical processes which take place and cause the occurrence of fluoride in groundwater saxena and ahmed 2001 2003 factors such as water chemistry chemical composition of the rocks and the residence time of interaction can affect the geochemical processes and hence the fluoride concentration of groundwater kim and jeong 2005 saxena and ahmed 2003 5 1 1 1 fluoride mobility in groundwater fluoride occurs in almost all groundwater at different concentration ranging from trace 1 mg l to high concentrations 35 mg l ozsvath 2009 sivasankar et al 2016 the types of fluoride bearing minerals solubility of fluorine bearing minerals concentration of fluoride in the mineral residence time anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials oh for f and climate are the primary controls on dissolved fluoride concentration but the overall water quality e g ph aqueous ionic species ionic strength has an important role because of its influence on mineral solubility complexation and sorption exchange reactions handa 1975 ozsvath 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a the solubility of fluoride bearing mineral differs from one mineral source to another for example fluorite is much more soluble than apatite micas and amphiboles apambire et al 1997 few fluoride bearing minerals e g hf sif4 and naf are fairly soluble although many others e g caf2 mgf2 and na3alf6 are sparingly soluble in water under normal conditions of temperature and pressure farooqi 2015 however the solubility of sparingly soluble minerals can increase under certain physico chemical conditions the solubility of fluoride bearing mineral such as fluorite and cryolite increase in alkaline ph and therefore enhances the dissolution of fluoride from these minerals originated from fluoride rich rocks the alkaline ph is more favourable for fluorite dissolution activity farooqi 2015 sivasankar et al 2016 the alkaline water can mobilize fluoride from soils and weathered rocks into groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a villiamite naf which is an almost infinitely soluble mineral in water 40 g l may contribute greatly to fluoride concentration in groundwater associated with certain peralkaline intrusive bodies farooqi 2015 garcía and borgnino 2015 such waters are common in areas with generally alkaline soils jacks et al 2005 the case is different for apatite micas and amphiboles where the dissolution of fluoride from these minerals is most pronounced in acidic condition apambire et al 1997 farooqi 2015 apart from ph the presence of other aqueous ions in groundwater can also influence the fluorite dissolution saxena and ahmed 2003 for example the ratio between bicarbonate hco3 sodium na and calcium ca2 in groundwater play a significant role in fluorite dissolution in groundwater the dissociation activity of fluorite will be high in the presence of excessive bicarbonate hco3 and sodium na and low calcium ca2 in groundwater due to removal of ca by precipitation of calcite caco3 jacks et al 2005 saxena and ahmed 2003 sivasankar et al 2016 the chemical reactions for the dissolution of fluorite in the presence of high hco3 and na and low ca2 content is as follows mkungu et al 2014 3 n a h c o 3 n a h c o 3 4 c a f 2 2 n a h c o 3 c a c o 3 2 n a 2 f h 2 o c o 2 the influence of climate on fluoride concentration in groundwater is largely attributed to the effect that rainfall has on recharge rate and groundwater flow areas of high rainfall such as humid tropical regions are expected to have low fluoride concentration in groundwater because soluble ions such as fluoride are leached out and diluted conversely many arid and semi arid environments have been found to have high fluoride content in groundwater because they have low recharge rates of groundwater which lead to prolonged water mineral interaction and higher salinities which enhance mineral dissolution ozsvath 2009 also most of the arid and semi arid regions have oxidizing aquifers which provide conditions suitable for the lease of fluoride in groundwater das et al 2018 kumar et al 2016 also due to the effects of minerals weathering and high evaporation rate arid and semi arid environments have high ph value ph 8 5 which favour the dissolution of fluoride smedley and kinniburgh 2002 camargo 2003 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a the high evaporation can also cause calcium ions to precipitate out as caco3 which can result in low concentration of ca2 in groundwater as a result the solubility control of caf2 on fluoride enrichment in the aqueous phase become weaker and allowing fluoride to increase jacks et al 2005 jacks and bhattacharya 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a as shown in fig 2 the precipitation of the secondary minerals such as sepiolite and palygorskite can also cause dissolution of fluoride in arid climates jacks et al 2005 the effect of temperature on the solubility of fluorine bearing minerals can also be regarded as another influence of climate on fluoride concentration in groundwater this occurs because there is a relationship between the mineral solubility and temperature for example the fluorite solubility is directly proportional to the temperature therefore roughly 30 more fluoride will dissolve from fluorite into groundwater if the temperature is raised from 10 to 25 c because the equilibrium constant for fluorite increases from 10 10 80 to10 10 57 respectively jha et al 2011 ozsvath 2009 sivasankar et al 2016 also the anion exchange between oh and f involving various types of clay minerals weathered mica and oxyhydroxides found in residual soils and sedimentary deposits can affect the amount of fluoride in groundwater and lead to very high concentration of fluoride in groundwater up to 30 mg l apambire et al 1997 ozsvath 2009 fluoride ions and hydroxyl ions may replace each other in the octahedral sheet of mineral structures as they have the same charge and nearly the same radius garcía and borgnino 2015 in acidic ph hydroxide ions are desorbed from minerals into groundwater while fluoride ions are adsorbed onto minerals from the groundwater which decrease the concentration of fluoride in groundwater the case is different in alkaline ph where by the hydroxide ions are adsorbed onto minerals while fluoride ions are desorbed from minerals which increase the concentrations of fluoride in groundwater das et al 2018 sivasankar et al 2016 for example the reaction for anion exchange between oh and f in muscovite in alkaline ph is as follows vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 2015b 5 k a l 2 a l s i 3 o 10 f 2 2 o h k a l 2 a l s i 3 o 10 o h 2 2 f 5 1 1 2 fluoride mobility in soil soil fluoride concentrations typically vary between 20 and 500 mg kg although the fluorine content of most rocks ranges from 100 to 1 300 mg kg muller et al 1998 ozsvath 2009 higher concentrations 1 000 g kg can sometime occur in soils that are derived from rocks with high fluorine contents or in soils affected by anthropogenic inputs such as industrial pollution cronin et al 2000 phosphate fertilizers jha et al 2011 and sewage sludge ozsvath 2009 most of the fluoride found in soils can occur within minerals in the soil or adsorbed to clays and oxyhydroxides with only a few percent or less dissolved in the soil solution the soil s sorption capacity which varies with ph the types of sorbents present and soil salinity can affect the fluoride mobility in soil generally fine grained soils have higher clay and oxyhydroxide contents than do sandy soils and therefore retain more fluoride than sandy soils the minimum ph for fluoride mobility in fine grained soils is 6 0 6 5 pickering 1985 ozsvath 2009 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a at ph values less than 6 cationic alf2 and alf2 complexes will be formed which will inhibit adsorption ozsvath 2009 high salinity ionic strength affects fluoride mobility in the soil by enhancing the potential for fluoride complexes to form and by increasing the number of ions that compete with fluoride for soil sorption sites the effect of evapotranspiration which raises the salinity of soil solutions can increase the concentrations of fluoride reaching groundwater by lowering the amount of fluoride adsorbed by the soil ozsvath 2009 5 1 2 geogenic sources geogenic occurrence of fluoride is often linked to volcanic activity fumarolic gases and presence of geothermal waters thole 2013 varieties of gases containing h2o co2 so2 hcl nh3 h2s h2 nh3 co hf nh4f sif4 nh4 2sif6 nasif6 k2sif6 and kbf4 and few other minor constituents e g sulphate can be emitted during volcanic activities nordstrom and jenne 1977 d alessandro 2006 garcía and borgnino 2015 witham et al 2005 and when the fresh erupted tephra contact with water the significant amounts of soluble elements e g s cl f ca na mg p k and al can be released ayris and delmelle 2012 the concentration of these elements and gases vary for individual eruptions and between volcanoes depending on several factors including style of eruption cronin et al 2003 magma type and tephra composition plume concentration gas to particles ratio temperature and chemical history environmental conditions e g wind and humidity particle size fractions and surface area porosity and texture of the particles witham et al 2005 the annual global emissions of gaseous fluoride compounds from volcanic sources is estimated to range from 60 000 to 6 million tons garcía and borgnino 2015 these emitted gases interact rapidly with the ash particles of the volcanic plume and form extremely thin salt coatings which are composed of relatively soluble sulfate and halide salts mixed with sparingly soluble fluorine compounds such as caf2 alf3 and ca5 po4 3f cronin et al 2003 delmelle et al 2007 the aerial emission of fluoride in the form of volcanic ash formed during volcanic eruption reaches the surface by fall out of particulate fluorides and during rainfall from the soil surface this fluoride will reach the groundwater zone easily along with percolating rainwater brindha and elango 2011 as a result the water in contact with volcanic ash deposits usually contains high concentrations of fluoride wolff boenisch et al 2004 the generation of fluorine rich lavas in the calc alkaline volcanoes typical of continental rift east africa hot spot and continental margin andes or island arc japan has been reported garcía and borgnino 2015 sivasankar et al 2016 geothermal waters which are other source of fluoride are associated with active areas of volcanic activity hot water and stream both containing dissolved solutes and gases are examples of geothermal fluids that rise to the surface garcía and borgnino 2015 the hydrothermal vein deposits and rocks that crystallize from highly evolved magmas contain fluorite fluorapatite and fluoride enriched micas and or amphiboles vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a because of this some of the areas affected by geothermal activity have the highest dissolved fluoride concentrations ozsvath 2009 for example a geothermal field of los azufres in michoacán state in the mexican volcanic belt has fluoride concentration of 17 and 16 3 mg l in geothermal well and surface water respectively armienta and segovia 2008 and hydrothermal system of ruapehu volcano in new zealand has fluoride concentration range between 90 and 450 μg g cronin et al 2003 other examples are thermal springs occurring along the border of lake victoria between musoma and mwanza in tanzania the thermal waters from these springs have high fluoride content which indicate their interaction with rocks of granitic composition chandrasekhar 2014 this occurs because the evolved magmas and their associated hydrothermal solutions are rich in fluorine as meteoric waters come in contact with these types of magma bodies or solutions they can acquire fluoride contained in them up to the limit imposed by fluorite solubility ayenew 2008 lottermoser and cleverley 2007 thus geothermal hot springs often contain fluoride concentrations above 1 mg l ozsvath 2009 only small amounts of geothermal water may be derived from gases that were originally dissolved in magmas however most geothermal water correspond to rainwater that descends through faults to considerable depths and then is heated by the magma attaining high temperatures 250 c and pressures alkali chloride solutions with near neutral ph values are the most common types of geothermal water edmunds and smedley 2013 even though they depict great variability in the chemical composition and in the range of ph weathering of the bedrock and the inflow of geothermal waters produce lakes that are characterized by high sodium and bicarbonate concentrations near neutral to alkaline ph values and under saturation with respect to fluorite gizaw 1996 these conditions are conducive to high fluoride concentrations which are further increased through evaporation acidic geothermal waters can also contain high fluoride concentrations nordstrom et al 2005 but for a different reason under low ph conditions fluoride solubility is enhanced by the formation of complexes with hydrogen silicon and aluminum which prevent fluorite from forming ozsvath 2009 features which are common to most high temperature waters include unusually high proportions of li rb cs si b as f and nh4 the fluoride concentration in geothermal waters is closely linked to the solubility equilibria of fluorite which in turn also depends on the fluid temperature garcía and borgnino 2015 5 2 anthropogenic sources apart from natural sources anthropogenic activities are considered to contribute a considerable amount of fluoride into groundwater and soil the anthropogenic activities which can cause fluoride contamination in groundwater include industrial rao and metre 2014 and agricultural activities saxena and ahmed 2003 5 2 1 industrial activities the industrial activities which can cause fluoride contamination in drinking water include effluents from industries which are involved with manufacturing of fertilizers semiconductor glass ceramic pesticides disinfectants tv picture tubes bricks plastics textile dyeing electroplating wood preservatives etc çengeloğlu et al 2002 mann and mandal 2014 sujana et al 2009 these industries can release fluorine to the environment either as gaseous e g hf sif4 f2 and h2sif4 or particulate e g caf2 naf and na2sif6 species ozsvath 2009 5 2 2 agricultural activities agricultural activities can contribute to fluoride content in the soil and groundwater through application of fluoride containing fertilizers and pesticides farooqi 2015 the most important source of fluoride contamination to agricultural lands is the phosphatic fertilizers especially the super phosphates jha et al 2011 the remarkable amount of fluoride often contained as impurity in phosphatic fertilizers dar et al 2011 which are extensively used in agriculture are being leached down to the saturated zone by return irrigation flows when interaction with water fluoride can form a number of complexes or exist in free form eventually precipitating as fluorite saxena and ahmed 2003 this can result into the elevated fluoride concentration in groundwater located in agricultural fields than the domestic wells sivasankar et al 2016 the agricultural activities can also increase the fluoride concentration in groundwater because of heavy withdrawal of water for agricultural activities associated with poor recharging rate due to shortage of rainfall ganvir and das 2011 6 water defluoridation there are several adverse effects on human health caused by excess fluoride in drinking water rao 2003 parlikar and mokashi 2015 the corrective measures to control fluorosis where fluoride levels of potable water are consistently beyond permissible levels is necessary one possibility is source substitution i e to search for safe water source locally or transport from a distant safe source through a piped water supply system and blending high fluoride with low fluoride water dual water sources can also be used to solve this problem where the water source with low fluoride concentration is used for drinking and cooking while the one with high fluoride concentration is used for other domestic activities macdonald and kavanaugh 1994 another potential option is rainwater harvesting jacks 2016 jacks et al 2005 however in some cases where there are no possible water source alternatives available defluoridation is left as the only option alagumuthu and rajan 2010 bansiwal et al 2010 peter 2009 defluoridation should be considered only where other options are not possible or as a temporary measure if the other options require a long time for planning and implementation shorter 2011 this is because until now there is no any defluoridation method which meets all the requirements for standard defluoridation method some of the requirements are modest investment low maintenance cost simple design easy to operate ability to reduce fluoride content e g from 5 to 0 5 mg l improved water quality in general and ingredients maintainable for acceptable period bjorvatn and bårdsen 1995 parlikar and mokashi 2015 6 1 water defluoridation methods the defluoridation techniques include precipitation coagulation techniques e g nalgonda technique calcium hydroxide aluminium hydroxide adsorption techniques e g activated alumina activated carbons other natural and synthetic adsorbents ion exchange techniques e g strong basic anion exchange resin with quaternary ammonium functional groups membrane techniques e g reverse osmosis nanofiltration and electrochemical techniques e g electro dialysis electro coagulation liao and shi 2005 al rawajfeh et al 2013 habuda stanić et al 2014 islam and patel 2007 each technique has its own advantages and limitations table 6 there is not a single method which meets all the requirements for standard defluoridation technique mehari et al 2014a 2014b but adsorption is generally considered to be an appropriate technique for small community water source defluoridation compared to other techniques due to its simplicity of design operation is easier availability of wide range of adsorbents and reasonable running and investment cost bhatnagar et al 2011 habuda stanić et al 2014 lavecchia et al 2012 similar opinions have been presented for the removal of arsenic from groundwater for small scale systems that could be adapted for fluoride removal from drinking water sources ahmad et al 2018 2019 among the wide range of adsorbent materials that have been used for fluoride uptake selection is based on cost capital investment and running cost removal capacity design and operation simplicity locally availability of materials and chemicals by products during the course of the treatment acceptance by the community and user preference mehari et al 2014a 2014b miretzky and cirelli 2011 however some of the adsorbent materials for defluoridation currently available are not cost effective and technically not feasible in rural areas ghorai and pant 2005 nevertheless the applicability of low cost adsorbents is limited either due to their low removal capacity or lack of public acceptance for instance adsorption of fluoride using activated alumina ghorai and pant 2005 bone char leyva ramos et al 2010 mbabaye et al 2017 and clay materials meenakshi et al 2008 was investigated and none of them is used in large scale application therefore it is still essential to identify materials that are both effective and applicable in low income communities at large scale kebede et al 2014 6 2 optimum conditions for fluoride adsorption the adsorption of fluoride depends on many different factors like the ph dose of the adsorbent contact time initial fluoride concentration and the presence of various contaminants present in the water mody et al 2010 each adsorbent has its optimum conditions ph temperature dose of the adsorbent contact time and initial fluoride concentration which give maximum adsorption the optimum conditions for fluoride adsorption of different adsorbents are given in table 7 7 conclusion despite the awareness of the potential risk of fluoride contamination in drinking water for half a century fluorosis still represents a serious and widespread health problem particularly to rural communities which depend on untreated water supplies there is a wide range of techniques developed for removing fluoride from potable water in areas with no alternative sources of water the applications of the existing technologies require some research at local level because communities differ in socio economic status further research is therefore required to establish suitability and sustainability of the existing research results in pilot and full scale plants acknowledgement this work was supported by swedish

ph of the solution and initial concentration the results revealed that 96 of copper ii was removed in the best adsorption conditions ph 4 an adsorbent dose of 4 g l 360 min reaction time and 5 mg l 1 of cu ii initial concentration experimental results showed that the pseudo second order model gave the best description of the adsorption kinetics of copper ii as well as the langmuir model was the best applicable model to describe the isotherm waste fish show promising results in removing copper ii in aqueous solution these results present new sustainable cost effective material as a promising adsorbent for copper ii removal from wastewater the regeneration of smtfw showed a low reduction which confirmed that our adsorbent can be considered as a sustainable material for copper adsorption finally the adsorption mechanism was proposed on the basis of ftir analyses before and after adsorption graphical abstract fx1 keywords fish waste adsorption copper ii removal low cost adsorbent 1 introduction nowadays industrial activities led to an increase of hazardous pollutants including heavy metals chromium arsenic fluoride cadmium zinc copper which are considered as pollutants of water and soil leading to risks for the ecosystems kumari et al 2017 saikia et al 2017 borah et al 2018 kumar 2016 copper ii is such heavy metal which is of non degradable nature bakhtiari et al 2015 various industries use processes that include copper ii such as metal plating mining operations nuclear power plant metallurgical industries tanneries battery manufacturing industries and textiles industries jiang et al 2015 the copper ii is not biodegradable and tend to accumulate in body organs and threat the health of living organisms mosayebi and azizian 2016 the presence of a very small

organization who and environmental protection agency epa cheng et al 2010 it becomes extremely toxic when it is presented at a high concentration then 1 3 mg l 1 kong and wang 2016 many studies have developed techniques for copper removal such as combined process adsorption photocatalysis kanakaraju et al 2017 thermally regenerative electro deposition battery rahimi et al 2017 cation exchange membrane rikame et al 2017 and sand filters tizaoui et al 2012 among these the adsorption process where the fish waste adsorption process is more advantageous for cu ii removal in terms of low cost high surface area and the simplicity of operation however the disadvantage of the fish waste adsorption is the high degree of heat required for the calcination of adsorbent recently the copper ii adsorption in aqueous solutions has been investigated using many adsorbents such as natural bentonite karapinar and donat 2009 poly n phenylglycine nanofibers doh et al 2015 modified carbon foam lee

an increase in fish products means that the fish waste is also increased which constitutes a growing concern wallace et al 2014 usually fish waste consists of 30 wt organic compounds mainly keratin

for copper ii removal in aqueous solution effects of many key parameters on adsorption capacity such as adsorbent dose contact time ph and initial cu ii concentration on the adsorption process have been studied in detail adsorption kinetics and equilibrium of adsorption processes of dyes as well as regeneration and mechanism were studied 2 experimental study 2 1 materials hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and copper ii solution were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without any further purification 2 2 preparation of the adsorbent fish waste was obtained from a local fish market after collection the amount of fish waste was rinsed with distilled water and dried at 25 c for 24 h then 30 g of the prepared fish waste was mixed with 60 ml of sulfuric acid h2so4 8 for 12 h with a

min1 2 and can be calculated from the slope of qt vs t1 2 plot and c is the intercept 3 3 adsorption isotherm in the present work the results of the experiment were analyzed according to the most frequently models langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms 3 3 1 langmuir model langmuir indicates that the surfaces of adsorbents are mainly made up of heterogeneous adsorption patches kim et al 2004 the langmuir equation which can be described by the following equation ghaedi et al 2014 ait akbour et al 2018 7 c e q e 1 q max k l c e q max where ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate qe mg g 1 is the amount of adsorption per unit mass qmax and kl are langmuir constants related to adsorption capacity and rate of adsorption respectively the essential characteristics of the

as irreversible rl 0 favourable rl between 0 and 1 linear rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 3 3 2 freundlich model the freundlich equation can be applied to describe heterogeneous systems as well as multilayer

constant which indicates the adsorption capacity and 1 n is the adsorption intensity values kf and n are calculated from the intercept and slope of the plot and listed in table 2 the value of freundlich exponent n is in the range of n 1 indicating a favourable adsorption 3 3 3 temkin model the temkin isotherm contains a factor that explicitly takes into account the adsorbent adsorbate interactions the linear form of the temkin model is written as hameed 2009 10 q e b ln a b ln c e where b is the temkin constant related to the heat of sorption j mol and a is the temkin isotherm constant l g 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization 4 1 1 thermal analysis the tga and dta curves in fig 1 shows the thermal dehydration of smtfw with a heating rate of 10 k min this analysis was carried out specifically in ambient air when it s about fish waste after heat treatment at 600 c during 2 h fig 1 a the dehydration was accompanied with an endothermic effect followed by mass losses 1 5 at 60 c which is due to the dehydration of water an exothermic effect around 500 c followed by mass losses 6 which can only be due to the loss of the remaining organic matter for the analysis of fish waste after chemical treatment fig 1b the dehydration was accompanied by one endothermic and two exothermic effects followed by three mass losses at around 60 c 350 c and 550 c respectively the first loss is due to the dehydration of water the exothermic effect is due to the loss of the organic matter 4 1 2 scanning electron microscopy fig 2 shows the sem photographs of the fish waste with a magnification up to 6000 kx before absorption fig 2a b and after adsorption fig 2c d pores of different size and different shapes could be observed before absorption additionally after absorption there was a noticeable scattering of salt particles presenting on the fish waste which could be attributed to the copper trapped by the pores some particles to some extent were even trapped into the pores which could possibly block the entry of pores therefore it seems that the adsorptive capacity of the products could increase if the washing procedure was improved 4 1 3 specific surface area bet and pore size distribution the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm along with the pore size distribution of treated fish waste are shown in fig 3a b it can be observed that the isotherm of a treated waste of fish is thoroughly classified as a type iv which is associated with a mesoporous structure also the structure of treated fish waste has pores mainly located in the mesoporous region as shown in the distribution pore size curve the pore size distribution curve indicates that pore sizes centre at 2 85 17 44 and 26 95 nm the bet surface area of treated fish waste is 268 44 m2g 1 the high surface area would provide more active sites for reactants on the treated fish waste surface 4 1 4 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectra for original and carbonized fish waste with and without dye loading are displayed in fig 4 fish waste is mainly composed of collagen fibres and hydroxyapatite thus many active functional groups are present on the surface of fish waste such as hydroxyl amino nitro carbonyl and phosphate the broadband at 3281 cm 1 corresponds to oh groups anfar et al 2017 prabu et al 2012 the band at 2917 and 2847 cm 1 relates to ch group alkanes the spectra of smtfw also show peaks at 1650 and 884 cm 1 corresponding to nh bending in amines i and ii of collagen respectively in addition bands at 1530 1372 cm 1 indicate the presence of nitro groups due to no asymmetric stretching of nitro compounds two successive peaks at 1454 and 1413 cm 1 are related to carbonate co3 2 group furthermore the two medium peaks at 1229 and 1039 cm 1 are representative of co groups alcohols carboxylic acids esters and ethers bands between 600 and 500 cm 1 indicate the vibration of phosphate group due to the po asymmetric stretching of the po4 3 group however the ftir spectra of smtfw show a band at 3407 cm 1 assigned to oh stretching the peaks at 1039 cm 1 808 cm 1 669 cm 1 612 cm 1 and 589 cm 1 are assigned to vibrations of po4 3 groups accordingly the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups are the main functional groups on the surface of raw fish waste and smtfw these observations are in good agreement with the previously published ftir data for fish scales khanday et al 2014 the co3 2 and po4 3 band vibrations of smtfw at 1619 cm 1 669 cm 1 608 cm 1 and 596 cm 1 shifted when the cu ii was adsorbed onto its surface fig 4 4 2 adsorption process 4 2 1 effect of adsorbent dose as shown in fig 5a different doses of the smtfw between 50 and 200 mg of the adsorbent were tested the adsorption experiments were carried out for 6 h of contact time 50 ml of the cu ii solution with a concentration of 5 mg l at room temperature and natural ph therefore the adsorption efficiency of cu ii ions on smtfw adsorbent increased progressively from 10 78 to 90 19 as a function of the increase in the adsorption dose of 50 200 mg moreover the optimal dose of smtfw adsorbent was found to be 200 mg in the rest of the study 4 2 2 effect of contact time it is known that during the adsorption method the contact time plays an important role goswami and kumar 2017 in order to evaluate this effect on the adsorption of copper 50 ml solutions of copper were contacted at different times 60 min 120 min 180 min 240 min 360 min and 480 min it is noted that the cu ii initial concentration is 5 mg l with a density of 200 mg of the adsorbent the effect of the contact time is given in the fig 5b the maximum removal capacity of cu ii onto the smtfw adsorbent equal 95 at 360 min clearly the cu ii removal rate increased within contact time ranges from 0 to 360 min then it remained constant even with increasing the contact time the data show that a longer contact time provides sufficient time for the adsorption process to take place and thus increases the absorption of the metal ions of the solution onto the metal binding sites of the adsorbent ahsaine et al 2017 4 2 3 effect of ph the ph of solution medium is an investigating effective parameter for the metal ions adsorption process because it can change the surface charge of the adsorbent li and bai 2005 villaescusa et al 2004 wan ngah et al 2002 the effect of cu ii solution ph on the adsorption process is displayed in fig 5c the cu ii removal as a function of ph was studied by varying the initial ph of the solution and keeping the other parameters constant the experiments were carried out at 200 mg 25 ml smtfw adsorbent mass volume ratio at room temperature for 360 min of equilibrium at different initial ph of cu ii solution varied between 2 and 12 the results of this study are shown in fig 5c in the ph range 2 4 the elimination rate of cu ii ions increased strongly and a maximum removal rate of 96 was achieved in addition when the ph increases from 4 to 12 the cu ii removal rate was decreased slowly and after remained constant from the above observation it can be concluded that the smtfw adsorbent exhibits much higher adsorption capacity under weak acidic condition at the lower ph value low removal rate was noted the reason is that the h concentration is higher at lower ph values and the predominant h competes with cu ii ions in solution resulting in the lower removal efficiency wang et al 2013 on the other hand the higher ph value is beneficial to the deprotonation of the adsorbent surface which increased the negatively charged sites further the increasing of negatively charged sites enhanced the attractive forces between the adsorbent surface and cu ii ions leading to an increase in the adsorption capacity roy and bhattacharya 2012 4 2 4 effect of concentration to study the initial concentration effect of cu ii volumes of 50 ml of different concentrations of cu ii ranging from 6 to 20 mg l are contacted with a mass of 200 mg for each adsorbent at room temperature with stirring of 360 min with a ph 4 the effect of the initial concentration of cu ii on the adsorption by waste fish was shown in fig 5d it was observed that qe increased with the increasing the initial concentration of cu ii the initial concentration of cu ii provides the necessary driving force to overcome the resistance to the mass transfer of metal between the solid phase and the aqueous phase kumar et al 2010 the driving force of the concentration gradient is enhanced as the initial concentration of cu ii increased 4 3 kinetics studies in order to study the controlling mechanisms of the adsorption process and to determine the equilibrium time for optimal adsorption of cu ii adsorption experiments were studied in the contact time range of 1 8 h with an initial dye concentration of 5 mg l 1 and optimal ph 4 the cu ii adsorption increases when the contact time increases when the contact time was approximately 8 h the adsorption efficiency reached 94 81 to examine the controlling mechanism of the sorption process the pseudo first order plot fig 6a the pseudo second order plot fig 6b the elovich plot fig 6c and the intra particle diffusion model fig 6d were discussed the fit of these models was checked by comparing the regression coefficients r2 demiral and güngör 2016 the results of the obtained kinetics parameters and regression coefficients are given in table 1 as shown in fig 6b the straight lines in the plot of t qe versus t were in good agreement with the experimental data as can be seen from table 1 the correlation coefficients obtained from the pseudo second order model are very close to 1 r2 0 9703 the correlation coefficients for pseudo first order and elovich are found to be 0 9338 and 0 8024 respectively therefore this indicates that the cu2 adsorption undergoes the second order kinetic model according to the intra particle diffusion model a plot of qt versus t1 2 should be linear if the intra particle diffusion is involved in the adsorption process and if this line passes through the origin then the intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling step demiral and gündüzoğlu 2010 as shown in fig 6d the plot presented a multi linearity relation indicating that intra particle processes were not the main controlling step during cu2 adsorption the first section is the rapid external surface adsorption correlated with the boundary layer diffusion of adsorbate the second stage is attributed to the gradual adsorption han et al 2011 4 4 adsorption isotherms fig 7a shows the linear form of the langmuir equation as shown in table 2 the maximum uptake capacities qm for cu2 onto smtfw adsorbent was found to be 2 1 mg g 1 the value of kl equals to 3 87 l mg 1 calculated from the slope and intercept of ce qe vs ce based on the correlation coefficient as shown in table 2 langmuir isotherm represents a better fit of experimental data than that of freundlich and temkin isotherms from table 2 the results of dimensionless separation factor indicating that the cu2 adsorption on smtfw is favourable fig 7b shows the linear form of freundlich isotherm freundlich parameters for the adsorption of cu2 onto smtfw were listed in table 2 therefore the value of n 0 1112 less than 1 indicating heterogeneity of the adsorbents and favourable adsorption zhang et al 2005 fig 7 c shows the linear form of temkin isotherm the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 values of temkin plot was not very high and coherent r2 0 9297 therefore the cu2 was adsorbed mainly in the form of monolayer coverage with no transmigration in the plane on the adsorbent surface adsorption capacities of copper ii ions on various low cost adsorbents are presented in table 3 below 4 5 regeneration of smtfw and adsorption mechanism in order to investigate the reusability of cu loaded smtfw adsorbent 200 mg of adsorbent loaded with cu2 molecules was introduced into 50 ml of nacl 0 1 m at ph 5 then the recycled smtfw was filtered and then dried at 105 c four cycles of adsorption desorption studies were carried out accordingly as shown clearly in fig 8 the smtfw regenerated by nacl showed a slight decrease from 94 4 to 89 9 after 4 cycles and then still maintained this suggests that smtfw is an excellent recycling adsorption material the adsorption mechanism of cu2 onto smtfw was outlined considering all the parameters previously studied and ftir analysis after cu2 adsorption generally the first step in the adsorption mechanism was attributed to surface area by cu2 fixation inside the adsorbent pores fig 6 reports the ftir spectra of the smtfw before and after adsorption which clearly confirms the presence of copper ions on the surface and the change in the band intensities of co3 2 and po4 3 this can be due to the electrostatic interactions between co3 2 and po4 3 and cu2 molecule ahsaine et al 2017 5 conclusion this research was carried out to remove cu ii from aqueous solutions using a sustainable mesoporous treated fish waste characterized by thermal analysis scanning electron microscopy sem specific surface area bet and pore size distribution and ftir spectrum adsorption data followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir isotherm batch adsorption experiments can be affected by various key parameters such as adsorbent dose contact time solution ph and initial metal ion concentration the optimal values for removed of 96 of copper in 5 mg l 1 of initial concentration are ph 4 an adsorbent dose of 4 g l 360 min reaction time the regeneration of smtfw showed a low reduction from 94 4 to 89 9 after 4 cycles which suggests that smtfw is an excellent sustainable material adsorption mechanism was proposed suggested the electrostatic interactions are main factors controlling the adsorption capacity these results indicate that the smtfw can be used as an alternative low cost adsorbent for the removal of cu ii from aqueous solutions 
12263,mesoporous treated fish waste obtained at a temperature of 600 c was investigated as a sustainable and cost effective material for copper ii removal in aqueous solution the structural and micro structural study and the chemical composition of our elaborated material were realized by bet sem eds ftir tga and dta several adsorbent effects have been optimized to have adsorbent dose contact time ph of the solution and initial concentration the results revealed that 96 of copper ii was removed in the best adsorption conditions ph 4 an adsorbent dose of 4 g l 360 min reaction time and 5 mg l 1 of cu ii initial concentration experimental results showed that the pseudo second order model gave the best description of the adsorption kinetics of copper ii as well as the langmuir model was the best applicable model to describe the isotherm waste fish show promising results in removing copper ii in aqueous solution these results present new sustainable cost effective material as a promising adsorbent for copper ii removal from wastewater the regeneration of smtfw showed a low reduction which confirmed that our adsorbent can be considered as a sustainable material for copper adsorption finally the adsorption mechanism was proposed on the basis of ftir analyses before and after adsorption graphical abstract fx1 keywords fish waste adsorption copper ii removal low cost adsorbent 1 introduction nowadays industrial activities led to an increase of hazardous pollutants including heavy metals chromium arsenic fluoride cadmium zinc copper which are considered as pollutants of water and soil leading to risks for the ecosystems kumari et al 2017 saikia et al 2017 borah et al 2018 kumar 2016 copper ii is such heavy metal which is of non degradable nature bakhtiari et al 2015 various industries use processes that include copper ii such as metal plating mining operations nuclear power plant metallurgical industries tanneries battery manufacturing industries and textiles

organization who and environmental protection agency epa cheng et al 2010 it becomes extremely toxic when it is presented at a high concentration then 1 3 mg l 1 kong and wang 2016 many studies have

membrane rikame et al 2017 and sand filters tizaoui et al 2012 among these the adsorption process where the fish waste adsorption process is more advantageous for cu ii removal in terms of low cost high surface area and the simplicity of operation however the disadvantage of the fish waste adsorption is the high degree of heat required for the calcination of adsorbent recently the copper ii adsorption in aqueous solutions has been investigated using many adsorbents such as natural bentonite karapinar and donat 2009 poly n phenylglycine nanofibers doh et al 2015 modified carbon foam lee

interactions the linear form of the temkin model is written as hameed 2009 10 q e b ln a b ln c e where b is the temkin constant related to the heat of sorption j mol and a is the temkin isotherm constant l g 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization 4 1 1 thermal analysis the tga and dta curves in fig 1 shows the thermal dehydration of smtfw with a heating rate of 10 k min this analysis was carried out specifically in ambient air when it s about fish waste after heat treatment at 600 c during 2 h fig 1 a the dehydration was accompanied with an endothermic effect followed by mass losses 1 5 at 60 c which is due to the dehydration of water an exothermic effect around 500 c followed by mass losses 6 which can only be due to the loss of the remaining organic matter for the analysis of fish waste after chemical treatment fig 1b the dehydration was accompanied by one endothermic and two exothermic effects followed by three mass losses at around 60 c 350 c and 550 c respectively the first loss is due to the dehydration of water the exothermic effect is due to the loss of the organic matter 4 1 2 scanning electron microscopy fig 2 shows the sem photographs of the fish waste with a magnification up to 6000 kx before absorption fig 2a b and after adsorption fig 2c d pores of different size and different shapes could be observed before absorption additionally after absorption there was a noticeable scattering of salt particles presenting on the fish waste which could be attributed to the copper trapped by the pores some particles to some extent were even trapped into the pores which could possibly block the entry of pores therefore it seems that the adsorptive capacity of the products could increase if the washing procedure was improved 4 1 3 specific surface area bet and pore size distribution the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm along with the pore size distribution of treated fish waste are shown in fig 3a b it can be observed that the isotherm of a treated waste of fish is thoroughly classified as a type iv which is associated with a mesoporous structure also the structure of treated fish waste has pores mainly located in the mesoporous region as shown in the distribution pore size curve the pore size distribution curve indicates that pore sizes centre at 2 85 17 44 and 26 95 nm the bet surface area of treated fish waste is 268 44 m2g 1 the high surface area would provide more active sites for reactants on the treated fish waste surface 4 1 4 ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectra for original and carbonized fish waste with and without dye loading are displayed in fig 4 fish waste is mainly composed of collagen fibres and hydroxyapatite thus many active functional groups are present on the surface of fish waste such as hydroxyl amino nitro carbonyl and phosphate the broadband at 3281 cm 1 corresponds to oh groups anfar et al 2017 prabu et al 2012 the band at 2917 and 2847 cm 1 relates to ch group alkanes the spectra of smtfw also show peaks at 1650 and 884 cm 1 corresponding to nh bending in amines i and ii of collagen respectively in addition bands at 1530 1372 cm 1 indicate the presence of nitro groups due to no asymmetric stretching of nitro compounds two successive peaks at 1454 and 1413 cm 1 are related to carbonate co3 2 group furthermore the two medium peaks at 1229 and 1039 cm 1 are representative of co groups alcohols carboxylic acids esters and ethers bands between 600 and 500 cm 1 indicate the vibration of phosphate group due to the po asymmetric stretching of the po4 3 group however the ftir spectra of smtfw show a band at 3407 cm 1 assigned to oh stretching the peaks at 1039 cm 1 808 cm 1 669 cm 1 612 cm 1 and 589 cm 1 are assigned to vibrations of po4 3 groups accordingly the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups are the main functional groups on the surface of raw fish waste and smtfw these observations are in good agreement with the previously published ftir data for fish scales khanday et al 2014 the co3 2 and po4 3 band vibrations of smtfw at 1619 cm 1 669 cm 1 608 cm 1 and 596 cm 1 shifted when the cu ii was adsorbed onto its surface fig 4 4 2 adsorption process 4 2 1 effect of adsorbent dose as shown in fig 5a different doses of the smtfw between 50 and 200 mg of the adsorbent were tested the adsorption experiments were carried out for 6 h of contact time 50 ml of the cu ii solution with a concentration of 5 mg l at room temperature and natural ph therefore the adsorption efficiency of cu ii ions on smtfw adsorbent increased progressively from 10 78 to 90 19 as a function of the increase in the adsorption dose of 50 200 mg moreover the optimal dose of smtfw adsorbent was found to be 200 mg in the rest of the study 4 2 2 effect of contact time it is known that during the adsorption method the contact time plays an important role goswami and kumar 2017 in order to evaluate this effect on the adsorption of copper 50 ml solutions of copper were contacted at different times 60 min 120 min 180 min 240 min 360 min and 480 min it is noted that the cu ii initial concentration is 5 mg l with a density of 200 mg of the adsorbent the effect of the contact time is given in the fig 5b the maximum removal capacity of cu ii onto the smtfw adsorbent equal 95 at 360 min clearly the cu ii removal rate increased within contact time ranges from 0 to 360 min then it remained constant even with increasing the contact time the data show that a longer contact time provides sufficient time for the adsorption process to take place and thus increases the absorption of the metal ions of the solution onto the metal binding sites of the adsorbent ahsaine et al 2017 4 2 3 effect of ph the ph of solution medium is an investigating effective parameter for the metal ions adsorption process because it can change the surface charge of the adsorbent li and bai 2005 villaescusa et al 2004 wan ngah et al 2002 the effect of cu ii solution ph on the adsorption process is displayed in fig 5c the cu ii removal as a function of ph was studied by varying the initial ph of the solution and keeping the other parameters constant the experiments were carried out at 200 mg 25 ml smtfw adsorbent mass volume ratio at room temperature for 360 min of equilibrium at different initial ph of cu ii solution varied between 2 and 12 the results of this study are shown in fig 5c in the ph range 2 4 the elimination rate of cu ii ions increased strongly and a maximum removal rate of 96 was achieved in addition when the ph increases from 4 to 12 the cu ii removal rate was decreased slowly and after remained constant from the above observation it can be concluded that the smtfw adsorbent exhibits much higher adsorption capacity under weak acidic condition at the lower ph value low removal rate was noted the reason is that the h concentration is higher at lower ph values and the predominant h competes with cu ii ions in solution resulting in the lower removal efficiency wang et al 2013 on the other hand the higher ph value is beneficial to the deprotonation of the adsorbent surface which increased the negatively charged sites further the increasing of negatively charged sites enhanced the attractive forces between the adsorbent surface and cu ii ions leading to an increase in the adsorption capacity roy and bhattacharya 2012 4 2 4 effect of concentration to study the initial concentration effect of cu ii volumes of 50 ml of different concentrations of cu ii ranging from 6 to 20 mg l are contacted with a mass of 200 mg for each adsorbent at room temperature with stirring of 360 min with a ph 4 the effect of the initial concentration of cu ii on the adsorption by waste fish was shown in fig 5d it was observed that qe increased with the increasing the initial concentration of cu ii the initial concentration of cu ii provides the necessary driving force to overcome the resistance to the mass transfer of metal between the solid phase and the aqueous phase kumar et al 2010 the driving force of the concentration gradient is enhanced as the initial concentration of cu ii increased 4 3 kinetics studies in order to study the controlling mechanisms of the adsorption process and to determine the equilibrium time for optimal adsorption of cu ii adsorption experiments were studied in the contact time range of 1 8 h with an initial dye concentration of 5 mg l 1 and optimal ph 4 the cu ii adsorption increases when the contact time increases when the contact time was approximately 8 h the adsorption efficiency reached 94 81 to examine the controlling mechanism of the sorption process the pseudo first order plot fig 6a the pseudo second order plot fig 6b the elovich plot fig 6c and the intra particle diffusion model fig 6d were discussed the fit of these models was checked by comparing the regression coefficients r2 demiral and güngör 2016 the results of the obtained kinetics parameters and regression coefficients are given in table 1 as shown in fig 6b the straight lines in the plot of t qe versus t were in good agreement with the experimental data as can be seen from table 1 the correlation coefficients obtained from the pseudo second order model are very close to 1 r2 0 9703 the correlation coefficients for pseudo first order and elovich are found to be 0 9338 and 0 8024 respectively therefore this indicates that the cu2 adsorption undergoes the second order kinetic model according to the intra particle diffusion model a plot of qt versus t1 2 should be linear if the intra particle diffusion is involved in the adsorption process and if this line passes through the origin then the intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling step demiral and gündüzoğlu 2010 as shown in fig 6d the plot presented a multi linearity relation indicating that intra particle processes were not the main controlling step during cu2 adsorption the first section is the rapid external surface adsorption correlated with the boundary layer diffusion of adsorbate the second stage is attributed to the gradual adsorption han et al 2011 4 4 adsorption isotherms fig 7a shows the linear form of the langmuir equation as shown in table 2 the maximum uptake capacities qm for cu2 onto smtfw adsorbent was found to be 2 1 mg g 1 the value of kl equals to 3 87 l mg 1 calculated from the slope and intercept of ce qe vs ce based on the correlation coefficient as shown in table 2 langmuir isotherm represents a better fit of experimental data than that of freundlich and temkin isotherms from table 2 the results of dimensionless separation factor indicating that the cu2 adsorption on smtfw is favourable fig 7b shows the linear form of freundlich isotherm freundlich parameters for the adsorption of cu2 onto smtfw were listed in table 2 therefore the value of n 0 1112 less than 1 indicating heterogeneity of the adsorbents and favourable adsorption zhang et al 2005 fig 7 c shows the linear form of temkin isotherm the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 values of temkin plot was not very high and coherent r2 0 9297 therefore the cu2 was adsorbed mainly in the form of monolayer coverage with no transmigration in the plane on the adsorbent surface adsorption capacities of copper ii ions on various low cost adsorbents are presented in table 3 below 4 5 regeneration of smtfw and adsorption mechanism in order to investigate the reusability of cu loaded smtfw adsorbent 200 mg of adsorbent loaded with cu2 molecules was introduced into 50 ml of nacl 0 1 m at ph 5 then the recycled smtfw was filtered and then dried at 105 c four cycles of adsorption desorption studies were carried out accordingly as shown clearly in fig 8 the smtfw regenerated by nacl showed a slight decrease from 94 4 to 89 9 after 4 cycles and then still maintained this suggests that smtfw is an excellent recycling adsorption material the adsorption mechanism of cu2 onto smtfw was outlined considering all the parameters previously studied and ftir analysis after cu2 adsorption generally the first step in the adsorption mechanism was attributed to surface area by cu2 fixation inside the adsorbent pores fig 6 reports the ftir spectra of the smtfw before and after adsorption which clearly confirms the presence of copper ions on the surface and the change in the band intensities of co3 2 and po4 3 this can be due to the electrostatic interactions between co3 2 and po4 3 and cu2 molecule ahsaine et al 2017 5 conclusion this research was carried out to remove cu ii from aqueous solutions using a sustainable mesoporous treated fish waste characterized by thermal analysis scanning electron microscopy sem specific surface area bet and pore size distribution and ftir spectrum adsorption data followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir isotherm batch adsorption experiments can be affected by various key parameters such as adsorbent dose contact time solution ph and initial metal ion concentration the optimal values for removed of 96 of copper in 5 mg l 1 of initial concentration are ph 4 an adsorbent dose of 4 g l 360 min reaction time the regeneration of smtfw showed a low reduction from 94 4 to 89 9 after 4 cycles which suggests that smtfw is an excellent sustainable material adsorption mechanism was proposed suggested the electrostatic interactions are main factors controlling the adsorption capacity these results indicate that the smtfw can be used as an alternative low cost adsorbent for the removal of cu ii from aqueous solutions 
12264,understanding the response of physical environment to anthropogenic activities assists land use planning aimed at protecting water resources which prevents society from incurring major economic and social costs this paper aimed to identify the potential contamination of groundwater by human activity at an outcropping area of guarani aquifer system gas the most important hydrogeological unit in south america the methodology used was based on a multi criteria analysis using decision matrices to analyze from algebra mapping in a gis environment the influence of rock units aquifer units soil classes steepness slope shape and land cover and use in contamination potential overall medium to very high potential for groundwater contamination predominates in the area amounting to 69 23 in such areas when the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge the master plans of the municipalities located in the gas outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation são carlos has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs and thereby to protect them however the gas recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas have not been established therefore it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale given that the natural conditions and anthropogenic activities performed in the area of study are reflected in many other periurban wellheads as well as that of the guarani aquifer outcropping are the decision matrices designed can be applied and serve as an agile tool to define the recharge areas to be protected on a preliminary basis graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater contamination land use planning thematic cartography gis 1 introduction groundwater quality degradation has become a global concern who 2008 gleeson et al 2012 custodio 2014 united nations

metallurgical chemical and tanning industries added up pollution sources industrial waste storage and petrol stations johansson and hirata 2004 iritani et al 2013 contribute to increase of water contamination globally nitrate no3 varnier et al 2010 hussain et al 2017 and urban sanitation system asadi et al 2016 have been recognized as the main pollutant and contaminator of aquifers respectively considering this scenario lerner and harris 2009 warn that the intrinsic relationship between groundwater and land coverage and use is not well understood by the majority of people particularly politicians engineers and administrators who lack proper knowledge of the attributes and mechanisms of the physical environment this is because aquifers outcrop over a vast area and groundwater cannot be seen on a global scale one of the greatest challenges for cities is to create real alternatives to the soil use process where the groundwater pollution is not exacerbated having said this cities in brazil have faced great challenges for it has been observed that development of cities infrastructure has happened in a disorderly manner rolnik 2009 in peri urban areas watershed used as wellhead are susceptible to occupation by anthropic activity without proper planning such as urbanization industrialization and farming costa et al 2012 2015b sperandelli et al 2013 as a consequence these activities change the volume and quality of groundwater which compromises the ecosystem services rendered by these basins different methodologies have been developed in order to determine the intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater according to particular physical attributes of a given area but they hardly ever address the impact of human activity drastic aller et al 1987 is one of the worldwide used methods to analyze pollutant s potential in the saturated zone for such it makes use of weighs attributed to seven geoenvironmental attributes water depth recharge in mm year type of material of the aquifer environment type of soil declivity the influence of the unsaturated zone of the soil and the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity in cm s aquifer vulnerability index avi is another method van stempvoort et al 1993 for measuring the vulnerability of groundwater based on the thickness of each sedimentary layer above the saturated zone of the aquifer and their hydraulic conductivity god groundwater overlay deep method proposed by foster et al 2002 only considers hydraulic confinement of groundwater in the aquifer the coverage strata hydrogeological characteristic and degree of consolidation and the depth to the water table in natural vulnerability analysis despite the advantages of these approaches combine the classification of attributes show deficiencies concerning to weights and prioritization of attributes attribution resulting subjectivity dixon 2005 the use of decisions matrices is one of the most common solutions in reducing this subjectivity multi criteria decision analysis mcda incorporates flexibility and de possibility of facilitating the dialogue between scientists and public administrators been applicable in many fields and have demonstrated widely valuable in environmental decision making huang et al 2011 cinelli et al 2014 the most evident advantages of mcda are the possibility of structuring the attributes into a composed hierarchy i e both classes of one attribute and different attributes itself a discussion of meaning and of weights and scores for each criterion according the focused problem and area the use of single scores for adequately characterize complex situation is one of the most efficient multi criteria decision making methods in takes uncertainty in account and incorporating preferences kujawski 2003 linkov et al 2006 velasquez and hester 2013 mcda was early successfully applied to evaluating environmental evaluation concerning groundwater in similar environmental conditions costa et al 2015a piga et al 2017 considering these arguments we chose multi criteria as the most indicate method for evaluating groundwater pollution potential for the study area instead other methods focusing groundwater vulnerability multi criteria analysis defined by boroushaki and malczewski 2010 as a process in which geographic data and the judgment of decision makers are integrated and transformed into relevant and useful information for environmental decision making thus both geographic information system gis and multi criteria analysis can complement each other in this paper the analysis was carried out in a gis environment involving cross referencing of the attributes of natural and anthropic environments since groundwater bodies are closely linked to soil coverage and land use this paper aimed to verify the areas with greater potential for contamination of groundwater in face of anthropogenic activity in feijão river watershed on a scale of 1 50 000 southeast brazil the applied case study has an area of 243 16 km2 and directly recharges guarani aquifer system gas which is the most important hydrogeological unit in south america the outcropping regions only 10 of the system are the strategic supports for the gas and are worthy of attention in order to understand and assess how recharge process takes place feijão river watershed is used as a source of groundwater since 72 deep wells currently under operation were identified as predominantly used for urban industrial and agricultural water supply cprm 2016 2 location and physiography of the study area feijão river watershed is located in the central region of the state of são paulo approximately 230 km away from the city of são paulo fig 1b the basin encompasses part of são carlos 221 950 inhabitants 51 of the

of rocks with hydraulic conductivity varying from 10 5 to 10 4 cm s rebouças and amore 2002 in brazil the gas is constituted by the mesozoic continental sandstones of botucatu and piramboia formations conformed between cretaceous basaltic rocks serra geral formation and its correlates recharge occurs predominantly in areas where sandstones crop out recharge through basalt joints and fractures are considered insignificant in the study area three types of aquifer units were identified sedimentary aquifers porous sandstones from botucatu itaqueri and aluvionar formations fractured aquifer serra geral formation and associated basic intrusive rocks and aquiclude silicified sandstones in botucatu formation fig 1d on a continental geological scale the area is within the phanerozoic coverage geological domain including the sub andean province in geotectonic compartmentalization craton paraná in the structural province of paraná hasui 2012 according to zuquette 1981 and nishiyama 1991 the geological units occurring in feijão river watershed all of them related to panará basin origin and history can be described as follows the geological units quaternary quaternary period is represented by broad plains that occur along the valley floor of feijão river and its tributaries this unit is composed by alluvial and colluvial sediments of sandy texture due to the contribution of adjacent sandy formations the presence of organic matter on superficial layers is common itaqueri formation tertiary period composed of non cemented sandstones with fine to coarse grain sizes with clayey and or silty matrix conglomeratic sandstones argillites and conglomerates this unit represents the post basaltic sedimentary coverage settled over the serra geral and botucatu formations it occupies the summit surfaces on the back of the cuestas reaching about 60 m in thickness serra geral formation and basic intrusives cretaceous period it consists of sequences of basaltic lavas spills and diabase dikes and sills intensely fractured compact structure and aphanitic texture settled onto botucatu formation with a maximum thickness of 80 m silicified sandstones of botucatu formation cretaceous jurassic periods they underlie the basalt of serra geral formation and support vertical escarpments cuestas with 60 and 120 m amplitudes according to paraguassu 1972 the process of silicification of botucatu sandstones resulted from precipitation of silica from groundwater flow botucatu formation cretaceous jurassic periods mainly constituted by aeolian sandstones deposited in desert environments presents fine to medium grain size well rounded particles essentially composed by quartz 80 thickness varies between 20 and 280 m according to iritani and ezaki 2012 this is the main former of guarani aquifer due to its large amount of interconnected pores and high capacity to store and supply water a cross section of the study area is shown in fig 2 the itaqueri formation followed by the serra geral formation and botucatu formation forms the toposequence up to the base over botucatu formation units quaternary alluvial deposits occur fig 2 the soil units occurring in the area can be generically divided into residual soils and neozoic sediments resulted from relief dynamics in the area the residual units resulted from weathering of sandstones argillites basalts and basic migmatites the sediment units show varying combinations of sediments granulometry witch results distinct geological and geotechnical properties due to this nishiyama 1991 classified these soils and sediments units according to its origin for residual and texture for neozoic sediment units and presented they in terms of thickness texture and permeability table 1 in terms of geomorphology according to paulista institute of technology ipt 1981 the basin is located in cuestas basálticas province where degradation reliefs predominate and in dissected plateaus the relief is constituted by hilly relief with a predominance of low slopes of up to 15 and local amplitudes below 100 m and mountainous relief predominance of medium to high slopes over 15 and local amplitudes of 100 300 m the dominant climate of the region is described as the tropical climate with rainy summer and drought winter with an average temperature of 22 c mendonça and danni oliveira 2007 cepagri 2016 the main vegetation classes are cerrados sparsely arboreal savanna short shrub savanna and wet meadows semi deciduous and riparian forests and forest regeneration areas soares et al 2003 3 materials and method in order to obtain the dataset for this study the first task was the search for basic geoenvironmental data to characterizing feijão river watershed once obtained these data its conversion and adjustment needed because most of the data were originally in analogic format the basic data and information used for feijão river watershed digital databank is presented in table 2 data and information about rock units soil and sediments classes and slope forms were obtained from studies and surveys previously done by other authors in the area fig 2 part of data and information from previous works were used for steepness and land use land cover charts the dataset used to composing the databank follows the principles for potential for aquifer contamination early proposed in costa et al 2015b and piga et al 2017 in order to perform the map algebra the information plans were in a matrix format with the same cell size in the same map projection and geodetic reference system the information plans have been georeferenced to the geodetic reference system sirgas2000 ibge 2005 universal transverse mercator projection utm in zone 23 s and arcgis 10 2 esri 2013 was used for the spatial treatment of the information plans fig 3 3 1 aquifers units chart production aquifer units due to their geological formations are one of the primary attributes of the physical environment that have been considered in order to identify the areas with the greatest potentials of groundwater contamination in this study the map of aquifer units fig 1 was elaborated from the analysis of geological maps on a scale of 1 50 000 using lithostratigraphic profiles description of deep wells cprm 2016 completed by field surveys executed with the purpose of checking and validating the geological map from this data analysis geological units were classified according to this hydrological hydrogeological and permeability features defining its respective aquifer unit or aquiclude the aquifers units were divided according to its kind of porosity in porous or fractured and its hydraulic characteristics into unconfined or confined in the case of fractured aquifers factors such as high fracturing of rocks and the presence of fissures were taken into consideration for classification with regard to the sandstones quartz composition of the rock was considered as well as grain size porosity and interconnectivity of pores the aquiclude was mapped along with the silicified sandstones in areas of the botucatu formation at the edges of the cuesta shaped escarpments 3 2 multi criteria analysis basis and procedures this study has used multi criteria analysis in order to identify the areas where the discharge of pollutants onto the surface could cause adverse effects on groundwater multi criteria analysis has been carried out from decision matrices and integrated evaluation of the criteria and through a multidisciplinary team of specialists this method allowed work to be carried out with data describing the heterogeneity of natural systems multi criteria decision analysis mcda provides a systematic methodology to combine the inputs for analysis according to stakeholder views to rank alternatives mcda is usually used to discover and quantify decision criteria in order to compare alternative courses of action there are various approaches with different ways for eliciting inputs and algorithms to combine them and processes for its interpretation the technique has been applied in several applications in environmental researches particularly in water resources management in some applications the researchers taking into account the opinions peoples or groups of the local community but in academic studies many times a group of professionals with expertise in the theme is consulted for defining the influence of each attribute or class of they into the decision process there is a strong accordance that the application of multi criteria methods provides a significant improvement in the decision process due to its low subjectivity and clearance of decisions for each individual person or group in the process when decision matrices were used people were consulted about its opinion of how prioritizing classes of attributes defining weights for analysis all the results of these opinions can be pondered or discussed in experts reunions or debates in order to set de common sense between experts about that theme that was de approach adopted in this work the use of decision matrices provided the assessment of the behavior of each class of a geoenvironmental attribute in relation to another class of a distinct attribute where values were attributed to the intersection of classes such values or weights ranged from 1 to 5 very low low medium high and very high and refer to the contamination potential of the groundwater with crossed matrices the prioritization usually is defined by the greater range of weight it procedure present the conservative idea of maximizes environmental protection once the attribute or its weight with greater value predominates over the other in line x column crossing that was the main reason for double entrance matrices usage in this work in a gis environment the geoenvironmental attributes were cross referenced two at a time in the form of information plans aquifer units soils steepness slope shape and land cover and use costa et al 2015a weighted sum tool available on arcgis 10 2 was used for this purpose in this case values of two information plans were added afterward intersected cells were reclassified with weighs ranging from 1 to 5 and were attributed in the decision matrices the construction mechanics for the decision matrices and the procedures to extract spatial information in a gis environment is illustrated in fig 3 this is an example of the first cross reference performed types of soil aquifer units some symbols like 11 or 44 expresses the positioning of a specific result in a decision matrix i e 44 corresponds to line 4 versus column 4 crossing in the decision matrix 3 3 map algebra map algebra operations were initially defined from a prioritization of operated attributes aquifer units soils granulometry and permeability soils thickness steepness slope shape and land use cover each class of all attributes receives a weight according to its importance for aquifer contamination potential these weights defined for attribute classes were combined using decision matrices in the sequence defined in prioritization the result from each decision matrix combination i e result 1 combination of aquifer units and soils granulometry and permeability was after combined with the next attribute in the prioritization structure soils thickness in the example final result potential for aquifer contamination chart was the result of the last decision matrix combination fig 4 synthesizes the set of procedures for prioritization attributes and classes weights combination according to decision matrices the weights considered for each decision matrix that supported the cross referencing after result 1 are shown in table 3 the aquifer units retract the retardation and purification ability of the substratum in relation to a potentially pollutant discharge i e the characteristics of the aquifer material such as connectivity of empty spaces and degree of confinement will determine the hydrodynamic dispersion of a potential pollutant in the case study a hierarchy was established to attribute weights to the quadrants between the aquifer units and the soil type the sedimentary porous and unconfined aquifers aluvionar botucatu e itaqueri for having higher transmissivity and therefore lower pollutant mitigation capacity were given higher weights followed by fractured aquifers serra geral and basic intrusive and aquiclude respectively soils and sediments properties can be responsible by retarding potential pollutant s percolation to aquifer units this behavior can be conditioned by soils granulometry hydraulic conductivity and layer thickness defining how effortless potentially contaminant solutions can reach the saturated zone thus standard weights were established based on the attributes texture permeability and thickness of soils and sediments where sandy texture and less thick soil profiles represent the higher values considering that the earth surface is too irregular to produce uniform infiltration relief characteristics such as steepness and slope shape define the hydraulic gradient and the flow direction which ultimately influences the pollutants direction thus these attributes affect the ability of a pollutant applied on the surface to flow or remain on the surface being infiltrated with time in this case in steeper slopes with greater surface runoffs reduction of the weights applied to the groundwater contamination was adopted on the other hand flat areas with steepness ranging from 0 to 2 or up to 5 which favor water infiltration contributed to an increase in weights the field curvature determines the sections with surfaces that predominantly concentrate surface water concave which favor infiltration and hence were given higher weights by contrast lower weights were attributed to convex segments of the field since they contribute to the dispersion of water and or pollutants human interference changes the groundwater properties according to the different types of land cover and use foster et al 2002 studied potential anthropogenic activities which contribute in groundwater quality degradation this study analyzed the correlation between groundwater contaminants and human activity using the distribution of weights thus potentially groundwater contaminators such as gas stations industrial plants highways urbanized areas and agricultural activities such as citriculture and sugarcane which resort to the indiscriminate use of agrochemicals have received higher weights to the detriment of less harmful activities such as grazing and reforestation the areas of cerrado arboreal savanna semi deciduous and riparian forest have been considered as negligible potential for contamination 4 results and discussion according to borguetti et al 2004 most recharge areas of guarani aquifer system in brazilian territory still now in terrains covers by agricultural urban and industrial activities due to this situation its delimitation and analysis is essential in order to propose measures to avoid and reduce groundwater contamination evaluating infiltration capacity in feijão river watershed failache et al 2014 verified that rainfall lasting over 60 min does not generate surface runoff thus infiltrating the entire volume precipitated the soil units presenting the greatest recharge potential in the area are residuals soils from botucatu formation and the sediment named sandy i the recharge potential in these areas increases reforestation forests and newly planted sugarcane covers the units presenting lower recharge potential and a greater possibility of generating surface runoff was the soil units residual from serra geral formation in general sense large areas of feijão river watershed act as direct recharge of the gas due to its aquifer class unconfined porous fig 5 illustrates the intermediary results produced in order to make feasible algebra map for potential contamination chart production fig 6 shows significant presence of the areas with medium high and very high classes of contamination potential resulted from this analysis considering that the main contamination sources registered in the area are strongly influenced by human activities the discussions about how natural and manmade attributes controls contamination potential is imperative in order to discuss or propose countermeasures unfortunately due to legal questions and because water quality monitoring in the sites with contamination sources identified only presents qualitative analysis of water in soils and sediments saturated zone i e soil profiles wasn t possible to establish how these contamination sources compromise aquifer resources quality however the nature of substances usually infiltrated from contamination sources in the watershed gas stations dump and automotive industry plant indicates the potential of significant contamination in these areas fig 6 demonstrates that each contamination class has specific characteristics and contributions arisen from interrelations between natural and anthropic environmental components so understanding the relationship between geoenvironmental attributes table 4 and groundwater contamination is crucial in the study area this occurs as described in the following sections the very low contamination potential is distributed throughout the entire basin notably in the eastern and northeastern regions occupying a small area of approximately 0 05 km2 which represents only 0 02 of the study area a large portion of this area 53 5 is subordinated to the serra geral aquifer and basic intrusives basalt with very fine to medium grain size extremely dense acting as fractured and unconfined botucatu aquifer sedimentary porous and unconfined or to the aquiclude formed by the silicified sandstones of botucatu formation which has as characteristic an inability to store and transmit water in the area with very low potential of contamination predominate of residual soils from serra geral formation in 27 8 of the area and mixed sediments 21 4 with clayey matrix according to failache et al 2014 these materials present lower infiltration potential almost 97 4 of the area is related to steepness classes of 5 10 and slopes shapes with horizontal divergent and planar profiles as a result of intense dissection as to land cover and use there was a predominant presence of potentially polluting uses of groundwater such as sugarcane 23 3 citrus cultivation 12 8 and mining in this case though potentially polluting such uses are compatible with the physical environment what minimizing the potential for contamination the low contamination potential is predominantly distributed along the east and north northeast of the basin where 50 5 of the area in this class is associated with the unconfined fractured serra geral aquifer followed by the unconfined sedimentary aquifers of botucatu 30 33 and itaqueri 15 67 the contributing soil types are mixed sedimentary 24 sandy i 19 1 and residual botucatu 15 7 these soils types such sandy textured high permeability coefficients 10 4 a 10 2 cm s and thickness which varies in the order of 10 and 20 m and represent 96 of potential area also steepness classes that range between 5 and 20 which encompass 85 1 of this class of potential being mainly associated to the slope shapes of divergent rectilinear and planar rectilinear slopes favoring hydraulic dispersion by attenuation of possible contaminant discharges applied to the surface the land cover and use are markedly represented by pasture hereupon it was verified that configuration of the physical environment s attributes and presence of a culture that does not pose high potential risks to groundwater contamination were paramount for the low potential of contamination by analyzing the results of medium contamination potential class it was verified that these areas are spread throughout the basin 38 7 km2 which represents 15 9 of the study area in these areas the botucatu aquifer porous and unconfined predominates it is composed of fine medium well selected spherical and equidimensional sandstones without clayey matrix it presents in 57 of this contamination class followed by the unconfined fractured aquifer of serra geral present in 22 9 with regard to the contribution of soil types these are mainly composed of residuals with sandy texture of botucatu formation which cover 38 4 of the class followed by the sandy i type 21 9 both with high permeability coefficients ranging from 10 3 to 10 2 cm s spatially such soil types are derived from the chemical conditioning of botucatu formation which carved a dissected modeling characterized by low steepness up to 10 however these slope classes are dominantly distributed on slopes shapes with divergent profiles rectilinear and convex reducing runoff velocity and favoring formation of thick soils 10 20 m concerning land cover and use the predominance of pastures comprising 40 of the medium potential area reforestation 30 5 and sugarcane 14 6 was verified according to failache et al 2014 the highest infiltration rates in the basin were verified in the reforestation and sugarcane crop areas at the beginning of the cycle in accordance with sandy soils considering the extensive area of the basin occupied by sugarcane crops and the amount of agrochemicals used this area of potential is worthy of attention concomitantly mining areas non metallic minerals are included in this class of contamination potential which although small are known to cause negative impacts on groundwater in terms of contamination in this case it is worth mentioning that the area authorized for opening of new working sites represents future negative impacts due to the possibility of vegetation removal the high contamination potential covers 48 1 km2 which represents approximately 19 8 of the basin area 67 61 of this class is distributed along the unconfined porous aquifer of botucatu whereas 18 36 correspond to itaqueri aquifer the botucatu aquifer consists mainly of fine to medium grained sandstones and itaqueri aquifer of fine to coarse grained therefore both have large amounts of interconnected pores with good capacity to store and transmit water the residual soils of botucatu formation predominate over 43 of the very high potential area followed by the sandy i soil type these soils are sandy and well drained permeability coefficients ranging from 10 3 to 10 2 cm s which facilitates percolation of water and potential pollutants the predominant steepness is low varying from 0 to 5 a condition that allows essentially vertical hydraulic flow in the unsaturated zone however they are distributed in well developed soils with thicknesses of the order of 10 20 m which contributes to slow down the speed of the contaminant on the other hand the convergent concave and rectilinear profile of the slopes shapes favored escalation of the potential for groundwater contamination the soils exposed for preparation for sugarcane cultivation are distributed in 24 of the area followed by pasture with 21 7 sugarcane cultivation 16 2 citriculture 6 3 farms and urbanized areas in addition to the risks posed by citriculture and sugarcane it is important to emphasize that farming land use include the use of septic tanks and other forms of waste disposal which directly discharge into the environment this condition exacerbates the groundwater contamination potential very high potentials predominated in the study area covering approximately 81 4 km2 which represents 33 47 of the basin sedimentary aquifer units composed of sandy matrix present large number of interconnected pores good storage and transmissivity capacity botucatu 64 2 of the area itaqueri 17 8 and aluvionar 12 6 are the outstanding aquifers on such aquifer units there are soils with good hydraulic conductivity 10 3 to 10 2 cm s among them the botucatu formation residual which covers 40 6 of the potential area followed by the sedimentary sandy i type and aluvionar 10 4 to 10 3 cm s these pedological types predominantly occupy areas with dissected and flat relief composed of mildly rolling hills with the steepness of the order of 0 5 concomitant to the shape of slopes with rectilinear vertical segmentation the occurrence of areas presenting soil thicknesses smaller than 1 m and 2 m and related to alluvial soils also contributed to the very high potential upon evaluating the relationship between land cover and use and the very high contamination potential a great contribution of potentially polluting activities was verified such as crops of sugarcane 30 3 citrus 17 8 pasture 15 5 exposed soil prepared for sugarcane cultivation 9 8 pasture in wetlands 8 8 farms 5 7 industrial plants 2 2 highways 1 8 and gas stations 0 1 4 1 driving forces according to spadotto et al 2004 among agricultural activities sugarcane and citrus are the ones which make frequent and often incorrect use of agrochemicals and represent potential sources of contamination of agricultural soils surface water and groundwater these activities occupy extensive areas and due to the amount of agrochemicals used by sugarcane and citriculture it is necessary to establish municipal laws in order to plan for land use in the outcropping areas of botucatu formation it was observed that the contaminated areas gas stations deactivated dumpsite and automotive industry are spatialized in the very high potential class raising the risks of groundwater contamination fig 4 and table 4 for a long time gas stations used iron tanks buried underground over the years these reservoirs have been subject to corrosion due to the material used for manufacture the stored fuel itself and soil humidity in many cases this led to leaks and consequent soil and groundwater contamination foster et al 2002 consider that wells can act as sources of groundwater contamination since they may present design and construction flaws that results in contamination from human activities in the neighborhoods of wells affecting the aquifers in the study area it was verified that out of 72 wells in operation 86 are located in areas with high and very high contamination potential which generates the possibility of one off contaminations mainly because these wells are concentrated in farm areas using septic tanks to dispose of effluents although brazil is at the forefront of legislation with respect to water resources this does not mean that they are protected however on a federal level there is no environmental management instrument directly aimed at protecting the gas recharge areas in the state of são paulo legislation provides that the recharge areas to be protected will be determined based on hydrogeological studies upon hearing the municipalities and other organizations concerned for as long as a specific law is not established for the gas outcropping areas their protection will be restricted to municipal legislation costa et al 2015c moraes et al 2016 concurrent with the scenario laid out it was verified in são carlos municipality between 1989 and 2009 an increase of 684 2 in groundwater exploitation costa et al 2013 by means of overexploitation perroni and wendland 2008 observed a lowering of 0 9 m year in the piezometric levels of deep wells mainly caused by excessive pumping of the guarani aquifer 5 conclusions 69 23 of the study area has groundwater contamination potential this potential varies at a range of 15 95 medium to 33 47 very high the areas with the highest potentials are located on the sedimentary porous and partly unconfined aquifers of botucatu itaqueri and aluvionar these aquifer units are composed of lithologies with sandy particle size a large number of interconnected pores and good storage and transmissivity capacity over such aquifer units are soils with sandy texture characteristic and good hydraulic conductivity predominantly occupying flat areas or relief composed of mildly rolling hills thus it was verified that such configuration of attributes of the physical environment enhances vertical flow of water and contributes to the percolation of potential pollutants pointing to the need for these areas to be addressed by specific guidelines in areas where the conditions of the physical environment imply higher contamination potentials some agricultural crops are worthy of attention as they occupy large areas in the basin and due to the amount of agrochemicals used such as the case of sugarcane including soils exposed in preparation for its cultivation and citriculture which together cover 79 73 km2 representing 32 79 of the study area in the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge the master plans of the municipalities located in the gas outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation the municipality of são carlos sp has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs and thereby to protect them however the gas recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas have not been established therefore it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale the southeastern region of brazil is the most populous and economically developed region of the country the natural conditions and anthropic activity observed in the study area are reproduced in many other peri urban and direct recharge wellheads of the guarani aquifer in these areas the decision matrices can be replicated and serve as an agile instrument to monitor the relationship between human activity and groundwater contamination this will contribute to territorial and hydrographic planning and also

12264,understanding the response of physical environment to anthropogenic activities assists land use planning aimed at protecting water resources which prevents society from incurring major economic and social costs this paper aimed to identify the potential contamination of groundwater by human activity at an outcropping area of guarani aquifer system gas the most important hydrogeological unit in south america the methodology used was based on a multi criteria analysis using decision matrices to analyze from algebra mapping in a gis environment the influence of rock units aquifer units soil classes steepness slope shape and land cover and use in contamination potential overall medium to very high potential for groundwater contamination predominates in the area amounting to 69 23 in such areas when the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge the master plans of the municipalities located in the gas outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation são carlos has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs and thereby to protect them however the gas recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas have not been established therefore it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale given that the natural conditions and anthropogenic activities performed in the area of study are reflected in many other periurban wellheads as well as that of the guarani aquifer outcropping are the decision matrices designed can be applied and serve as an agile tool to define the recharge areas to be protected on a preliminary basis graphical abstract fx1 keywords

metallurgical chemical and tanning industries added up pollution sources industrial waste storage and petrol stations johansson and hirata 2004 iritani et al 2013 contribute to increase of water contamination globally nitrate no3 varnier et al 2010 hussain et al 2017 and urban sanitation system asadi et al 2016 have been recognized as the main pollutant and contaminator of aquifers respectively considering this scenario lerner and harris 2009 warn that the intrinsic relationship between groundwater and land coverage and use is not well understood by the majority of people particularly politicians engineers and administrators who lack proper knowledge of the attributes and mechanisms of the physical environment this is because aquifers outcrop over a vast area and groundwater cannot be seen on a global scale one of the greatest challenges for cities is to create real alternatives to the soil use process where the groundwater pollution is not exacerbated having said this cities in brazil have faced great challenges for it has been observed that development of cities infrastructure has happened in a disorderly manner rolnik 2009 in peri urban areas watershed used as wellhead are susceptible to occupation by anthropic activity without proper planning such as urbanization industrialization and farming costa et al 2012 2015b sperandelli et al 2013 as a consequence these activities change the volume and quality of groundwater which compromises the ecosystem services rendered by these basins different methodologies have been developed in order to determine the intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater according to particular physical attributes of a given area but they hardly ever address the impact of human activity drastic aller et al 1987 is one of the worldwide used methods to analyze pollutant s potential in the saturated zone for such it makes use of weighs attributed to seven geoenvironmental attributes water depth recharge in mm year type of material of the aquifer environment type of soil declivity the influence of the unsaturated zone of the soil and the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity in cm s aquifer vulnerability index avi is another method van stempvoort et al 1993 for measuring the vulnerability of groundwater based on the thickness of each sedimentary layer above the saturated zone of the aquifer and their hydraulic conductivity god groundwater overlay deep method proposed by foster et al 2002 only considers hydraulic confinement of groundwater in the aquifer the coverage strata hydrogeological characteristic and degree of consolidation and the depth to the water table in natural vulnerability analysis despite the advantages of these approaches combine the classification of attributes show deficiencies concerning to weights and prioritization of attributes attribution resulting subjectivity dixon 2005 the use of decisions matrices is one of the most common solutions in reducing this subjectivity multi criteria decision analysis mcda incorporates flexibility and de possibility of facilitating the dialogue between scientists and public administrators been applicable in many fields and have demonstrated widely valuable in environmental decision making huang et al 2011 cinelli et al 2014 the most evident advantages of mcda are the possibility of structuring the attributes into a composed hierarchy i e both classes of one attribute and different attributes itself a discussion of meaning and of weights and scores for each criterion according the focused problem and area the use of single scores for adequately characterize complex situation is one of the most efficient multi criteria decision making methods in takes uncertainty in account and incorporating preferences kujawski 2003 linkov et al 2006 velasquez and hester 2013 mcda was early successfully applied to evaluating environmental evaluation concerning groundwater in similar environmental conditions costa et al 2015a piga et al 2017 considering these arguments we chose multi criteria as the most indicate method for evaluating groundwater pollution potential for the study area instead other methods focusing groundwater vulnerability multi criteria analysis defined by boroushaki and malczewski 2010 as a process in which geographic data and the judgment of decision makers are integrated and transformed into relevant and useful information for environmental decision making thus both geographic information system gis and multi criteria analysis can complement each other in this paper the analysis was carried out in a gis environment involving cross referencing of the attributes of natural and anthropic environments since groundwater bodies are closely linked to soil coverage and land use this paper aimed to verify the areas with greater potential for contamination of groundwater in face of anthropogenic activity in feijão river watershed on a scale of 1 50 000 southeast brazil the applied case study has an area of 243 16 km2 and directly recharges guarani aquifer system gas which is the most important hydrogeological unit in south america the outcropping regions only 10 of the system are the strategic supports for the gas and are worthy of attention in order to understand and assess how recharge process takes place feijão river watershed is used as a source of groundwater since 72 deep wells currently under operation were identified as predominantly used for urban industrial and agricultural water supply cprm 2016 2 location and physiography of the study area feijão river watershed is located in the central region of the state of são paulo approximately 230 km away from the city of são paulo fig 1b the basin encompasses part of são carlos 221 950 inhabitants 51 of the area itirapina 15 524 inhabitants 27 of the area and analândia 4293 inhabitants 22 of the area municipalities ibge 2016 fig 1c the drainage pattern is dendritic christofoletti 1974 and streams are of up to 5th order strahler 1952 in terms of continental hydrogeology fig 1a the gas 1087 880 km2 encompasses territory in brazil argentina paraguay and uruguay the gas is characterized by the presence of rocks with hydraulic conductivity varying from 10 5 to 10 4 cm s rebouças and amore 2002 in brazil the gas is constituted by the mesozoic continental sandstones of botucatu and piramboia formations conformed between cretaceous basaltic rocks serra geral formation and its correlates recharge occurs predominantly in areas where sandstones crop out recharge through basalt joints and fractures are considered insignificant in the study area three types of aquifer units were identified sedimentary aquifers porous sandstones from botucatu itaqueri and aluvionar formations fractured aquifer serra geral formation and associated basic intrusive rocks and aquiclude silicified sandstones in botucatu formation fig 1d on a continental geological scale the area is within the phanerozoic coverage geological domain including the sub andean province in geotectonic compartmentalization craton paraná in the structural province of paraná hasui 2012 according to zuquette 1981 and nishiyama 1991 the geological units occurring in feijão river watershed all of them related to panará basin origin and history can be described as follows the geological units quaternary quaternary period is represented by broad plains that occur along the valley floor of feijão river and its tributaries this unit is composed by alluvial and colluvial sediments of sandy texture due to the contribution of adjacent sandy formations the presence of organic matter on superficial layers is common itaqueri formation tertiary period composed of non cemented sandstones with fine to coarse grain sizes with clayey and or silty matrix conglomeratic sandstones argillites and conglomerates this unit represents the post basaltic sedimentary coverage settled over the serra geral and botucatu formations it occupies the summit surfaces on the back of the cuestas reaching about 60 m in thickness serra geral formation and basic intrusives cretaceous period it consists of sequences of basaltic lavas spills and diabase dikes and sills intensely fractured compact structure and aphanitic texture settled onto botucatu formation with a maximum thickness of 80 m silicified sandstones of botucatu formation cretaceous jurassic periods they underlie the basalt of serra geral formation and support vertical escarpments cuestas with 60 and 120 m amplitudes according to paraguassu 1972 the process of silicification of botucatu sandstones resulted from precipitation of silica from groundwater flow botucatu formation cretaceous jurassic periods mainly constituted by aeolian sandstones deposited in desert environments presents fine to medium grain size well rounded particles essentially composed by quartz 80 thickness varies between 20 and 280 m according to iritani and ezaki 2012 this is the main former of guarani aquifer due to its large amount of interconnected pores and high capacity to store and supply water a cross section of the study area is shown in fig 2 the itaqueri formation followed by the serra geral formation and botucatu formation forms the toposequence up to the base over botucatu formation units quaternary alluvial deposits occur fig 2 the soil units occurring in the area can be generically divided into residual soils and neozoic sediments resulted from relief dynamics in the area the residual units resulted from weathering of sandstones argillites basalts and basic migmatites the sediment units show varying combinations of sediments granulometry witch results distinct geological and geotechnical properties due to this nishiyama 1991 classified these soils and sediments units according to its origin for residual and texture for neozoic sediment units and presented they in terms of thickness texture and permeability table 1 in terms of geomorphology according to paulista institute of technology ipt 1981 the basin is located in cuestas basálticas province where degradation reliefs predominate and in dissected plateaus the relief is constituted by hilly relief with a predominance of low slopes of up to 15 and local amplitudes below 100 m and mountainous relief predominance of medium to high slopes over 15 and local amplitudes of 100 300 m the dominant climate of the region is described as the tropical climate with rainy summer and drought winter with an average temperature of 22 c mendonça and danni oliveira 2007 cepagri 2016 the main vegetation classes are cerrados sparsely arboreal savanna short shrub savanna and wet meadows semi deciduous and riparian forests and forest regeneration areas soares et al 2003 3 materials and method in order to obtain the dataset for this study the first task was the search for basic geoenvironmental data to characterizing feijão river watershed once obtained these data its conversion and adjustment needed because most of the data were originally in analogic format the basic data and information used for feijão river watershed digital databank is presented in table 2 data and information about rock units soil and sediments classes and slope forms were obtained from studies and surveys previously done by other authors in the area fig 2 part of data and information from previous works were used for steepness and land use land cover charts the dataset used to composing the databank follows the principles for potential for aquifer contamination early proposed in costa et al 2015b and piga et al 2017 in order to perform the map algebra the information plans were in a matrix format with the same cell size in the same map projection and geodetic reference system the information plans have been georeferenced to the geodetic reference system sirgas2000 ibge 2005 universal transverse mercator projection utm in zone 23 s and arcgis 10 2 esri 2013 was used for the spatial treatment of the information plans fig 3 3 1 aquifers units chart production aquifer units due to their geological formations are one of the primary attributes of the physical environment that have been considered in order to identify the areas with the greatest potentials of groundwater contamination in this study the map of aquifer units fig 1 was elaborated from the analysis of geological maps on a scale of 1 50 000 using lithostratigraphic profiles description of deep wells cprm 2016 completed by field surveys executed with the purpose of checking and validating the geological map from this data analysis geological units were classified according to this hydrological hydrogeological and permeability features defining its respective aquifer unit or aquiclude the aquifers units were divided according to its kind of porosity in porous or fractured and its hydraulic characteristics into unconfined or confined in the case of fractured aquifers factors such as high fracturing of rocks and the presence of fissures were taken into consideration for classification with regard to the sandstones quartz composition of the rock was considered as well as grain size porosity and interconnectivity of pores the aquiclude was mapped along with the silicified sandstones in areas of the botucatu formation at the edges of the cuesta shaped escarpments 3 2 multi criteria analysis basis and procedures this study has used multi criteria analysis in order to identify the areas where the discharge of pollutants onto the surface could cause adverse effects on groundwater multi criteria analysis has been carried out from decision matrices and integrated evaluation of the criteria and through a multidisciplinary team of specialists this method allowed work to be carried out with data describing the heterogeneity of natural systems multi criteria decision analysis mcda provides a systematic methodology to combine the inputs for analysis according to stakeholder views to rank alternatives mcda is usually used to discover and quantify decision criteria in order to compare alternative courses of action there are various approaches with different ways for eliciting inputs and algorithms to combine them and processes for its interpretation the technique has been applied in several applications in environmental researches particularly in water resources management in some applications the researchers taking into account the opinions peoples or groups of the local community but in academic studies many times a group of professionals with expertise in the theme is consulted for defining the influence of each attribute or class of they into the decision process there is a strong accordance that the application of multi criteria methods provides a significant improvement in the decision process due to its low subjectivity and clearance of decisions for each individual person or group in the process when decision matrices were used people were consulted about its opinion of how prioritizing classes of attributes defining weights for analysis all the results of these opinions can be pondered or discussed in experts reunions or debates in order to set de common sense between experts about that theme that was de approach adopted in this work the use of decision matrices provided the assessment of the behavior of each class of a geoenvironmental attribute in relation to another class of a distinct attribute where values were attributed to the intersection of classes such values or weights ranged from 1 to 5 very low low medium high and very high and refer to the contamination potential of the groundwater with crossed matrices the prioritization usually is defined by the greater range of weight it procedure present the conservative idea of maximizes environmental protection once the attribute or its weight with greater value predominates over the other in line x column crossing that was the main reason for double entrance matrices usage in this work in a gis environment the geoenvironmental attributes were cross referenced two at a time in the form of information plans aquifer units soils steepness slope shape and land cover and use costa et al 2015a weighted sum tool available on arcgis 10 2 was used for this purpose in this case values of two information plans were added afterward intersected cells were reclassified with weighs ranging from 1 to 5 and were attributed in the decision matrices the construction mechanics for the decision matrices and the procedures to extract spatial information in a gis environment is illustrated in fig 3 this is an example of the first cross reference performed types of soil aquifer units some symbols like 11 or 44 expresses the positioning of a specific result in a decision matrix i e 44 corresponds to line 4 versus column 4 crossing in the decision matrix 3 3 map algebra map algebra operations were initially defined from a prioritization of operated attributes aquifer units soils granulometry and permeability soils thickness steepness slope shape and land use cover each class of all attributes receives a weight according to its importance for aquifer contamination potential these weights defined for attribute classes were combined using decision matrices in the sequence defined in prioritization the result from each decision matrix combination i e result 1 combination of aquifer units and soils granulometry and permeability was after combined with the next attribute in the prioritization structure soils thickness in the example final result potential for aquifer contamination chart was the result of the last decision matrix combination fig 4 synthesizes the set of procedures for prioritization attributes and classes weights combination according to decision matrices the weights considered for each decision matrix that supported the cross referencing after result 1 are shown in table 3 the aquifer units retract the retardation and purification ability of the substratum in relation to a potentially pollutant discharge i e the characteristics of the aquifer material such as connectivity of empty spaces and degree of confinement will determine the hydrodynamic dispersion of a potential pollutant in the case study a hierarchy was established to attribute weights to the quadrants between the aquifer units and the soil type the sedimentary porous and unconfined aquifers aluvionar botucatu e itaqueri for having higher transmissivity and therefore lower pollutant mitigation capacity were given higher weights followed by fractured aquifers serra geral and basic intrusive and aquiclude respectively soils and sediments properties can be responsible by retarding potential pollutant s percolation to aquifer units this behavior can be conditioned by soils granulometry hydraulic conductivity and layer thickness defining how effortless potentially contaminant solutions can reach the saturated zone thus standard weights were established based on the attributes texture permeability and thickness of soils and sediments where sandy texture and less thick soil profiles represent the higher values considering that the earth surface is too irregular to produce uniform infiltration relief characteristics such as steepness and slope shape define the hydraulic gradient and the flow direction which ultimately influences the pollutants direction thus these attributes affect the ability of a pollutant applied on the surface to flow or remain on the surface being infiltrated with time in this case in steeper slopes with greater surface runoffs reduction of the weights applied to the groundwater contamination was adopted on the other hand flat areas with steepness ranging from 0 to 2 or up to 5 which favor water infiltration contributed to an increase in weights the field curvature determines the sections with surfaces that predominantly concentrate surface water concave which favor infiltration and hence were given higher weights by contrast lower weights were attributed to convex segments of the field since they contribute to the dispersion of water and or pollutants human interference changes the groundwater properties according to the different types of land cover and use foster et al 2002 studied potential anthropogenic activities which contribute in groundwater quality degradation this study analyzed the correlation between groundwater contaminants and human activity using the distribution of weights thus potentially groundwater contaminators such as gas stations industrial plants highways urbanized areas and agricultural activities such as citriculture and sugarcane which resort to the indiscriminate use of agrochemicals have received higher weights to the detriment of less harmful activities such as grazing and reforestation the areas of cerrado arboreal savanna semi deciduous and riparian forest have been considered as negligible potential for contamination 4 results and discussion according to borguetti et al 2004 most recharge areas of guarani aquifer system in brazilian territory still now in terrains covers by agricultural urban and industrial activities due to this situation its delimitation and analysis is essential in order to propose measures to avoid and reduce groundwater contamination evaluating infiltration capacity in feijão river watershed failache et al 2014 verified that rainfall lasting over 60 min does not generate surface runoff thus infiltrating the entire volume precipitated the soil units presenting the greatest recharge potential in the area are residuals soils from botucatu formation and the sediment named sandy i the recharge potential in these areas increases reforestation forests and newly planted sugarcane covers the units presenting lower recharge potential and a greater possibility of generating surface runoff was the soil units residual from serra geral formation in general sense large areas of feijão river watershed act as direct recharge of the gas due to its aquifer class unconfined porous fig 5 illustrates the intermediary results produced in order to make feasible algebra map for potential contamination chart production fig 6 shows significant presence of the areas with medium high and very high classes of contamination potential resulted from this analysis considering that the main contamination sources registered in the area are strongly influenced by human activities the discussions about how natural and manmade attributes controls contamination potential is imperative in order to discuss or propose countermeasures unfortunately due to legal questions and because water quality monitoring in the sites with contamination sources identified only presents qualitative analysis of water in soils and sediments saturated zone i e soil profiles wasn t possible to establish how these contamination sources compromise aquifer resources quality however the nature of substances usually infiltrated from contamination sources in the watershed gas stations dump and automotive industry plant indicates the potential of significant contamination in these areas fig 6 demonstrates that each contamination class has specific characteristics and contributions arisen from interrelations between natural and anthropic environmental components so understanding the relationship between geoenvironmental attributes table 4 and groundwater contamination is crucial in the study area this occurs as described in the following sections the very low contamination potential is distributed throughout the entire basin notably in the eastern and northeastern regions occupying a small area of approximately 0 05 km2 which represents only 0 02 of the study area a large portion of this area 53 5 is subordinated to the serra geral aquifer and basic intrusives basalt with very fine to medium grain size extremely dense acting as fractured and unconfined botucatu aquifer sedimentary porous and unconfined or to the aquiclude formed by the silicified sandstones of botucatu formation which has as characteristic an inability to store and transmit water in the area with very low potential of contamination predominate of residual soils from serra geral formation in 27 8 of the area and mixed sediments 21 4 with clayey matrix according to failache et al 2014 these materials present lower infiltration potential almost 97 4 of the area is related to steepness classes of 5 10 and slopes shapes with horizontal divergent and planar profiles as a result of intense dissection as to land cover and use there was a predominant presence of potentially polluting uses of groundwater such as sugarcane 23 3 citrus cultivation 12 8 and mining in this case though potentially polluting such uses are compatible with the physical environment what minimizing the potential for contamination the low contamination potential is predominantly distributed along the east and north northeast of the basin where 50 5 of the area in this class is associated with the unconfined fractured serra geral aquifer followed by the unconfined sedimentary aquifers of botucatu 30 33 and itaqueri 15 67 the contributing soil types are mixed sedimentary 24 sandy i 19 1 and residual botucatu 15 7 these soils types such sandy textured high permeability coefficients 10 4 a 10 2 cm s and thickness which varies in the order of 10 and 20 m and represent 96 of potential area also steepness classes that range between 5 and 20 which encompass 85 1 of this class of potential being mainly associated to the slope shapes of divergent rectilinear and planar rectilinear slopes favoring hydraulic dispersion by attenuation of possible contaminant discharges applied to the surface the land cover and use are markedly represented by pasture hereupon it was verified that configuration of the physical environment s attributes and presence of a culture that does not pose high potential risks to groundwater contamination were paramount for the low potential of contamination by analyzing the results of medium contamination potential class it was verified that these areas are spread throughout the basin 38 7 km2 which represents 15 9 of the study area in these areas the botucatu aquifer porous and unconfined predominates it is composed of fine medium well selected spherical and equidimensional sandstones without clayey matrix it presents in 57 of this contamination class followed by the unconfined fractured aquifer of serra geral present in 22 9 with regard to the contribution of soil types these are mainly composed of residuals with sandy texture of botucatu formation which cover 38 4 of the class followed by the sandy i type 21 9 both with high permeability coefficients ranging from 10 3 to 10 2 cm s spatially such soil types are derived from the chemical conditioning of botucatu formation which carved a dissected modeling characterized by low steepness up to 10 however these slope classes are dominantly distributed on slopes shapes with divergent profiles rectilinear and convex reducing runoff velocity and favoring formation of thick soils 10 20 m concerning land cover and use the predominance of pastures comprising 40 of the medium potential area reforestation 30 5 and sugarcane 14 6 was verified according to failache et al 2014 the highest infiltration rates in the basin were verified in the reforestation and sugarcane crop areas at the beginning of the cycle in accordance with sandy soils considering the extensive area of the basin occupied by sugarcane crops and the amount of agrochemicals used this area of potential is worthy of attention concomitantly mining areas non metallic minerals are included in this class of contamination potential which although small are known to cause negative impacts on groundwater in terms of contamination in this case it is worth mentioning that the area authorized for opening of new working sites represents future negative impacts due to the possibility of vegetation removal the high contamination potential covers 48 1 km2 which represents approximately 19 8 of the basin area 67 61 of this class is distributed along the unconfined porous aquifer of botucatu whereas 18 36 correspond to itaqueri aquifer the botucatu aquifer consists mainly of fine to medium grained sandstones and itaqueri aquifer of fine to coarse grained therefore both have large amounts of interconnected pores with good capacity to store and transmit water the residual soils of botucatu formation predominate over 43 of the very high potential area followed by the sandy i soil type these soils are sandy and well drained permeability coefficients ranging from 10 3 to 10 2 cm s which facilitates percolation of water and potential pollutants the predominant steepness is low varying from 0 to 5 a condition that allows essentially vertical hydraulic flow in the unsaturated zone however they are distributed in well developed soils with thicknesses of the order of 10 20 m which contributes to slow down the speed of the contaminant on the other hand the convergent concave and rectilinear profile of the slopes shapes favored escalation of the potential for groundwater contamination the soils exposed for preparation for sugarcane cultivation are distributed in 24 of the area followed by pasture with 21 7 sugarcane cultivation 16 2 citriculture 6 3 farms and urbanized areas in addition to the risks posed by citriculture and sugarcane it is important to emphasize that farming land use include the use of septic tanks and other forms of waste disposal which directly discharge into the environment this condition exacerbates the groundwater contamination potential very high potentials predominated in the study area covering approximately 81 4 km2 which represents 33 47 of the basin sedimentary aquifer units composed of sandy matrix present large number of interconnected pores good storage and transmissivity capacity botucatu 64 2 of the area itaqueri 17 8 and aluvionar 12 6 are the outstanding aquifers on such aquifer units there are soils with good hydraulic conductivity 10 3 to 10 2 cm s among them the botucatu formation residual which covers 40 6 of the potential area followed by the sedimentary sandy i type and aluvionar 10 4 to 10 3 cm s these pedological types predominantly occupy areas with dissected and flat relief composed of mildly rolling hills with the steepness of the order of 0 5 concomitant to the shape of slopes with rectilinear vertical segmentation the occurrence of areas presenting soil thicknesses smaller than 1 m and 2 m and related to alluvial soils also contributed to the very high potential upon evaluating the relationship between land cover and use and the very high contamination potential a great contribution of potentially polluting activities was verified such as crops of sugarcane 30 3 citrus 17 8 pasture 15 5 exposed soil prepared for sugarcane cultivation 9 8 pasture in wetlands 8 8 farms 5 7 industrial plants 2 2 highways 1 8 and gas stations 0 1 4 1 driving forces according to spadotto et al 2004 among agricultural activities sugarcane and citrus are the ones which make frequent and often incorrect use of agrochemicals and represent potential sources of contamination of agricultural soils surface water and groundwater these activities occupy extensive areas and due to the amount of agrochemicals used by sugarcane and citriculture it is necessary to establish municipal laws in order to plan for land use in the outcropping areas of botucatu formation it was observed that the contaminated areas gas stations deactivated dumpsite and automotive industry are spatialized in the very high potential class raising the risks of groundwater contamination fig 4 and table 4 for a long time gas stations used iron tanks buried underground over the years these reservoirs have been subject to corrosion due to the material used for manufacture the stored fuel itself and soil humidity in many cases this led to leaks and consequent soil and groundwater contamination foster et al 2002 consider that wells can act as sources of groundwater contamination since they may present design and construction flaws that results in contamination from human activities in the neighborhoods of wells affecting the aquifers in the study area it was verified that out of 72 wells in operation 86 are located in areas with high and very high contamination potential which generates the possibility of one off contaminations mainly because these wells are concentrated in farm areas using septic tanks to dispose of effluents although brazil is at the forefront of legislation with respect to water resources this does not mean that they are protected however on a federal level there is no environmental management instrument directly aimed at protecting the gas recharge areas in the state of são paulo legislation provides that the recharge areas to be protected will be determined based on hydrogeological studies upon hearing the municipalities and other organizations concerned for as long as a specific law is not established for the gas outcropping areas their protection will be restricted to municipal legislation costa et al 2015c moraes et al 2016 concurrent with the scenario laid out it was verified in são carlos municipality between 1989 and 2009 an increase of 684 2 in groundwater exploitation costa et al 2013 by means of overexploitation perroni and wendland 2008 observed a lowering of 0 9 m year in the piezometric levels of deep wells mainly caused by excessive pumping of the guarani aquifer 5 conclusions 69 23 of the study area has groundwater contamination potential this potential varies at a range of 15 95 medium to 33 47 very high the areas with the highest potentials are located on the sedimentary porous and partly unconfined aquifers of botucatu itaqueri and aluvionar these aquifer units are composed of lithologies with sandy particle size a large number of interconnected pores and good storage and transmissivity capacity over such aquifer units are soils with sandy texture characteristic and good hydraulic conductivity predominantly occupying flat areas or relief composed of mildly rolling hills thus it was verified that such configuration of attributes of the physical environment enhances vertical flow of water and contributes to the percolation of potential pollutants pointing to the need for these areas to be addressed by specific guidelines in areas where the conditions of the physical environment imply higher contamination potentials some agricultural crops are worthy of attention as they occupy large areas in the basin and due to the amount of agrochemicals used such as the case of sugarcane including soils exposed in preparation for its cultivation and citriculture which together cover 79 73 km2 representing 32 79 of the study area in the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge the master plans of the municipalities located in the gas outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation the municipality of são carlos sp has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs and thereby to protect them however the gas recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas have not been established therefore it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale the southeastern region of brazil is the most populous and economically developed region of the country the natural conditions and anthropic activity observed in the study area are reproduced in many other peri urban and direct recharge wellheads of the guarani aquifer in these areas the decision matrices can be replicated and serve as an agile instrument to monitor the relationship between human activity and groundwater contamination this will contribute to territorial and hydrographic planning and also
