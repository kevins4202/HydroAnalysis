17240,interests in the kinetics of radical induced reactions in aqueous solution have grown remarkably due to their water engineering significance e g advanced oxidation processes although compilations of the rate constants k for various radicals have been documented surprisingly a systematic review has yet to be reported on the development of reliable methods for determining k values a knowledge gap exists to critically evaluate and screen the various methods to measure them in this review we summarize the direct and indirect methods under steady state and non steady state conditions followed by critical evaluations on their advantages and disadvantages the radicals of oh so 4 o 2 and cl were chosen based on their significant aquatic environmental relevance ms excel spreadsheets that demonstrate the determination processes were provided allowing one to reproduce the data and or to analyze the unprocessed raw data as a template we formulated a standard operation procedure for the k determination although there is simply no versatile method fitting for all radical reactions finally existing challenges and future research focus are discussed this is the first review covering methodological approaches and considerations aiming to provide a holistic and fundamental basis to choose an appropriate method for determining the k values for bimolecular reactions

defined as species capable of independent existence that contains one or more unpaired electrons halliwell and gutteridge 2015 are important species in biological systems especially related to aging and diseases environmental and biological fate and sustainable environmental friendly remediation of pollutants and water purification basaga 1990 manahan 2017 for example hydroxyl radicals oh hydroperoxyl radicals ho 2 and superoxide radicals o 2 as reactive species in natural sunlit surface waters can promote the transformation of an extensive number of organic contaminants guerard et al 2009 therefore the thermodynamic and kinetics parameters of the reactions of these free radicals have been actively investigated for decades brezonik 1994 stumm and morgan 2012 it is well known that the timescale of radical driven reactions vary by orders of magnitude from slow reactions e g disproportionation reaction of superoxide radical o 2 in a strong alkaline solution in minutes to extremely fast reactions e g reduction reaction of an oxidized compound by hydrated electrons in nanoseconds bielski 1978 poskrebyshev et al 2003a from a phenomenological point of view the bimolecular reaction between free radicals and a target molecule typically follows second order kinetics whereas its reaction rate constant k becomes the most important parameter describing its kinetics under a specific condition i e ph ionic strength and temperature the reaction rate constant reflects the intrinsic nature of bimolecular reactions between radicals and target compounds and these k values can be further used in many occasions as an important input haag and yao 1992 von sonntag 2006 wine et al 1989 for example oxygen derived species such as the o 2 and oh play an important role in tissue damage due to their oxidative degradation of proteins and unsaturated lipids in order to screen out effective antioxidative compounds as radical scavengers one relies on the k value and finds out that a compound with high k value can be used as a good scavenger da silva et al 1991 evaluated the oh scavenger ability of various procyanidins obtained from grape seeds the k values for the reactions varied from 1 20 109 to 3 59 109 m 1 s 1 and they concluded that procyanidins can be effective compounds in trapping oh in living organisms likewise there is a critical need to compile k values of radical species with pollutants for predicting chemical fate exploring viable water treatment technologies and developing environmental regulations jiang 2007 liu et al 2020 squadrito et al 2001 in fact a holistic environmental decision making process relies heavily on contaminant environmental fate models which involves complex systems on the global scale cronin et al 2003 suciu et al 2012 while modelling capabilities have blossomed in complexity and scale new models will necessarily require huge arrays of input data that are not easily measured such as k values for example herrmann et al 1999 presented an updated chemical aqueous phase radical mechanism capram with a box model for three modelling scenarios namely urban rural and marine conditions this box model included extended reaction schemes with production and destruction reactions for radicals such as oh nitrate radical no 3 sulfate radical anion so 4 carbonate radical anion co 3 dibromine radical anion br 2 and dichloride radical anion cl 2 to account for the role of halide ions in marine systems the halide activation reactions were considered in their updated model with the inclusion of the halogen reactions nearly 1 67 10 11 m chlorine radical cl and 1 67 10 6 m bromine radical br were predicted to be generated the cl and br were 10 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of without respectively both cl and br can play extreme roles as reactive species as evident in their pivotal role in atmospheric ozone depletion molina and molina 1992 simpson et al 2007 the example highlights the importance of accurate k values and halogen activation reactions which have a pronounced influence on the accuracy of the reaction models the methods for the determination of aqueous phase rate constants have progressed rapidly and these advancements have been complemented by the development of new analytical techniques to improve the detectability and accuracy zweier and his colleagues employed electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy and spin trap to qualify and quantify radical induced reactions kuppusamy et al 1994 samouilov et al 2004 villamena et al 2003 the esr technique detects paramagnetic species such as the unpaired electron s of free radicals since the half life of these free radicals was often too short to be detected directly using esr compounds known as spin traps were used to trap the radical through covalent bond formation leading to stable adducts or complexes that are readily analyzed by esr harbour et al 1974 rosen and finkelstein 1985 in the presence of excess target compound the pseudo first order rate constant k can be derived from esr signal change for the spin trap thus making quantification of the kinetic processes possible however spin trapping in tandem with esr techniques has significant limitations as the adducts are often still short lived i e thermostability and possess poor selectivity in the presence of other radicals janzen et al 1980 zhang et al 2009 the technique also requires the syntheses of cyclic nitrone spin traps and their uncertain biological impacts janzen et al 1980 villamena et al 2007 these stability and selectivity limitations were overcome by rapid time resolved uv visible spectroscopic techniques huggenberger and fischer 1981 newcomb et al 1992 for example poskrebyshev et al 2003a investigated the reaction of monochloramine with hydrated electron e aq by pulse radiolysis in aqueous solution the k value of the reaction was determined to be 2 2 0 3 1010 m 1 s 1 by recording the decay of e aq absorption at 600 nm using time resolved uv vis spectroscopy this technique can be used to detect and monitor transient radicals in situ thus becoming a powerful and relatively easy to use tool for determination of k values even at or near the diffusion controlled limit yet the direct detection and determination of rate constants for these radical species is limited by their short wavelengths of the light absorbance complicating detection and weak extinction coefficients ε limiting sensitivity in addition to experimental measurements the k values for radical molecule reactions can also be predicted employing collision theory and electronic structure theory within the framework of the kohn sham density functional theory dft bickelhaupt and baerends 2000 galano and alvarez idaboy 2014 phillips 1990 selection of density functional approximations solvation models and various transition state theories can be daunting challenges and the limitations remain to directly calculate the aqueous phase reaction k within the experimentally obtained errors and are beyond the scope of this review adamo and jacquemin 2013 kohn et al 1996 while there have been many reviews that summarized the k values of radical species and while various techniques have been employed to study the kinetics of radical induced reactions a careful and critical scrutinization of pros and cons for each technique is perquisite and central to understand these reactions herein we have complied all the known information regarding different k measurement techniques and appended ms excel spreadsheets for every example we illustrated i e mmc1 and mmc2 the spreadsheets allow one to reproduce the data and to analyze the unprocessed raw data as a template the direct and indirect methods for determining rate constants under steady state ss and non ss conditions have been carefully described and exemplified in this review noted the raw data appended in spreadsheets were estimated from their original figures therefore the k values reported herein may slightly deviate from the reported values in the literature to identify the knowledge gap in the development of measuring method critical discussions of the advantages and disadvantages are provided in addition we developed a standard operation procedure for the k value determination to ensure the best practices and maintain the organizational knowledge we finally completed the review with concluding remarks and recommendations for future investigations we aim to provide a holistic and fundamental basis to choose an appropriate mainstream method for measuring the k values for radicals and target compounds of interest the radicals under consideration in this review are oh so 4 o 2 and cl due to their high chemical and environmental relevance asada 1994 thomas and aust 1986 hydroxyl radical for example can react with various organic and inorganic contaminants even pathogenic microorganisms i e disinfection and the efforts exerted on its reactivity are of scientific and regulation importance in wastewater treatment processes and decontamination of pollutants in natural waters gligorovski et al 2015 wei et al 2019 xiao et al 2020a in addition so 4 has been implicated as an important intermediate in cloud water playing a crucial role in acid rain chemistry as well as in advanced oxidation processes for water treatment huie and neta 1984 superoxide radical can be generated in sunlit natural waters together with dissolved organic matter and it can maintain the redox cycles of dissolved trace metals such as fe2 and cu2 halliwell and gutteridge 1984 in addition a specific marine bacterium roseobacter sp azwk 3b can produce o 2 which is involved in the oxidation of soluble mn2 into insoluble manganese oxide deposits in the ocean berner et al 2007 chloride radical is generated during uv free chlorine process an emerging water technology for disinfection bu et al 2018 minakata et al 2017 similar to so 4 cl exhibits high reactivity typically diffusion controlled and plays a significant role as a strong oxidant for organic sulfur substances in marine atmospheric aerosols and droplet mediated reactions in cloud waters zhu et al 2005 the main physicochemical properties of the radical species under study are tabulated in table 1 2 hierarchy and classifications the review consists of several sections in section 1 the importance of rate constants for the radical induced reactions and the methodology for their determination measurements are presented in section 2 the hierarchy of the review and classifications of the methodologies are discussed sections 3 and 4 summarize the direct and indirect methods for determining rate constants under steady state ss and non ss conditions critical discussions of the advantages and disadvantages are discussed in section 5 finally concluding remarks and recommendations for future investigations are provided in section 6 the aqueous phase rate constants for bimolecular reactions between radicals and target compounds can be determined via direct and indirect methods fig 1 direct detection and observation of the radical target compound or transient product during the course of reaction can be used to determine k neta et al 1988 yu 2004 in contrast indirect methods employ a molecular trap or competition reaction which can extend the lifetime or detectability of the initial reaction product or whose absolute rate constant with target radical is already known buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 this approach is based on the competition reactions between the radical under study target and reference compounds meanwhile direct and indirect methods can be applied under ss and non ss radical conditions the descriptions of these important terms i e direct and indirect methods ss and non ss are compared in table 2 3 direct methods workbook mmc1 xlsx based on fig 1 the k value for radical and target compound can be measured when the radical is generated at a ss concentration where its formation rate is equal to consumption rate or non ss for a ss system the k value can be derived from degradation kinetics of the target compound present at a large concentration excess characterized by k when ss concentration of the radical radical ss is known 1 d target compound dt k target compound where k is equal to k radical ss by varying radical ss different k values can be determined then by plotting k vs radical ss the k value is determined as the slope in reality radical ss varies by the initial concentration of a target compound however the time dependent target compound decay is not always feasible due to the undetectable absorbance of the target compound thus directly measuring k values for the radical induced reactions in ss systems are not commonly used nevertheless one can still find a solution for example oh is initiated by uv photolysis of h2o2 with a constant primary quantum yield ϕ in a uv h2o2 system thus a relationship between oh ss and h2o2 can be obtained because of the availability of wavelength that detects the h2o2 and ho 2 this example will be elaborated in section 3 1 1 in contrast directly measuring k values in non ss systems are quite commonly employed baxendale et al 1968 westerhoff et al 2007 zona et al 2010 for a non ss system typical experimental conditions are expected to exhibit two features 1 only one primary radical i e transient radical is present in the system and 2 the concentration of the non radical species is high enough typically a 10 fold excess to ensure that pseudo first order kinetics is obeyed marquez et al 1996 powers 1978 2 d radical dt k radical where k is equal to k target compound therefore by varying the concentration of the target compound instead of radical ss and incorporating in eqn 2 the k value between the radical and target compound can be obtained by plotting k vs target compound 0 specifically k can be derived by directly monitoring the decay of the primary radical by its spectroscopic signals in the case that the spectroscopic property of the radical is unsuitable for monitoring the growth of the primary transient product could also be monitored it should be noted that varying the concentration of the target compound eliminates error due to reactions of the primary radicals with themselves or with impurities in the solvent buxton et al 1988 3 1 direct k measurements in a steady state system the direct method for k measurement of the radical induced reactions in ss systems is not commonly seen due to the difficulty in quantifying radical ss however there is an exception for oh as oh ss can be alternatively deduced from its precursor concentration i e h2o2 and actinometry briefly with h2o2 as actinometer ϕ 1 mol photon 1 and ε 19 m 1 cm 1 beltran et al 1995 the irradiation intensity and the effective path of irradiation in a reactor can be determined it should be noted that the premise for using the direct method with oh ss deducing from h2o2 is that the target compound should be recalcitrant to uv photolysis 3 1 1 oh worksheet oh radical target compound the direct measurement for the k values at ss can be performed by monitoring the target compound mazellier and leverd 2003 investigated the degradation kinetics of 4 tert octylphenol op at ph 6 in a uv h2o2 system that generated oh in ss at the given ph the h2o2 is the dominant species given that pk a of h2o2 is 11 6 smith and martell 1976 the working solution contained op op 0 1 μm and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 0 0 06 0 20 m and it was irradiated at the wavelength of 253 7 nm for 3 min as a control no degradation was observed when 1 μm op was mixed with a high h2o2 concentration in the absence of uv light and the direct uv photolysis of op in the absence of h2o2 has also been determined to be negligible in their system the concentration of oh was assumed to be at the ss condition as the continuous uv irradiation and sufficient availability of h2o2 during the entire reaction time here we derive the equations in the referred study to present the process of the k measurement step by step for the formation of oh generated by uv photolysis of h2o2 3 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh the formation rate of oh was equal to the consumption or decay rate of the oh precursor i e h2o2 here 4 d oh d t form ϕ oh pri i 0 a h 2 o 2 a tot 1 e 2 3 a tot where ϕ oh pri is the primary quantum yield of oh formation equal to 1 nicole 1990 ι 0 is the photon fluence rate in the range of 4 9 6 1 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 a h 2 o 2 expressed by ε h 2 o 2 h2o2 l is the absorbance of h2o2 in the working solution ε is the molar extinction coefficient and l is the optical path length of the reactor a tot is the absorbance of the solution at 253 7 nm and it arises from two sources absorbance due to h2o2 and other absorbing species as including op thus a tot can be expressed by l ε h 2 o 2 h2o2 σε as as by working with high h2o2 concentrations 0 03 0 2 m the absorbance of the solution at 253 7 nm can be normalized to the absorbance of h2o2 in the solution thus a h 2 o 2 is equal to a tot and e 2 3 a tot approximates to 0 then eqn 4 can be simplified to 5 d oh d t form ϕ oh pri i 0 for the consumption of oh in the system oh can react with h2o2 k oh h 2 o 2 op k oh op and other scavengers s that are present in the solution k oh s then the rate of consumption of oh can be described as 6 d oh d t consump k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh k oh op op oh k oh s s oh at ph 6 the contribution from deprotonated h2o2 as perhydroxyl anion ho 2 is negligible due to its pk a of 11 7 smith and martell 1976 by definition at ss the formation and consumption of oh are equal thus eqns 5 and 6 are equal and can be rearranged to 7 oh ss ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh op op k oh s s the term k oh s s was estimated to be 2000 300 s 1 mazellier and leverd 2003 when the h2o2 concentration is in excess for example h2o2 op 6 104 oh mainly reacts with h2o2 thus the terms k oh h 2 o 2 h2o2 k oh op op k oh s s can be condensed to k oh h 2 o 2 h2o2 8 oh ss ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 upon irradiation oh initiated by uv photolysis of h2o2 led to rapid disappearance of op under the experimental conditions the uv light was essentially completely absorbed by the high concentration of h2o2 with the direct photolysis of op negligible therefore the oh mediated op disappearance rate can be described by 9 d op d t k oh op op oh ss k oh op ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 op the concentration of h2o2 remained relatively constant h2o2 t h2o2 0 0 98 thus eqn 9 can be integrated to 10 ln op 0 ln op t k oh op ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 1 h 2 o 2 0 t bt where b is equal to k oh op ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 1 h 2 o 2 0 the slopes i e b of the plots of ln op t op 0 against reaction time are illustrated in fig 2 together with k oh h 2 o 2 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 christensen et al 1982 the plot of the b as a function of the reciprocal of h2o2 0 is presented in fig 2 inset yielding a k oh op of 6 0 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 it should be noted the ss assumption should be considered only in the early stages of the reactions as the presence of intermediate products can interfere with the kinetics through scavenging of oh 3 2 direct k measurements in a non steady state system directly measuring k in a non ss system of an individual radical is commonly employed we include four radicals oh so 4 o 2 and cl reacting with target compounds as these radicals are of great interest in the field of aquatic and atmospheric chemistry and physiological biochemistry 3 2 1 oh in a non ss system the k value for a bimolecular reaction between oh and a target compound can be measured by directly observing 1 the decay of oh and 2 the formation of transient product directly observing the decay of oh is not typically seen since oh only has a nondescript absorption with a weak feature around 230 nm in aqueous solution nielsen et al 1976 in addition when the target compound investigated has distinctive absorption in this region which is especially true for aromatic compounds directly monitoring the decay of oh around 230 nm is not feasible due to the issues such as overlapping absorption with background water and other species herrmann 2003 however when the target compound is aliphatic such as alcohols with negligible absorption around 230 nm k can be obtained by the mathematically manipulated absorbance as a function of reaction time alam et al 2003 ershov et al 2008 milosavljevic and laverne 2005 consequently directly determined k values in the non ss solution are often achieved by the product build up kinetics p b k technique indeed p b k technique is considered to be a promising alternative when the transient product exhibits an observable absorption i e transient spectra however the selection of experimental conditions should be considered with caution to ensure that the transient product does not react further with oh if this is not possible appropriate corrections should be made to compensate for the extra consumption of oh buxton et al 1988 3 2 1 1 p b k technique worksheet oh transient product directly measuring k values at non ss is often achieved by the p b k technique for example song et al 2009 measured the k value of n n diethyl m toluamide deet with oh in aqueous solution at non ss by pulse radiolysis three different reactive species oh e aq and hydrogen atoms h were produced by radiolysis of aqueous solution 11 h 2 o γ radiolysis e aq oh h h 2 h 2 o 2 the solution was saturated with nitrous oxide n2o before irradiation to eliminate dissolved oxygen and to convert the e aq and h to oh as shown below 12 e aq n 2 o h oh n 2 13 h n 2 o oh n 2 these diffusion controlled reactions between n2o and e aq h ensure that within a few microseconds oh is the predominant species for the reaction of oh and deet the formation rate of the transient product is equal to the consumption of oh 14 d product d t form d oh d t consump k oh deet oh deet where k oh deet is the rate constant for oh reacting deet when deet is in excess compared to oh pseudo first order kinetics can be achieved 15 product t oh 0 oh t oh 0 oh 0 e k oh deet deet t the concentration of the transient product of the reaction between deet and oh hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical is proportional to the absorbance a at 330 and 270 nm thus a plot of a against t can yield the k values at different deet 0 after fitting the plot of k vs deet 0 to a linear line fig 3 k oh deet was determined to be 4 95 0 18 109 m 1 s 1 based on eqn 16 16 k k oh deet deet it should be noted that the fitted line in fig 3 does not go through the zero in fact non zero intercept is commonly seen in plots of k vs concentrations in any k determination processes this is attributed to several factors including 1 impurities in the working solutions that react with target radicals von sonntag and schuchmann 1994 2 coexisting radicals even with zero concentration of the target chemicals there are other radicals that coexist and may slow down the reactions buxton et al 1988 3 low limit of detection for the radical that is monitored mocak et al 1997 peltier et al 2007 4 backward reaction when the chemical concentration is zero k indicates the rate constant for the reverse reaction because we can assume no forward reaction 5 radical termination with the zero concentration of chemical termination of radicals that coexist can occur which shows lower limit values of reactivities liu et al 2016 3 2 2 so 4 worksheet so 4 radical since so 4 has a strong broad optical absorption feature around 450 nm table 1 it allows for direct measurement of its decay for the k determination grgic et al 2007 neta et al 1977 redpath and willson 1975 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 zhou et al 2017 measured the k value of diatrizoate dtz reacting with so 4 using laser flash photolysis persulfate ps is used as a common precursor for generating so 4 by various activation mechanisms through uv heat and catalysts monteagudo et al 2015 in their study so 4 was generated by activation of ps under simulated solar irradiation 17 ps hv 2 so 4 for the reaction of so 4 and dtz the consumption rate of so 4 in the system can be described as 18 d so 4 d t k so 4 dtz so 4 dtz where k so 4 dtz is the rate constant of dtz with so 4 the initial so 4 was much lower than that of the dtz 0 thus pseudo first order kinetics was followed 19 so 4 so 4 0 e k t where k is the transient product of k so 4 dtz multiplying dtz the decay of so 4 monitored at 450 nm vs reaction time was fitted and the k value of dtz with so 4 was estimated to be 1 9 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 fig 4 it should be noted that the k value of a target compound reacting with so 4 can also be measured by the p b k technique bansal and fessenden 1978 eibenberger et al 1978 o neill et al 1975 steenken et al 1977 however we do not exemplify p b k technique as the reported studies do not give specific raw data allowing us to reproduce the analyses 3 2 3 o 2 o 2 superoxide radical exhibits a distinct absorption spectrum around 245 nm in aqueous and ethanolic solutions bielski 1978 thus its concentration can be directly monitored and rate constants can be determined by o 2 decay bielski et al 1985 bielski and richter 1977 similar to oh this method is limited in practice due to spectral overlap with any target compounds absorbing around this uv region kwon and lee 2004 this is particularly true in geobiochemistry since in natural waters the occurrence of o 2 produced by solar irradiation of colored dissolved organic matter and metabolic processes in phytoplankton is extremely low typically on the nanomolar level blough and zepp 1995 direct monitoring of o 2 245 nm is therefore not practical for not meeting the interferences and sensitivity requirements kwon and lee 2004 alternatively the k value of a target compound reacting with o 2 can also be measured by the observation of time dependent absorption of transient product by optical means i e p b k technique 3 2 3 1 direct monitoring o 2 decay worksheet o 2 radical for high concentration of o 2 the k values for o 2 driven processes can be determined by monitoring o 2 decay as it has a considerable molar extinction coefficient ε of 2 350 m 1 cm 1 at 245 nm bielski et al 1985 peretz et al 1982 investigated the disproportionation of the o 2 in the presence of fe iii tmpyp a fe iii and porphyrin complex by observing the decay rate of o 2 at 254 nm first oxygenated solutions containing 2 mm phosphate buffer and 5 mm hcoo scavenger of oh were γ irradiated at ph 8 under these experimental conditions they ensured that the primary radical after the pulsed radiation was o 2 as the pk a of ho 2 is 4 8 20 h 2 o γ radiolysis e aq oh h h 2 h 2 o 2 21 e aq o 2 o 2 22 oh hcoo h 2 o co 2 23 co 2 o 2 o 2 co 2 24 h o 2 ho 2 25 ho 2 o 2 h in the absence of the target compound the decay of o 2 due to disproportionation reaction follows second order kinetics 26 o 2 o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 o 2 2 oh 27 d o 2 d t 2 k d o 2 2 where k d is the uncatalyzed disproportionation rate constant in the presence of a target compound fe iii tmpyp the consumption of o 2 arises from two sources namely disproportionation of o 2 and reaction with fe iii tmpyp 28 d o 2 d t 2 k d o 2 2 k o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe iii tmpyp o 2 where k o 2 fe iii tmpyp is the k value of catalytic disproportionation reaction of o 2 by fe iii tmpyp it should be noted that the concentration of fe iii tmpyp was determined to be constant due to its formation consumption balance 29 o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe ii tmpyp o 2 30 o 2 fe ii tmpyp o 2 2 h fe iii tmpyp o 2 h 2 o 2 the authors claimed that without fe iii tmpyp the disproportionation of o 2 could be ignored thus eqn 28 could be simplified to 31 d o 2 d t k o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe iii tmpyp o 2 assuming constant concentration of fe iii tmpyp pseudo first order kinetics were modeled and k was expressed by 32 k k o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe iii tmpyp ultimately the k can be obtained by fitting various o 2 decays in the presence of different concentrations of fe iii tmpyp one example is in the inset in fig 5 as illustrated in fig 5 a linear dependence of k on the various concentrations of fe iii tmpyp yielded the slope which was equal to k o 2 fe iii tmpyp 3 0 108 m 1 s 1 3 2 3 2 p b k technique worksheet o 2 transient product the p b k technique can be an alternative method to measuring the k value for o 2 reacting with a target compound when the spectrum of the target compound overlaps that of o 2 greenstock and ruddock 1976 employed p b k technique to measure the k value for the reaction of o 2 with p benzoquinone bq pulse radiolysis of oxygen saturated solutions with oh scavenger tertiary butyl alcohol tba provides a method for generating o 2 the generation of o 2 has been described in 3 2 3 1 except the oh scavenging reaction 33 oh tba tba h 2 o when the target compound bq was added into the system the rate of formation of the transient product b q whose feature absorption is at 410 nm was described by 34 d bq d t form k o 2 bq o 2 bq where k o 2 bq is the rate constant for o 2 reacting with bq when bq was in excess compared to o 2 pseudo first order kinetics were obeyed 35 bq t o 2 0 o 2 t o 2 0 o 2 0 e k o 2 bq bq t thus time dependent absorption of bq was monitored at 410 nm at different bq 0 36 k k o 2 bq bq 0 then k o 2 bq was obtained by fitting the plot of k vs bq 0 see fig 6 and it was determined to be 9 108 m 1 s 1 3 2 4 cl there are three common techniques for measuring the k values for the reactions of cl and target compounds first although cl is extremely transient it can be monitored by its optical absorption at 320 nm with the ε of around 4 000 m 1 cm 1 klaning and wolff 1985 treinin and hayon 1975 thus the k value for a cl initiated reaction can be obtained second in the presence of cl the k value can also be obtained by its equilibrium constant with cl 2 k 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 37 cl cl cl 2 cl 2 dichloride radical exhibits broad absorption with maximum at 340 nm ε 340 nm 8 800 m 1 cm 1 and it is a strong oxidant with redox potential 2 1 v vs nhe see table 1 yu et al 2004 by monitoring the decay of cl 2 the k value for the reaction of cl and a target compound can be derived it should be noted that the kinetics measured by the equilibrium constant k method is typically investigated in solutions containing cl and ps under irradiation condition so 4 quickly oxidizes cl to cl and reacts with extra cl forming an equilibrium with cl 2 which then can be detected by uv spectroscopy third for a transient product exhibiting observable absorption outside of the absorption range of cl the k value can be determined by monitoring the formation of the transient product i e p b k 3 2 4 1 direct monitoring cl decay worksheet cl radical the k value for a cl initiated reaction can be directly obtained by monitoring its optical absorption at 320 nm buxton et al 2000 measured the k value for the reaction of cl with tba by laser flash photolysis of chloroacetone in aqueous solution at 25 c in their study cl was generated by laser photolysis of ar saturated solution containing 2 10 2 m chloroacetone at 248 nm 38 ch 3 coch 2 cl hv 1 ch 3 coch 2 cl 39 1 ch 3 coch 2 cl ch 2 coch 3 cl where 1 ch3coch2cl is the excited singlet state of chloroacetone the time dependent absorption profile at cl characteristic absorption at 320 nm was monitored and the absorption was fitted to a first order decay until reaching a plateau it should be noted that ch2coch3 absorbance is negligible at 320 nm while cl is not with ε of 4 500 m 1 cm 1 thus the absorbance at 320 nm can be attributed primarily to cl as fig 7 illustrates the rate of cl decay increases by the addition of tba yielding k values between cl and tba ultimately the k values vs tba 0 yielded the k value to be 3 108 m 1 s 1 fig 8 in addition they also obtained the k values at different temperatures e g 5 15 and 35 c to determine the arrhenius kinetic parameters in fig 8 3 2 4 2 direct monitoring cl 2 decay worksheet cl 2 radical by monitoring the decay of cl 2 the k value for the reaction of cl and a target compound can also be derived from equilibrium constant k between cl 2 and cl alegre et al 2000 investigated k values of cl and cl 2 oxidation of benzene bz by conventional flash photolysis with 5 10 3 m ps in 0 1 m nacl solutions flash photolysis of ps at low ph leads to the generation of so 4 40 ps hv so 4 then in the presence of high concentrations of cl ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 m so 4 can be readily depleted and forms cl 41 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl except for the equilibrium reaction between cl and cl 2 they claimed that there were competing reactions potentially depleting cl 2 cl in the system 42 cl 2 h 2 o hoclh cl 43 cl h 2 o hoclh 44 cl 2 bz cl organic radicals 45 cl bz organic radicals then the apparent first order decay of cl 2 k can be described 46 k k cl 2 h 2 o k c l h 2 o k c l k c l bz k c l k cl 2 bz bz since cl used in their experiments is high eqn 43 does not contribute to the first order decay component of cl 2 due to k c l h 2 o k cl k cl 2 h 2 o thus eqn 46 could be simplified 47 k k cl 2 h 2 o k c l bz k c l k cl 2 bz bz for a given cl 0 faster decay rates of cl 2 were observed for increasing bz 0 noted that the k value is 1 4 105 m 1 thus they concluded that the ratio cl 2 cl 10 was expected when cl 0 was greater than 1 10 4 m consequently they neglected the contribution of cl to the observed absorbance at 340 nm the absorption a which is due to cl 2 then can be fitted according to eqn 48 48 a f e k t h where k is constant at a certain bz 0 h is also constant and may be due to a longer lived species formed after cl 2 depletion and f is a pre exponential factor and cannot be explicitly determined with a fixed cl 0 the k values in the presence of bz can be fitted then by varying cl 0 the k values of cl 2 were determined fig 9 the slopes of the lines shown in fig 9 were then plotted against cl 1 yielding fig 10 the slope of the line in fig 10 multiplying k yielded the k c l bz of 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 3 2 4 3 p b k technique worksheet cl transient product the k values for cl induced reactions can also be determined by monitoring the formation of the transient product when it exhibits observable absorption lei et al 2019 determined the k value for cl reacting with bisphenol a bpa using laser flash photolysis of chloroacetone by applying p b k technique the formation mechanism of cl has been discussed in 3 2 4 1 the transient product generated from the reaction of cl with bpa exhibited a unique absorption peak at 420 nm thus the product formation kinetics can be expressed 49 d product d t form k c l bpa c l bpa where k cl bpa is the k for cl reacting with bpa the kinetic experiments were conducted in pseudo first order condition thus 50 cl t cl 0 e k t 51 product t cl 0 cl t cl 0 cl 0 e k t 52 k k c l bpa bpa where product t is the concentration of the product formed at time t cl 0 is the initial concentration of cl fitting the time dependent absorption of the transient product k value can be obtained at a given bpa 0 a plot of k vs bpa 0 yielded a linear line with the slope equal to k c l bpa i e 1 82 1010 m 1 s 1 fig 11 4 indirect methods workbook mmc2 xlsx the indirect method of k value determination can be applied under both ss and non ss conditions based on fig 1 determining the k values for bimolecular reactions of radical species at its ss concentration by the indirect method is commonly used however the most important premise for using indirect methods in ss system is that an exact knowledge of the mechanism of the radical reactions relative rate constants of the two competing reactions i e radicals with both target and reference compounds can be determined by monitoring reactant and reference degradation kinetics based on the known k value of the reference compound the k value for the target compound can be derived in addition k value for the target compound can also be deduced from radical ss which can be determined by monitoring the degradation of a probe compound with a known k value see 4 1 1 1 it should be noted that there is a difference between reference and probe compounds a reference compound is used to compete for the radical in the system in which target compound is present the ratio of degradation rates between reference and target compounds is directly proportional to a ratio of their k values de heredia et al 2001 53 k radical target compound k radical reference d target compound target compound d reference reference ln target compound t target compound 0 ln reference t reference 0 thus based on known k values of the reference compound the k value of a target compound can be derived as the ratio by monitoring the total degradation rate in contrast a probe compound is used to quantify the radical ss in a system where the target compound is absent then based on the known radical ss the k value for the target compound can be derived by directly monitoring its degradation rate 54 d target compound d t k radical ss target compound for a non ss system in the presence of the target compound the competition of reference and target compounds for the radical generates different observable endpoints e g absorbance as compared to the case in the absence of the target compound specifically the yield ratios of the transient product of the reference compound is determined as a function of the ratio of concentrations of the reference compound to the target compound from a plot of the yield ratios vs the concentration ratios and the known k with the reference compound the unknown k of the target compound can be derived generally the application of indirect method in non ss system requires three criteria buxton et al 1988 first it can only be applied when the light absorbance of the transient product of a target compound does not overlap with that of a reference compound second the product of a reference compound should be unreactive and stable third the formation of the product from the reaction between a reference compound and radicals in general should be an elementary step however there may be exceptions to this rule for example scn a widely used reference compound can react with oh and or cl forming scn 2 via intermediate radicals scnoh and scn although this is a multistep reaction previous studies suggested that the possible intermediate radicals e g scnoh and scn do not impact the absorbance measurement of scn 2 as the lifetime of the scnoh complex is extremely short 5 ns and scn radicals quickly transform into scn 2 with a large excess of scn herrmann et al 2010 4 1 indirect k measurements in a steady state system indirect methods are frequently employed to measure k values for oh and so 4 induced reactions when the radical concentration is at ss alnajjar and franz 1992 einschlag et al 2003 miller et al 1996 neta and dorfman 1968 yang et al 2017 zhou and mopper 1990 this is due to the fact that exact knowledge of the formation mechanisms for oh or so 4 from their precursors e g h2o2 or persulfate by the application of energy in the form of heat light or radiation is well established baxendale and wilson 1957 xiao et al 2018 the method used to study the kinetics of oh and so 4 induced reactions is based on continuous uv photolysis of radical precursors in the presence of target and reference compounds xiao et al 2020b thus direct photolysis of target and reference compounds should be separated from the radical induced degradations 4 1 1 oh a k value with target compound can be deduced from radical ss that is determined by monitoring degradation of a probe compound the k value of the probe compound reacting with oh should be measured by different laboratories and be consistent the probe compound is expected to be stable in the surrounding solution matrix and the quantification of the probe compound should be straightforward to conduct by conventional analytical methods most importantly the reaction product of the probe compound should not interact with oh or at least kinetic measurements should be conducted only for the early stages of the reactions common oh probe compounds are p chlorobenzoic acid pcba coumarin terephalate and 1 chlorobutane in addition the k value with target compound can be derived from the simultaneous decay of both the reference and target compounds based on known k value of a reference compound the k value can be derived by monitoring the ratio of degradation rate between reference and target compounds the principles for choosing an appropriate reference compound are similar to that of probe compound i e the reliability of the k value and the stability in the working solutions common reference compounds include pcba tba methanol and formaldehyde however validity of some of these common reference compounds should always be tested under specific systems 4 1 1 1 monitoring probe compound worksheet oh probe monitoring the decay of a probe compound reflects the oh ss concentration in the system brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 measured k values for oh scavenging capacity of aquatic humic matter ahm from five surface water sources the effects of source and concentration of ahm on oh ss were investigated by irradiating different surface waters containing no 3 a photoreactive anion at a concentration of 1 43 mm assuming ahm is the only oh scavenger and no 3 the only source of oh oh can be maintained at ss by balancing formation and consumption under constant light intensity for the formation of oh no 3 was first photochemically decomposed 55 no 3 hv no 2 o then o radical anion subsequently abstracts a proton from water forming oh 56 o h 2 o ho ho thus the formation rate of oh can be described by 57 d oh d t form k no 3 no 3 where k no 3 is the observed first order rate constant of oh formation from no 3 6 6 10 7 s 1 for the consumption of oh scavenging by ahm 58 d oh d t consump k oh ahm oh ss ahm where k oh ahm is the k value for the reaction of ahm with

yield straight lines with slopes proportional to k oh ahm in order to obtain oh ss the probe compound 1 chlorobutane cb and oh scavenger tba can be employed specifically the solution only with 1 07 mm no 3 and 7 7 μm tba was irradiated to maintain a steady state oh after the addition of the probe compound cb which reacts rapidly with oh k oh cb 3 109 m 1 s 1 zepp et al 1987 the degradation kinetics of the probe can be expressed as 61 d probe d t k oh probe oh ss probe integrating to 62 ln probe t probe 0 k t 63 k k oh probe oh ss where k is the measured pseudo first order rate constant of the probe compound s 1 probe 0 is the initial concentration of the probe thus oh ss can be measured indirectly from the rate of disappearance of the probe compound in their study a plot of ln probe t probe 0 vs time yielded a straight line with a slope equal to the k value and oh ss was then determined by dividing by k oh probe by varying ahm from 2 to 24 mgc l 1 a plot of 1 oh ss vs ahm 0 yielded a straight line with the slopes ranging from 1 1 1013 to 2 3 1013 m mgc l 1 the slope values were obtained by fitting estimated raw data from their original figures based on eqn 63 k oh ahm values from five surface waters were determined ranging from 1 0 104 to 2 9 104 mgc l 1 s 1 fig 12 4 1 1 2 monitoring reference compound worksheet oh reference and target a k value for a bimolecular reaction between a radical and a target compound can simultaneously monitor the decay of both the reference and target compounds xiao et al 2020c measured k value of a target compound carbamazepine cbz reacting with oh using pcba as a reference compound at ph 3 in their system h2o2 was used as a precursor to oh continuous uv irradiation with constant intensity generates oh that can react with cbz and pcba 64 cbz oh product 65 p cba oh product thus the degradation rate of cbz can be described by 66 d cbz d t k oh cbz oh ss cbz where k oh cbz is the k value for oh reacting with cbz under the ss condition pseudo first order kinetics was obeyed integrating to 67 ln cbz t cbz 0 k oh cbz oh ss t similarly for the reaction of p cba and oh the degradation kinetics can be described 68 ln p cba t p cba 0 k oh p cba oh ss t combining eqn 67 and 68 allows the determination of k oh cbz 69 k oh cbz k oh p cba ln cbz t cbz 0 ln p cba t p cba 0 it should be noted that uv photolysis of cbz and p cba also need to be taken into account thus eqn 69 should be modified 70 k oh cbz k oh p cba ln cbz t cbz 0 uv h 2 o 2 ln cbz t cbz 0 uv ln p cba t p cba 0 uv h 2 o 2 ln p cba t p cba 0 uv thus a plot of ln c t c0 for cbz and pcba under direct uv photolysis and uv h2o2 conditions vs reaction time yielded straight lines denoting the measured pseudo first order rate constant of cbz and pcba with oh with slopes of 4 83 10 3 8 18 10 2 min 1 and known k oh p cba value 5 109 m 1 s 1 k oh cbz value was determined to be 4 36 109 m 1 s 1 fig 13 4 1 2 so 4 worksheet so 4 reference and target the k value for a so 4 induced reaction of target compound can be determined through simultaneously monitoring the decay of the reference and target compounds the process is similar to that of oh and has been discussed in great detail in 4 1 1 2 here we illustrated an example chen et al 2018 determined the k value of acetamiprid ace reacting with so 4 at ph 7 using meta toluic acid mta as a reference in a uv ps system the generation of so 4 in the uv ps system has also been described in 3 2 4 2 and the reaction mechanism for establishing so 4 ss under continuous uv irradiation is well understood dogliotti and hayon 1967 noted that although so 4 can react with h2o oh to generate oh in uv ps system this transformation reaction could be neglected in acidic to neutral solutions zhang et al 2016 after addition of the target compound ace and the reference compound mta the consumption of so 4 was attributed to 71 ace so 4 product 72 m ta so 4 product the degradation kinetics of ace and mta obeyed pseudo first order as described in 4 1 1 2 for oh the so 4 induced degradation of ace and mta can be expressed 73 k so 4 ace k so 4 m ta ln ace t ace 0 uv ps ln ace t ace 0 uv ln m ta t m ta 0 uv ps ln m ta t m ta 0 uv where k so 4 ace is k value for so 4 reacting with ace and k so 4 m ta is k value for so 4 reacting with mta thus after subtracting the direct photolysis in the uv system a plot of ln ace t ace 0 versus ln m ta t m ta 0 under in uv ps system yielded a straight line whose slope was the ratio of k so 4 ace k so 4 m ta considering a reported value for k so 4 m ta i e 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1977 the k so 4 ace value was determined to be 3 68 108 m 1 s 1 fig 14 4 2 indirect k measurements in a non steady state system there are many studies measuring k values using the competition kinetics based on reaction product analysis in a non ss system asmus 1984 getoff and schwörer 1970 nishikimi 1975 redpath and willson 1975 storkey et al 2014 sueishi et al 2014 willson 1971 we included reaction induced by four radicals oh so 4 o 2 and cl 4 2 1 oh worksheet oh product of reference since direct observation of oh is not feasible by the relatively weak absorption and possible overlapping absorption from target compounds an indirect competition method by monitoring the absorbance of transient product formed from a reference compound was developed to determine reaction k values in oh induced processes getoff and schwörer 1970 kwon et al 2009 sueishi et al 2014 willson 1971 willson et al 1971 dell arciprete et al 2009 measured the reactivity of oh with thiacloprid thia by flash photolysis with a competition technique using thiocyanate scn as the reference in a h2o2 solution scn reacts rapidly with oh forming scnoh radical 74 oh scn scnoh the k value for eqn 74 was reported to be 1 13 1010 m 1 s 1 herrmann et al 2010 then scnoh further decomposes and reacts with excess scn to form scn 2 radical anions with maximum absorbance λmax at 480 nm 75 scnoh oh scn 76 scn scn scn 2 since the decay of scn 2 is much slower than its formation eqn 76 thus the measured absorbance at 480 nm is almost equal to the maximal scn 2 when thia is present it competes with scn for oh with a rate constant k oh thia thus reducing the yield of the scn 2 77 oh thia non absorbing products at 480 nm based on the change of the absorbance at 480 nm k oh thia can be derived 78 a 0 a 1 k oh thia thia k oh scn sc n where a 0 is the absorbance at 480 nm in the absence of thia and a is the absorbance at 480 nm in the presence of thia at different concentrations as illustrated in fig 15 the data obtained for the competition of oh for thia and scn at different concentrations was plotted according to eqn 78 i e a 0 a against thia scn the slope of the straight line in fig 15 which represents the k oh thia k oh scn ratio allowed the determination of the k oh thia value taking k oh scn of 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 k oh thia was determined to be 7 5 1 1010 m 1 s 1 4 2 2 so 4 worksheet so 4 product of reference similarly a k value for a so 4 induced reaction can be determined by monitoring the time dependent absorption for the transient product of a reference compound redpath and willson 1975 investigated the k value for reaction of so 4 with oh by the competition technique using tyrosine tyr as a reference compound a pulse radiolysis study was undertaken in air saturated solutions containing 0 01 m ps 10 3 m tyr and 0 1 m tba as an oh radical scavenger the formation of so 4 by pulse radiolysis is described by 79 ps e aq so 4 so 4 2 then so 4 reacts with oh forming oh 80 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 the high concentrations of tba can quench oh in the system 81 oh tba product in addition in the presence of tyr a strong absorption at 410 nm was observed upon pulse radiolysis of solutions which was attributed to the transient product of tyr 82 so 4 tyr transient product the magnitude of the absorbance decreased with increasing ph fig 16 a which was accounted for by the reactions 80 and 82 competing for so 4 thus the k value of so 4 reacting with oh can be deduced 83 a 0 a 1 k so 4 oh o h k so 4 tyr tyr where k so 4 oh is the unknown k of so 4 reacting with oh and k so 4 tyr is the reported k value of so 4 reacting with tyr 3 2 109 m 1 s 1 redpath and willson 1975 a 0 is the absorbance at 410 nm obtained when reaction 80 was minimal e g at ph 7 and a is the absorbance at 410 nm in the presence of various oh ph 11 a kinetic plot of a 0 a vs oh tyr is shown in fig 16b the slope of the line after multiplying k so 4 tyr is the k so 4 oh value 8 3 107 m 1 s 1 4 2 3 o 2 worksheet o 2 product of target the k value for o 2 reacting with a target compound can be determined on the basis of the reaction product that is easily detectable and relatively stable kutala et al 2008 nishikimi 1975 sakurai et al 2014 villamena and zweier 2002 villamena and zweier 2002 investigated the scavenging capacity of the spin trap 5 diethoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide depmpo by o 2 using superoxide dismutase sod as a reference compound the product for the reaction of depmpo and o 2 has spin resonance structure while sod and o 2 do not thus the reaction between depmpo and o 2 can be monitored by esr technique villamena and zweier 2002 they generated o 2 in a light riboflavin buffered system at ph 7 the working solutions were bubbled with dioxygen gas prior to the addition of riboflavin uv irradiation of the oxygenated riboflavin solution reduce o2 to o 2 which then reacts with reference compound sod and target compound depmpo 84 o 2 depmpo esr active product 85 o 2 sod esr silent product during the uv irradiation phase the initial formation rate for o 2 induced product of depmpo was unchanged for the first 60 s then the kinetic data were plotted 86 v v 1 k o 2 sod sod k o 2 depmpo depmpo where v and ν are the initial formation rates for product of depmpo in the absence and presence of sod respectively k o 2 sod and k o 2 depmpo are the k values of the o 2 reacting with sod and depmpo respectively the v ν ratios were plotted as a function of sod 0 and the linear plot is shown in fig 17 confirming the validity of eqn 86 with the known k o 2 sod 1 108 m 1 s 1 the k o 2 depmpo value derived from the slope i e 3 33 107 m 1 was 58 m 1 s 1 4 2 4 cl worksheet cl product of reference the direct determination of the rate constants cl is limited by the overlapping absorbance of cl and the cl transient products alegre et al 2000 given this limitation the k values are commonly determined using an indirect method using competition kinetics and monitoring the product of the reference compound which exhibits a characteristic observable signal lei et al 2019 for example lei et al 2019 determined the k value for the reaction of cl with amoxicillin amx using scn as a reference the formation of cl using chloroacetone as precursor has been described in 3 2 4 1 and the major cl consuming reactions are as follows 87 cl h 2 o product 88 cl ch 3 coch 2 cl product 89 cl amx product 90 cl 2 scn cl scn 2 the peak absorbance of scn 2 a at 472 nm over a range of concentrations of amx at fixed scn was monitored and the ratio of peak absorbance without scn to that of with was fitted based on eqn 91 91 a 0 a 1 k c l amx amx g k c l sc n sc n 92 g k c l h 2 o h 2 o k cl ch 3 coch 2 cl ch 3 coch 2 clo where a 0 and a are the absorbance at 472 nm in the absence and presence of scn at different concentrations respectively k c l amx is the unknown k value of cl reacting with amx and k c l scn is k value of cl reacting with scn which has been reported to be 5 3 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 the g value is fixed to be 3 6 105 s 1 at chloroacetone 0 0 01 m in their system hence based on the plot of a 0 a vs amx g k c l scn scn the k cl amx value was determined to be 1 27 1010 m 1 s 1 fig 18 5 comparison of direct and indirect methods although direct monitoring of starting reactants and or transient products is generally a simple and accurate technique to determine reaction rates constants the application of direct detection for radical reaction rate constants is often limited among the limiting factors for monitoring radical species are the light absorption of the reactive radical species being weak low extinction coefficient occurring at short wavelengths 250 nm and the radical species typically being short lived thus requiring highly specialized detectors e g transient absorbance esr etc in addition the extensive overlap of the absorbance spectra of the radical species with the aromatic and unsaturated functionality common in a wide variety of organic target compounds is a daunting complication given these limitations indirect methods of determining reaction rate constants has been extensively studied and is commonly employed for accurate measurement of radical reaction rates the indirect methods however require assumptions related to ss concentrations and or consistent radical generation in different working solutions and thus require extreme care to minimize the errors inherent in their application the k values measured by the indirect methods can suffer from bias intrinsically by the accuracy of the k value for a reference compound used yu 2004 the reliability of the k value by the indirect method strongly depends on the accurate knowledge of overall reaction mechanisms therefore caution must be exercised in the application of indirect methods in fact the k values obtained by indirect method often require verification by a direct method before being accepted as a reliable technique adams et al 1965 used indirect methods to determine the k values for oh reacting with ethanol and methanol employing three different reference compounds co 3 2 scn and seo 3 2 which exhibit characteristic absorption maxima at 600 500 and 435 nm respectively the reference compound and target alcohol competed for oh in the system as illustrated below 93 oh reference product 94 oh ch 3 oh ch 2 oh h 2 o 95 oh ch 3 ch 2 oh ch 3 choh h 2 o the ratio a 0 a for the product of a reference at feature wavelength in the absence and presence of varying alcohol was fitted based on eqn 96 96 a 0 a 1 k oh alcohol alcohol k oh reference reference where k oh alcohol and k oh reference are the k values of the oh reacting with the target alcohol and reference compound respectively the mixtures of alcohol and reference were subject to radiolysis under conditions to generate oh the transient absorbance of the radical products was recorded by the photomultiplier detector based on eqn 96 the ratios of a 0 a at various alcohol were plotted against the ratios of the alcohol reference fig 19 from the known k oh reference values and slopes of the plot of a 0 a vs alcohol reference the unknown k oh methanol and k oh ethanol values were determined using eqn 96 there was a good agreement between k oh methanol and k oh ethanol values obtained by using indirect determination via competition kinetics with a reference compound confirming the validity of the indirect method however the accuracy of indirect methods can vary significantly with respect to the radical species involved and the experimental conditions for example the indirect method was employed for the k values between oh and br with co 3 2 as a reference compound adams et al 1965 the competition reactions for oh in the system were 97 oh 2 br oh br 2 98 oh co 3 2 oh co 3 the absorbance of co 3 at 600 nm was measured as a function of br and the data fit to eqn 96 based on a literature value of k oh co 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 the k oh b r value was determined to be 1 8 108 m 1 s 1 for comparison the k oh b r value was measured by directly monitoring the formation of br 2 which has characteristic absorbance at 360 nm and assumed to be proportional to br the k oh b r value by direct method 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 was faster by an order of magnitude than that determined by the indirect method the discrepancy is due to the incomplete transformation of br to br 2 in fact br reacts with co 3 2 thus consuming br in the system resulting in underestimation of k oh b r 99 br co 3 2 br co 3 it should be noted that the presence of organic constituents in waters also impact the fate of the radicals leading to inaccuracy of any k measurement however unlike oh so 4 there is a series lack of rate constant data for certain radicals cl and o 2 and organic constituents thus we did not emphasize effect of organic constituents of waters complexities and limitations inherent in the direct determination of the reaction rate constants for radical species have led to extensive application of indirect methodologies while the indirect methods can be convenient and effective extreme care and in depth understanding of the undergoing reaction mechanisms are required to ensure the accuracy of the results 6 conclusion and outlook free radicals play an essential role in understanding attenuation of contaminants in natural and engineered processes thus an accurate k value in a radical driven reaction is a critical parameter which needs to be determined in any fundamental kinetic study due to their intrinsic unstable nature they generally tend to exhibit high reactivity the lack of a systematic review of the methodological approaches for the determination of rate constants for radical reactions illustrates an urgent need to highlight this topic to the scientific community herein is a summary of the direct and indirect experimental methods for measuring k values of radicals reacting with target compounds under radical steady state and non steady state conditions the radicals involving oh so 4 o 2 and cl were chosen as the representatives based on their essential chemical and environmental relevance we provided the ms excel spreadsheets for determining k values for the radicals aiming to allow one to reproduce the data and to analyze the unprocessed raw data as a template the advantages and disadvantages for direct and indirect methods were also discussed in order to ensure the best practices in determining the aqueous phase rate constants of radical species and maintain the organizational knowledge we developed a standard operation procedure for the k value determination fig 20 it allows one to follow the step by step instruction to select and decide the k measurement methodology aiming to achieve efficiency and high quality performance while reducing miscommunication among different research areas as it is shown in fig 20 there is no versatile method fitting for all radicals the characteristics of radicals and availability of generation methods that can maintain radical in ss should be taken into consideration in the choice of method for k value measurements although this review covers the primary methods for measuring k for radical reactions under the ss and non ss conditions further investigations are critical to advancing the fundamental understanding of these radical reactions specifically the field of kinetic measurement for radical reactions would benefit from further studies in the following areas 1 given the millions of anthropogenic and natural organic compounds present in different aqueous based systems it is impossible to experimentally determine all the k values for their reactions with radical species therefore predictive models such as structure activity relationships and empirical correlations e g hammett constant must be developed for modelling k values for high throughput screening hammett 1940 monod et al 2005 however there are always limitations and application domains for any reactivity model for example while the reactivity of many monofunctional aliphatic compounds can be estimated reasonably well by the hammett s correlation it appears that estimations on the reactivity of poly functional compounds still contain large uncertainties jaffe 1953 the accuracies of different models depend on the specific reactions and there is not a universal best model to predict radical reactivities evolution of computational models through comparisons with experimental data and more powerful computations with higher degrees of robustness and predictivity can be anticipated again the assessment of any predictive model requires conformational experimental kinetic investigations for the radical reactions 2 there is still an urgent need for investigations on the methods for generating radicals in aqueous solution especially for o 2 and cl for example existing methods for the generation of significant quantities of o 2 in aqueous or other protic media are challenged by coexisting radicals hayyan et al 2016 for the mcdowell method this photochemical method not only produces o 2 but also involves highly light absorbing carbon centered radicals in the system mcdowell et al 1983 in addition chloroacetone a commonly used precursor for cl polymerizes slowly under light irradiation leading to explosion hazard therefore identifying a more sustainable and safer alternative needs to be continuously explored 3 extensive efforts should be exerted in developing or identifying conditions for maintaining ss radical concentrations especially for o 2 and cl in a ss system no special instruments e g high resolution uv vis spectroscopies or esr are required to directly monitor superfast decay of target radical which will be enormously advantageous the k values can then be determined by monitoring the degradation kinetics of target compounds over a relatively long period of duration the condition for generation of oh ss and so 4 ss are well documented and have been employed to determine an extensive number of k values on the contrary generation of o 2 ss and cl ss have not been reported which significantly handicaps the determination of their rate constants and inhibits development of data base of the kinetic parameters required for broad fundamental understanding of the corresponding reactions 4 although scavengers have been frequently used to minimize the effect of non targeted radicals that are present in the systems this is particularly true for radiolysis of water scavengers can have unintended and undesirable effects on the reaction kinetics and pathways determination of k values using scavengers often does not require robust understanding of reaction mechanisms or the first elementary chain reaction steps thus it will be extremely desirable to explore measurement techniques that allow simultaneously monitoring several radicals reacting with a target compound rather than introducing scavengers the potential of such methodology is underexplored and developing such an attractive technique depends on the advances in analytical chemistry however it is reasonable to expect that the difficulties in developing such efficient approaches include the overlapping signals of radical species and again

17240,interests in the kinetics of radical induced reactions in aqueous solution have grown remarkably due to their water engineering significance e g advanced oxidation processes although compilations of the rate constants k for various radicals have been documented surprisingly a systematic review has yet to be reported on the development of reliable methods for determining k values a knowledge gap exists to critically evaluate and screen the various methods to measure them in this review we summarize the direct and indirect methods under steady state and non steady state conditions followed by critical evaluations on their advantages and disadvantages the radicals of oh so 4 o 2 and cl were chosen based on their significant aquatic environmental relevance ms excel spreadsheets that demonstrate the determination processes were provided allowing one to reproduce the data and or to analyze the unprocessed raw data as a template we formulated a standard operation procedure for the k determination although there is simply no versatile method fitting for all radical reactions finally existing challenges and future research focus are discussed this is the first

defined as species capable of independent existence that contains one or more unpaired electrons halliwell and gutteridge 2015 are important species in biological systems especially related to aging and diseases environmental and biological fate and sustainable environmental friendly remediation of pollutants and water purification basaga 1990 manahan 2017 for example hydroxyl radicals oh hydroperoxyl radicals ho 2 and superoxide radicals o 2 as reactive species in natural sunlit surface waters can promote the transformation of an extensive number of organic contaminants guerard et al 2009 therefore the thermodynamic and kinetics parameters of the reactions of these free radicals have been actively investigated for decades brezonik 1994 stumm and morgan 2012 it is well known that the timescale of radical driven reactions vary by orders of magnitude from slow reactions e g disproportionation reaction of superoxide radical o 2 in a strong alkaline solution in minutes to extremely fast reactions e g reduction reaction of an oxidized compound by hydrated electrons in nanoseconds bielski 1978 poskrebyshev et al 2003a from a phenomenological point of view the bimolecular reaction between free radicals and a target molecule typically follows second order kinetics whereas its reaction rate constant k becomes the most important parameter describing its kinetics under a specific condition i e ph ionic strength and temperature the reaction rate constant reflects the intrinsic nature of bimolecular reactions between radicals and target compounds and these k values can be further used in many occasions as an important input haag and yao 1992 von sonntag 2006 wine et al 1989 for example oxygen derived species such as the o 2 and oh play an important role in tissue damage due to their oxidative degradation of proteins and unsaturated lipids in order to screen out effective antioxidative compounds as radical scavengers one relies on the k value and finds out that a compound with high k value can be used as a good scavenger da silva et al 1991 evaluated the oh scavenger ability of various procyanidins obtained from grape seeds the k values for the reactions varied from 1 20 109 to 3 59 109 m 1 s 1 and they concluded that procyanidins can be effective compounds in trapping oh in living organisms likewise there is a critical need to compile k values of radical species with pollutants for predicting chemical fate exploring viable water treatment technologies and developing environmental regulations jiang 2007 liu et al 2020 squadrito et al 2001 in fact a holistic environmental decision making process relies heavily on contaminant environmental fate models which involves complex systems on the global scale cronin et al 2003 suciu et al 2012 while modelling capabilities have blossomed in complexity and scale new models will necessarily require huge arrays of input data that are not easily measured such as k values for example herrmann et al 1999 presented an updated chemical aqueous phase radical mechanism capram with a box model for three modelling scenarios namely urban rural and marine conditions this box model included extended reaction schemes with production and destruction reactions for radicals such as oh nitrate radical no 3 sulfate radical anion so 4 carbonate radical anion co 3 dibromine radical anion br 2 and dichloride radical anion cl 2 to account for the role of halide ions in marine systems the halide activation reactions were considered in their updated model with the inclusion of the halogen reactions nearly 1 67 10 11 m chlorine radical cl and 1 67 10 6 m bromine radical br were predicted to be generated the cl and br were 10 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of without respectively both cl and br can play extreme roles as reactive species as evident in their pivotal role in atmospheric ozone depletion molina and molina 1992 simpson et al 2007 the example highlights the importance of accurate k values and halogen activation reactions which have a pronounced influence on the accuracy of the reaction models the methods for the determination of aqueous phase rate constants have progressed rapidly and these advancements have been complemented by the development of new analytical techniques to improve the detectability and accuracy zweier and his colleagues employed electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy and spin trap to qualify and quantify radical induced reactions kuppusamy et al 1994 samouilov et al 2004 villamena et al 2003 the esr technique detects paramagnetic species such as the unpaired electron s of free radicals since the half life of these free radicals was often too short to be detected directly using esr compounds known as spin traps were used to trap the radical through covalent bond formation leading to stable adducts or complexes that are readily analyzed by esr harbour et al 1974 rosen and finkelstein 1985 in the presence of excess target compound the pseudo first order rate constant k can be derived from esr signal change for the spin trap thus making quantification of the kinetic processes possible however spin trapping in tandem with esr techniques has significant limitations as the adducts are often still short lived i e thermostability and possess poor selectivity in the presence of other radicals janzen et al 1980 zhang et al 2009 the technique also requires the syntheses of cyclic nitrone spin traps and their uncertain biological impacts janzen et al 1980 villamena et al 2007 these stability and selectivity limitations were overcome by rapid time resolved uv visible spectroscopic techniques huggenberger and fischer 1981 newcomb et al 1992 for example poskrebyshev et al 2003a investigated the reaction of monochloramine with hydrated electron e aq by pulse radiolysis in aqueous solution the k value of the reaction was determined to be 2 2 0 3 1010 m 1 s 1 by recording the decay of e aq absorption at 600 nm using time resolved uv vis spectroscopy this technique can be used to detect and monitor transient radicals in situ thus becoming a powerful and relatively easy to use tool for determination of k values even at or near the diffusion controlled limit yet the direct detection and determination of rate constants for these radical species is limited by their short wavelengths of the light absorbance complicating detection and weak extinction coefficients ε limiting sensitivity in addition to experimental measurements the k values for radical molecule reactions can also be predicted employing collision theory and electronic structure theory within the framework of the kohn sham density functional theory dft bickelhaupt and baerends 2000 galano and alvarez idaboy 2014 phillips 1990 selection of density functional approximations solvation models and various transition state theories can be daunting challenges and the limitations remain to directly calculate the aqueous phase reaction k within the experimentally obtained errors and are beyond the scope of this review adamo and jacquemin 2013 kohn et al 1996 while there have been many reviews that summarized the k values of radical species and while various techniques have been employed to study the kinetics of radical induced reactions a careful and critical scrutinization of pros and cons for each technique is perquisite and central to understand these reactions herein we have complied all the known information regarding different k measurement techniques and appended ms excel spreadsheets for every example we illustrated i e mmc1 and mmc2 the spreadsheets allow one to reproduce the data and to analyze the unprocessed raw data as a template the direct and indirect methods for determining rate constants under steady state ss and non ss conditions have been carefully described and exemplified in this review noted the raw data appended in spreadsheets were estimated from their original figures therefore the k values reported herein may slightly deviate from the reported values in the literature to identify the knowledge gap in the development of measuring method critical discussions of the advantages and disadvantages are provided in addition we developed a standard operation procedure for the k value determination to ensure the best practices and maintain the organizational knowledge we finally completed the review with concluding remarks and recommendations for future investigations we aim to provide a holistic and fundamental basis to choose an appropriate mainstream method for measuring the k values for radicals and target compounds of interest the radicals under consideration in this review are oh so 4 o 2 and cl due to their high chemical and environmental relevance asada 1994 thomas and aust 1986 hydroxyl radical for example can react with various organic and inorganic contaminants even pathogenic microorganisms i e disinfection and the efforts exerted on its reactivity are of scientific and regulation importance in wastewater treatment processes and decontamination of pollutants in natural waters gligorovski et al 2015 wei et al 2019 xiao et al 2020a in addition so 4 has been implicated as an important intermediate in cloud water playing a crucial role in acid rain chemistry as well as in advanced oxidation processes for water treatment huie and neta 1984 superoxide radical can be generated in sunlit natural waters together with dissolved organic matter and it can maintain the redox cycles of dissolved trace metals such as fe2 and cu2 halliwell and gutteridge 1984 in addition a specific marine bacterium roseobacter sp azwk 3b can produce o 2 which is involved in the oxidation of soluble mn2 into insoluble manganese oxide deposits in the ocean berner et al 2007 chloride radical is generated during uv free chlorine process an emerging water technology for disinfection bu et al 2018 minakata et al 2017 similar to so 4 cl exhibits high reactivity typically diffusion controlled and plays a significant role as a strong oxidant for organic sulfur substances in marine atmospheric aerosols and droplet mediated reactions in cloud waters zhu et al 2005 the main physicochemical properties of the radical species under study are tabulated in table 1 2 hierarchy and classifications the review consists of several sections in section 1 the importance of rate constants for the radical induced reactions and the methodology for their determination measurements are presented in section 2 the hierarchy of the review and classifications of the methodologies are discussed sections 3 and 4 summarize the direct and indirect methods for determining rate constants under steady state ss and non ss conditions critical discussions of the advantages and disadvantages are discussed in section 5 finally concluding remarks and recommendations for future investigations are provided in section 6 the aqueous phase rate constants for bimolecular reactions between radicals and target compounds can be determined via direct and indirect methods fig 1 direct detection and observation of the radical target compound or transient product during the course of reaction can be used to determine k neta et al 1988 yu 2004 in contrast indirect methods employ a molecular trap or competition reaction which can extend the lifetime or detectability of the initial reaction product or whose absolute rate constant with target radical is already known buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 this approach is based on the competition reactions between the radical under study target and reference compounds meanwhile direct and indirect methods can be applied under ss and non ss radical conditions the descriptions of these important terms i e direct and indirect methods ss and non ss are compared in table 2 3 direct methods workbook mmc1 xlsx based on fig 1 the k value for radical and target compound can be measured when the radical is generated at a ss concentration where its formation rate is equal to consumption rate or non ss for a ss system the k value can be derived from degradation kinetics of the target compound present at a large concentration excess characterized by k when ss concentration of the radical radical ss is known 1 d target compound dt k target compound where k is equal to k radical ss by varying radical ss different k values can be determined then by plotting k vs radical ss the k value is determined as the slope in reality radical ss varies by the initial concentration of a target compound however the time dependent target compound decay is not always feasible due to the undetectable absorbance of the target compound thus directly measuring k values for the radical induced reactions in ss systems are not commonly used nevertheless one can still find a solution for example oh is initiated by uv photolysis of h2o2 with a constant primary quantum yield ϕ in a uv h2o2 system thus a relationship between oh ss and h2o2 can be obtained because of the availability of wavelength that detects the h2o2 and ho 2 this example will be elaborated in section 3 1 1 in contrast directly measuring k values in non ss systems are quite commonly employed baxendale et al 1968 westerhoff et al 2007 zona et al 2010 for a non ss system typical experimental conditions are expected to exhibit two features 1 only one primary radical i e transient radical is present in the system and 2 the concentration of the non radical species is high enough typically a 10 fold excess to ensure that pseudo first order kinetics is obeyed marquez et al 1996 powers 1978 2 d radical dt k radical where k is equal to k target compound therefore by varying the concentration of the target compound instead of radical ss and incorporating in eqn 2 the k value between the radical and target compound can be obtained by plotting k vs target compound 0 specifically k can be derived by directly monitoring the decay of the primary radical by its spectroscopic signals in the case that the spectroscopic property of the radical is unsuitable for monitoring the growth of the primary transient product could also be monitored it should be noted that varying the concentration of the target compound eliminates error due to reactions of the primary radicals with themselves or with impurities in the solvent buxton et al 1988 3 1 direct k measurements in a steady state system the direct method for k measurement of the radical induced reactions in ss systems is not commonly seen due to the difficulty in quantifying radical ss however there is an exception for oh as oh ss can be alternatively deduced from its precursor concentration i e h2o2 and actinometry briefly with h2o2 as actinometer ϕ 1 mol photon 1 and ε 19 m 1 cm 1 beltran et al 1995 the irradiation intensity and the effective path of irradiation in a reactor can be determined it should be noted that the premise for using the direct method with oh ss deducing from h2o2 is that the target compound should be recalcitrant to uv photolysis 3 1 1 oh worksheet oh radical target compound the direct measurement for the k values at ss can be performed by monitoring the target compound mazellier and leverd 2003 investigated the degradation kinetics of 4 tert octylphenol op at ph 6 in a uv h2o2 system that generated oh in ss at the given ph the h2o2 is the dominant species given that pk a of h2o2 is 11 6 smith and martell 1976 the working solution contained op op 0 1 μm and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 0 0 06 0 20 m and it was irradiated at the wavelength of 253 7 nm for 3 min as a control no degradation was observed when 1 μm op was mixed with a high h2o2 concentration in the absence of uv light and the direct uv photolysis of op in the absence of h2o2 has also been determined to be negligible in their system the concentration of oh was assumed to be at the ss condition as the continuous uv irradiation and sufficient availability of h2o2 during the entire reaction time here we derive the equations in the referred study to present the process of the k measurement step by step for the formation of oh generated by uv photolysis of h2o2 3 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh the formation rate of oh was equal to the consumption or decay rate of the oh precursor i e h2o2 here 4 d oh d t form ϕ oh pri i 0 a h 2 o 2 a tot 1 e 2 3 a tot where ϕ oh pri is the primary quantum yield of oh formation equal to 1 nicole 1990 ι 0 is the photon fluence rate in the range of 4 9 6 1 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 a h 2 o 2 expressed by ε h 2 o 2 h2o2 l is the absorbance of h2o2 in the working solution ε is the molar extinction coefficient and l is the optical path length of the reactor a tot is the absorbance of the solution at 253 7 nm and it arises from two sources absorbance due to h2o2 and other absorbing species as including op thus a tot can be expressed by l ε h 2 o 2 h2o2 σε as as by working with high h2o2 concentrations 0 03 0 2 m the absorbance of the solution at 253 7 nm can be normalized to the absorbance of h2o2 in the solution thus a h 2 o 2 is equal to a tot and e 2 3 a tot approximates to 0 then eqn 4 can be simplified to 5 d oh d t form ϕ oh pri i 0 for the consumption of oh in the system oh can react with h2o2 k oh h 2 o 2 op k oh op and other scavengers s that are present in the solution k oh s then the rate of consumption of oh can be described as 6 d oh d t consump k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh k oh op op oh k oh s s oh at ph 6 the contribution from deprotonated h2o2 as perhydroxyl anion ho 2 is negligible due to its pk a of 11 7 smith and martell 1976 by definition at ss the formation and consumption of oh are equal thus eqns 5 and 6 are equal and can be rearranged to 7 oh ss ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh op op k oh s s the term k oh s s was estimated to be 2000 300 s 1 mazellier and leverd 2003 when the h2o2 concentration is in excess for example h2o2 op 6 104 oh mainly reacts with h2o2 thus the terms k oh h 2 o 2 h2o2 k oh op op k oh s s can be condensed to k oh h 2 o 2 h2o2 8 oh ss ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 upon irradiation oh initiated by uv photolysis of h2o2 led to rapid disappearance of op under the experimental conditions the uv light was essentially completely absorbed by the high concentration of h2o2 with the direct photolysis of op negligible therefore the oh mediated op disappearance rate can be described by 9 d op d t k oh op op oh ss k oh op ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 op the concentration of h2o2 remained relatively constant h2o2 t h2o2 0 0 98 thus eqn 9 can be integrated to 10 ln op 0 ln op t k oh op ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 1 h 2 o 2 0 t bt where b is equal to k oh op ϕ oh pri i 0 k oh h 2 o 2 1 h 2 o 2 0 the slopes i e b of the plots of ln op t op 0 against reaction time are illustrated in fig 2 together with k oh h 2 o 2 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 christensen et al 1982 the plot of the b as a function of the reciprocal of h2o2 0 is presented in fig 2 inset yielding a k oh op of 6 0 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 it should be noted the ss assumption should be considered only in the early stages of the reactions as the presence of intermediate products can interfere with the kinetics through scavenging of oh 3 2 direct k measurements in a non steady state system directly measuring k in a non ss system of an individual radical is commonly employed we include four radicals oh so 4 o 2 and cl reacting with target compounds as these radicals are of great interest in the field of aquatic and atmospheric chemistry and physiological biochemistry 3 2 1 oh in a non ss system the k value for a bimolecular reaction between oh and a target compound can be measured by directly observing 1 the decay of oh and 2 the formation of transient product directly observing the decay of oh is not typically seen since oh only has a nondescript absorption with a weak feature around 230 nm in aqueous solution nielsen et al 1976 in addition when the target compound investigated has distinctive absorption in this region which is especially true for aromatic compounds directly monitoring the decay of oh around 230 nm is not feasible due to the issues such as overlapping absorption with background water and other species herrmann 2003 however when the target compound is aliphatic such as alcohols with negligible absorption around 230 nm k can be obtained by the mathematically manipulated absorbance as a function of reaction time alam et al 2003 ershov et al 2008 milosavljevic and laverne 2005 consequently directly determined k values in the non ss solution are often achieved by the product build up kinetics p b k technique indeed p b k technique is considered to be a promising alternative when the transient product exhibits an observable absorption i e transient spectra however the selection of experimental conditions should be considered with caution to ensure that the transient product does not react further with oh if this is not possible appropriate corrections should be made to compensate for the extra consumption of oh buxton et al 1988 3 2 1 1 p b k technique worksheet oh transient product directly measuring k values at non ss is often achieved by the p b k technique for example song et al 2009 measured the k value of n n diethyl m toluamide deet with oh in aqueous solution at non ss by pulse radiolysis three different reactive species oh e aq and hydrogen atoms h were produced by radiolysis of aqueous solution 11 h 2 o γ radiolysis e aq oh h h 2 h 2 o 2 the solution was saturated with nitrous oxide n2o before irradiation to eliminate dissolved oxygen and to convert the e aq and h to oh as shown below 12 e aq n 2 o h oh n 2 13 h n 2 o oh n 2 these diffusion controlled reactions between n2o and e aq h ensure that within a few microseconds oh is the predominant species for the reaction of oh and deet the formation rate of the transient product is equal to the consumption of oh 14 d product d t form d oh d t consump k oh deet oh deet where k oh deet is the rate constant for oh reacting deet when deet is in excess compared to oh pseudo first order kinetics can be achieved 15 product t oh 0 oh t oh 0 oh 0 e k oh deet deet t the concentration of the transient product of the reaction between deet and oh hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical is proportional to the absorbance a at 330 and 270 nm thus a plot of a against t can yield the k values at different deet 0 after fitting the plot of k vs deet 0 to a linear line fig 3 k oh deet was determined to be 4 95 0 18 109 m 1 s 1 based on eqn 16 16 k k oh deet deet it should be noted that the fitted line in fig 3 does not go through the zero in fact non zero intercept is commonly seen in plots of k vs concentrations in any k determination processes this is attributed to several factors including 1 impurities in the working solutions that react with target radicals von sonntag and schuchmann 1994 2 coexisting radicals even with zero concentration of the target chemicals there are other radicals that coexist and may slow down the reactions buxton et al 1988 3 low limit of detection for the radical that is monitored mocak et al 1997 peltier et al 2007 4 backward reaction when the chemical concentration is zero k indicates the rate constant for the reverse reaction because we can assume no forward reaction 5 radical termination with the zero concentration of chemical termination of radicals that coexist can occur which shows lower limit values of reactivities liu et al 2016 3 2 2 so 4 worksheet so 4 radical since so 4 has a strong broad optical absorption feature around 450 nm table 1 it allows for direct measurement of its decay for the k determination grgic et al 2007 neta et al 1977 redpath and willson 1975 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 zhou et al 2017 measured the k value of diatrizoate dtz reacting with so 4 using laser flash photolysis persulfate ps is used as a common precursor for generating so 4 by various activation mechanisms through uv heat and catalysts monteagudo et al 2015 in their study so 4 was generated by activation of ps under simulated solar irradiation 17 ps hv 2 so 4 for the reaction of so 4 and dtz the consumption rate of so 4 in the system can be described as 18 d so 4 d t k so 4 dtz so 4 dtz where k so 4 dtz is the rate constant of dtz with so 4 the initial so 4 was much lower than that of the dtz 0 thus pseudo first order kinetics was followed 19 so 4 so 4 0 e k t where k is the transient product of k so 4 dtz multiplying dtz the decay of so 4 monitored at 450 nm vs reaction time was fitted and the k value of dtz with so 4 was estimated to be 1 9 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 fig 4 it should be noted that the k value of a target compound reacting with so 4 can also be measured by the p b k technique bansal and fessenden 1978 eibenberger et al 1978 o neill et al 1975 steenken et al 1977 however we do not exemplify p b k technique as the reported studies do not give specific raw data allowing us to reproduce the analyses 3 2 3 o 2 o 2 superoxide radical exhibits a distinct absorption spectrum around 245 nm in aqueous and ethanolic solutions bielski 1978 thus its concentration can be directly monitored and rate constants can be determined by o 2 decay bielski et al 1985 bielski and richter 1977 similar to oh this method is limited in practice due to spectral overlap with any target compounds absorbing around this uv region kwon and lee 2004 this is particularly true in geobiochemistry since in natural waters the occurrence of o 2 produced by solar irradiation of colored dissolved organic matter and metabolic processes in phytoplankton is extremely low typically on the nanomolar level blough and zepp 1995 direct monitoring of o 2 245 nm is therefore not practical for not meeting the interferences and sensitivity requirements kwon and lee 2004 alternatively the k value of a target compound reacting with o 2 can also be measured by the observation of time dependent absorption of transient product by optical means i e p b k technique 3 2 3 1 direct monitoring o 2 decay worksheet o 2 radical for high concentration of o 2 the k values for o 2 driven processes can be determined by monitoring o 2 decay as it has a considerable molar extinction coefficient ε of 2 350 m 1 cm 1 at 245 nm bielski et al 1985 peretz et al 1982 investigated the disproportionation of the o 2 in the presence of fe iii tmpyp a fe iii and porphyrin complex by observing the decay rate of o 2 at 254 nm first oxygenated solutions containing 2 mm phosphate buffer and 5 mm hcoo scavenger of oh were γ irradiated at ph 8 under these experimental conditions they ensured that the primary radical after the pulsed radiation was o 2 as the pk a of ho 2 is 4 8 20 h 2 o γ radiolysis e aq oh h h 2 h 2 o 2 21 e aq o 2 o 2 22 oh hcoo h 2 o co 2 23 co 2 o 2 o 2 co 2 24 h o 2 ho 2 25 ho 2 o 2 h in the absence of the target compound the decay of o 2 due to disproportionation reaction follows second order kinetics 26 o 2 o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 o 2 2 oh 27 d o 2 d t 2 k d o 2 2 where k d is the uncatalyzed disproportionation rate constant in the presence of a target compound fe iii tmpyp the consumption of o 2 arises from two sources namely disproportionation of o 2 and reaction with fe iii tmpyp 28 d o 2 d t 2 k d o 2 2 k o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe iii tmpyp o 2 where k o 2 fe iii tmpyp is the k value of catalytic disproportionation reaction of o 2 by fe iii tmpyp it should be noted that the concentration of fe iii tmpyp was determined to be constant due to its formation consumption balance 29 o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe ii tmpyp o 2 30 o 2 fe ii tmpyp o 2 2 h fe iii tmpyp o 2 h 2 o 2 the authors claimed that without fe iii tmpyp the disproportionation of o 2 could be ignored thus eqn 28 could be simplified to 31 d o 2 d t k o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe iii tmpyp o 2 assuming constant concentration of fe iii tmpyp pseudo first order kinetics were modeled and k was expressed by 32 k k o 2 fe iii tmpyp fe iii tmpyp ultimately the k can be obtained by fitting various o 2 decays in the presence of different concentrations of fe iii tmpyp one example is in the inset in fig 5 as illustrated in fig 5 a linear dependence of k on the various concentrations of fe iii tmpyp yielded the slope which was equal to k o 2 fe iii tmpyp 3 0 108 m 1 s 1 3 2 3 2 p b k technique worksheet o 2 transient product the p b k technique can be an alternative method to measuring the k value for o 2 reacting with a target compound when the spectrum of the target compound overlaps that of o 2 greenstock and ruddock 1976 employed p b k technique to measure the k value for the reaction of o 2 with p benzoquinone bq pulse radiolysis of oxygen saturated solutions with oh scavenger tertiary butyl alcohol tba provides a method for generating o 2 the generation of o 2 has been described in 3 2 3 1 except the oh scavenging reaction 33 oh tba tba h 2 o when the target compound bq was added into the system the rate of formation of the transient product b q whose feature absorption is at 410 nm was described by 34 d bq d t form k o 2 bq o 2 bq where k o 2 bq is the rate constant for o 2 reacting with bq when bq was in excess compared to o 2 pseudo first order kinetics were obeyed 35 bq t o 2 0 o 2 t o 2 0 o 2 0 e k o 2 bq bq t thus time dependent absorption of bq was monitored at 410 nm at different bq 0 36 k k o 2 bq bq 0 then k o 2 bq was obtained by fitting the plot of k vs bq 0 see fig 6 and it was determined to be 9 108 m 1 s 1 3 2 4 cl there are three common techniques for measuring the k values for the reactions of cl and target compounds first although cl is extremely transient it can be monitored by its optical absorption at 320 nm with the ε of around 4 000 m 1 cm 1 klaning and wolff 1985 treinin and hayon 1975 thus the k value for a cl initiated reaction can be obtained second in the presence of cl the k value can also be obtained by its equilibrium constant with cl 2 k 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 37 cl cl cl 2 cl 2 dichloride radical exhibits broad absorption with maximum at 340 nm ε 340 nm 8 800 m 1 cm 1 and it is a strong oxidant with redox potential 2 1 v vs nhe see table 1 yu et al 2004 by monitoring the decay of cl 2 the k value for the reaction of cl and a target compound can be derived it should be noted that the kinetics measured by the equilibrium constant k method is typically investigated in solutions containing cl and ps under irradiation condition so 4 quickly oxidizes cl to cl and reacts with extra cl forming an equilibrium with cl 2 which then can be detected by uv spectroscopy third for a transient product exhibiting observable absorption outside of the absorption range of cl the k value can be determined by monitoring the formation of the transient product i e p b k 3 2 4 1 direct monitoring cl decay worksheet cl radical the k value for a cl initiated reaction can be directly obtained by monitoring its optical absorption at 320 nm buxton et al 2000 measured the k value for the reaction of cl with tba by laser flash photolysis of chloroacetone in aqueous solution at 25 c in their study cl was generated by laser photolysis of ar saturated solution containing 2 10 2 m chloroacetone at 248 nm 38 ch 3 coch 2 cl hv 1 ch 3 coch 2 cl 39 1 ch 3 coch 2 cl ch 2 coch 3 cl where 1 ch3coch2cl is the excited singlet state of chloroacetone the time dependent absorption profile at cl characteristic absorption at 320 nm was monitored and the absorption was fitted to a first order decay until reaching a plateau it should be noted that ch2coch3 absorbance is negligible at 320 nm while cl is not with ε of 4 500 m 1 cm 1 thus the absorbance at 320 nm can be attributed primarily to cl as fig 7 illustrates the rate of cl decay increases by the addition of tba yielding k values between cl and tba ultimately the k values vs tba 0 yielded the k value to be 3 108 m 1 s 1 fig 8 in addition they also obtained the k values at different temperatures e g 5 15 and 35 c to determine the arrhenius kinetic parameters in fig 8 3 2 4 2 direct monitoring cl 2 decay worksheet cl 2 radical by monitoring the decay of cl 2 the k value for the reaction of cl and a target compound can also be derived from equilibrium constant k between cl 2 and cl alegre et al 2000 investigated k values of cl and cl 2 oxidation of benzene bz by conventional flash photolysis with 5 10 3 m ps in 0 1 m nacl solutions flash photolysis of ps at low ph leads to the generation of so 4 40 ps hv so 4 then in the presence of high concentrations of cl ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 m so 4 can be readily depleted and forms cl 41 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl except for the equilibrium reaction between cl and cl 2 they claimed that there were competing reactions potentially depleting cl 2 cl in the system 42 cl 2 h 2 o hoclh cl 43 cl h 2 o hoclh 44 cl 2 bz cl organic radicals 45 cl bz organic radicals then the apparent first order decay of cl 2 k can be described 46 k k cl 2 h 2 o k c l h 2 o k c l k c l bz k c l k cl 2 bz bz since cl used in their experiments is high eqn 43 does not contribute to the first order decay component of cl 2 due to k c l h 2 o k cl k cl 2 h 2 o thus eqn 46 could be simplified 47 k k cl 2 h 2 o k c l bz k c l k cl 2 bz bz for a given cl 0 faster decay rates of cl 2 were observed for increasing bz 0 noted that the k value is 1 4 105 m 1 thus they concluded that the ratio cl 2 cl 10 was expected when cl 0 was greater than 1 10 4 m consequently they neglected the contribution of cl to the observed absorbance at 340 nm the absorption a which is due to cl 2 then can be fitted according to eqn 48 48 a f e k t h where k is constant at a certain bz 0 h is also constant and may be due to a longer lived species formed after cl 2 depletion and f is a pre exponential factor and cannot be explicitly determined with a fixed cl 0 the k values in the presence of bz can be fitted then by varying cl 0 the k values of cl 2 were determined fig 9 the slopes of the lines shown in fig 9 were then plotted against cl 1 yielding fig 10 the slope of the line in fig 10 multiplying k yielded the k c l bz of 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 3 2 4 3 p b k technique worksheet cl transient product the k values for cl induced reactions can also be determined by monitoring the formation of the transient product when it exhibits observable absorption lei et al 2019 determined the k value for cl reacting with bisphenol a bpa using laser flash photolysis of chloroacetone by applying p b k technique the formation mechanism of cl has been discussed in 3 2 4 1 the transient product generated from the reaction of cl with bpa exhibited a unique absorption peak at 420 nm thus the product formation kinetics can be expressed 49 d product d t form k c l bpa c l bpa where k cl bpa is the k for cl reacting with bpa the kinetic experiments were conducted in pseudo first order condition thus 50 cl t cl 0 e k t 51 product t cl 0 cl t cl 0 cl 0 e k t 52 k k c l bpa bpa where product t is the concentration of the product formed at time t cl 0 is the initial concentration of cl fitting the time dependent absorption of the transient product k value can be obtained at a given bpa 0 a plot of k vs bpa 0 yielded a linear line with the slope equal to k c l bpa i e 1 82 1010 m 1 s 1 fig 11 4 indirect methods workbook mmc2 xlsx the indirect method of k value determination can be applied under both ss and non ss conditions based on fig 1 determining the k values for bimolecular reactions of radical species at its ss concentration by the indirect method is commonly used however the most important premise for using indirect methods in ss system is that an exact knowledge of the mechanism of the radical reactions relative rate constants of the two competing reactions i e radicals with both target and reference compounds can be determined by monitoring reactant and reference degradation kinetics based on the known k value of the reference compound the k value for the target compound can be derived in addition k value for the target compound can also be deduced from radical ss which can be determined by monitoring the degradation of a probe compound with a known k value see 4 1 1 1 it should be noted that there is a difference between reference and probe compounds a reference compound is used to compete for the radical in the system in which target compound is present the ratio of degradation rates between reference and target compounds is directly proportional to a ratio of their k values de heredia et al 2001 53 k radical target compound k radical reference d target compound target compound d reference reference ln target compound t target compound 0 ln reference t reference 0 thus based on known k values of the reference compound the k value of a target compound can be derived as the ratio by monitoring the total degradation rate in contrast a probe compound is used to quantify the radical ss in a system where the target compound is absent then based on the known radical ss the k value for the target compound can be derived by directly monitoring its degradation rate 54 d target compound d t k radical ss target compound for a non ss system in the presence of the target compound the competition of reference and target compounds for the radical generates different observable endpoints e g absorbance as compared to the case in the absence of the target compound specifically the yield ratios of the transient product of the reference compound is determined as a function of the ratio of concentrations of the reference compound to the target compound from a plot of the yield ratios vs the concentration ratios and the known k with the reference compound the unknown k of the target compound can be derived generally the application of indirect method in non ss system requires three criteria buxton et al 1988 first it can only be applied when the light absorbance of the transient product of a target compound does not overlap with that of a reference compound second the product of a reference compound should be unreactive and stable third the formation of the product from the reaction between a reference compound and radicals in general should be an elementary step however there may be exceptions to this rule for example scn a widely used reference compound can react with oh and or cl forming scn 2 via intermediate radicals scnoh and scn although this is a multistep reaction previous studies suggested that the possible intermediate radicals e g scnoh and scn do not impact the absorbance measurement of scn 2 as the lifetime of the scnoh complex is extremely short 5 ns and scn radicals quickly transform into scn 2 with a large excess of scn herrmann et al 2010 4 1 indirect k measurements in a steady state system indirect methods are frequently employed to measure k values for oh and so 4 induced reactions when the radical concentration is at ss alnajjar and franz 1992 einschlag et al 2003 miller et al 1996 neta and dorfman 1968 yang et al 2017 zhou and mopper 1990 this is due to the fact that exact knowledge of the formation mechanisms for oh or so 4 from their precursors e g h2o2 or persulfate by the application of energy in the form of heat light or radiation is well established baxendale and wilson 1957 xiao et al 2018 the method used to study the kinetics of oh and so 4 induced reactions is based on continuous uv photolysis of radical precursors in the presence of target and reference compounds xiao et al 2020b thus direct photolysis of target and reference compounds should be separated from the radical induced degradations 4 1 1 oh a k value with target compound can be deduced from radical ss that is determined by monitoring degradation of a probe compound the k value of the probe compound reacting with oh should be measured by different laboratories and be consistent the probe compound is expected to be stable in the surrounding solution matrix and the quantification of the probe compound should be straightforward to conduct by conventional analytical methods most importantly the reaction product of the probe compound should not interact with oh or at least kinetic measurements should be conducted only for the early stages of the reactions common oh probe compounds are p chlorobenzoic acid pcba coumarin terephalate and 1 chlorobutane in addition the k value with target compound can be derived from the simultaneous decay of both the reference and target compounds based on known k value of a reference compound the k value can be derived by monitoring the ratio of degradation rate between reference and target compounds the principles for choosing an appropriate reference compound are similar to that of probe compound i e the reliability of the k value and the stability in the working solutions common reference compounds include pcba tba methanol and formaldehyde however validity of some of these common reference compounds should always be tested under specific systems 4 1 1 1 monitoring probe compound worksheet oh probe monitoring the decay of a probe compound reflects the oh ss concentration in the system brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 measured k values for oh scavenging capacity of aquatic humic matter ahm from five surface water sources the effects of source and concentration of ahm on oh ss were investigated by irradiating different surface waters containing no 3 a photoreactive anion at a concentration of 1 43 mm assuming ahm is the only oh scavenger and no 3 the only source of oh oh can be maintained at ss by balancing formation and consumption under constant light intensity for the formation of oh no 3 was first photochemically decomposed 55 no 3 hv no 2 o then o radical anion subsequently abstracts a proton from water forming oh 56 o h 2 o ho ho thus the formation rate of oh can be described by 57 d oh d t form k no 3 no 3 where k no 3 is the observed first order rate constant of oh formation from no 3 6 6 10 7 s 1 for the consumption of oh scavenging by ahm 58 d oh d t consump k oh ahm oh ss ahm where k oh ahm is the k value for the reaction of ahm with

yield straight lines with slopes proportional to k oh ahm in order to obtain oh ss the probe compound 1 chlorobutane cb and oh scavenger tba can be employed specifically the solution only with 1 07 mm no 3 and 7 7 μm tba was irradiated to maintain a steady state oh after the addition of the probe compound cb which reacts rapidly with oh k oh cb 3 109 m 1 s 1 zepp et al 1987 the degradation kinetics of the probe can be expressed as 61 d probe d t k oh probe oh ss probe integrating to 62 ln probe t probe 0 k t 63 k k oh probe oh ss where k is the measured pseudo first order rate constant of the probe compound s 1 probe 0 is the initial concentration of the probe thus oh ss can be measured indirectly from the rate of disappearance of the probe compound in their study a plot of ln probe t probe 0 vs time yielded a straight line with a slope equal to the k value and oh ss was then determined by dividing by k oh probe by varying ahm from 2 to 24 mgc l 1 a plot of 1 oh ss vs ahm 0 yielded a straight line with the slopes ranging from 1 1 1013 to 2 3 1013 m mgc l 1 the slope values were obtained by fitting estimated raw data from their original figures based on eqn 63 k oh ahm values from five surface waters were determined ranging from 1 0 104 to 2 9 104 mgc l 1 s 1 fig 12 4 1 1 2 monitoring reference compound worksheet oh reference and target a k value for a bimolecular reaction between a radical and a target compound can simultaneously monitor the decay of both the reference and target compounds xiao et al 2020c measured k value of a target compound carbamazepine cbz reacting with oh using pcba as a reference compound at ph 3 in their system h2o2 was used as a precursor to oh continuous uv irradiation with constant intensity generates oh that can react with cbz and pcba 64 cbz oh product 65 p cba oh product thus the degradation rate of cbz can be described by 66 d cbz d t k oh cbz oh ss cbz where k oh cbz is the k value for oh reacting with cbz under the ss condition pseudo first order kinetics was obeyed integrating to 67 ln cbz t cbz 0 k oh cbz oh ss t similarly for the reaction of p cba and oh the degradation kinetics can be described 68 ln p cba t p cba 0 k oh p cba oh ss t combining eqn 67 and 68 allows the determination of k oh cbz 69 k oh cbz k oh p cba ln cbz t cbz 0 ln p cba t p cba 0 it should be noted that uv photolysis of cbz and p cba also need to be taken into account thus eqn 69 should be modified 70 k oh cbz k oh p cba ln cbz t cbz 0 uv h 2 o 2 ln cbz t cbz 0 uv ln p cba t p cba 0 uv h 2 o 2 ln p cba t p cba 0 uv thus a plot of ln c t c0 for cbz and pcba under direct uv photolysis and uv h2o2 conditions vs reaction time yielded straight lines denoting the measured pseudo first order rate constant of cbz and pcba with oh with slopes of 4 83 10 3 8 18 10 2 min 1 and known k oh p cba value 5 109 m 1 s 1 k oh cbz value was determined to be 4 36 109 m 1 s 1 fig 13 4 1 2 so 4 worksheet so 4 reference and target the k value for a so 4 induced reaction of target compound can be determined through simultaneously monitoring the decay of the reference and target compounds the process is similar to that of oh and has been discussed in great detail in 4 1 1 2 here we illustrated an example chen et al 2018 determined the k value of acetamiprid ace reacting with so 4 at ph 7 using meta toluic acid mta as a reference in a uv ps system the generation of so 4 in the uv ps system has also been described in 3 2 4 2 and the reaction mechanism for establishing so 4 ss under continuous uv irradiation is well understood dogliotti and hayon 1967 noted that although so 4 can react with h2o oh to generate oh in uv ps system this transformation reaction could be neglected in acidic to neutral solutions zhang et al 2016 after addition of the target compound ace and the reference compound mta the consumption of so 4 was attributed to 71 ace so 4 product 72 m ta so 4 product the degradation kinetics of ace and mta obeyed pseudo first order as described in 4 1 1 2 for oh the so 4 induced degradation of ace and mta can be expressed 73 k so 4 ace k so 4 m ta ln ace t ace 0 uv ps ln ace t ace 0 uv ln m ta t m ta 0 uv ps ln m ta t m ta 0 uv where k so 4 ace is k value for so 4 reacting with ace and k so 4 m ta is k value for so 4 reacting with mta thus after subtracting the direct photolysis in the uv system a plot of ln ace t ace 0 versus ln m ta t m ta 0 under in uv ps system yielded a straight line whose slope was the ratio of k so 4 ace k so 4 m ta considering a reported value for k so 4 m ta i e 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1977 the k so 4 ace value was determined to be 3 68 108 m 1 s 1 fig 14 4 2 indirect k measurements in a non steady state system there are many studies measuring k values using the competition kinetics based on reaction product analysis in a non ss system asmus 1984 getoff and schwörer 1970 nishikimi 1975 redpath and willson 1975 storkey et al 2014 sueishi et al 2014 willson 1971 we included reaction induced by four radicals oh so 4 o 2 and cl 4 2 1 oh worksheet oh product of reference since direct observation of oh is not feasible by the relatively weak absorption and possible overlapping absorption from target compounds an indirect competition method by monitoring the absorbance of transient product formed from a reference compound was developed to determine reaction k values in oh induced processes getoff and schwörer 1970 kwon et al 2009 sueishi et al 2014 willson 1971 willson et al 1971 dell arciprete et al 2009 measured the reactivity of oh with thiacloprid thia by flash photolysis with a competition technique using thiocyanate scn as the reference in a h2o2 solution scn reacts rapidly with oh forming scnoh radical 74 oh scn scnoh the k value for eqn 74 was reported to be 1 13 1010 m 1 s 1 herrmann et al 2010 then scnoh further decomposes and reacts with excess scn to form scn 2 radical anions with maximum absorbance λmax at 480 nm 75 scnoh oh scn 76 scn scn scn 2 since the decay of scn 2 is much slower than its formation eqn 76 thus the measured absorbance at 480 nm is almost equal to the maximal scn 2 when thia is present it competes with scn for oh with a rate constant k oh thia thus reducing the yield of the scn 2 77 oh thia non absorbing products at 480 nm based on the change of the absorbance at 480 nm k oh thia can be derived 78 a 0 a 1 k oh thia thia k oh scn sc n where a 0 is the absorbance at 480 nm in the absence of thia and a is the absorbance at 480 nm in the presence of thia at different concentrations as illustrated in fig 15 the data obtained for the competition of oh for thia and scn at different concentrations was plotted according to eqn 78 i e a 0 a against thia scn the slope of the straight line in fig 15 which represents the k oh thia k oh scn ratio allowed the determination of the k oh thia value taking k oh scn of 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 k oh thia was determined to be 7 5 1 1010 m 1 s 1 4 2 2 so 4 worksheet so 4 product of reference similarly a k value for a so 4 induced reaction can be determined by monitoring the time dependent absorption for the transient product of a reference compound redpath and willson 1975 investigated the k value for reaction of so 4 with oh by the competition technique using tyrosine tyr as a reference compound a pulse radiolysis study was undertaken in air saturated solutions containing 0 01 m ps 10 3 m tyr and 0 1 m tba as an oh radical scavenger the formation of so 4 by pulse radiolysis is described by 79 ps e aq so 4 so 4 2 then so 4 reacts with oh forming oh 80 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 the high concentrations of tba can quench oh in the system 81 oh tba product in addition in the presence of tyr a strong absorption at 410 nm was observed upon pulse radiolysis of solutions which was attributed to the transient product of tyr 82 so 4 tyr transient product the magnitude of the absorbance decreased with increasing ph fig 16 a which was accounted for by the reactions 80 and 82 competing for so 4 thus the k value of so 4 reacting with oh can be deduced 83 a 0 a 1 k so 4 oh o h k so 4 tyr tyr where k so 4 oh is the unknown k of so 4 reacting with oh and k so 4 tyr is the reported k value of so 4 reacting with tyr 3 2 109 m 1 s 1 redpath and willson 1975 a 0 is the absorbance at 410 nm obtained when reaction 80 was minimal e g at ph 7 and a is the absorbance at 410 nm in the presence of various oh ph 11 a kinetic plot of a 0 a vs oh tyr is shown in fig 16b the slope of the line after multiplying k so 4 tyr is the k so 4 oh value 8 3 107 m 1 s 1 4 2 3 o 2 worksheet o 2 product of target the k value for o 2 reacting with a target compound can be determined on the basis of the reaction product that is easily detectable and relatively stable kutala et al 2008 nishikimi 1975 sakurai et al 2014 villamena and zweier 2002 villamena and zweier 2002 investigated the scavenging capacity of the spin trap 5 diethoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide depmpo by o 2 using superoxide dismutase sod as a reference compound the product for the reaction of depmpo and o 2 has spin resonance structure while sod and o 2 do not thus the reaction between depmpo and o 2 can be monitored by esr technique villamena and zweier 2002 they generated o 2 in a light riboflavin buffered system at ph 7 the working solutions were bubbled with dioxygen gas prior to the addition of riboflavin uv irradiation of the oxygenated riboflavin solution reduce o2 to o 2 which then reacts with reference compound sod and target compound depmpo 84 o 2 depmpo esr active product 85 o 2 sod esr silent product during the uv irradiation phase the initial formation rate for o 2 induced product of depmpo was unchanged for the first 60 s then the kinetic data were plotted 86 v v 1 k o 2 sod sod k o 2 depmpo depmpo where v and ν are the initial formation rates for product of depmpo in the absence and presence of sod respectively k o 2 sod and k o 2 depmpo are the k values of the o 2 reacting with sod and depmpo respectively the v ν ratios were plotted as a function of sod 0 and the linear plot is shown in fig 17 confirming the validity of eqn 86 with the known k o 2 sod 1 108 m 1 s 1 the k o 2 depmpo value derived from the slope i e 3 33 107 m 1 was 58 m 1 s 1 4 2 4 cl worksheet cl product of reference the direct determination of the rate constants cl is limited by the overlapping absorbance of cl and the cl transient products alegre et al 2000 given this limitation the k values are commonly determined using an indirect method using competition kinetics and monitoring the product of the reference compound which exhibits a characteristic observable signal lei et al 2019 for example lei et al 2019 determined the k value for the reaction of cl with amoxicillin amx using scn as a reference the formation of cl using chloroacetone as precursor has been described in 3 2 4 1 and the major cl consuming reactions are as follows 87 cl h 2 o product 88 cl ch 3 coch 2 cl product 89 cl amx product 90 cl 2 scn cl scn 2 the peak absorbance of scn 2 a at 472 nm over a range of concentrations of amx at fixed scn was monitored and the ratio of peak absorbance without scn to that of with was fitted based on eqn 91 91 a 0 a 1 k c l amx amx g k c l sc n sc n 92 g k c l h 2 o h 2 o k cl ch 3 coch 2 cl ch 3 coch 2 clo where a 0 and a are the absorbance at 472 nm in the absence and presence of scn at different concentrations respectively k c l amx is the unknown k value of cl reacting with amx and k c l scn is k value of cl reacting with scn which has been reported to be 5 3 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 the g value is fixed to be 3 6 105 s 1 at chloroacetone 0 0 01 m in their system hence based on the plot of a 0 a vs amx g k c l scn scn the k cl amx value was determined to be 1 27 1010 m 1 s 1 fig 18 5 comparison of direct and indirect methods although direct monitoring of starting reactants and or transient products is generally a simple and accurate technique to determine reaction rates constants the application of direct detection for radical reaction rate constants is often limited among the limiting factors for monitoring radical species are the light absorption of the reactive radical species being weak low extinction coefficient occurring at short wavelengths 250 nm and the radical species typically being short lived thus requiring highly specialized detectors e g transient absorbance esr etc in addition the extensive overlap of the absorbance spectra of the radical species with the aromatic and unsaturated functionality common in a wide variety of organic target compounds is a daunting complication given these limitations indirect methods of determining reaction rate constants has been extensively studied and is commonly employed for accurate measurement of radical reaction rates the indirect methods however require assumptions related to ss concentrations and or consistent radical generation in different working solutions and thus require extreme care to minimize the errors inherent in their application the k values measured by the indirect methods can suffer from bias intrinsically by the accuracy of the k value for a reference compound used yu 2004 the reliability of the k value by the indirect method strongly depends on the accurate knowledge of overall reaction mechanisms therefore caution must be exercised in the application of indirect methods in fact the k values obtained by indirect method often require verification by a direct method before being accepted as a reliable technique adams et al 1965 used indirect methods to determine the k values for oh reacting with ethanol and methanol employing three different reference compounds co 3 2 scn and seo 3 2 which exhibit characteristic absorption maxima at 600 500 and 435 nm respectively the reference compound and target alcohol competed for oh in the system as illustrated below 93 oh reference product 94 oh ch 3 oh ch 2 oh h 2 o 95 oh ch 3 ch 2 oh ch 3 choh h 2 o the ratio a 0 a for the product of a reference at feature wavelength in the absence and presence of varying alcohol was fitted based on eqn 96 96 a 0 a 1 k oh alcohol alcohol k oh reference reference where k oh alcohol and k oh reference are the k values of the oh reacting with the target alcohol and reference compound respectively the mixtures of alcohol and reference were subject to radiolysis under conditions to generate oh the transient absorbance of the radical products was recorded by the photomultiplier detector based on eqn 96 the ratios of a 0 a at various alcohol were plotted against the ratios of the alcohol reference fig 19 from the known k oh reference values and slopes of the plot of a 0 a vs alcohol reference the unknown k oh methanol and k oh ethanol values were determined using eqn 96 there was a good agreement between k oh methanol and k oh ethanol values obtained by using indirect determination via competition kinetics with a reference compound confirming the validity of the indirect method however the accuracy of indirect methods can vary significantly with respect to the radical species involved and the experimental conditions for example the indirect method was employed for the k values between oh and br with co 3 2 as a reference compound adams et al 1965 the competition reactions for oh in the system were 97 oh 2 br oh br 2 98 oh co 3 2 oh co 3 the absorbance of co 3 at 600 nm was measured as a function of br and the data fit to eqn 96 based on a literature value of k oh co 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 the k oh b r value was determined to be 1 8 108 m 1 s 1 for comparison the k oh b r value was measured by directly monitoring the formation of br 2 which has characteristic absorbance at 360 nm and assumed to be proportional to br the k oh b r value by direct method 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 was faster by an order of magnitude than that determined by the indirect method the discrepancy is due to the incomplete transformation of br to br 2 in fact br reacts with co 3 2 thus consuming br in the system resulting in underestimation of k oh b r 99 br co 3 2 br co 3 it should be noted that the presence of organic constituents in waters also impact the fate of the radicals leading to inaccuracy of any k measurement however unlike oh so 4 there is a series lack of rate constant data for certain radicals cl and o 2 and organic constituents thus we did not emphasize effect of organic constituents of waters complexities and limitations inherent in the direct determination of the reaction rate constants for radical species have led to extensive application of indirect methodologies while the indirect methods can be convenient and effective extreme care and in depth understanding of the undergoing reaction mechanisms are required to ensure the accuracy of the results 6 conclusion and outlook free radicals play an essential role in understanding attenuation of contaminants in natural and engineered processes thus an accurate k value in a radical driven reaction is a critical parameter which needs to be determined in any fundamental kinetic study due to their intrinsic unstable nature they generally tend to exhibit high reactivity the lack of a systematic review of the methodological approaches for the determination of rate constants for radical reactions illustrates an urgent need to highlight this topic to the scientific community herein is a summary of the direct and indirect experimental methods for measuring k values of radicals reacting with target compounds under radical steady state and non steady state conditions the radicals involving oh so 4 o 2 and cl were chosen as the representatives based on their essential chemical and environmental relevance we provided the ms excel spreadsheets for determining k values for the radicals aiming to allow one to reproduce the data and to analyze the unprocessed raw data as a template the advantages and disadvantages for direct and indirect methods were also discussed in order to ensure the best practices in determining the aqueous phase rate constants of radical species and maintain the organizational knowledge we developed a standard operation procedure for the k value determination fig 20 it allows one to follow the step by step instruction to select and decide the k measurement methodology aiming to achieve efficiency and high quality performance while reducing miscommunication among different research areas as it is shown in fig 20 there is no versatile method fitting for all radicals the characteristics of radicals and availability of generation methods that can maintain radical in ss should be taken into consideration in the choice of method for k value measurements although this review covers the primary methods for measuring k for radical reactions under the ss and non ss conditions further investigations are critical to advancing the fundamental understanding of these radical reactions specifically the field of kinetic measurement for radical reactions would benefit from further studies in the following areas 1 given the millions of anthropogenic and natural organic compounds present in different aqueous based systems it is impossible to experimentally determine all the k values for their reactions with radical species therefore predictive models such as structure activity relationships and empirical correlations e g hammett constant must be developed for modelling k values for high throughput screening hammett 1940 monod et al 2005 however there are always limitations and application domains for any reactivity model for example while the reactivity of many monofunctional aliphatic compounds can be estimated reasonably well by the hammett s correlation it appears that estimations on the reactivity of poly functional compounds still contain large uncertainties jaffe 1953 the accuracies of different models depend on the specific reactions and there is not a universal best model to predict radical reactivities evolution of computational models through comparisons with experimental data and more powerful computations with higher degrees of robustness and predictivity can be anticipated again the assessment of any predictive model requires conformational experimental kinetic investigations for the radical reactions 2 there is still an urgent need for investigations on the methods for generating radicals in aqueous solution especially for o 2 and cl for example existing methods for the generation of significant quantities of o 2 in aqueous or other protic media are challenged by coexisting radicals hayyan et al 2016 for the mcdowell method this photochemical method not only produces o 2 but also involves highly light absorbing carbon centered radicals in the system mcdowell et al 1983 in addition chloroacetone a commonly used precursor for cl polymerizes slowly under light irradiation leading to explosion hazard therefore identifying a more sustainable and safer alternative needs to be continuously explored 3 extensive efforts should be exerted in developing or identifying conditions for maintaining ss radical concentrations especially for o 2 and cl in a ss system no special instruments e g high resolution uv vis spectroscopies or esr are required to directly monitor superfast decay of target radical which will be enormously advantageous the k values can then be determined by monitoring the degradation kinetics of target compounds over a relatively long period of duration the condition for generation of oh ss and so 4 ss are well documented and have been employed to determine an extensive number of k values on the contrary generation of o 2 ss and cl ss have not been reported which significantly handicaps the determination of their rate constants and inhibits development of data base of the kinetic parameters required for broad fundamental understanding of the corresponding reactions 4 although scavengers have been frequently used to minimize the effect of non targeted radicals that are present in the systems this is particularly true for radiolysis of water scavengers can have unintended and undesirable effects on the reaction kinetics and pathways determination of k values using scavengers often does not require robust understanding of reaction mechanisms or the first elementary chain reaction steps thus it will be extremely desirable to explore measurement techniques that allow simultaneously monitoring several radicals reacting with a target compound rather than introducing scavengers the potential of such methodology is underexplored and developing such an attractive technique depends on the advances in analytical chemistry however it is reasonable to expect that the difficulties in developing such efficient approaches include the overlapping signals of radical species and again

17241,natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in environment and plays a fundamental role in the geochemical cycling of elements it is involved in a wide range of environmental processes and can significantly affect the environmental fates of exogenous contaminants understanding the properties and environmental behaviors of nom is critical to advance water treatment technologies and environmental remediation strategies nom is composed of characteristic light absorbing emitting functional groups which are the identification card of nom and susceptive to ambient physiochemical changes these groups and their variations can be captured through optical sensing therefore spectroscopic techniques are elegant tools to track the sources features and environmental behaviors of nom in this work the most recent advances in molecular spectroscopic techniques including uv vis fluorescence infrared and raman spectroscopy for the characterization measurement and monitoring of nom are reviewed and the state of the art innovations are highlighted furthermore the limitations of current spectroscopic approaches for the exploration of nom related environmental processesand how these weaknesses drawbacks can be addressed are explored finally suggestions and directions are proposed to advance the development of spectroscopic methods in analyzing and elucidating the properties and

introduction natural organic matter nom is the active organic species derived from decaying plants and animals after a series of biological and physiochemical reaction pan et al 2016 nom is widely present in environment and plays avital role in elemental geochemical cycling nom is served as the nutrient and energy sources for microbial webs in aquatic ecosystems and refers to the largest carbon pool on earth bianchi 2011 owing to the complex and heterogeneous structure of nom that contains various types of functional groups it has been regarded as a reactant chelator and or sorbent that can interact with anthropogenic contaminants such as heavy metals organic pollutants and nanoparticles thus altering their speciation distribution migration transformation and ultimate environmental fate nebbioso and piccolo 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 moreover specific components in nom are precursors of harmful disinfection by product dbp in freshwater systems beggs and summers 2011 zeng and arnold 2014 in addition nom is a major contributor that cause membrane fouling during membrane filtration processes chen et al 2018 le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 wang et al 2017 therefore understanding the properties and environmental behaviors of nom is of critical importance numerous techniques have been developed and applied for the characterization of nom such as size exclusion chromatography sec mass spectrometry ms nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and molecular spectroscopy molecular spectroscopy resulting from the absorption emission of electromagnetic radiation when the quantizedenergy state of molecules undergo changes is among the most popular tools to track the chemical structures of nom and their variations in environmental processes nom is composed of characteristic components that absorb emit a wide range of light which are susceptive to ambient biological and physiochemical changes these components and their variations can be easily captured through optical sensing for instance a wealth of information about the aromaticity molecular weight mw distribution origin and reactivity of nom can be reflected through uv vis spectroscopy on the other hand fluorescence spectroscopy can provide quantification of nom content and abundant chemical information about the functional groups in nom can be probed by infrared spectroscopy nowadays molecular spectroscopic techniques continue to evolve rapidly resulting in a high popularity for their broadened applications to new areas involving nom during the past two decades the number of publications on nom study using molecular spectroscopy has been expanding steadily since there is a significantly increasing trend in the utilization of molecular spectroscopic techniques for the characterization and monitoring of nom with different focuses it is therefore necessary to summarize and appraise the advances and development of molecular spectroscopic techniques in nom studies there are some reviews about the applications and recent advances of analytical approaches for nom studies in which molecular spectroscopic techniques are included derrien et al 2019 minor et al 2014 pan et al 2016 however these reviews simply introduced the advantages and application area of these spectroscopies while their limitations as well as future perspectives are missing utilization of uv vis spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy for nom studies have also been respectively summarized in some recent reviews carstea et al 2019 li et al 2020 li and hur 2017 mesquita et al 2017 but there is no objective comparison between each technique there remains a gap between the practical and theoretical applications of molecular spectroscopic techniques in different environmental areas as a result a comprehensive evaluation of the applications of molecular spectroscopic techniques in characterizing nom properties and environmental behaviors is still lacking this work aimed to broaden our knowledge about the utilization of molecular spectra for nom studies through bridging the gaps between different research areas the state of the art molecular spectroscopic techniques including uv vis fluorescence infrared and raman spectroscopy and the most recent advances of their applications in the studies of nom are summarized specifically we highlight the evolution of spectral data extraction analysis and interpretation methods and their practical operability moreover themain limitations and requirements of current spectroscopic analytical approaches for the interpretation of the properties and environmental behaviors of nom are discussed and suggestions are proposed on how these defects can be addressed in addition perspectives and new directions on the development of spectroscopic techniques in analyzing nom related topics in environments are presented 2 spectroscopic techniques for studying nom 2 1 uv vis absorptionspectroscopy uv vis absorption spectroscopy is a popular tool that has been widely used in nom studies to identify the abundance quality trace the source reactivity and probe the structural variation of nom on account of its ease in use fast response low cost and high sensitivity li and hur 2017 due to a variety of light absorbing fractions in nom its original uv vis absorption spectra are usually featureless which generally decrease approximately exponentially with increasing wavelength fig 1 a however specific indexes parameters can be calculated through processing the uv vis spectral data of nom providing additional information on both static environments and dynamic processes these indexes parameters include absorption coefficients absorption ratios spectral slopes gaussian decomposition derivative differential spectra and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos the applications and indications of these spectral indexes parameters in nom studies are summarized in table 1 the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and the ratio of uv254 to dissolved organic carbon doc i e suva254 are usually used as indicative parameters of aromatic contents in humic substances batista et al 2016 wei et al 2009 similarly the parameters suva280 365 436 are associated with the levels of double bonds molecular size and chromophoric groups in nom respectively valencia et al 2013 absorption coefficients at specific wavelengths i e the absorbance normalized by optical path are found to be linearly related to doc concentrations in many ecosystems brezonik et al 2015 frey et al 2016 absorption coefficients can also be applied to predict lignin phenols and hydrophobic hydrophilic fractions in nom through empirical models al juboori et al 2016b fichot et al 2016 in addition absorption coefficients also correlate with organic compound attenuation and thus can be used as a surrogate parameter to monitor the removal of organic pollutants in advanced wastewater treatment processes altmann et al 2016 absorption coefficients can be applied for online monitoring of water treatment performance and early warning of process failure through integrating an uv vis spectrometer with the data processing system as absorbance absorption coefficients at different wavelengths present the contents of different nom fractions the absorption ratio defined as the ratio of absorbance absorption coefficients at two wavelengths can reflect the sources and the chemical compositions of nom absorption ratios such as e 2 e 3 at 250 365 nm e 2 e 4 at 265 465 nm and e 4 e 6 at 465 665 nm are frequently used to monitor the changes of mw aromaticity polarity humification and hydrophobicity of nom kang and xing 2008 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 rodríguez et al 2016 teng et al 2020 wang et al 2014 for instance an increase in e 2 e 3 indicates a decrease in average molecular weight and aromaticity teng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 absorption ratios at low wavelength e g a 254 a 204 can also be used to estimate the change of unsaturated saturated fraction proportions in nom or predict dbp formation potential as long as the absorption of interferences such as nitrates and sulfates at this wavelength range can be eliminated al juboori et al 2016a kim and yu 2007 in comparison the absorption ratios at relatively long wavelengths 600 nm are not recommended due to the poor signal to noise ratio at the wavelength ranges the practical application of absorption ratios for monitoring nom structural change relies on appropriate elimination of the interfering signals during the measurement spectral slopes are calculated from specific ranges of log transformed uv vis spectra fig 1b through exponential linear fitting which can provide more information about the structural changes of nom analogous to absorption ratio spectral slope can also reflect the aromaticity source and mw of nom in part helms et al 2008 roccaro et al 2015 the spectral slope in the wavelength region from 275 to 295 nm s 275 295 and the ratio of slope in the 275 295 nm region to that in the 350 400 nm region s 275 295 s 350 400 are found to be negatively correlated with the mw of nom loiselle et al 2009 wang et al 2016 moreover the amount of metal ions involved in nom binding are highly related to the differential spectral slope in the wavelength range from 325 to 375 nm namely dslope325 375 yan et al 2013b zhou and meng 2015 dslope325 375 is also amirror of chemically induced structural changes of nom during on line membrane cleaning zhou et al 2017 in comparison dslope240 280 and dslope325 375 are indicators of the involvements of conjugated carboxylic groups and phenolic plus carboxylic groups in nom heavy metal interaction respectively fig 1c d chen et al 2020b guo et al 2017 in other work dslope260 270 and dslope350 400are respectively linearly correlated with concentrations of carboxylic like groups and total nom bound al iii ions predicted based on the nica donnan model yan et al 2019 dslope350 400 is also indicative of the mg2 nom binding extent yan et al 2015 since the algorithm and the spectral range for the calculation of spectral slopes are quite diverse it is difficult to directly compare the results from different literatures thus the practical application of spectral slopes for nom samples need further verification in each case gaussian decomposition method is based on the allocation of gaussian bands through numerical deconvolution of uv vis absorbance spectra this method can be used to track the changes of molecular structure in nom under various external stimulations such as coagulation chlorination treatment korshin et al 1997 and spatial variation schwarz et al 2002 it can also be applied to trace the chemical characteristics as well as diagnostic state of nom massicotte and markager 2016 moreover the ratios of intensities at different gaussian bands in nom are found to be associated with covalent bonding characteristics of metal ionspecies yan and korshin 2014 derivative differential spectra are used to magnify the detection sensitivity through elevating signal noise ratio and are usually combined with the above mentioned parameters to interpret the structural changes of nom in various processes for instance integration of differential absorption spectra and gaussian decomposition has been widely used to study the interactions between nom and metals yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 doc normalized derivative absorbance and the ratios of derivative absorbance e g 1st or 2nd at different wavelengths can also be used to discriminate nom origins hur et al 2006 yakimenko et al 2018 in addition the degree of nom transformation and removal efficiency during ozone oxidation can be predicted by the relative differential absorbance a a audenaert et al 2013 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 it should be noted that when deciphering the uv vis spectral information of nom by gaussian decomposition the results may vary with different sources regions and environmental conditions in practice therefore it is suggested to establish recognized gaussian peak models of nom for better comparison and monitoring 2dcos analysis is a mathematic algorithm to enhance the spectral resolution by spreading the spectra along the second dimension and more importantly discern relative directions and specific orders of spectral changes upon a specific external perturbation such as ph time temperature and ion strength 2dcos can provide additional structural information about nom through seizing and extracting the subtle changes hiding behind the featureless uv vis absorption spectra hur et al 2011 phong and hur 2016 in 2dcos theory a series of perturbation induced spectrums a v p with a total number of m are recorded from the system v and p refer to the spectral and perturbation variables respectively which can be transformed to a set of dynamic spectra a v p with the following equation chen et al 2019 noda 2012 1 a v i p k a v i p k a v i f o r 1 k m 0 o t h e r w i s e where a v i is the reference spectrum typically the initial spectrum under no perturbation or the m averaged spectrum the variations of spectral features a v p under a perturbation are systematically examined by the cross correlation analysis hilbert noda transformation eqs 2 and 3 generating a pair of data matrixes i e synchronous ф and asynchronous ψ correlation spectra 2 φ v 1 v 2 1 m 1 k 1 m y v 1 p k y v 2 p k 3 ψ v 1 v 2 1 m 1 k 1 m y v 1 p k k 1 m n i k y v 2 p k 4 n i k 0 i f i k 1 π k i o t h e r w i s e where n ik is the hilbert noda transformation matrix element the spectral coordinates intensities and signs of correlation peaks in the synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos spectra can be interpreted by a set of well established principles noda 2012 noda 1990 xu et al 2018b uv vis 2dcos results reveal the degradation rates of humic substances at specific wavelength range depending on uv irradiation wavelengths hur et al 2011 2dcos has also been widely used to study heavy metal nom interactions guo et al 2019 guo et al 2017 apart from uv vis a variety of spectroscopic signals including fluorescence infrared and raman can also be analyzed by 2dcos which will be discussed later it should be noted however that 2dcos analysis only gives the sequential orders of spectral intensity variations rather than the order of the distributed presence of species relating to the spectral signals the premise for the application of spectral indexes parameters for nom study is the correct measurement of uv vis absorption spectra as mentioned before there are various environmental factors that may interfere with the measurement parameter calculation and interpretation of spectra such as turbidity temperature ph and coexistent ions therefore very cautious attention should be paid to avoid or eliminate the influences of interferences during spectral data acquisition calculation and interpretation in addition according to existing literatures each spectral index parameter is precisely applicable only to specific nom samples and the broadening of its application for a wider range remains to be validated moreover the spectral indexes parameters are mainly based on beer lambert experimental law while the inherent meaning of absorbance is still controversial mckay et al 2018 there are some attempts to interpret the spectral signals caused by variation of active functional groups in nom e g correlating the carboxylic and phenolic groups in das with deprotonation protonation dryer et al 2008 and correlating gaussian bands with metal binding and oxidation he et al 2015a yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 yan et al 2014 the assignment of the gaussian bands derived from the uv vis spectra may also be interpreted by quantum chemistry calculation chen et al 2020a yan et al 2017 however the exact relationship between uv vis spectral signals and nom structure requires more solid evidences the recent advances in the innovations of spectral indexes parameters especially the development of in situ measurement and online monitoring have driven the application scopes of uv vis spectroscopy from static conditions into dynamics of nom during physical chemical and biological processes it is also promising to expand the application of the spectral indexes parameters into some new aquatic or terrestrial systems since there are complementary findings from different researches owing to different parameters algorithms used in different studies comparison of nom data and cross application of uv vis spectra may be obstructed thus it is recommended to establish a platform to publish and share the raw absorption spectra data for better comparison and wider application so as to broaden our understanding on nom properties and environmental behaviors it is suggested to build uv vis spectral database and measurement standards so as to compare and characterize nom independent of sources regions and environmental conditions 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy has been extensively used to probe the chemical composition and biogeochemical cycling of nom with a high speed and superior sensitivity carstea et al 2019 there are two types of fluorescence spectroscopies i e transient state fluorescence fluorescence lifetime and steady state fluorescence and the latter is predominantly used in nom studies the basis of fluorescence technique is that the ground state sample molecules jump to the excited state under the illumination of an uv vis light and go back to the ground state through emitting lights at longer wavelengths fluorescence techniques include excitation spectra emission spectra synchronous fluorescence spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem excitation emission spectra are generated through scanning the excitation emission wavelength while fixing the emission excitation wavelength in synchronous fluorescence spectra both excitation and emission monochromatorsare scanned at a fixed wavelength interval δλ or energy interval δe between them providing a chance to eliminate the interferences of rayleigh and raman scattering eem comprises three vectors i e the excitation wavelength emission wavelength and fluorescence intensity along the x y and z coordinates respectively which is usually shown as a contour map synchronous fluorescence spectra and eem are the most popular fluorescence methods for nom study fluorescent structures in nom have characteristic excitation emission ex em peaks in the fluorescence spectra lying the foundation for the identification and quantification of nom fluorophores in various environmental and engineering systems carstea et al 2019 as nom consists of a variety of fluorescent structure its fluorescence spectra contains abundant and interwoven fluorescence information iskander et al 2018 during the past decades various methods have been developed to interpret the fluorescence data and so as to decipher the structural information of nom mainly including peak picking fluorescence regional integration fri principal component analysis pca parallel factor parafac self organizing map analysis 2dcos parallel factor framework clustering analysis pffca and prior linear decomposition pld the peak picking method identifies fluorescent components based on the peaks of ex em pairs pastore et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 there are typically six pairs of fluorescence ex em peaks in nom baker et al 2015 carstea et al 2016 coble et al 2014 fox et al 2017 peak b tyrosine like structure 230 300 nm two peaks t tryptophan like structure with at least one aromatic ring 230 280 340 nm peak a humic like structure with two aromaticrings 250 400 450 nm peak c humic like structure with two or more aromaticrings 300 350 400 460 nm and c allochthonous structure with two or more aromatic rings or microbially produced substances 380 480 nm peak picking is a simple and viable method for real time monitoring of water quality goldman et al 2012 there are customized sensors based on fluorescence peak picking designed for online measurement of biological oxygen demand colony forming unit and density of algae which are closely correlated with the fluorescence intensities at specific ex em peaks lee and hur 2017 yu et al 2018 it can also be used for the diagnosis of process failure which may result in significant change in fluorescence intensity peak picking coupled with modified stern volmer analysis can be used to track the quenching of nom fluorescence resulted from heavy metals chen et al 2015b habibul and chen 2018 lu and jaffe 2001 the binding characteristics of heavy metal ions onto fluorescent nom fractions can be quantified by the fluorescence quenching titration and the binding parameters can be obtained from the modified stern volmer equation berkovic et al 2013 5 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f and f 0 are the fluorescence intensities with and without heavy metal addition respectively while c m is the heavy metal concentration and f is the fraction of initial fluorescence relating to the binding fluorophores the conditional stability constant k m and f can be calculated through the linear fitting of f 0 f 0 f versus 1 c m due to peak shifts peak overlapping and interferences however the accuracy of fluorescence peak picking is sometimes uncertain yu et al 2016 moreover some fluorophores have more than one ex em peak the eems of nom can be decomposed into regionally specific eem volumes through fri method which integrates the volume beneath each eem region enabling semi quantitative analysis of the configuration and heterogeneity of nom xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 fluorophores in nom can be classified into five peak regions along the excitation and emission wavelength boundaries based on the literature reports table 2 chen et al 2003 fluorescence peaks at short excitation wavelengths 250 nm with emission wavelength ranges of 330 nm 330 380 nm and 380 nm are attributed to aromatic proteins i tyrosine aromatic proteins ii tryptophan and fulvic acid like substances respectively peaks located at long excitation wavelengths 250 nm with short emission wavelengths 250 380 nm are assigned to protein like and soluble microbial product smp like compounds while peaks at ex em 250 380 nm represent humic acid like organic fractions compared with peak picking the volume in fri reflects a group of substances with similar structure and negligible distinction fri has been successfully used to trace the fates of nom substances during water treatment processes he et al 2014 xu et al 2016 eem coupled with fri analysis can also be used to track the dbp precursors originated from nom which suggests that hydrophobic neutral and acidic compounds are the two predominant substances forming dbps deng et al 2018 application of fri to evaluate nom component is yet controversial because the component concentration is not always linearly related to fluorescence intensity in addition the presence of interferences may result in fluorescence quenching or enhancement of specific fluorophores in nom which can unlikely be revealed by fri pca is a statistical procedure widely used to extract common features from datasets not limited to spectra pca reduces the dimensionality of a dataset through an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of possibly correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated new variables called principal components the principal components can be correlated well with specific nom components through the comparison of score plots concentration and loading plots spectra of the components defined by fri persson and wedborg 2001 eem coupled with pca allows for the evaluation of the impact of surface water constituents on reversible irreversible membrane fouling maqbool et al 2018 peldszus et al 2011 moreover as confirmed by synchronous fluorescence spectra combined with pca the proton binding sites are heterogeneously distributed in the sub fractions of fulvic acid including fulvic humic tryptophan and tyrosine like moieties song et al 2018 it is worth noting that the principal components are merely abstract mathematical entities generated from monotonous mathematical manipulation which are statistically remarkable but lack chemical significance stedmon and bro 2008 therefore pca is usually combined with other methods or parameters to reflect the difference between nom samples and identify the predominant influential factors in comparison to pca parafac analysis deconvolutes eems into chemically meaningful components based on a mathematical tri linear model parafac has become the most commonly used algorithm to process eem data ishii and boyer 2012 and shows superior capacity on the differentiation and characterization of fluorescent nom indicators over peak picking and fri methods he and hur 2015b each parafac component has a distinctive source and characteristic which may show distinctive responses to environmental factors such as light salinity ph and microorganisms meng et al 2013 yang and hur 2014 zhang et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 eem combined with parafac is a promising tool to evaluate water quality and the removal of nom during treatment processes cohen et al 2014 murphy et al 2011 moreover eem parafac is able to track the changes in the chemical compositions of organic matter in stabilized landfill leachate during various pretreatments and access membrane fouling propensities in the subsequent nanofiltration processes aftab et al 2020 it can also be applied for the exploration of the heterogeneous adsorption behavior of nom onto nanoparticles with respect to ph molecular sizes and sources chen et al 2014 phong and hur 2018 wang et al 2019 self organizing map analysis is an artificial neural network algorithm that converts the fluorescence eem data to a low dimensional map whilst keeping the key topological and metric relationships of the input data bieroza et al 2012 combination of eem parafac with self organizing map analysis enables the clustering of similar samples and has been successfully applied to monitor the removal of nom in physical chemical treatment oloibiri et al 2017 the advantages of 2dcos method for spectral interpretation have been introduced before its application in fluorescence spectroscopy is mainly based on synchronous fluorescence spectra rather than eem due to incompatible dimensions fluorescence 2dcos allows for the evaluation of the nom characteristics from aquaculture wastewater and its interaction to 4 chlorophenol huang et al 2018a combination of eem parafac with synchronous fluorescence 2dcos analysis has been successfully used to track the temperature dependent structural variation of soil sediment nom making clear of the thermal induced transition priority of nom components chen et al 2017a parafac components of nom associated with humic like and tryptophan like speciesare affected by temperature by different extents depending on the water type carstea et al 2014 coupling synchronous fluorescence spectra with pca and 2dcos has been applied for the fractionation of nom from leachates with different landfill ages as well as characterization of the compositional variation based on hydrophobicity and polarity su et al 2016 a recent study has shown the possibility of using 2dcos technique to analyze eem data after dimension reduction by parafac and successfully applied it to track the fluorescence changes of effluent organic matter during ozonation yu et al 2019 it should be noted that eem parafac analysis is valid only if the eem data are trilinear ishii and boyer 2012 however not all fluorophores in nom are trilinearly independent in this case parafac analysis may lead to overestimation of component number and consequently inaccurate decomposition results on the basis of parafac a new method namely pffca is proposed to amend this defect qian et al 2017 compared to parafac pffca includes two steps i e data decomposition and component formation and may provide a relatively more precise estimation of nom components eem pffca has been successfully applied to examine the existence of interaction between nom components i e ha and protein during membrane fouling guan et al 2018 moreover eem parafac can be used for early warning of contamination occurrence on condition that the contaminants are spectrally different from the existing components nom without much spectral overlap eem parafac may not directly applicable for continuous online monitoring strategy at the early stage because of insufficient eem data while for long term monitoring it may be applicable as long as sufficient eem data are obtained carstea et al 2010 sanchez et al 2014 shutova et al 2014 inspired by pffca a method called pld is developed to quantify fluorescent nom components even when interferences with overlapping fluorescence coexist pld integrates pffca back propagation network and alternating least square analyses and provides quick diagnosis of interferences contaminants which shows a promising applicability for online monitoring of fluorescent substances in aqueous environments qian et al 2019 specifically fluorescence techniques have been widely applied in nom induced membrane fouling studies the intensity of nom fluorescence in the effluents is closely related to trans membrane pressure providing an indication of membrane bioreactor performance galinha et al 2012 the primary components of external foulants changed from protein like substance to humic acid like substance in the membrane bioreactor with pre ozonation liu et al 2011 through fluorescence eem the contributions of nom components on membrane fouling in the ultrafiltration process can be clarified which suggest that humic substances are the major foulants during the initial period while protein like components are related to irreversible fouling wang et al 2017 in addition the mw of humic substance can significantly affect the membrane fouling extent and reversibility quang et al 2016 fluorescence methods have a potential to be used as foulant indicators for online monitoring of membrane filtration systems since only a small fraction less than 1 of nom components is fluorescent the representativeness of these fluorophores to the whole nom structure is still challenging fluorescence spectroscopy fails to detect non fluorescent components limiting its wider application for nom study moreover although various methods have been developed to interpret the fluorescence data the exact inherent meaning of fluorescent signal is unclear yet therefore complementary techniques should be combined together to reveal a more comprehensive description of nom structure 2 3 infrared spectroscopy in contrast to uv vis and fluorescence techniques infrared spectroscopy offers more specific information on the chemical bonding molecular environment and molecular structure of nom the basic premise is that infrared light at specific wavelengths matches the energy levels of molecular vibrations e g stretching bending scissoring integration of fourier transform with infrared spectroscopy ftir has broadened its application to a wider field with a high sensitivity accuracy and resolution the wavelength of infrared spectroscopy ranges from 0 78 μm to 300 μm which is a huge span that can be divided into three sections i e near infrared 0 75 2 5 μm mid infrared 2 5 25 μm also revealed as wavenumber 400 4000 cm 1 and far infrared 25 300 μm mid infrared spectroscopy is the most popularly used technique for nom studies and contains two regions the functional group region 4000 1350 cm 1 and the fingerprint region 1350 400 cm 1 both of which can help to identify and discriminate specific chemical structure in nom however direct interpretation of infrared spectroscopy is challenging due to the heavily overlapped spectral features of nom as a result of the high polyfunctionality and complexity pan et al 2016 the resolution can be enhanced through spectral data post processing such as subtraction differentiation multivariate curve resolution alternative least squares and 2dcos analysis two modes are frequently used in ftir spectroscopy the transmission mode and the attenuated total reflection atr mode fig 3 a in the transmission mode the samples are dried ground with homogenized kbr squashed into transparent piece and put into the infrared beam path fig 3a thus it is considered as a sample destructive process abdulla et al 2010 in comparison the atr mode is non destructive in which the infrared light penetrates through a crystal with high refractive index and reaches the sample crystal interface generating an evanescent wave that interacts with the sample and the reflected radiation containing the vibrational information is collected by the detector fig 3b lu et al 2016 through atr ftir the structural variation of nom with respect to ph change can be monitored fig 3c chen et al 2014 the structure of dried nom fractions can also be probed via diffuse reflectance ftir spectroscopy in which a fine particle sample with relatively low absorbance and controlled size is required heckman et al 2011 płatkowska siwiec et al 2012 the evolution degradation of nom species in various processes such as biogas residue composting anaerobic digestion and biodrying can be examined based on the chemical changes probed by ftir spectroscopy offering insights into the evolution and degradation mechanisms guo et al 2018 li et al 2015 li et al 2014 the reversible redox sites in solid phase humic substances can be examined by in situ ftir spectroelectrochemistry yuan et al 2018 moreover the compositional changes of organics during water treatment processes can be tracked through ftir spectroscopic techniques aftab et al 2018 li et al 2014 rodríguez et al 2016 as confirmed by ftir spectra coupled with 2dcos analysis destruction of nom aromatic structure is correlated with the attenuation of anti estrogenic activity during ozonation treatment of domestic wastewater tang et al 2014 application of 2dcos to the ftir spectra reveals changes in the chemical composition of nom along an estuarine transect in which three major components with totally different biogeochemical reactivities are identified abdulla et al 2010 notably combination of ftir 2dcos with eem parafac has been widely used for the investigation of heavy metal nom interaction chen et al 2015b huang et al 2018b xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 it is also feasible to study nom induced membrane fouling via ftir spectroscopy benavente et al 2016 chen et al 2016b howe et al 2002 integration of atr ftir mapping with chemometric methods provides a possibility for the discrimination of nom foulants spatial temporal characterization of fouling evolution and comparison of fouling propensities between different foulants chen et al 2016b atr ftir spectroscopic feature of protein foulants can be used to track the velocity and shear stress profiles of membrane modules in the diary industry delaunay et al 2008 the existence of interaction between foulants originated from different nom components has been confirmed through ftir 2dcos which may affect the fouling mechanism and fouling extent guan et al 2018 furthermore the impacts of mg2 and ca2 on ha induced membrane fouling are explored using atr ftir coupled with quartz crystal microbalance and isothermal titration calorimetry the results show that ca2 could resultin acceleration of membrane fouling more evident compared to mg2 wang et al 2015 owing to the specific requirements on sample preparation and relatively low sensitivity ftir spectroscopy is mostly used as a qualitative method rather than quantitative technique moreover water is a major interference during measurement due to its strong absorption in a wide range of infrared region thus it is difficult to apply ftir spectroscopy for real time and in situ monitoring but some interfacial processes relating to nom such as heterogeneous adsorption can be revealed by the atr ftir mode with appropriately designed measuring setup overall ftir spectroscopy is more of a characterizing technique rather than a monitoring technique 2 4 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy is another vibrational spectroscopic technique that offers similar but complementary structural information compared to ir spectra moreover the interference of water no longer exists because the background raman signal of water is negligible although the energy levels measured in infrared and raman spectroscopy are close the basis are quite different vibrations that change the permanent dipole moment of the molecule are sensed in infrared spectroscopy while vibrations with polarizability changes produce raman signals ivleva et al 2017 raman based techniques include spontaneous raman scattering resonance raman scattering surface enhanced raman scattering sers tip enhanced raman scattering and stimulated raman scattering srs all of which with varying sensitivities have been applied to different fields raman spectroscopy is a minimally invasive technique for the monitoring of water quality and off line characterization of membrane fouling li et al 2016 it can also be used for real time and semi quantitative monitoring of membrane fouling during cross flow ultrafiltration and online sensing of biofouling in drinking water membrane filtration kögler et al 2016 virtanen et al 2017 characteristics of nom derived from river and sediment in normal flow period can be revealed by raman spectra fan et al 2016 moreover integration of fluorescence and raman spectroscopy has a great potential in the detection of chlorophyll a carotenoids nom and so4 2 in the ocean chen et al 2016a in addition raman microscopy has been used as a non invasive approach for microbial analysis and identification of macromolecules cells and their distributions in biofilm such as protein polyhydroxybutyrate and bacteria fig 4 a b andrews et al 2010 liu et al 2020 wagner et al 2009 raman signal can be elevated by 1014 1015 through sers which combines electromagnetic charge transfer and resonance mechanisms for signal enhancement qian and nie 2008 sers provides an earlier diagnoses of nom induced membrane fouling than commonly used flux decline curve with a high sensitivity and the fouling mechanism is mainly resulted from blocking of membrane pores cui et al 2011 sers also allows for the monitoring of biofilm formation evolution of biofouling and layer by layer interrogation of chemical infrastructure in biofouling and cleaning processes efeoglu and culha 2013 chen et al 2015a moreover real time sers analysis suggests that ha could inhibit the precipitation of cd and as at mineral surfaces through oxidation reduction and aqueous surface complexation mechanisms zhai et al 2019 based on nonlinear optics srs has been applied for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of biological samples with high speed sensitivity and spatial resolution in a label free and non invasive manner tipping et al 2016 srs spectroscopic imaging is able to identify the chemical structure of nom foulants protein and polysaccharide species and monitor their spatial distribution on inside membrane which shows the adsorption of foulants onto membrane surfaces and their aggregation within membrane pores in microfiltration process fig 4c d chen et al 2017b thus srs imaging is also a promising tool for monitoring of membrane fouling evolution raman signals are usually weak due to the low quantum efficiency typically 10 8 10 6 resulting in a low sensitivity sers can enhance the detection sensitivity but its performance depends on specific sers substrates ngo et al 2012 while unification of sers substrate is usually difficult on the other hand to obtain moderate raman signals the light sources are usually based on laser systems which inevitably results in relatively high cost and inconvenience for online monitoring overall the great potential of vibrational spectroscopic techniques for nom characterization and monitoring is evident despite that their applicability is limited by the practical implementation at present 3 comparison of molecular spectroscopy with other techniques knowledge on nom characteristics and environmental behaviors has risen to a new level with the rapid developments and applications of spectroscopic techniques the properties of nom including oxidation reduction protonation deprotonation and evolution degradation and its environmental behaviors such as thermal response locational variation membrane fouling and interaction with exogenous contaminants e g nanoparticles heavy metals and organic pollutants have been extensively investigated and clarified however due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of nom and its vast difference in composition concentration under various environments accurate characterization measurement and monitoring of nom is still challenging although molecular spectroscopic techniques can give abundant structural information about nom some inherent or technical defects remain to be solved interpretation ofthe inherent meanings of spectroscopic signals and development of algorithms to figure out the signals to quantify nom are two key challenges for expanding the utility of molecular spectroscopic methods the pros and cons of uv vis fluorescence ftir and raman spectroscopy for nom study are listed in table 3 in comparison other methods including sec ms and nmr for structural characterization of nom are also listed and discussed herein sec has been recognized as a reliable technique to directly provide both qualitative and quantitative information on nom such as mw fractionation and doc dissolved organic nitrogen concentration huber et al 2011 so et al 2017 yan et al 2012 generally the size fractions in nom identified by sec can be divided in the order 10 kda 1 kda 300 500 da and 350 da which are usually correlated to biopolymers humic substances building blocks and low molecular weight acid neutrals respectively sec is mainly applied to track nom in aqueous environments and study nom induced membrane fouling brogi et al 2018 derrien et al 2019 zheng et al 2014 since sec is unable to provide detailed structural information it is usually coupled with other techniques e g fluorescence ftir to reveal the properties of specific size fractions in nom in contrast ms provides a whole picture of molecular complexity with which the molecular species exact masses and molecular formula can be identified baluha et al 2013 hawkes et al 2018 richardson 2001 sleighter et al 2010 there are three ms techniques available for nom studies including pyrolysis gas chromatography ms liquid chromatography ms and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ft icr ms among them ft icr ms is a promising technique to accurately characterize nom from various water samples owing to its high mass resolution and accuracy providing molecular elemental information of nom bae et al 2011 li et al 2019 with the ft icr ms analysis nom in landfill leachate concentrate was found to be mainly composed of more saturated and less oxidized nitrogen and sulfur containing substances and complementary functions of biodegradation and coagulation in its treatment were verified yuan et al 2017 likewise nmr also offers comprehensive information about the molecular architecture of nom through sensing the chemical shifts of nuclei of atoms 1h 13c 15n and 31p under various local chemical environments barron and wilson 1981 hertkorn et al 2016 minor et al 2014 both solution and solid state nmr are available to characterize nom and the multidimensional configuration makes it a more appropriate technique to characterize complex organic compounds ikeya and watanabe 2016 woods et al 2012 although ms and nmr are highly sensitive techniques and have been proven to be powerful tools to reveal the diversity and complexity of nom they still present some inconveniences including technical issues prohibitive cost and most importantly the difficulties in data interpretation derrien et al 2019 how to link the various and extremely diversified data from ms nmr to the basic understanding of nom dynamics remains a big challenge on the other hand integration of molecular spectroscopy with ms and or nmr may offer a platform to reveal the intrinsic nature of spectroscopic signals which is helpful for tracking nom origins for instance as revealed by ultrahigh resolution ms nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy picocyanobacteria released nom with abundant nitrogen containing compounds which showed typical fluorescent signals that are closely found in oceanic environments and underwent similar photo degradation behaviors zhao et al 2017 this indicate that picocyano bacteria may be important sources of marine autochthonous nom that accumulates in the deep ocean ft icr ms also allows for the correlation of nom molecular signatures with eem parafac components and the results suggest that eem parafac analyses can offer information about the fraction of fluorescent nom and a significant amount of non fluorescent compounds stubbins et al 2014 in addition combination of ultrahigh resolution ms with optical spectroscopy can reveal the degradation processes of nom in aquatic systems in which oxidized and aromatic compounds were preferentially removed whereas reduced aliphatic and n containing compounds were resistant to degradation kellerman et al 2015 4 conclusion and perspectives given the current development and application of molecular spectroscopy for nom study future considerations and prospective are proposed as follows 1 unification of spectral analytical methods and establishment of spectral database for instance it is suggested to establish a platform to share and gather spectral data relating to nom forming recognized spectral models of nom regardless of origins and measuring conditions it is beneficial to obtain a good repeatability reliability of the analytical results by building universal standards for spectral measurement of nom regardless of origins a spectral database allows for a global comparison of nom responses and a deep insight of associated mechanisms during environmental processes which are helpful for the identification of nom origins properties and environmental behaviors 2 innovations on online monitoring techniques offline measurement of nom spectra may fail to reflect the structural information in real cases because the sample pretreatment process or delayed measurement may result in changes in nom structure through real time online measurement nom information under actual conditions can be revealed the following aspects are the directions to make efforts design of in situ sampling measuring setups nondestructive measurement in a label free manner improvement of instrumental detection sensitivity design of compatible software to reduce analysis time and simplify the analytical procedure integration of spectroscopic sensors with optical fibers or waveguide techniques is a good example for long distance and online monitoring of nom in aqueous solution 3 updates of chemometric algorithms for spectral data processing the marriage between chemometric approaches and spectral sensors allows for the identification and quantitative description of nom in complicated cases to better interpret spectral responses and extract useful signals from the interlaced spectral pool some other chemometric algorithms can be developed to integrate with molecular spectroscopy such as deep learning e g artificial neural network multivariate curve resolution and new concepts on 2dcos the goals are magnification of obscured subtle spectral features and attenuation of the overwhelmingly dominant but unwanted interference signals 4 enhancement of spectral spatial sensitivity and resolution with the rapid development of molecular spectroscopic instrumentation and imaging systems the spectral spatial sensitivity and resolution have been greatly improved some ultra sensitive techniques for interfacial detection such as atr surface tip enhanced raman scattering and second frequency generation spectroscopy are promising in probing physiochemical reactions involving with nom occurred at the heterogeneous interface at a molecular level second frequency generation spectroscopy for instance is superiorly sensitive sub molecular level at the interface between two phases which may be applied to capture the migration of nom from aqueous phase to minerals 5 integration of multiple spectroscopic techniques and interpretation of inherent meanings of spectral signals the basis of uv vis fluorescence infrared and raman spectroscopy are quite different and therefore they reflect different aspects of nom structure although there have been various publications that relate specific functional groups in nom with spectroscopic signals the inherent meanings of which are still ambiguous and sometimes results in inconsistent or even opposite conclusions complementary information about these structures and their relationships may be clarified through the integration of multiple spectroscopic techniques hetero spectral 2dcos analysis is an ideal way to interpret the spectral signals from different probes in addition molecular spectroscopy combined with other techniques such as sec atomic force microscopy electrochemical methods and theoretical calculations may provide additional insights into nom properties and environmental behaviors for example transient uv vis spectroscopy coupled with quantum chemistry calculations is promising in interpreting the inherent relationship between spectral signals and microstructure of nom to conclude evolutions on instrumentation and analytical methodology are two directions to drive the development of molecular spectroscopic techniques in the characterization and monitoring of nom with the rapid development of molecular spectroscopic techniques it is highly possible to broaden their applications to a wider field relating to nom for instance they may be used to study environmental interaction between nom and emerging contaminants such as dbps and endocrine disrupting chemicals moreover combination of spectroscopy with other characterizing techniques such as sec ms and nmr is promising to offer a more comprehensive insight into the functional and structural features of nom and their variation in environmental processes molecular spectroscopy coupled with chemometric methods provides more accurate information on the origin quality and diversity of nom and more clearly elucidates the underlying mechanisms resulting in the observed changes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17241,natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in environment and plays a fundamental role in the geochemical cycling of elements it is involved in a wide range of environmental processes and can significantly affect the environmental fates of exogenous contaminants understanding the properties and environmental behaviors of nom is critical to advance water treatment technologies and environmental remediation strategies nom is composed of characteristic light absorbing emitting functional groups which are the identification card of nom and susceptive to ambient physiochemical changes these groups and their variations can be captured through optical sensing therefore spectroscopic techniques are elegant tools to track the sources features and environmental behaviors of nom in this work the most recent advances in molecular spectroscopic techniques including uv vis fluorescence infrared and raman spectroscopy for the characterization measurement and monitoring of nom are reviewed and the state of the art innovations are highlighted furthermore the limitations of current spectroscopic approaches for the exploration of nom related environmental processesand how these weaknesses drawbacks can be addressed are explored finally suggestions and directions are proposed to advance the development of spectroscopic methods in analyzing and elucidating the properties and

introduction natural organic matter nom is the active organic species derived from decaying plants and animals after a series of biological and physiochemical reaction pan et al 2016 nom is widely present in environment and plays avital role in elemental geochemical cycling nom is served as the nutrient and energy sources for microbial webs in aquatic ecosystems and refers to the largest carbon pool on earth bianchi 2011 owing to the complex and heterogeneous structure of nom that contains various types of functional groups it has been regarded as a reactant chelator and or sorbent that can interact with anthropogenic contaminants such as heavy metals organic pollutants and nanoparticles thus altering their speciation distribution migration transformation and ultimate environmental fate nebbioso and piccolo 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 moreover specific components in nom are precursors of harmful disinfection by product dbp in freshwater systems beggs and summers 2011 zeng and arnold 2014 in addition nom is a major contributor that cause membrane fouling during membrane filtration processes chen et al 2018 le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 wang et al 2017 therefore understanding the properties and environmental behaviors of nom is of critical importance numerous techniques have been developed and applied for the characterization of nom such as size exclusion chromatography sec mass spectrometry ms nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and molecular spectroscopy molecular spectroscopy resulting from the absorption emission of electromagnetic radiation when the quantizedenergy state of molecules undergo changes is among the most popular tools to track the chemical structures of nom and their variations in environmental processes nom is composed of characteristic components that absorb emit a wide range of light which are susceptive to ambient biological and physiochemical changes these components and their variations can be easily captured through optical sensing for instance a wealth of information about the aromaticity molecular weight mw distribution origin and reactivity of nom can be reflected through uv vis spectroscopy on the other hand fluorescence spectroscopy can provide quantification of nom content and abundant chemical information about the functional groups in nom can be probed by infrared spectroscopy nowadays molecular spectroscopic techniques continue to evolve rapidly resulting in a high popularity for their broadened applications to new areas involving nom during the past two decades the number of publications on nom study using molecular spectroscopy has been expanding steadily since there is a significantly increasing trend in the utilization of molecular spectroscopic techniques for the characterization and monitoring of nom with different focuses it is therefore necessary to summarize and appraise the advances and development of molecular spectroscopic techniques in nom studies there are some reviews about the applications and recent advances of analytical approaches for nom studies in which molecular spectroscopic techniques are included derrien et al 2019 minor et al 2014 pan et al 2016 however these reviews simply introduced the advantages and application area of these spectroscopies while their limitations as well as future perspectives are missing utilization of uv vis spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy for nom studies have also been respectively summarized in some recent reviews carstea et al 2019 li et al 2020 li and hur 2017 mesquita et al 2017 but there is no objective comparison between each technique there remains a gap between the practical and theoretical applications of molecular spectroscopic techniques in different environmental areas as a result a comprehensive evaluation of the applications of molecular spectroscopic techniques in characterizing nom properties and environmental behaviors is still lacking this work aimed to broaden our knowledge about the utilization of molecular spectra for nom studies through bridging the gaps between different research areas the state of the art molecular spectroscopic techniques including uv vis fluorescence infrared and raman spectroscopy and the most recent advances of their applications in the studies of nom are summarized specifically we highlight the evolution of spectral data extraction analysis and interpretation methods and their practical operability moreover themain limitations and requirements of current spectroscopic analytical approaches for the interpretation of the properties and environmental behaviors of nom are discussed and suggestions are proposed on how these defects can be addressed in addition perspectives and new directions on the development of spectroscopic techniques in analyzing nom related topics in environments are presented 2 spectroscopic techniques for studying nom 2 1 uv vis absorptionspectroscopy uv vis absorption spectroscopy is a popular tool that has been widely used in nom studies to identify the abundance quality trace the source reactivity and probe the structural variation of nom on account of its ease in use fast response low cost and high sensitivity li and hur 2017 due to a variety of light absorbing fractions in nom its original uv vis absorption spectra are usually featureless which generally decrease approximately exponentially with increasing wavelength fig 1 a however specific indexes parameters can be calculated through processing the uv vis spectral data of nom providing additional information on both static environments and dynamic processes these indexes parameters include absorption coefficients absorption ratios spectral slopes gaussian decomposition derivative differential spectra and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos the applications and indications of these spectral indexes parameters in nom studies are summarized in table 1 the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and the ratio of uv254 to dissolved organic carbon doc i e suva254 are usually used as indicative parameters of aromatic contents in humic substances batista et al 2016 wei et al 2009 similarly the parameters suva280 365 436 are associated with the levels of double bonds molecular size and chromophoric groups in nom respectively valencia et al 2013 absorption coefficients at specific wavelengths i e the absorbance normalized by optical path are found to be linearly related to doc concentrations in many ecosystems brezonik et al 2015 frey et al 2016 absorption coefficients can also be applied to predict lignin phenols and hydrophobic hydrophilic fractions in nom through empirical models al juboori et al 2016b fichot et al 2016 in addition absorption coefficients also correlate with organic compound attenuation and thus can be used as a surrogate parameter to monitor the removal of organic pollutants in advanced wastewater treatment processes altmann et al 2016 absorption coefficients can be applied for online monitoring of water treatment performance and early warning of process failure through integrating an uv vis spectrometer with the data processing system as absorbance absorption coefficients at different wavelengths present the contents of different nom fractions the absorption ratio defined as the ratio of absorbance absorption coefficients at two wavelengths can reflect the sources and the chemical compositions of nom absorption ratios such as e 2 e 3 at 250 365 nm e 2 e 4 at 265 465 nm and e 4 e 6 at 465 665 nm are frequently used to monitor the changes of mw aromaticity polarity humification and hydrophobicity of nom kang and xing 2008 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 rodríguez et al 2016 teng et al 2020 wang et al 2014 for instance an increase in e 2 e 3 indicates a decrease in average molecular weight and aromaticity teng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 absorption ratios at low wavelength e g a 254 a 204 can also be used to estimate the change of unsaturated saturated fraction proportions in nom or predict dbp formation potential as long as the absorption of interferences such as nitrates and sulfates at this wavelength range can be eliminated al juboori et al 2016a kim and yu 2007 in comparison the absorption ratios at relatively long wavelengths 600 nm are not recommended due to the poor signal to noise ratio at the wavelength ranges the practical application of absorption ratios for monitoring nom structural change relies on appropriate elimination of the interfering signals during the measurement spectral slopes are calculated from specific ranges of log transformed uv vis spectra fig 1b through exponential linear fitting which can provide more information about the structural changes of nom analogous to absorption ratio spectral slope can also reflect the aromaticity source and mw of nom in part helms et al 2008 roccaro et al 2015 the spectral slope in the wavelength region from 275 to 295 nm s 275 295 and the ratio of slope in the 275 295 nm region to that in the 350 400 nm region s 275 295 s 350 400 are found to be negatively correlated with the mw of nom loiselle et al 2009 wang et al 2016 moreover the amount of metal ions involved in nom binding are highly related to the differential spectral slope in the wavelength range from 325 to 375 nm namely dslope325 375 yan et al 2013b zhou and meng 2015 dslope325 375 is also amirror of chemically induced structural changes of nom during on line membrane cleaning zhou et al 2017 in comparison dslope240 280 and dslope325 375 are indicators of the involvements of conjugated carboxylic groups and phenolic plus carboxylic groups in nom heavy metal interaction respectively fig 1c d chen et al 2020b guo et al 2017 in other work dslope260 270 and dslope350 400are respectively linearly correlated with concentrations of carboxylic like groups and total nom bound al iii ions predicted based on the nica donnan model yan et al 2019 dslope350 400 is also indicative of the mg2 nom binding extent yan et al 2015 since the algorithm and the spectral range for the calculation of spectral slopes are quite diverse it is difficult to directly compare the results from different literatures thus the practical application of spectral slopes for nom samples need further verification in each case gaussian decomposition method is based on the allocation of gaussian bands through numerical deconvolution of uv vis absorbance spectra this method can be used to track the changes of molecular structure in nom under various external stimulations such as coagulation chlorination treatment korshin et al 1997 and spatial variation schwarz et al 2002 it can also be applied to trace the chemical characteristics as well as diagnostic state of nom massicotte and markager 2016 moreover the ratios of intensities at different gaussian bands in nom are found to be associated with covalent bonding characteristics of metal ionspecies yan and korshin 2014 derivative differential spectra are used to magnify the detection sensitivity through elevating signal noise ratio and are usually combined with the above mentioned parameters to interpret the structural changes of nom in various processes for instance integration of differential absorption spectra and gaussian decomposition has been widely used to study the interactions between nom and metals yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 doc normalized derivative absorbance and the ratios of derivative absorbance e g 1st or 2nd at different wavelengths can also be used to discriminate nom origins hur et al 2006 yakimenko et al 2018 in addition the degree of nom transformation and removal efficiency during ozone oxidation can be predicted by the relative differential absorbance a a audenaert et al 2013 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 it should be noted that when deciphering the uv vis spectral information of nom by gaussian decomposition the results may vary with different sources regions and environmental conditions in practice therefore it is suggested to establish recognized gaussian peak models of nom for better comparison and monitoring 2dcos analysis is a mathematic algorithm to enhance the spectral resolution by spreading the spectra along the second dimension and more importantly discern relative directions and specific orders of spectral changes upon a specific external perturbation such as ph time temperature and ion strength 2dcos can provide additional structural information about nom through seizing and extracting the subtle changes hiding behind the featureless uv vis absorption spectra hur et al 2011 phong and hur 2016 in 2dcos theory a series of perturbation induced spectrums a v p with a total number of m are recorded from the system v and p refer to the spectral and perturbation variables respectively which can be transformed to a set of dynamic spectra a v p with the following equation chen et al 2019 noda 2012 1 a v i p k a v i p k a v i f o r 1 k m 0 o t h e r w i s e where a v i is the reference spectrum typically the initial spectrum under no perturbation or the m averaged spectrum the variations of spectral features a v p under a perturbation are systematically examined by the cross correlation analysis hilbert noda transformation eqs 2 and 3 generating a pair of data matrixes i e synchronous ф and asynchronous ψ correlation spectra 2 φ v 1 v 2 1 m 1 k 1 m y v 1 p k y v 2 p k 3 ψ v 1 v 2 1 m 1 k 1 m y v 1 p k k 1 m n i k y v 2 p k 4 n i k 0 i f i k 1 π k i o t h e r w i s e where n ik is the hilbert noda transformation matrix element the spectral coordinates intensities and signs of correlation peaks in the synchronous and asynchronous 2dcos spectra can be interpreted by a set of well established principles noda 2012 noda 1990 xu et al 2018b uv vis 2dcos results reveal the degradation rates of humic substances at specific wavelength range depending on uv irradiation wavelengths hur et al 2011 2dcos has also been widely used to study heavy metal nom interactions guo et al 2019 guo et al 2017 apart from uv vis a variety of spectroscopic signals including fluorescence infrared and raman can also be analyzed by 2dcos which will be discussed later it should be noted however that 2dcos analysis only gives the sequential orders of spectral intensity variations rather than the order of the distributed presence of species relating to the spectral signals the premise for the application of spectral indexes parameters for nom study is the correct measurement of uv vis absorption spectra as mentioned before there are various environmental factors that may interfere with the measurement parameter calculation and interpretation of spectra such as turbidity temperature ph and coexistent ions therefore very cautious attention should be paid to avoid or eliminate the influences of interferences during spectral data acquisition calculation and interpretation in addition according to existing literatures each spectral index parameter is precisely applicable only to specific nom samples and the broadening of its application for a wider range remains to be validated moreover the spectral indexes parameters are mainly based on beer lambert experimental law while the inherent meaning of absorbance is still controversial mckay et al 2018 there are some attempts to interpret the spectral signals caused by variation of active functional groups in nom e g correlating the carboxylic and phenolic groups in das with deprotonation protonation dryer et al 2008 and correlating gaussian bands with metal binding and oxidation he et al 2015a yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 yan et al 2014 the assignment of the gaussian bands derived from the uv vis spectra may also be interpreted by quantum chemistry calculation chen et al 2020a yan et al 2017 however the exact relationship between uv vis spectral signals and nom structure requires more solid evidences the recent advances in the innovations of spectral indexes parameters especially the development of in situ measurement and online monitoring have driven the application scopes of uv vis spectroscopy from static conditions into dynamics of nom during physical chemical and biological processes it is also promising to expand the application of the spectral indexes parameters into some new aquatic or terrestrial systems since there are complementary findings from different researches owing to different parameters algorithms used in different studies comparison of nom data and cross application of uv vis spectra may be obstructed thus it is recommended to establish a platform to publish and share the raw absorption spectra data for better comparison and wider application so as to broaden our understanding on nom properties and environmental behaviors it is suggested to build uv vis spectral database and measurement standards so as to compare and characterize nom independent of sources regions and environmental conditions 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy has been extensively used to probe the chemical composition and biogeochemical cycling of nom with a high speed and superior sensitivity carstea et al 2019 there are two types of fluorescence spectroscopies i e transient state fluorescence fluorescence lifetime and steady state fluorescence and the latter is predominantly used in nom studies the basis of fluorescence technique is that the ground state sample molecules jump to the excited state under the illumination of an uv vis light and go back to the ground state through emitting lights at longer wavelengths fluorescence techniques include excitation spectra emission spectra synchronous fluorescence spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem excitation emission spectra are generated through scanning the excitation emission wavelength while fixing the emission excitation wavelength in synchronous fluorescence spectra both excitation and emission monochromatorsare scanned at a fixed wavelength interval δλ or energy interval δe between them providing a chance to eliminate the interferences of rayleigh and raman scattering eem comprises three vectors i e the excitation wavelength emission wavelength and fluorescence intensity along the x y and z coordinates respectively which is usually shown as a contour map synchronous fluorescence spectra and eem are the most popular fluorescence methods for nom study fluorescent structures in nom have characteristic excitation emission ex em peaks in the fluorescence spectra lying the foundation for the identification and quantification of nom fluorophores in various environmental and engineering systems carstea et al 2019 as nom consists of a variety of fluorescent structure its fluorescence spectra contains abundant and interwoven fluorescence information iskander et al 2018 during the past decades various methods have been developed to interpret the fluorescence data and so as to decipher the structural information of nom mainly including peak picking fluorescence regional integration fri principal component analysis pca parallel factor parafac self organizing map analysis 2dcos parallel factor framework clustering analysis pffca and prior linear decomposition pld the peak picking method identifies fluorescent components based on the peaks of ex em pairs pastore et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 there are typically six pairs of fluorescence ex em peaks in nom baker et al 2015 carstea et al 2016 coble et al 2014 fox et al 2017 peak b tyrosine like structure 230 300 nm two peaks t tryptophan like structure with at least one aromatic ring 230 280 340 nm peak a humic like structure with two aromaticrings 250 400 450 nm peak c humic like structure with two or more aromaticrings 300 350 400 460 nm and c allochthonous structure with two or more aromatic rings or microbially produced substances 380 480 nm peak picking is a simple and viable method for real time monitoring of water quality goldman et al 2012 there are customized sensors based on fluorescence peak picking designed for online measurement of biological oxygen demand colony forming unit and density of algae which are closely correlated with the fluorescence intensities at specific ex em peaks lee and hur 2017 yu et al 2018 it can also be used for the diagnosis of process failure which may result in significant change in fluorescence intensity peak picking coupled with modified stern volmer analysis can be used to track the quenching of nom fluorescence resulted from heavy metals chen et al 2015b habibul and chen 2018 lu and jaffe 2001 the binding characteristics of heavy metal ions onto fluorescent nom fractions can be quantified by the fluorescence quenching titration and the binding parameters can be obtained from the modified stern volmer equation berkovic et al 2013 5 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f and f 0 are the fluorescence intensities with and without heavy metal addition respectively while c m is the heavy metal concentration and f is the fraction of initial fluorescence relating to the binding fluorophores the conditional stability constant k m and f can be calculated through the linear fitting of f 0 f 0 f versus 1 c m due to peak shifts peak overlapping and interferences however the accuracy of fluorescence peak picking is sometimes uncertain yu et al 2016 moreover some fluorophores have more than one ex em peak the eems of nom can be decomposed into regionally specific eem volumes through fri method which integrates the volume beneath each eem region enabling semi quantitative analysis of the configuration and heterogeneity of nom xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 fluorophores in nom can be classified into five peak regions along the excitation and emission wavelength boundaries based on the literature reports table 2 chen et al 2003 fluorescence peaks at short excitation wavelengths 250 nm with emission wavelength ranges of 330 nm 330 380 nm and 380 nm are attributed to aromatic proteins i tyrosine aromatic proteins ii tryptophan and fulvic acid like substances respectively peaks located at long excitation wavelengths 250 nm with short emission wavelengths 250 380 nm are assigned to protein like and soluble microbial product smp like compounds while peaks at ex em 250 380 nm represent humic acid like organic fractions compared with peak picking the volume in fri reflects a group of substances with similar structure and negligible distinction fri has been successfully used to trace the fates of nom substances during water treatment processes he et al 2014 xu et al 2016 eem coupled with fri analysis can also be used to track the dbp precursors originated from nom which suggests that hydrophobic neutral and acidic compounds are the two predominant substances forming dbps deng et al 2018 application of fri to evaluate nom component is yet controversial because the component concentration is not always linearly related to fluorescence intensity in addition the presence of interferences may result in fluorescence quenching or enhancement of specific fluorophores in nom which can unlikely be revealed by fri pca is a statistical procedure widely used to extract common features from datasets not limited to spectra pca reduces the dimensionality of a dataset through an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of possibly correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated new variables called principal components the principal components can be correlated well with specific nom components through the comparison of score plots concentration and loading plots spectra of the components defined by fri persson and wedborg 2001 eem coupled with pca allows for the evaluation of the impact of surface water constituents on reversible irreversible membrane fouling maqbool et al 2018 peldszus et al 2011 moreover as confirmed by synchronous fluorescence spectra combined with pca the proton binding sites are heterogeneously distributed in the sub fractions of fulvic acid including fulvic humic tryptophan and tyrosine like moieties song et al 2018 it is worth noting that the principal components are merely abstract mathematical entities generated from monotonous mathematical manipulation which are statistically remarkable but lack chemical significance stedmon and bro 2008 therefore pca is usually combined with other methods or parameters to reflect the difference between nom samples and identify the predominant influential factors in comparison to pca parafac analysis deconvolutes eems into chemically meaningful components based on a mathematical tri linear model parafac has become the most commonly used algorithm to process eem data ishii and boyer 2012 and shows superior capacity on the differentiation and characterization of fluorescent nom indicators over peak picking and fri methods he and hur 2015b each parafac component has a distinctive source and characteristic which may show distinctive responses to environmental factors such as light salinity ph and microorganisms meng et al 2013 yang and hur 2014 zhang et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 eem combined with parafac is a promising tool to evaluate water quality and the removal of nom during treatment processes cohen et al 2014 murphy et al 2011 moreover eem parafac is able to track the changes in the chemical compositions of organic matter in stabilized landfill leachate during various pretreatments and access membrane fouling propensities in the subsequent nanofiltration processes aftab et al 2020 it can also be applied for the exploration of the heterogeneous adsorption behavior of nom onto nanoparticles with respect to ph molecular sizes and sources chen et al 2014 phong and hur 2018 wang et al 2019 self organizing map analysis is an artificial neural network algorithm that converts the fluorescence eem data to a low dimensional map whilst keeping the key topological and metric relationships of the input data bieroza et al 2012 combination of eem parafac with self organizing map analysis enables the clustering of similar samples and has been successfully applied to monitor the removal of nom in physical chemical treatment oloibiri et al 2017 the advantages of 2dcos method for spectral interpretation have been introduced before its application in fluorescence spectroscopy is mainly based on synchronous fluorescence spectra rather than eem due to incompatible dimensions fluorescence 2dcos allows for the evaluation of the nom characteristics from aquaculture wastewater and its interaction to 4 chlorophenol huang et al 2018a combination of eem parafac with synchronous fluorescence 2dcos analysis has been successfully used to track the temperature dependent structural variation of soil sediment nom making clear of the thermal induced transition priority of nom components chen et al 2017a parafac components of nom associated with humic like and tryptophan like speciesare affected by temperature by different extents depending on the water type carstea et al 2014 coupling synchronous fluorescence spectra with pca and 2dcos has been applied for the fractionation of nom from leachates with different landfill ages as well as characterization of the compositional variation based on hydrophobicity and polarity su et al 2016 a recent study has shown the possibility of using 2dcos technique to analyze eem data after dimension reduction by parafac and successfully applied it to track the fluorescence changes of effluent organic matter during ozonation yu et al 2019 it should be noted that eem parafac analysis is valid only if the eem data are trilinear ishii and boyer 2012 however not all fluorophores in nom are trilinearly independent in this case parafac analysis may lead to overestimation of component number and consequently inaccurate decomposition results on the basis of parafac a new method namely pffca is proposed to amend this defect qian et al 2017 compared to parafac pffca includes two steps i e data decomposition and component formation and may provide a relatively more precise estimation of nom components eem pffca has been successfully applied to examine the existence of interaction between nom components i e ha and protein during membrane fouling guan et al 2018 moreover eem parafac can be used for early warning of contamination occurrence on condition that the contaminants are spectrally different from the existing components nom without much spectral overlap eem parafac may not directly applicable for continuous online monitoring strategy at the early stage because of insufficient eem data while for long term monitoring it may be applicable as long as sufficient eem data are obtained carstea et al 2010 sanchez et al 2014 shutova et al 2014 inspired by pffca a method called pld is developed to quantify fluorescent nom components even when interferences with overlapping fluorescence coexist pld integrates pffca back propagation network and alternating least square analyses and provides quick diagnosis of interferences contaminants which shows a promising applicability for online monitoring of fluorescent substances in aqueous environments qian et al 2019 specifically fluorescence techniques have been widely applied in nom induced membrane fouling studies the intensity of nom fluorescence in the effluents is closely related to trans membrane pressure providing an indication of membrane bioreactor performance galinha et al 2012 the primary components of external foulants changed from protein like substance to humic acid like substance in the membrane bioreactor with pre ozonation liu et al 2011 through fluorescence eem the contributions of nom components on membrane fouling in the ultrafiltration process can be clarified which suggest that humic substances are the major foulants during the initial period while protein like components are related to irreversible fouling wang et al 2017 in addition the mw of humic substance can significantly affect the membrane fouling extent and reversibility quang et al 2016 fluorescence methods have a potential to be used as foulant indicators for online monitoring of membrane filtration systems since only a small fraction less than 1 of nom components is fluorescent the representativeness of these fluorophores to the whole nom structure is still challenging fluorescence spectroscopy fails to detect non fluorescent components limiting its wider application for nom study moreover although various methods have been developed to interpret the fluorescence data the exact inherent meaning of fluorescent signal is unclear yet therefore complementary techniques should be combined together to reveal a more comprehensive description of nom structure 2 3 infrared spectroscopy in contrast to uv vis and fluorescence techniques infrared spectroscopy offers more specific information on the chemical bonding molecular environment and molecular structure of nom the basic premise is that infrared light at specific wavelengths matches the energy levels of molecular vibrations e g stretching bending scissoring integration of fourier transform with infrared spectroscopy ftir has broadened its application to a wider field with a high sensitivity accuracy and resolution the wavelength of infrared spectroscopy ranges from 0 78 μm to 300 μm which is a huge span that can be divided into three sections i e near infrared 0 75 2 5 μm mid infrared 2 5 25 μm also revealed as wavenumber 400 4000 cm 1 and far infrared 25 300 μm mid infrared spectroscopy is the most popularly used technique for nom studies and contains two regions the functional group region 4000 1350 cm 1 and the fingerprint region 1350 400 cm 1 both of which can help to identify and discriminate specific chemical structure in nom however direct interpretation of infrared spectroscopy is challenging due to the heavily overlapped spectral features of nom as a result of the high polyfunctionality and complexity pan et al 2016 the resolution can be enhanced through spectral data post processing such as subtraction differentiation multivariate curve resolution alternative least squares and 2dcos analysis two modes are frequently used in ftir spectroscopy the transmission mode and the attenuated total reflection atr mode fig 3 a in the transmission mode the samples are dried ground with homogenized kbr squashed into transparent piece and put into the infrared beam path fig 3a thus it is considered as a sample destructive process abdulla et al 2010 in comparison the atr mode is non destructive in which the infrared light penetrates through a crystal with high refractive index and reaches the sample crystal interface generating an evanescent wave that interacts with the sample and the reflected radiation containing the vibrational information is collected by the detector fig 3b lu et al 2016 through atr ftir the structural variation of nom with respect to ph change can be monitored fig 3c chen et al 2014 the structure of dried nom fractions can also be probed via diffuse reflectance ftir spectroscopy in which a fine particle sample with relatively low absorbance and controlled size is required heckman et al 2011 płatkowska siwiec et al 2012 the evolution degradation of nom species in various processes such as biogas residue composting anaerobic digestion and biodrying can be examined based on the chemical changes probed by ftir spectroscopy offering insights into the evolution and degradation mechanisms guo et al 2018 li et al 2015 li et al 2014 the reversible redox sites in solid phase humic substances can be examined by in situ ftir spectroelectrochemistry yuan et al 2018 moreover the compositional changes of organics during water treatment processes can be tracked through ftir spectroscopic techniques aftab et al 2018 li et al 2014 rodríguez et al 2016 as confirmed by ftir spectra coupled with 2dcos analysis destruction of nom aromatic structure is correlated with the attenuation of anti estrogenic activity during ozonation treatment of domestic wastewater tang et al 2014 application of 2dcos to the ftir spectra reveals changes in the chemical composition of nom along an estuarine transect in which three major components with totally different biogeochemical reactivities are identified abdulla et al 2010 notably combination of ftir 2dcos with eem parafac has been widely used for the investigation of heavy metal nom interaction chen et al 2015b huang et al 2018b xu et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 it is also feasible to study nom induced membrane fouling via ftir spectroscopy benavente et al 2016 chen et al 2016b howe et al 2002 integration of atr ftir mapping with chemometric methods provides a possibility for the discrimination of nom foulants spatial temporal characterization of fouling evolution and comparison of fouling propensities between different foulants chen et al 2016b atr ftir spectroscopic feature of protein foulants can be used to track the velocity and shear stress profiles of membrane modules in the diary industry delaunay et al 2008 the existence of interaction between foulants originated from different nom components has been confirmed through ftir 2dcos which may affect the fouling mechanism and fouling extent guan et al 2018 furthermore the impacts of mg2 and ca2 on ha induced membrane fouling are explored using atr ftir coupled with quartz crystal microbalance and isothermal titration calorimetry the results show that ca2 could resultin acceleration of membrane fouling more evident compared to mg2 wang et al 2015 owing to the specific requirements on sample preparation and relatively low sensitivity ftir spectroscopy is mostly used as a qualitative method rather than quantitative technique moreover water is a major interference during measurement due to its strong absorption in a wide range of infrared region thus it is difficult to apply ftir spectroscopy for real time and in situ monitoring but some interfacial processes relating to nom such as heterogeneous adsorption can be revealed by the atr ftir mode with appropriately designed measuring setup overall ftir spectroscopy is more of a characterizing technique rather than a monitoring technique 2 4 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy is another vibrational spectroscopic technique that offers similar but complementary structural information compared to ir spectra moreover the interference of water no longer exists because the background raman signal of water is negligible although the energy levels measured in infrared and raman spectroscopy are close the basis are quite different vibrations that change the permanent dipole moment of the molecule are sensed in infrared spectroscopy while vibrations with polarizability changes produce raman signals ivleva et al 2017 raman based techniques include spontaneous raman scattering resonance raman scattering surface enhanced raman scattering sers tip enhanced raman scattering and stimulated raman scattering srs all of which with varying sensitivities have been applied to different fields raman spectroscopy is a minimally invasive technique for the monitoring of water quality and off line characterization of membrane fouling li et al 2016 it can also be used for real time and semi quantitative monitoring of membrane fouling during cross flow ultrafiltration and online sensing of biofouling in drinking water membrane filtration kögler et al 2016 virtanen et al 2017 characteristics of nom derived from river and sediment in normal flow period can be revealed by raman spectra fan et al 2016 moreover integration of fluorescence and raman spectroscopy has a great potential in the detection of chlorophyll a carotenoids nom and so4 2 in the ocean chen et al 2016a in addition raman microscopy has been used as a non invasive approach for microbial analysis and identification of macromolecules cells and their distributions in biofilm such as protein polyhydroxybutyrate and bacteria fig 4 a b andrews et al 2010 liu et al 2020 wagner et al 2009 raman signal can be elevated by 1014 1015 through sers which combines electromagnetic charge transfer and resonance mechanisms for signal enhancement qian and nie 2008 sers provides an earlier diagnoses of nom induced membrane fouling than commonly used flux decline curve with a high sensitivity and the fouling mechanism is mainly resulted from blocking of membrane pores cui et al 2011 sers also allows for the monitoring of biofilm formation evolution of biofouling and layer by layer interrogation of chemical infrastructure in biofouling and cleaning processes efeoglu and culha 2013 chen et al 2015a moreover real time sers analysis suggests that ha could inhibit the precipitation of cd and as at mineral surfaces through oxidation reduction and aqueous surface complexation mechanisms zhai et al 2019 based on nonlinear optics srs has been applied for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of biological samples with high speed sensitivity and spatial resolution in a label free and non invasive manner tipping et al 2016 srs spectroscopic imaging is able to identify the chemical structure of nom foulants protein and polysaccharide species and monitor their spatial distribution on inside membrane which shows the adsorption of foulants onto membrane surfaces and their aggregation within membrane pores in microfiltration process fig 4c d chen et al 2017b thus srs imaging is also a promising tool for monitoring of membrane fouling evolution raman signals are usually weak due to the low quantum efficiency typically 10 8 10 6 resulting in a low sensitivity sers can enhance the detection sensitivity but its performance depends on specific sers substrates ngo et al 2012 while unification of sers substrate is usually difficult on the other hand to obtain moderate raman signals the light sources are usually based on laser systems which inevitably results in relatively high cost and inconvenience for online monitoring overall the great potential of vibrational spectroscopic techniques for nom characterization and monitoring is evident despite that their applicability is limited by the practical implementation at present 3 comparison of molecular spectroscopy with other techniques knowledge on nom characteristics and environmental behaviors has risen to a new level with the rapid developments and applications of spectroscopic techniques the properties of nom including oxidation reduction protonation deprotonation and evolution degradation and its environmental behaviors such as thermal response locational variation membrane fouling and interaction with exogenous contaminants e g nanoparticles heavy metals and organic pollutants have been extensively investigated and clarified however due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of nom and its vast difference in composition concentration under various environments accurate characterization measurement and monitoring of nom is still challenging although molecular spectroscopic techniques can give abundant structural information about nom some inherent or technical defects remain to be solved interpretation ofthe inherent meanings of spectroscopic signals and development of algorithms to figure out the signals to quantify nom are two key challenges for expanding the utility of molecular spectroscopic methods the pros and cons of uv vis fluorescence ftir and raman spectroscopy for nom study are listed in table 3 in comparison other methods including sec ms and nmr for structural characterization of nom are also listed and discussed herein sec has been recognized as a reliable technique to directly provide both qualitative and quantitative information on nom such as mw fractionation and doc dissolved organic nitrogen concentration huber et al 2011 so et al 2017 yan et al 2012 generally the size fractions in nom identified by sec can be divided in the order 10 kda 1 kda 300 500 da and 350 da which are usually correlated to biopolymers humic substances building blocks and low molecular weight acid neutrals respectively sec is mainly applied to track nom in aqueous environments and study nom induced membrane fouling brogi et al 2018 derrien et al 2019 zheng et al 2014 since sec is unable to provide detailed structural information it is usually coupled with other techniques e g fluorescence ftir to reveal the properties of specific size fractions in nom in contrast ms provides a whole picture of molecular complexity with which the molecular species exact masses and molecular formula can be identified baluha et al 2013 hawkes et al 2018 richardson 2001 sleighter et al 2010 there are three ms techniques available for nom studies including pyrolysis gas chromatography ms liquid chromatography ms and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ft icr ms among them ft icr ms is a promising technique to accurately characterize nom from various water samples owing to its high mass resolution and accuracy providing molecular elemental information of nom bae et al 2011 li et al 2019 with the ft icr ms analysis nom in landfill leachate concentrate was found to be mainly composed of more saturated and less oxidized nitrogen and sulfur containing substances and complementary functions of biodegradation and coagulation in its treatment were verified yuan et al 2017 likewise nmr also offers comprehensive information about the molecular architecture of nom through sensing the chemical shifts of nuclei of atoms 1h 13c 15n and 31p under various local chemical environments barron and wilson 1981 hertkorn et al 2016 minor et al 2014 both solution and solid state nmr are available to characterize nom and the multidimensional configuration makes it a more appropriate technique to characterize complex organic compounds ikeya and watanabe 2016 woods et al 2012 although ms and nmr are highly sensitive techniques and have been proven to be powerful tools to reveal the diversity and complexity of nom they still present some inconveniences including technical issues prohibitive cost and most importantly the difficulties in data interpretation derrien et al 2019 how to link the various and extremely diversified data from ms nmr to the basic understanding of nom dynamics remains a big challenge on the other hand integration of molecular spectroscopy with ms and or nmr may offer a platform to reveal the intrinsic nature of spectroscopic signals which is helpful for tracking nom origins for instance as revealed by ultrahigh resolution ms nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy picocyanobacteria released nom with abundant nitrogen containing compounds which showed typical fluorescent signals that are closely found in oceanic environments and underwent similar photo degradation behaviors zhao et al 2017 this indicate that picocyano bacteria may be important sources of marine autochthonous nom that accumulates in the deep ocean ft icr ms also allows for the correlation of nom molecular signatures with eem parafac components and the results suggest that eem parafac analyses can offer information about the fraction of fluorescent nom and a significant amount of non fluorescent compounds stubbins et al 2014 in addition combination of ultrahigh resolution ms with optical spectroscopy can reveal the degradation processes of nom in aquatic systems in which oxidized and aromatic compounds were preferentially removed whereas reduced aliphatic and n containing compounds were resistant to degradation kellerman et al 2015 4 conclusion and perspectives given the current development and application of molecular spectroscopy for nom study future considerations and prospective are proposed as follows 1 unification of spectral analytical methods and establishment of spectral database for instance it is suggested to establish a platform to share and gather spectral data relating to nom forming recognized spectral models of nom regardless of origins and measuring conditions it is beneficial to obtain a good repeatability reliability of the analytical results by building universal standards for spectral measurement of nom regardless of origins a spectral database allows for a global comparison of nom responses and a deep insight of associated mechanisms during environmental processes which are helpful for the identification of nom origins properties and environmental behaviors 2 innovations on online monitoring techniques offline measurement of nom spectra may fail to reflect the structural information in real cases because the sample pretreatment process or delayed measurement may result in changes in nom structure through real time online measurement nom information under actual conditions can be revealed the following aspects are the directions to make efforts design of in situ sampling measuring setups nondestructive measurement in a label free manner improvement of instrumental detection sensitivity design of compatible software to reduce analysis time and simplify the analytical procedure integration of spectroscopic sensors with optical fibers or waveguide techniques is a good example for long distance and online monitoring of nom in aqueous solution 3 updates of chemometric algorithms for spectral data processing the marriage between chemometric approaches and spectral sensors allows for the identification and quantitative description of nom in complicated cases to better interpret spectral responses and extract useful signals from the interlaced spectral pool some other chemometric algorithms can be developed to integrate with molecular spectroscopy such as deep learning e g artificial neural network multivariate curve resolution and new concepts on 2dcos the goals are magnification of obscured subtle spectral features and attenuation of the overwhelmingly dominant but unwanted interference signals 4 enhancement of spectral spatial sensitivity and resolution with the rapid development of molecular spectroscopic instrumentation and imaging systems the spectral spatial sensitivity and resolution have been greatly improved some ultra sensitive techniques for interfacial detection such as atr surface tip enhanced raman scattering and second frequency generation spectroscopy are promising in probing physiochemical reactions involving with nom occurred at the heterogeneous interface at a molecular level second frequency generation spectroscopy for instance is superiorly sensitive sub molecular level at the interface between two phases which may be applied to capture the migration of nom from aqueous phase to minerals 5 integration of multiple spectroscopic techniques and interpretation of inherent meanings of spectral signals the basis of uv vis fluorescence infrared and raman spectroscopy are quite different and therefore they reflect different aspects of nom structure although there have been various publications that relate specific functional groups in nom with spectroscopic signals the inherent meanings of which are still ambiguous and sometimes results in inconsistent or even opposite conclusions complementary information about these structures and their relationships may be clarified through the integration of multiple spectroscopic techniques hetero spectral 2dcos analysis is an ideal way to interpret the spectral signals from different probes in addition molecular spectroscopy combined with other techniques such as sec atomic force microscopy electrochemical methods and theoretical calculations may provide additional insights into nom properties and environmental behaviors for example transient uv vis spectroscopy coupled with quantum chemistry calculations is promising in interpreting the inherent relationship between spectral signals and microstructure of nom to conclude evolutions on instrumentation and analytical methodology are two directions to drive the development of molecular spectroscopic techniques in the characterization and monitoring of nom with the rapid development of molecular spectroscopic techniques it is highly possible to broaden their applications to a wider field relating to nom for instance they may be used to study environmental interaction between nom and emerging contaminants such as dbps and endocrine disrupting chemicals moreover combination of spectroscopy with other characterizing techniques such as sec ms and nmr is promising to offer a more comprehensive insight into the functional and structural features of nom and their variation in environmental processes molecular spectroscopy coupled with chemometric methods provides more accurate information on the origin quality and diversity of nom and more clearly elucidates the underlying mechanisms resulting in the observed changes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17242,eutrophication is caused by excess nitrate and other nutrient exported via stormwater runoff to surface waters which is projected to increase as a result of climate change despite recent increases in the implementation of stormwater control measures scm nutrient export has not abated indicating poor or inconsistent removal capacities of scm for nitrate however the cause of the variability is unclear we show that both design and local climate can explain nitrate removal variability by critically analyzing data reported on the international bmp database for nitrate removal by four common types of scm bioretention cells grass swales media filters and retention ponds the relative importance of climate or design on nitrate removal depends on the scm type nitrate removal in grass swales and bioretention systems is more sensitive to local climate than design specifications whereas nitrate removal in the retention ponds is less sensitive to climate and more sensitive to design features such as vegetation and pond volume media filters without amendment have the least capacity compared to other scm types surveyed and their removal capacity was independent of the local climate adding amendments made up of carbon biomass iron based media or a mixture of these amendments can significantly improve nitrate removal the type of carbon biomass is also a factor since biochar does not appear to affect nitrate removal this analysis can help inform the selection of scm and modification of their design based on local and projected climate to maximize nitrate removal and minimize eutrophication graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification climate change water quality improvement eutrophication bmp design 1 introduction excess nutrients in stormwater from nonpoint sources cause eutrophication boeykens et al 2017 resulting in significant financial losses deegan et al 2012 dodds et al 2009 eutrophication is projected to get worse because of climate change michalak et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 to manage stormwater different stormwater control measures scm have been widely implemented bowles et al 2018 however the implementation of scm on a watershed scale has often not resulted in improved water quality lintern et al 2020 among many reasons lintern et al 2020 a wide variation in nitrate removal in all scm is a primary factor manka et al 2016 the cause of the wide variation is often attributed to inadequate design zhang et al 2020 or local climate blecken et al 2010 kratky et al 2017 for instance an increase in temperature and the frequency of high intensity rainfall events is projected to accelerate eutrophication ballard et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 currently scm is rarely designed based on local climate information or projected climate changes brudler et al 2016 kerkez et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a partly because it is not clear how nitrate removal is affected by the coupled effect of climate and design or whether any design modification could minimize the detrimental effect of changing climates on nitrate removal local climate conditions and the scm s design have been shown to affect the removal of some contaminants rippy 2015 roseen et al 2009 valtanen et al 2017b so it is expected they could also affect nitrate removal mcphillips and walter 2015 payne et al 2018 shrestha et al 2018 however the relative importance of these factors on nitrate removal is unknown in scm nitrate can be removed via abiotic processes such as ion exchange hu et al 2020 but such process is sensitive to chloride concentration samatya et al 2006 nitrate can adsorb on filter media with net positive surface charge hassapak et al 2015 mahdy et al 2008 ordonez et al 2020 yan et al 2016 but most media in biofilters have a net negative surface charge or become negatively charged after adsorption of organic carbon kaiser and guggenberger 2003 thus the contribution of these abiotic processes for nitrate removal is typically low nitrate is typically removed in scm via biotic processes such as denitrification mangum et al 2020 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra bu et al 2017 burgin and hamilton 2007 or by direct plant uptake morse et al 2018 fig 1 among these processes nitrate removal by dnra can be temporary as oxidation of ammonium by nitrifiers can produce nitrate payne et al 2014a payne et al 2014b rahman et al 2019 abiotic processes are governed by amendment types and quantity and the design configuration grebel et al 2013 mohanty et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 biotic processes are governed by fluctuations in ph dissolved oxygen and moisture content all factors influenced by the local climate these factors result in soil microbial community shifts glassman et al 2018 and changes in contaminant removal rates garfí et al 2012 the coupled effect of climate and design modifications may act as the main cause of the high nitrate removal variability in scm however to what extent climate or design factors contribute to nitrate removal uncertainty remains unclear gold et al 2019 schifman et al 2016 nitrate removal in scm fluctuates widely collins et al 2010a lopez ponnada et al 2020 manka et al 2016 tian et al 2019 and even a large scale implementation of scm has not lowered the nutrient loading to water bodies significantly lintern et al 2020 the cause of this wide variability has been difficult to attribute at a specific site but can be attributed to several factors first field scale scm are rarely monitored long enough to accurately measure their removal potential even in controlled laboratory studies bock et al 2015 davis et al 2001 nitrate removal varies widely second differences in design specifications such as hydraulic retention time mcphillips and walter 2015 usage of amendments morgan et al 2020 and configuration palmer et al 2013 wissler et al 2020 could lead to variable nitrate removal third the local climate may influence the rainfall intensity dry periods and temperature liao et al 2018 xie et al 2003 thus a variation in local climate could cause fluctuation in nitrate removal berger et al 2019 blecken et al 2007 mangangka et al 2015 however it is unclear if the combined effects of design and climate can improve or worsen nitrate removal tanner and kadlec 2013 previous reviews have investigated specific details of scm including the sources cycling process and fate and transport of nitrogen based nutrients nestler et al 2011 reisinger et al 2016 yang and lusk 2018 overall design collins et al 2010b the effect of media type and vegetation osman et al 2019 skorobogatov et al 2020 biotic and abiotic removal mechanisms burgin and hamilton 2007 lee et al 2009 tang et al 2020 and more recently the coupled effect of infiltration rate and design characteristics zhang et al 2020 while many articles have recognized the lack of studies examining the effect of climate gold et al 2019 yang and lusk 2018 and design factors osman et al 2019 on the performance of scm previous reviews have rarely compared the importance of either factor on nitrate removal in the most common scm the overall objective of this review is to evaluate the relative importance of climate and design on nitrate removal in scm this article compares the nitrate removal of four commonly used scm bioretention grass swales media filters and retention ponds based on field data reported on the bmp database from 1982 through 2018 combined with peer reviewed articles published before june 30 2020 by identifying the local climate of those scm based on köppen geiger climate classification we link nitrate removal capacity to local climate and design configurations we have analyzed the data against many design configurations that may affect nitrate removal in scm but we reported only selected configurations where sufficient data is available for statistical analysis table s1 the selected design configurations include the presence and depth of ponding saturated zone watershed area infiltration rate vegetation density amendment type length area to depth ratio and the presence of plastic linen 2 data collection and analysis method to analyze the effect of different climate and design variables on nitrate removal we used data from the bmp database updated by june 30 2020 the bmp database is an open access website initiated in cooperation between the usepa and asce clary et al 2011 based on the availability of sufficient data for statistical analysis we chose four stormwater control measures scm bioretention grass swale media filter and retention pond these scm have a unique design or configuration for the removal or release of nitrate table 1 although other types of scm can also remove nitrate the lack of sufficient nitrate data limited our analysis among types of scm surveyed bioretention systems are the most common which include bioretention and infiltration basins media filters permit rapid infiltration of stormwater through packed sand where pollutants can be removed by physiochemical filtration and adsorption sabiri et al 2017 media filters are mostly sand filters or sand mixed with soil to increase the hydraulic conductivity of native soil for the rapid infiltration of stormwater thus they are not optimized to remove dissolved nutrients due to the low adsorption capacity of sand and low hydraulic retention time bioswales include both grass swales and grass strips and they are common in the roadside environment they do not have many design considerations other than the slope length and depth of the depressed area bioretention systems can remove nitrate by filtration adsorption and biotransformation mechanisms davis et al 2006 kim et al 2003 palmer et al 2013 whereas grass swales can treat stormwater via sedimentation and filtration barrett et al 1998 deletic and fletcher 2006 stagge et al 2012 retention ponds include wetland basins and detention basins they are particularly useful to handle a large volume of stormwater and lower the peak flow thus the design factors for retention ponds include the depth or volume of the pond and the presence or absence of plants retention ponds can lower nitrate concentration by dilution photolysis and other reactions in an aqueous medium chrétien et al 2016 krometis et al 2009 but they can simultaneously increase nitrate concentration through nitrification and decomposition of organic matter bettez and groffman 2012 in this study we catalog all scm data based on their design specifications such as watershed area scm length volume internal water storage iws zone or submerged zone and its depth area depth of scm and hydraulic conductivity of filter media details in supplementary material we used köppen geiger climate classification because it reflects the biome distribution of each region beck et al 2018 köppen geiger classifies the climate into five main groups including tropical dry temperate continental and polar which are further divided into 30 sub types depending on local precipitation and temperature peel et al 2007 using the global positioning system gps coordinates of each scm from the bmp database we designated each scm surveyed to one of the köppen geiger climate categories to analyze the performance of each scm in removing nitrate we calculated the log removal of nitrate lrn as follows l r n t log 10 c e t c i t where ce and ci represent the concentration of nitrate in the effluent and influent respectively in a given day t the removal calculation assumes a steady state that is the influent concentration remains consistent or does not vary within the time scale of hydraulic residence time this assumption could introduce significant error particularly if the residence time is much longer than the sampling frequency thus a composite sample should be used to account for such fluctuation in influent concentration data without both influent and effluent for the given day was excluded from the analysis to verify the change in performance due to design we compared scm located near each other and within the same climate classification nitrate removal was compared using wilcoxon test where p values lower than 0 05 represent a statistical difference to provide mechanistic insight into the link between nitrate removal and bioretention system design results were analyzed from 29 peer reviewed studies these studies were collected from web of science based on keyword combinations of the terms nitrate and biofilters mesocosm or biofiltration the complete dataset used in the analysis is provided in an online open access repository figshare https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 13167608 v1 3 the extent of nitrate removal uncertainty in scm scm are expected to have different nitrate removal capacity because of a difference in their design configurations our analysis reveals that irrespective of scm types nitrate removal 95 percentile varied by two orders of magnitude ranging from net positive removal to net negative removal fig 2 a fluctuation in dissolved oxygen do concentration diurnally could affect denitrification however a lack of data on the variation of do in urban stormwater and corresponding changes in nitrate concentration prevented us from linking diurnal fluctuation in do with denitrification among the four scm types the retention pond has a net positive median log removal of nitrate 0 2 for all other scm types the median log removal is negative indicating they act as a source of nitrate in most cases the media filters perform the worst but they are also the most consistent among all scm types the removal performance of nitrate by media filters is similar p 0 05 to the removal performance of bioretention systems but statistically p 0 05 different compared to the removal performance by grass swales and retention ponds we attribute the wide variability of the nitrate removal to a difference in design and climate the rainfall intensity can vary widely between sampling events for the same scm which likely affects the nitrate loading and hydraulic retention time spieles and mitsch 1999 thereby varying the nitrate removal berger et al 2019 the variability of nitrate removal in grass swales could also be related to varying temperature and water salinity between seasons roseen et al 2009 as salinity could lower the abundance of denitrifiers von ahnen et al 2019 on the other hand these scm types may have different types of amendments kameyama et al 2016 vegetation flite iii et al 2001 shrestha et al 2018 and size that dictate residence time kjellin et al 2007 all these factors could add uncertainty to nitrate removal by these systems we evaluate the contribution of each factor separately in the following sections 4 extent to which climate affects nitrate removal in scm comparing the nitrate removal of scm to local climate we found that climate does not affect nitrate removal in some scm types fig 3 the result is in contrast to the results from previously published studies collings et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 for instance there is no significant p 0 05 difference between nitrate removal by bioretention systems in hot summer mediterranean and cold semi arid climate in contrast nitrate removal of grass swales in a humid tropical climate median log removal 0 23 is significantly p 0 05 better than the removal 0 35 in a warm summer humid continental climate in contrast to plants in other climates native plants in tropical climates are adapted to switch nitrogen sources based on precipitation patterns and thus are more efficient at removing nitrate houlton et al 2007 this probably explains why grass swales remove more nitrate in tropical climates than in any other climate condition irrespective of climate media filters exhibit a negative removal of nitrate in most climates indicating that adding media filters could potentially lead to an increase in nitrate pollution since media filters are typically made up of sand with aerobic features nitrate removal via most of the biological mechanisms is not feasible in aerobic conditions ammonium in stormwater can be rapidly oxidized to nitrate by nitrifiers and could explain the net negative removal of nitrate nitrification can occur within 0 7 h jin et al 2012 which is in the range of overall stormwater retention time in media filters thus ammonia oxidation can make filter media a net source of nitrate comparing the performance of different scm types under the same climate classification we found that some scm types are more efficient than others in removing nitrate fig 3 for instance in a cold semi arid climate a retention pond provides a median net positive 0 16 nitrate removal while the other three scm types exhibit net negative removal source of nitrate in this climate a combination of low annual precipitation less than 508 mm and low mean annual temperature collings et al 2020 could lead to low biological activity and explain low nitrate removal in contrast in humid subtropical climates grass swales and retention ponds show a net positive median removal of 0 23 and 0 19 respectively while warm and moist climates increase nitrate concentration due to organic matter decomposition bulseco et al 2019 joslin and wolfe 1993 luo et al 1999 cold climates retard denitrification collings et al 2020 denitrification rates can vary with the season due to a difference in mean water temperature denitrification is typically greatest in the spring and lowest in the summer and early autumn zhong et al 2010 a decrease in denitrification at low temperature can be compensated by an increase in hydraulic retention time wicke et al 2015 thus the climate can affect the extent to which a design modification is effective for nitrate removal in scm the ability of scm in removing nitrate is limited under high intensity rainfall when most of the runoff overflows the system or infiltrates at a faster rate thereby limiting reaction time in the scm in contrast rainfall promotes the leaching of n source from soil and favors nitrate uptake by plants mantelin and touraine 2004 in addition to rainfall intensity increasing the dry duration between rainfall events can improve the nitrate removal from trapped pore water berger et al 2019 norton et al 2017 consequently a longer antecedent dry period between rainfall events partially explains why nitrate removal in hot summer mediterranean climates is higher than the removal in a humid subtropical climate collectively these results indicate that climate can influence moisture content in scm and affect nitrate removal by biological processes 5 effect of scm design on nitrate removal to isolate the effect of specific design factors we selected scm under the same climate conditions from the bmp database and compared the nitrate removal between scm as a function of different design variables the analysis reveals specific design parameters that could change the scm performance from a net sink of nitrate to a net source 5 1 which design factors affect nitrate removal in retention ponds to isolate the effect of designs we compared nitrate removal between ponds within the same climate regions that differed by a single design factor due to the lack of available data for all climate regions our data analysis was possible for retention ponds located in 2 climate regions hot summer humid continental climate and humid subtropical climate our analysis reveals that nitrate removal in retention ponds varies based on the pond s depth vegetation density and watershed area fig 4 the removal decreases significantly p 0 01 when the depth of the pond increases from 0 3 m to 0 7 m an increase in depth limits mass transfer of nitrate to the reactive zone the interface between biofilm or sediment and water columns thereby decreasing nitrate removal cubas et al 2019 a low volume of water column per anoxic zone near sediments chen et al 2019b is critical for enhancing denitrification mayo 2020 this could make a shallow pond or wetland more effective in removing nitrate than deeper ponds chen et al 2019a an increase in vegetation density significantly p 0 05 increases the removal of nitrate in retention ponds showing that plants can play a critical role in nitrate removal vymazal 2020 plants boost denitrification by providing endogenous carbon through root exudates for root microbiome to get energy via denitrification wu et al 2017 and increasing the hydraulic retention time hrt by blocking the flow in the pond khan et al 2019 all of which could explain the positive effect of vegetation on nitrate removal in retention ponds the carbon released during decomposition of plant materials provides carbon source critical for nitrogen mineralization hooker and stark 2008 however plants detritus unless removed can also release nitrogen into water knops et al 2002 thus the pond should be maintained to prevent excessive accumulation of plant debris retention ponds located in smaller watershed areas also remove more nitrate than those located in larger watershed areas possibly because of the increase of nutrient loading in larger watersheds zhang et al 2019b our analysis reveals that a retention pond connected to a small watershed 5 2 10 5 m 2 removes nitrate whereas the pond connected to a larger watershed 1 75 10 6 m 2 exports nitrate we attribute the pond size dependent removal capacity to the increased loading of nitrate from larger watershed due to deposition and biodegradation of plant debris jani et al 2020 krometis et al 2009 and a faster exhaustion of pond capacity to remove nitrate in this case pre treatment of influent water by an algal pond could increase the overall nitrate removal mayo 2020 based on our prior analysis the nitrate removal capacity of retention ponds is nearly similar in all climates the design factor rather than climate explains the variability in the nitrate removal capacity of retention ponds 5 2 does grass swale length affect nitrate removal our analysis shows that nitrate removal by grass swales is highly sensitive to local climate conditions fig 5 grass swales remove nitrate only in humid subtropical climates and an increase in the length of a grass swale increases nitrate removal in other climates grass swales can become a source of nitrate although moisture is critical for plant health and may explain the nitrate removal variability many plants are remain healthy even in low soil water environments as a result of the plant s phenotype and physiological characteristics in humid subtropic climates a high decomposition rate of organic debris provides carbon source essential for dentification moisture carbon and nitrogen availably has been shown to increase abundance of microorganism responsible for denitrification attard et al 2011 shrewsbury et al 2016 high moisture content or a submerged layer in the soil is needed to create local anoxic conditions hsieh et al 2007 which can facilitate denitrification thus we speculated that soil conditions in subtropic climate is more favorable for denitrification than other dry climate because of soil moisture carbon and nitrogen abundance that shape the denitrifier communities in soil high variability in nitrate removal can be attributed to the difference in a contact time as the data shows that increasing the length of a grass swale in a humid subtropical climate increased nitrate removal however other unexplored design parameters such as centerline slope and vegetation cover can affect how long the stormwater is detained on the grass swale and hence their ability to remove nitrate wicke et al 2015 thus the length of the grass swale may not be the only key factor affecting nitrate removal 5 3 does flow rate affect nitrate removal in the media filter the flow rate through media filters can depend on rainfall intensity and watershed area an increase in these variables can lead to increases in the discharge rate or nitrogen loading to media filters we compared the nitrate removal of paired sand filters located in the same local climate based on the rational method q c i a which permits the calculation of the peak runoff q chin 2019 the precipitation i for the paired sand filters was assumed to be the same and the bmp database provided the impervious area e g equivalent to the runoff coefficient c and the watershed area a for each sand filter our analysis shows that media filters act as a net source of nitrate in all climates and flow conditions except in a humid subtropical climate with an average flow rate of 0 33 m3 min 1 fig 6 in humid subtropical climates low runoff volumes may cause a positive removal of nitrate but heavy precipitation could reduce the removal rates feng et al 2012 possibly because of a decrease in hydraulic retention time gottinger et al 2011 nakhla and farooq 2003 as media filters mainly consist of sand they have limited capacity to remove nitrate by adsorption or biotransformation furthermore oxidation of ammonium to nitrate landsman and davis 2018b can make the filter itself a source of nitrate leaching therefore filter media should not be used for nitrate removal from stormwater unless amendments are added to sand filters which can substantially increase nitrate removal palmer et al 2013 ulrich et al 2017 5 4 which design factors of bioretention systems are critical for total nitrogen removal for bioretention systems we analyzed total nitrogen tn instead of nitrate due to a lack of sufficient paired data in the bmp database that links design parameters with nitrate removal we compared the tn removal of paired bioretention systems that were located within the same local climate but differed in only one design factor we extracted the following data for the design parameters from published studies that analyzed the same bioretention systems reported on the bmp database the presence of internal water storage iws hunt et al 2006 or plastic linen li et al 2009 surface infiltration 0 13 or 0 15 mm h 1 and depth 0 3 or 0 6 m of the saturated submerged zone and surface infiltration brown and hunt 2008 and biofilter area to depth ratio of 230 or 480 brown and hunt 2012 our analysis shows that tn removal in bioretention systems can vary based on design factors but the presence of plastic linen and the depth of the saturated zone do not affect tn removal significantly fig 7 the presence of a saturated zone slightly improved log tn removal from 0 63 to 0 24 previous laboratory studies have demonstrated an improvement in nitrate removal by adding iws alikhani et al 2020 lopez ponnada et al 2020 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 zinger et al 2013 zinger et al 2020 iws typically helps maintain anoxic conditions ding et al 2019 and improves nitrate removal palmer et al 2013 it should be noted that in the presence of iws denitrification only accounts for 23 of nitrogen removal in bioretention systems norton et al 2017 and dnra may dominate nitrate removal in areas with rewetting occurrence friedl et al 2018 our analysis reveals that an increase in depth of iws from 0 3 m to 0 6 m did not significantly improve tn removal indicating an increase in nitrate removal is probably offset by a decrease in ammonium removal in the saturated layer a comparison of bioretention systems with area to depth ratios of 230 and 480 shows that an increase in bioretention area significantly improves tn removal possibly because the removal of particulate n occurs near the surface instead of the deep layer landsman and davis 2018a tn removal is highly sensitive to stormwater infiltration which is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of filter media an increase in retention time typically improves nitrate removal in bioretention systems alikhani et al 2020 berger et al 2019 ding et al 2019 lopez ponnada et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 our analysis shows that infiltration rates exceeding 0 15 cm h 1 rapidly decrease tn removal from net positive to negative hydraulic retention time typically increases with an increase in rainfall intensity or catchment area as both factors produce a larger runoff volume and reduce tn removal alikhani et al 2020 additionally rainfall patterns could affect the levels of dissolved organic carbon doc in stormwater lipczynska kochany 2018 and the infiltration rate through scm which would have further implications on nitrate removal fidel et al 2018 in summary bioretention systems should be designed with a greater area shallow submerged layer and a relatively small catchment area if possible 5 5 how does vegetation influence the removal of different n species nearly all scm types contains vegetation which can directly uptake dissolved nitrogen species such as nitrate and ammonium via roots parker and newstead 2014 wang et al 2012 the presence of vegetation typically increases the removal of nitrogen by more than 75 barron et al 2019 davis et al 2006 although some studies observed no benefits of plants palmer et al 2013 valtanen et al 2017a our analysis shows that the presence of vegetation mostly emergent macrophytes can significantly increase tn removal fig 8 but it does not affect the removal of nh4 no3 and total dissolved nitrogen tdn the discrepancy could be attributed to the soil ph as dnra can contribute to 18 of nitrate removal if soil ph is neutral or alkaline zhang et al 2015 in addition a lack of removal of nitrogen based compounds could also be attributed to the leaching of different n species from the fertilizer that may have been applied to maintain the plant health and to the complexities of nitrate uptake mechanisms in plants compost is often added to support plant growth which can leach nitrate shrestha et al 2018 in this case organic biomass such as woodchips bark mulch wood dust compost or biochar can be used to improve denitrification greenan et al 2009 he et al 2019 nitrate uptake capacity of a plant is sensitive to the functional properties of the transporters in roots density in the plasma membrane of root cells the surface and architecture of the root plants types root depth and leave density cardinale 2011 hallin et al 2015 morse et al 2018 noguero and lacombe 2016 because they all directly or indirectly influence nitrate assimilation pathways the nitrate assimilation pathway in plants occurs in three steps 1 nitrate uptake 2 nitrate reduction and 3 nitrate storage crawford and glass 1998 tischner 2000 first anionic nitrate in the soil is carried toward the root systems by bulk flow and actively transported across the plasma membrane roots use transporters crawford 1995 encoded by nrt1 low affinity or nrt2 high affinity genes that bind to nitrate and transport them through the plasma membrane of the root cells to the root symplast nitrate can either be utilized into amino acids or effluxed out of the cell by loading it into the xylem and the transporter cells translocate nitrate to the leave system where it is stored in the vacuole as nitrite furthermore previous studies have shown that higher biomass content in plant and microbial community diversity enhances nitrate removal rates deng et al 2020 wen et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 plant s root development depends on the presence of inorganic nitrogen e g nitrate and ammonium ph and redox potential conditions bloom et al 2002 which are likely to experience seasonal variability fatubarin and olojugba 2014 fernandes et al 2002 and affect microbial communities mellado vázquez et al 2019 thus root health plant species and their growth rate in different scm could affect nitrate removal to maintain charge balance during nitrate uptake a proton is transported into root cells as amendments can alter ph to affect plant uptake of nitrate revell et al 2012 they can indirectly affect the ability of the plant to uptake nitrate plants can also indirectly affect nitrate removal by altering the moisture content in the filter media via evapotranspiration and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil valtanen et al 2017a by root architecture wang et al 2020 the selection of plant types should be used as a design factor to increase nitrate removal 5 6 which amendments have maximum removal capacity nitrate removal by bioretention systems or filter media can be increased by the addition of amendments through literature review we divided amendments into five categories 1 no amendment only sand and or soil 2 organic amendments compost mulch bark and woodchips 3 media mixture a mix of three or more amendments including zeolite tire crumb printed paper fly ash bark and water treatment residuals 4 biochar 5 iron based amendments zero valent iron iron fillings iron oxide from water treatment residues our analysis shows that the median removal capacity of amendments decreases in the following order iron based media media mixture organic amendment biochar fig 9 compared to control no amendment iron based media media mixture and organic amendments removed significantly more nitrate p 0 05 whereas biochar offered no significant improvement in nitrate removal these results indicate that biochar may not necessarily improve nitrate removal although it may remove other n species such as n h 4 due to electrostatic adsorption based on the opposite surface charge between n h 4 and biochar hina et al 2015 vu et al 2017 bioretention systems with organic amendments remove significantly more p 0 05 nitrate than bioretention systems without amendment one possibility for high variability is the difference in the types of organic amendments used organic amendments typically provide dissolved organic carbon an electron donor to facilitate the reduction of nitrate chang et al 2018 pfenning and mcmahon 1997 however some organic amendments such as compost can also be a source of nitrate chahal et al 2016 thus the amendment should be carefully selected to ensure they do not contribute nitrate to effluent the addition of biochar to compost may decrease the leaching of nitrate from compost iqbal et al 2015b but such an alternative may not be enough to reduce the effluent nitrate concentration due to net export of nitrate shrestha et al 2018 our analysis revealed that the benefits of biochar on nitrate removal observed in laboratory studies may not be translated to field studies biochar rarely removes nitrate by adsorption due to a net negative surface charge iqbal et al 2015a however biochar can modify microbial activity and affect denitrification based on laboratory studies biochar can increase total nitrogen removal by increasing the enzyme activity and reduction of ammonium nitrogen but the extent of the enzyme activity depends on biochar feedstock and vegetation growth stage jing et al 2020 biochar addition can increase total nitrogen removal due to the higher mineralization of organic n to n h 4 and nox which is subsequently denitrified de rozari et al 2018 similarly the addition of biochar can slow down nitrate leaching from the biofilter and increase nitrate utilization by the denitrifying community berger et al 2019 our analysis indicates that the extent to which biochar can affect nitrate removal is limited in field conditions and biochar alone may not be an appropriate amendment for the removal of nitrate poor and mohamed 2020 iron based amendment shows significant improvement compared to any other amendments for nitrate removal several laboratory studies confirmed the advantage of iron based media for nitrate removal chen et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 the improvement can be attributed to several mechanisms including electrochemical reduction ligand complexation coupled microbial reduction of nitrate and iron oxidation and nitrate sorption onto precipitated metal oxides reddy et al 2014 scholz et al 2016 valencia et al 2020 westerhoff and james 2003 for instance oxidation of f e 0 to f e 2 releases two electrons that could assist the electrochemical reduction of n o 3 to n h 4 westerhoff 2003 ligand complexation can occur when f e i i i binds to nitrate to form a complex song et al 2017 although nitrate adsorption can be greatly reduced in the presence of other anions such as sulfate kalaruban et al 2016 some studies have shown that media mixtures e g mixtures of two or more amendments such as spongy iron with pine bark or zero valent iron powder with activated carbon can achieve more than 95 nitrate removal from stormwater runoff huang et al 2015 huno et al 2018 liu et al 2013 mixing iron amendments with biochar could help slow down the flow as well as increase the interactions between nitrate with iron amendment material thereby improving overall capacity tian et al 2019 even under extreme weather conditions 6 opportunities despite the challenges of variable performance scm are a cost effective method to protect natural water bodies and improve water quality and quantity future studies should explore the effect of climate by conducting field experiments with similar variables in different climate regions thus a collaboration between researchers from different institutions located in multiple climates could help design the experiments to evaluate the effect of climate long term monitoring of these systems in field conditions could help determine how future climate change extremes such as prolonged drought or high intensity storms can affect the performance of scm plants in stormwater biofilters can have a significant association with fungi that could affect nitrate utilization the fundamental process of nitrate uptake by fungi garrett and amy 1979 and plants crawford and glass 1998 have been explored separately in earlier studies however there is a lack of fundamental studies on the coexistence of fungi and plants in scm and their role in denitrification fochi et al 2017 beneficial interactions between biochar and fungi have been observed gujre et al 2020 this is particularly important because fungi have been shown to increase plant tolerance in high salinity and drought conditions martínez garcía et al 2017 fungi could facilitate nitrate uptake by actively transporting nitrate and by helping plants survive in harsh climates bücking and kafle 2015 future studies should explore whether and how the presence of fungi could increase nitrate removal in scm and how to increase the abundance of fungi in the system our analysis reveals that bioretention systems are not efficient at removing nitrate studies that optimize the design of bioretention systems related to media amendment selected vegetation and submerged layer controls would be helpful to gain further insight into these systems subsurface wetlands and a combination of retention ponds and bioretention systems may maximize nitrate removal due to the synergy between the removal mechanisms and added design flexibility saeed and sun 2012 by actively supplying electrons or inducing reducing conditions via an external power source charged by solar panels nitrate removal capacity may be enhanced particularly during the rainfall period yang et al 2019 however further cost benefit analysis should be performed to evaluate the feasibility of such approach although grass swales have poor performance in nitrate removal this control measure is widely used as roadside infrastructure due to its simplicity and low maintenance requirements stagge et al 2012 however no study to date has analyzed the effect of the local climate on the performance of grass swales future studies should examine the specific mechanisms by which local climate can affect nitrate removal in scm as the climate would affect the conditions and activities of plants and root microbes which in turn could affect biological nitrate removal in particular future studies should examine how scm can operate under different hydraulic conditions removes nitrate in different climate scenarios okaikue woodi et al 2020 furthermore local carbon dioxide and humidity are the driving force for plant evapotranspiration and water conductance respectively de boer et al 2011 patanè 2011 while evapotranspiration remains poorly understood in scm ebrahimian et al 2019 no study in the context of scm has shown how plants and local co2 levels may affect the performance of scm that contain plants climate change is expected to alter köppen geiger climate classification beck et al 2018 which was used in this study to evaluate the effect of climate on nitrate removal capacities of scm in some regions precipitation frequency or intensity is expected to increase tabari 2020 while other regions are expected to experience more drying duration between rainfall events hari et al 2020 the resulting changes in moisture content in scm and the loading of nitrate to scm are expected to affect nitrate removal berger et al 2019 he et al 2020 however scm are rarely designed to account for changes in these variables due to climatic changes yazdanfar and sharma 2015 our analysis shows that retention ponds can be more effective in treating high nitrate loading in regions with greater rainfall events through modification of the water depth and vegetation in the ponds the analysis also reveals that the nitrate removal capacity of bioretention systems the most commonly used scm is sensitive to changing climate the addition of specific amendments can increase their capacity in all climate conditions the analysis also shows specific design conditions that could improve nitrate removal because consistent moisture is needed to improve nitrate removal alternative innovative designs such as dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters could be used in a dry climate barron et al 2019 barron et al 2020 there is also a lack of mechanistic study on how climate conditions affect the denitrifying community in scm future studies should also evaluate whether climate conditions or amendments explain changes in the microbial community in scm 7 conclusions analysis of the performance of the four most common scm types from 60 locations listed in the bmp database reveals the following conclusions both climate and design affect the nitrate removal capacity of scm but the extent to which they are critical varies between scm types low efficiency of scm in removing nitrate could be mostly related to nitrification in oxic conditions and low efficiency of removal of nitrate in high flow conditions retention ponds provide the best nitrate removal rates partially because of the long residence time their removal is more sensitive to design than climate the shallow depth and smaller catchment area improve the nitrate removal capacity of retention ponds media filter sand filter mostly exports nitrate irrespective of the local climate or design specifications bioretention systems are highly unreliable for the removal of nitrate optimizing their design by adding submerged layers and amendments increasing the area to depth ratio and lowering the infiltration rates could significantly improve their nitrate removal capacity and make them resilient in different climates or seasons nitrate removal capacities of filter media or bioretention systems can be improved by adding amendments including organic biomass iron based media and media mixtures however biochar addition appears to provide no such benefits for nitrate removal to alleviate the detrimental effect of changing climate

17242,eutrophication is caused by excess nitrate and other nutrient exported via stormwater runoff to surface waters which is projected to increase as a result of climate change despite recent increases in the implementation of stormwater control measures scm nutrient export has not abated indicating poor or inconsistent removal capacities of scm for nitrate however the cause of the variability is unclear we show that both design and local climate can explain nitrate removal variability by critically analyzing data reported on the international bmp database for nitrate removal by four common types of scm bioretention cells grass swales media filters and retention ponds the relative importance of climate or design on nitrate removal depends on the scm type nitrate removal in grass swales and bioretention systems is more sensitive to local climate than design specifications whereas nitrate removal in the retention ponds is less sensitive to climate and more sensitive to design features such as vegetation and pond volume media filters without amendment have the least capacity compared to other scm types surveyed and their removal capacity was independent of the local climate adding amendments made up of carbon biomass iron based media or a mixture of these amendments can significantly improve nitrate removal the type of carbon biomass is also a factor since biochar does not appear to affect nitrate removal this analysis can help inform the selection of scm and modification of their design based on local and projected climate to maximize nitrate removal and minimize eutrophication graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification climate change water quality improvement eutrophication bmp design 1 introduction excess nutrients in stormwater from nonpoint sources cause eutrophication boeykens et al 2017 resulting in significant financial losses deegan et al 2012 dodds et al 2009 eutrophication is projected to get worse because of climate change michalak et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 to manage stormwater different stormwater control measures scm have been widely implemented bowles et al 2018 however the implementation of scm on a watershed scale has often not resulted in improved water quality lintern et al 2020 among many reasons lintern et al 2020 a wide variation in nitrate removal in all scm is a primary factor manka et al 2016 the cause of the wide variation is often attributed to inadequate design zhang et al 2020 or local climate blecken et al 2010 kratky et al 2017 for instance an increase in temperature and the frequency of high intensity rainfall events is projected to accelerate eutrophication ballard et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 currently scm is rarely designed based on local climate information or projected climate changes brudler et al 2016 kerkez et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a partly because it is not clear how nitrate removal is affected by the coupled effect of climate and design or whether any design modification could minimize the detrimental effect of changing climates on nitrate removal local climate conditions and the scm s design have been shown to affect the removal of some contaminants rippy 2015 roseen et al 2009 valtanen et al 2017b so it is expected they could also affect nitrate removal mcphillips and walter 2015 payne et al 2018 shrestha et al 2018 however the relative importance of these factors on nitrate removal is unknown in scm nitrate can be removed via abiotic processes such as ion exchange hu et al 2020 but such process is sensitive to chloride concentration samatya et al 2006 nitrate can adsorb on filter media with net positive surface charge hassapak et al 2015 mahdy et al 2008 ordonez et al 2020 yan et al 2016 but most media in biofilters have a net negative surface charge or become negatively charged after adsorption of organic carbon kaiser and guggenberger 2003 thus the contribution of these abiotic processes for nitrate removal is typically low nitrate is typically removed in scm via biotic processes such as denitrification mangum et al 2020 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra bu et al 2017 burgin and hamilton 2007 or by direct plant uptake morse et al 2018 fig 1 among these processes nitrate removal by dnra can be temporary as oxidation of ammonium by nitrifiers can produce nitrate payne et al 2014a payne et al 2014b rahman et al 2019 abiotic processes are governed by amendment types and quantity and the design configuration grebel et al 2013 mohanty et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 biotic processes are governed by fluctuations in ph dissolved oxygen and moisture content all factors influenced by the local climate these factors result in soil microbial community shifts glassman et al 2018 and changes in contaminant removal rates garfí et al 2012 the coupled effect of climate and design modifications may act as the main cause of the high nitrate removal variability in scm however to what extent climate or design factors contribute to nitrate removal uncertainty remains unclear gold et al 2019 schifman et al 2016 nitrate removal in scm fluctuates widely collins et al 2010a lopez ponnada et al 2020 manka et al 2016 tian et al 2019 and even a large scale implementation of scm has not lowered the nutrient loading to water bodies significantly lintern et al 2020 the cause of this wide variability has been difficult to attribute at a specific site but can be attributed to several factors first field scale scm are rarely monitored long enough to accurately measure their removal potential even in controlled laboratory studies bock et al 2015 davis et al 2001 nitrate removal varies widely second differences in design specifications such as hydraulic retention time mcphillips and walter 2015 usage of amendments morgan et al 2020 and configuration palmer et al 2013 wissler et al 2020 could lead to variable nitrate removal third the local climate may influence the rainfall intensity dry periods and temperature liao et al 2018 xie et al 2003 thus a variation in local climate could cause fluctuation in nitrate removal berger et al 2019 blecken et al 2007 mangangka et al 2015 however it is unclear if the combined effects of design and climate can improve or worsen nitrate removal tanner and kadlec 2013 previous reviews have investigated specific details of scm including the sources cycling process and fate and transport of nitrogen based nutrients nestler et al 2011 reisinger et al 2016 yang and lusk 2018 overall design collins et al 2010b the effect of media type and vegetation osman et al 2019 skorobogatov et al 2020 biotic and abiotic removal mechanisms burgin and hamilton 2007 lee et al 2009 tang et al 2020 and more recently the coupled effect of infiltration rate and design characteristics zhang et al 2020 while many articles have recognized the lack of studies examining the effect of climate gold et al 2019 yang and lusk 2018 and design factors osman et al 2019 on the performance of scm previous reviews have rarely compared the importance of either factor on nitrate removal in the most common scm the overall objective of this review is to evaluate the relative importance of climate and design on nitrate removal in scm this article compares the nitrate removal of four commonly used scm bioretention grass swales media filters and retention ponds based on field data reported on the bmp database from 1982 through 2018 combined with peer reviewed articles published before june 30 2020 by identifying the local climate of those scm based on köppen geiger climate classification we link nitrate removal capacity to local climate and design configurations we have analyzed the data against many design configurations that may affect nitrate removal in scm but we reported only selected configurations where sufficient data is available for statistical analysis table s1 the selected design configurations include the presence and depth of ponding saturated zone watershed area infiltration rate vegetation density amendment type length area to depth ratio and the presence of plastic linen 2 data collection and analysis method to analyze the effect of different climate and design variables on nitrate removal we used data from the bmp database updated by june 30 2020 the bmp database is an open access website initiated in cooperation between the usepa and asce clary et al 2011 based on the availability of sufficient data for statistical analysis we chose four stormwater control measures scm bioretention grass swale media filter and retention pond these scm have a unique design or configuration for the removal or release of nitrate table 1 although other types of scm can also remove nitrate the lack of sufficient nitrate data limited our analysis among types of scm surveyed bioretention systems are the most common which include bioretention and infiltration basins media filters permit rapid infiltration of stormwater through packed sand where pollutants can be removed by physiochemical filtration and adsorption sabiri et al 2017 media filters are mostly sand filters or sand mixed with soil to increase the hydraulic conductivity of native soil for the rapid infiltration of stormwater thus they are not optimized to remove dissolved nutrients due to the low adsorption capacity of sand and low hydraulic retention time bioswales include both grass swales and grass strips and they are common in the roadside environment they do not have many design considerations other than the slope length and depth of the depressed area bioretention systems can remove nitrate by filtration adsorption and biotransformation mechanisms davis et al 2006 kim et al 2003 palmer et al 2013 whereas grass swales can treat stormwater via sedimentation and filtration barrett et al 1998 deletic and fletcher 2006 stagge et al 2012 retention ponds include wetland basins and detention basins they are particularly useful to handle a large volume of stormwater and lower the peak flow thus the design factors for retention ponds include the depth or volume of the pond and the presence or absence of plants retention ponds can lower nitrate concentration by dilution photolysis and other reactions in an aqueous medium chrétien et al 2016 krometis et al 2009 but they can simultaneously increase nitrate concentration through nitrification and decomposition of organic matter bettez and groffman 2012 in this study we catalog all scm data based on their design specifications such as watershed area scm length volume internal water storage iws zone or submerged zone and its depth area depth of scm and hydraulic conductivity of filter media details in supplementary material we used köppen geiger climate classification because it reflects the biome distribution of each region beck et al 2018 köppen geiger classifies the climate into five main groups including tropical dry temperate continental and polar which are further divided into 30 sub types depending on local precipitation and temperature peel et al 2007 using the global positioning system gps coordinates of each scm from the bmp database we designated each scm surveyed to one of the köppen geiger climate categories to analyze the performance of each scm in removing nitrate we calculated the log removal of nitrate lrn as follows l r n t log 10 c e t c i t where ce and ci represent the concentration of nitrate in the effluent and influent respectively in a given day t the removal calculation assumes a steady state that is the influent concentration remains consistent or does not vary within the time scale of hydraulic residence time this assumption could introduce significant error particularly if the residence time is much longer than the sampling frequency thus a composite sample should be used to account for such fluctuation in influent concentration data without both influent and effluent for the given day was excluded from the analysis to verify the change in performance due to design we compared scm located near each other and within the same climate classification nitrate removal was compared using wilcoxon test where p values lower than 0 05 represent a statistical difference to provide mechanistic insight into the link between nitrate removal and bioretention system design results were analyzed from 29 peer reviewed studies these studies were collected from web of science based on keyword combinations of the terms nitrate and biofilters mesocosm or biofiltration the complete dataset used in the analysis is provided in an online open access repository figshare https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 13167608 v1 3 the extent of nitrate removal uncertainty in scm scm are expected to have different nitrate removal capacity because of a difference in their design configurations our analysis reveals that irrespective of scm types nitrate removal 95 percentile varied by two orders of magnitude ranging from net positive removal to net negative removal fig 2 a fluctuation in dissolved oxygen do concentration diurnally could affect denitrification however a lack of data on the variation of do in urban stormwater and corresponding changes in nitrate concentration prevented us from linking diurnal fluctuation in do with denitrification among the four scm types the retention pond has a net positive median log removal of nitrate 0 2 for all other scm types the median log removal is negative indicating they act as a source of nitrate in most cases the media filters perform the worst but they are also the most consistent among all scm types the removal performance of nitrate by media filters is similar p 0 05 to the removal performance of bioretention systems but statistically p 0 05 different compared to the removal performance by grass swales and retention ponds we attribute the wide variability of the nitrate removal to a difference in design and climate the rainfall intensity can vary widely between sampling events for the same scm which likely affects the nitrate loading and hydraulic retention time spieles and mitsch 1999 thereby varying the nitrate removal berger et al 2019 the variability of nitrate removal in grass swales could also be related to varying temperature and water salinity between seasons roseen et al 2009 as salinity could lower the abundance of denitrifiers von ahnen et al 2019 on the other hand these scm types may have different types of amendments kameyama et al 2016 vegetation flite iii et al 2001 shrestha et al 2018 and size that dictate residence time kjellin et al 2007 all these factors could add uncertainty to nitrate removal by these systems we evaluate the contribution of each factor separately in the following sections 4 extent to which climate affects nitrate removal in scm comparing the nitrate removal of scm to local climate we found that climate does not affect nitrate removal in some scm types fig 3 the result is in contrast to the results from previously published studies collings et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 for instance there is no significant p 0 05 difference between nitrate removal by bioretention systems in hot summer mediterranean and cold semi arid climate in contrast nitrate removal of grass swales in a humid tropical climate median log removal 0 23 is significantly p 0 05 better than the removal 0 35 in a warm summer humid continental climate in contrast to plants in other climates native plants in tropical climates are adapted to switch nitrogen sources based on precipitation patterns and thus are more efficient at removing nitrate houlton et al 2007 this probably explains why grass swales remove more nitrate in tropical climates than in any other climate condition irrespective of climate media filters exhibit a negative removal of nitrate in most climates indicating that adding media filters could potentially lead to an increase in nitrate pollution since media filters are typically made up of sand with aerobic features nitrate removal via most of the biological mechanisms is not feasible in aerobic conditions ammonium in stormwater can be rapidly oxidized to nitrate by nitrifiers and could explain the net negative removal of nitrate nitrification can occur within 0 7 h jin et al 2012 which is in the range of overall stormwater retention time in media filters thus ammonia oxidation can make filter media a net source of nitrate comparing the performance of different scm types under the same climate classification we found that some scm types are more efficient than others in removing nitrate fig 3 for instance in a cold semi arid climate a retention pond provides a median net positive 0 16 nitrate removal while the other three scm types exhibit net negative removal source of nitrate in this climate a combination of low annual precipitation less than 508 mm and low mean annual temperature collings et al 2020 could lead to low biological activity and explain low nitrate removal in contrast in humid subtropical climates grass swales and retention ponds show a net positive median removal of 0 23 and 0 19 respectively while warm and moist climates increase nitrate concentration due to organic matter decomposition bulseco et al 2019 joslin and wolfe 1993 luo et al 1999 cold climates retard denitrification collings et al 2020 denitrification rates can vary with the season due to a difference in mean water temperature denitrification is typically greatest in the spring and lowest in the summer and early autumn zhong et al 2010 a decrease in denitrification at low temperature can be compensated by an increase in hydraulic retention time wicke et al 2015 thus the climate can affect the extent to which a design modification is effective for nitrate removal in scm the ability of scm in removing nitrate is limited under high intensity rainfall when most of the runoff overflows the system or infiltrates at a faster rate thereby limiting reaction time in the scm in contrast rainfall promotes the leaching of n source from soil and favors nitrate uptake by plants mantelin and touraine 2004 in addition to rainfall intensity increasing the dry duration between rainfall events can improve the nitrate removal from trapped pore water berger et al 2019 norton et al 2017 consequently a longer antecedent dry period between rainfall events partially explains why nitrate removal in hot summer mediterranean climates is higher than the removal in a humid subtropical climate collectively these results indicate that climate can influence moisture content in scm and affect nitrate removal by biological processes 5 effect of scm design on nitrate removal to isolate the effect of specific design factors we selected scm under the same climate conditions from the bmp database and compared the nitrate removal between scm as a function of different design variables the analysis reveals specific design parameters that could change the scm performance from a net sink of nitrate to a net source 5 1 which design factors affect nitrate removal in retention ponds to isolate the effect of designs we compared nitrate removal between ponds within the same climate regions that differed by a single design factor due to the lack of available data for all climate regions our data analysis was possible for retention ponds located in 2 climate regions hot summer humid continental climate and humid subtropical climate our analysis reveals that nitrate removal in retention ponds varies based on the pond s depth vegetation density and watershed area fig 4 the removal decreases significantly p 0 01 when the depth of the pond increases from 0 3 m to 0 7 m an increase in depth limits mass transfer of nitrate to the reactive zone the interface between biofilm or sediment and water columns thereby decreasing nitrate removal cubas et al 2019 a low volume of water column per anoxic zone near sediments chen et al 2019b is critical for enhancing denitrification mayo 2020 this could make a shallow pond or wetland more effective in removing nitrate than deeper ponds chen et al 2019a an increase in vegetation density significantly p 0 05 increases the removal of nitrate in retention ponds showing that plants can play a critical role in nitrate removal vymazal 2020 plants boost denitrification by providing endogenous carbon through root exudates for root microbiome to get energy via denitrification wu et al 2017 and increasing the hydraulic retention time hrt by blocking the flow in the pond khan et al 2019 all of which could explain the positive effect of vegetation on nitrate removal in retention ponds the carbon released during decomposition of plant materials provides carbon source critical for nitrogen mineralization hooker and stark 2008 however plants detritus unless removed can also release nitrogen into water knops et al 2002 thus the pond should be maintained to prevent excessive accumulation of plant debris retention ponds located in smaller watershed areas also remove more nitrate than those located in larger watershed areas possibly because of the increase of nutrient loading in larger watersheds zhang et al 2019b our analysis reveals that a retention pond connected to a small watershed 5 2 10 5 m 2 removes nitrate whereas the pond connected to a larger watershed 1 75 10 6 m 2 exports nitrate we attribute the pond size dependent removal capacity to the increased loading of nitrate from larger watershed due to deposition and biodegradation of plant debris jani et al 2020 krometis et al 2009 and a faster exhaustion of pond capacity to remove nitrate in this case pre treatment of influent water by an algal pond could increase the overall nitrate removal mayo 2020 based on our prior analysis the nitrate removal capacity of retention ponds is nearly similar in all climates the design factor rather than climate explains the variability in the nitrate removal capacity of retention ponds 5 2 does grass swale length affect nitrate removal our analysis shows that nitrate removal by grass swales is highly sensitive to local climate conditions fig 5 grass swales remove nitrate only in humid subtropical climates and an increase in the length of a grass swale increases nitrate removal in other climates grass swales can become a source of nitrate although moisture is critical for plant health and may explain the nitrate removal variability many plants are remain healthy even in low soil water environments as a result of the plant s phenotype and physiological characteristics in humid subtropic climates a high decomposition rate of organic debris provides carbon source essential for dentification moisture carbon and nitrogen availably has been shown to increase abundance of microorganism responsible for denitrification attard et al 2011 shrewsbury et al 2016 high moisture content or a submerged layer in the soil is needed to create local anoxic conditions hsieh et al 2007 which can facilitate denitrification thus we speculated that soil conditions in subtropic climate is more favorable for denitrification than other dry climate because of soil moisture carbon and nitrogen abundance that shape the denitrifier communities in soil high variability in nitrate removal can be attributed to the difference in a contact time as the data shows that increasing the length of a grass swale in a humid subtropical climate increased nitrate removal however other unexplored design parameters such as centerline slope and vegetation cover can affect how long the stormwater is detained on the grass swale and hence their ability to remove nitrate wicke et al 2015 thus the length of the grass swale may not be the only key factor affecting nitrate removal 5 3 does flow rate affect nitrate removal in the media filter the flow rate through media filters can depend on rainfall intensity and watershed area an increase in these variables can lead to increases in the discharge rate or nitrogen loading to media filters we compared the nitrate removal of paired sand filters located in the same local climate based on the rational method q c i a which permits the calculation of the peak runoff q chin 2019 the precipitation i for the paired sand filters was assumed to be the same and the bmp database provided the impervious area e g equivalent to the runoff coefficient c and the watershed area a for each sand filter our analysis shows that media filters act as a net source of nitrate in all climates and flow conditions except in a humid subtropical climate with an average flow rate of 0 33 m3 min 1 fig 6 in humid subtropical climates low runoff volumes may cause a positive removal of nitrate but heavy precipitation could reduce the removal rates feng et al 2012 possibly because of a decrease in hydraulic retention time gottinger et al 2011 nakhla and farooq 2003 as media filters mainly consist of sand they have limited capacity to remove nitrate by adsorption or biotransformation furthermore oxidation of ammonium to nitrate landsman and davis 2018b can make the filter itself a source of nitrate leaching therefore filter media should not be used for nitrate removal from stormwater unless amendments are added to sand filters which can substantially increase nitrate removal palmer et al 2013 ulrich et al 2017 5 4 which design factors of bioretention systems are critical for total nitrogen removal for bioretention systems we analyzed total nitrogen tn instead of nitrate due to a lack of sufficient paired data in the bmp database that links design parameters with nitrate removal we compared the tn removal of paired bioretention systems that were located within the same local climate but differed in only one design factor we extracted the following data for the design parameters from published studies that analyzed the same bioretention systems reported on the bmp database the presence of internal water storage iws hunt et al 2006 or plastic linen li et al 2009 surface infiltration 0 13 or 0 15 mm h 1 and depth 0 3 or 0 6 m of the saturated submerged zone and surface infiltration brown and hunt 2008 and biofilter area to depth ratio of 230 or 480 brown and hunt 2012 our analysis shows that tn removal in bioretention systems can vary based on design factors but the presence of plastic linen and the depth of the saturated zone do not affect tn removal significantly fig 7 the presence of a saturated zone slightly improved log tn removal from 0 63 to 0 24 previous laboratory studies have demonstrated an improvement in nitrate removal by adding iws alikhani et al 2020 lopez ponnada et al 2020 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 zinger et al 2013 zinger et al 2020 iws typically helps maintain anoxic conditions ding et al 2019 and improves nitrate removal palmer et al 2013 it should be noted that in the presence of iws denitrification only accounts for 23 of nitrogen removal in bioretention systems norton et al 2017 and dnra may dominate nitrate removal in areas with rewetting occurrence friedl et al 2018 our analysis reveals that an increase in depth of iws from 0 3 m to 0 6 m did not significantly improve tn removal indicating an increase in nitrate removal is probably offset by a decrease in ammonium removal in the saturated layer a comparison of bioretention systems with area to depth ratios of 230 and 480 shows that an increase in bioretention area significantly improves tn removal possibly because the removal of particulate n occurs near the surface instead of the deep layer landsman and davis 2018a tn removal is highly sensitive to stormwater infiltration which is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of filter media an increase in retention time typically improves nitrate removal in bioretention systems alikhani et al 2020 berger et al 2019 ding et al 2019 lopez ponnada et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 our analysis shows that infiltration rates exceeding 0 15 cm h 1 rapidly decrease tn removal from net positive to negative hydraulic retention time typically increases with an increase in rainfall intensity or catchment area as both factors produce a larger runoff volume and reduce tn removal alikhani et al 2020 additionally rainfall patterns could affect the levels of dissolved organic carbon doc in stormwater lipczynska kochany 2018 and the infiltration rate through scm which would have further implications on nitrate removal fidel et al 2018 in summary bioretention systems should be designed with a greater area shallow submerged layer and a relatively small catchment area if possible 5 5 how does vegetation influence the removal of different n species nearly all scm types contains vegetation which can directly uptake dissolved nitrogen species such as nitrate and ammonium via roots parker and newstead 2014 wang et al 2012 the presence of vegetation typically increases the removal of nitrogen by more than 75 barron et al 2019 davis et al 2006 although some studies observed no benefits of plants palmer et al 2013 valtanen et al 2017a our analysis shows that the presence of vegetation mostly emergent macrophytes can significantly increase tn removal fig 8 but it does not affect the removal of nh4 no3 and total dissolved nitrogen tdn the discrepancy could be attributed to the soil ph as dnra can contribute to 18 of nitrate removal if soil ph is neutral or alkaline zhang et al 2015 in addition a lack of removal of nitrogen based compounds could also be attributed to the leaching of different n species from the fertilizer that may have been applied to maintain the plant health and to the complexities of nitrate uptake mechanisms in plants compost is often added to support plant growth which can leach nitrate shrestha et al 2018 in this case organic biomass such as woodchips bark mulch wood dust compost or biochar can be used to improve denitrification greenan et al 2009 he et al 2019 nitrate uptake capacity of a plant is sensitive to the functional properties of the transporters in roots density in the plasma membrane of root cells the surface and architecture of the root plants types root depth and leave density cardinale 2011 hallin et al 2015 morse et al 2018 noguero and lacombe 2016 because they all directly or indirectly influence nitrate assimilation pathways the nitrate assimilation pathway in plants occurs in three steps 1 nitrate uptake 2 nitrate reduction and 3 nitrate storage crawford and glass 1998 tischner 2000 first anionic nitrate in the soil is carried toward the root systems by bulk flow and actively transported across the plasma membrane roots use transporters crawford 1995 encoded by nrt1 low affinity or nrt2 high affinity genes that bind to nitrate and transport them through the plasma membrane of the root cells to the root symplast nitrate can either be utilized into amino acids or effluxed out of the cell by loading it into the xylem and the transporter cells translocate nitrate to the leave system where it is stored in the vacuole as nitrite furthermore previous studies have shown that higher biomass content in plant and microbial community diversity enhances nitrate removal rates deng et al 2020 wen et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 plant s root development depends on the presence of inorganic nitrogen e g nitrate and ammonium ph and redox potential conditions bloom et al 2002 which are likely to experience seasonal variability fatubarin and olojugba 2014 fernandes et al 2002 and affect microbial communities mellado vázquez et al 2019 thus root health plant species and their growth rate in different scm could affect nitrate removal to maintain charge balance during nitrate uptake a proton is transported into root cells as amendments can alter ph to affect plant uptake of nitrate revell et al 2012 they can indirectly affect the ability of the plant to uptake nitrate plants can also indirectly affect nitrate removal by altering the moisture content in the filter media via evapotranspiration and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil valtanen et al 2017a by root architecture wang et al 2020 the selection of plant types should be used as a design factor to increase nitrate removal 5 6 which amendments have maximum removal capacity nitrate removal by bioretention systems or filter media can be increased by the addition of amendments through literature review we divided amendments into five categories 1 no amendment only sand and or soil 2 organic amendments compost mulch bark and woodchips 3 media mixture a mix of three or more amendments including zeolite tire crumb printed paper fly ash bark and water treatment residuals 4 biochar 5 iron based amendments zero valent iron iron fillings iron oxide from water treatment residues our analysis shows that the median removal capacity of amendments decreases in the following order iron based media media mixture organic amendment biochar fig 9 compared to control no amendment iron based media media mixture and organic amendments removed significantly more nitrate p 0 05 whereas biochar offered no significant improvement in nitrate removal these results indicate that biochar may not necessarily improve nitrate removal although it may remove other n species such as n h 4 due to electrostatic adsorption based on the opposite surface charge between n h 4 and biochar hina et al 2015 vu et al 2017 bioretention systems with organic amendments remove significantly more p 0 05 nitrate than bioretention systems without amendment one possibility for high variability is the difference in the types of organic amendments used organic amendments typically provide dissolved organic carbon an electron donor to facilitate the reduction of nitrate chang et al 2018 pfenning and mcmahon 1997 however some organic amendments such as compost can also be a source of nitrate chahal et al 2016 thus the amendment should be carefully selected to ensure they do not contribute nitrate to effluent the addition of biochar to compost may decrease the leaching of nitrate from compost iqbal et al 2015b but such an alternative may not be enough to reduce the effluent nitrate concentration due to net export of nitrate shrestha et al 2018 our analysis revealed that the benefits of biochar on nitrate removal observed in laboratory studies may not be translated to field studies biochar rarely removes nitrate by adsorption due to a net negative surface charge iqbal et al 2015a however biochar can modify microbial activity and affect denitrification based on laboratory studies biochar can increase total nitrogen removal by increasing the enzyme activity and reduction of ammonium nitrogen but the extent of the enzyme activity depends on biochar feedstock and vegetation growth stage jing et al 2020 biochar addition can increase total nitrogen removal due to the higher mineralization of organic n to n h 4 and nox which is subsequently denitrified de rozari et al 2018 similarly the addition of biochar can slow down nitrate leaching from the biofilter and increase nitrate utilization by the denitrifying community berger et al 2019 our analysis indicates that the extent to which biochar can affect nitrate removal is limited in field conditions and biochar alone may not be an appropriate amendment for the removal of nitrate poor and mohamed 2020 iron based amendment shows significant improvement compared to any other amendments for nitrate removal several laboratory studies confirmed the advantage of iron based media for nitrate removal chen et al 2020 shrestha et al 2018 the improvement can be attributed to several mechanisms including electrochemical reduction ligand complexation coupled microbial reduction of nitrate and iron oxidation and nitrate sorption onto precipitated metal oxides reddy et al 2014 scholz et al 2016 valencia et al 2020 westerhoff and james 2003 for instance oxidation of f e 0 to f e 2 releases two electrons that could assist the electrochemical reduction of n o 3 to n h 4 westerhoff 2003 ligand complexation can occur when f e i i i binds to nitrate to form a complex song et al 2017 although nitrate adsorption can be greatly reduced in the presence of other anions such as sulfate kalaruban et al 2016 some studies have shown that media mixtures e g mixtures of two or more amendments such as spongy iron with pine bark or zero valent iron powder with activated carbon can achieve more than 95 nitrate removal from stormwater runoff huang et al 2015 huno et al 2018 liu et al 2013 mixing iron amendments with biochar could help slow down the flow as well as increase the interactions between nitrate with iron amendment material thereby improving overall capacity tian et al 2019 even under extreme weather conditions 6 opportunities despite the challenges of variable performance scm are a cost effective method to protect natural water bodies and improve water quality and quantity future studies should explore the effect of climate by conducting field experiments with similar variables in different climate regions thus a collaboration between researchers from different institutions located in multiple climates could help design the experiments to evaluate the effect of climate long term monitoring of these systems in field conditions could help determine how future climate change extremes such as prolonged drought or high intensity storms can affect the performance of scm plants in stormwater biofilters can have a significant association with fungi that could affect nitrate utilization the fundamental process of nitrate uptake by fungi garrett and amy 1979 and plants crawford and glass 1998 have been explored separately in earlier studies however there is a lack of fundamental studies on the coexistence of fungi and plants in scm and their role in denitrification fochi et al 2017 beneficial interactions between biochar and fungi have been observed gujre et al 2020 this is particularly important because fungi have been shown to increase plant tolerance in high salinity and drought conditions martínez garcía et al 2017 fungi could facilitate nitrate uptake by actively transporting nitrate and by helping plants survive in harsh climates bücking and kafle 2015 future studies should explore whether and how the presence of fungi could increase nitrate removal in scm and how to increase the abundance of fungi in the system our analysis reveals that bioretention systems are not efficient at removing nitrate studies that optimize the design of bioretention systems related to media amendment selected vegetation and submerged layer controls would be helpful to gain further insight into these systems subsurface wetlands and a combination of retention ponds and bioretention systems may maximize nitrate removal due to the synergy between the removal mechanisms and added design flexibility saeed and sun 2012 by actively supplying electrons or inducing reducing conditions via an external power source charged by solar panels nitrate removal capacity may be enhanced particularly during the rainfall period yang et al 2019 however further cost benefit analysis should be performed to evaluate the feasibility of such approach although grass swales have poor performance in nitrate removal this control measure is widely used as roadside infrastructure due to its simplicity and low maintenance requirements stagge et al 2012 however no study to date has analyzed the effect of the local climate on the performance of grass swales future studies should examine the specific mechanisms by which local climate can affect nitrate removal in scm as the climate would affect the conditions and activities of plants and root microbes which in turn could affect biological nitrate removal in particular future studies should examine how scm can operate under different hydraulic conditions removes nitrate in different climate scenarios okaikue woodi et al 2020 furthermore local carbon dioxide and humidity are the driving force for plant evapotranspiration and water conductance respectively de boer et al 2011 patanè 2011 while evapotranspiration remains poorly understood in scm ebrahimian et al 2019 no study in the context of scm has shown how plants and local co2 levels may affect the performance of scm that contain plants climate change is expected to alter köppen geiger climate classification beck et al 2018 which was used in this study to evaluate the effect of climate on nitrate removal capacities of scm in some regions precipitation frequency or intensity is expected to increase tabari 2020 while other regions are expected to experience more drying duration between rainfall events hari et al 2020 the resulting changes in moisture content in scm and the loading of nitrate to scm are expected to affect nitrate removal berger et al 2019 he et al 2020 however scm are rarely designed to account for changes in these variables due to climatic changes yazdanfar and sharma 2015 our analysis shows that retention ponds can be more effective in treating high nitrate loading in regions with greater rainfall events through modification of the water depth and vegetation in the ponds the analysis also reveals that the nitrate removal capacity of bioretention systems the most commonly used scm is sensitive to changing climate the addition of specific amendments can increase their capacity in all climate conditions the analysis also shows specific design conditions that could improve nitrate removal because consistent moisture is needed to improve nitrate removal alternative innovative designs such as dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters could be used in a dry climate barron et al 2019 barron et al 2020 there is also a lack of mechanistic study on how climate conditions affect the denitrifying community in scm future studies should also evaluate whether climate conditions or amendments explain changes in the microbial community in scm 7 conclusions analysis of the performance of the four most common scm types from 60 locations listed in the bmp database reveals the following conclusions both climate and design affect the nitrate removal capacity of scm but the extent to which they are critical varies between scm types low efficiency of scm in removing nitrate could be mostly related to nitrification in oxic conditions and low efficiency of removal of nitrate in high flow conditions retention ponds provide the best nitrate removal rates partially because of the long residence time their removal is more sensitive to design than climate the shallow depth and smaller catchment area improve the nitrate removal capacity of retention ponds media filter sand filter mostly exports nitrate irrespective of the local climate or design specifications bioretention systems are highly unreliable for the removal of nitrate optimizing their design by adding submerged layers and amendments increasing the area to depth ratio and lowering the infiltration rates could significantly improve their nitrate removal capacity and make them resilient in different climates or seasons nitrate removal capacities of filter media or bioretention systems can be improved by adding amendments including organic biomass iron based media and media mixtures however biochar addition appears to provide no such benefits for nitrate removal to alleviate the detrimental effect of changing climate

17243,advanced oxidation processes aops based on hydroxyl radicals oh are the most important technologies for the removal of bio recalcitrant organic pollutants in industrial wastewater the ph is one of the crucial environmental parameters that affect the removal efficiency of pollutants in aops in this work the mechanistic and kinetic insights into the roles of ph on the hydroxylation of five aromatic acids and bases in uv h2o2 process have been investigated using theoretical calculation methods results show that the reactivity of oh towards the twelve ionic neutral species is positively correlated with electron donating effect of substituents which contributes to the positively ph dependent reactivity of aromatic acids and bases towards oh the hydroxylation apparent rate constants k app m 1 s 1 at 298 k increase as the ph values increase from about 1 to 10 but they decrease as the ph values increase from about 10 to 14 however the best ph values for degradation are not around 10 because the oh decreases continuously with the increasing ph values from 3 to 9 5 combining the factors of k app and oh the best degradation ph values are around 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid 3 0 7 5 for phenol and 5 5 7 5 for mixed pollutants of these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process moreover a significant number of hydroxylation by products are more toxic or harmful to aquatic organisms and rat oral than their parental pollutants altogether this work provides comprehensive understanding of the roles of ph on oh initiated degradation behavior of aromatic acids and bases graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aromatic acids bases advanced oxidation processes ph hydroxylation theoretical calculations 1 introduction aromatic contaminants released from industrial wastewater have drawn worldwide concern due to their serious threat to the ecosystems michalowicz and duda 2007 and toxicity to humans bukowska and kowalska 2004 thereinto p hydroxybenzoic acid mainly discharged from olive oil industries azbar et al 2004 and benzoic acid mostly released from food industries rayaroth et al 2017 possess risk to the aquatic organisms lee and chen 2009 in addition p aminophenol and aniline the two aromatic bases are widely used in dye petroleum pharmaceuticals rubber and explosive industries huang et al 2017 xu et al 2005 their exposure would cause detrimental impact on human and animals because of their target sites of blood and kidneys chen 2006 harmon et al 2006 therefore it is indispensable to develop effective methods to destruct these aromatic acids and bases due to their toxicity to microorganisms biological treatments are usually not effective at removing these bio recalcitrant aromatic acids and bases chen 2006 gonzalez et al 1990 pan et al 2019 therefore advanced oxidation processes aops have been successfully applied in the removal of bio recalcitrant organic pollutants in wastewater treatment in recent years alvarez et al 2020 fernandes et al 2020 lin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 shao et al 2020 xiao et al 2020a xiao et al 2020b hydroxyl radicals oh are the most reactive electrophiles which can be generated in various h2o2 related processes gligorovski et al 2018 luo et al 2019 wang and xu 2012 zhao et al 2020 in these processes solution ph plays a vital role in controlling the concentration of hydroxyl radicals amina et al 2020 boczkaj and fernandes 2017 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2014 moreover hydroxyl radicals will be partly present as oxide radical anion o in basic media pka 11 54 poskrebyshev et al 2002 the apparent rate constants k app m 1 s 1 for the reactions of o are at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of oh poskrebyshev et al 2002 the aromatic acids and bases listed in table s1 possess dissociable oh cooh and nh2 groups whose dissociation forms are also strongly influenced by the ph of the aquatic environment that is the ph adjustment of the treated water will lead to the modification of oh concentration oh and the molecule structures of aromatic acids and bases our previous work has proved that the reactions of oh with different dissociation forms of syringol syringaldehyde containing oh group have different reaction reactivity and apparent rate constants an et al 2020 therefore it could be expected that ph influences the degradation efficiency of the aromatic acids bases by influencing not only oh but also k app in aops recently the degradation of these aromatic acids and bases has been investigated in various aops criquet and leitner 2015 duran et al 2017 nezamzadeh ejhieh and amiri 2013 qin et al 2018 rayaroth et al 2017 tang et al 2010 including h2o2 based processes duran et al duran et al 2017 have obtained the maximum degradation efficiency of aniline at ph 4 among ph 4 ph 6 and ph 11 in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 ps systems qin et al qin et al 2018 found that ph 5 is the optimal ph value among ph 2 11 for the treatment of aniline by o3 fenton process they thought that the oh is maximal at the best ph values for degradation experimental researches usually focused on the ph dependent oh concentration that influences the degradation efficiency however degradation efficiency is a macroscopical phenomenon of free radicals concentration and apparent rate constant between different dissociation forms and oh at a given ph value it is relatively difficult to explain the difference of reactivity between different ionic neutral species at the molecular level through experimental methods the possible ph dependent effect on the reactivity of aromatic acids and bases towards oh is still of interest and it is imperative to study the oh initiated degradation reaction of different ionic neutral species quantum chemical methods can explore the chemical reactivity of various species at the molecular level which is a strong supplement and direction to experiments fu et al 2020 luo et al 2017 su et al 2019 tan et al 2020 wei et al 2019b in this work p hydroxybenzoic acid benzoic acid p aminophenol aniline as well as phenol were chosen to study the ph dependent hydroxylation degradation processes of aromatic acids and bases in uv h2o2 process special emphases were laid on the roles of ph on hydroxylation reaction mechanisms and kinetics through investigating the effect of ph on dissociation forms and oh in addition the average local ionization energy alie and frontier molecule orbital fmo theory gave insight into the structural parameters that determine the reactivity and the optimal reaction positions moreover for the pupose of risk assessment the toxicities of these aromatic acids bases and their stable transformation products to aquatic organisms and rat oral were evaluated to ascertain the changes in health effect along with the degradation process 2 calculation methodology 2 1 electronic structures in present work the electronic structure calculations were based on density functional theory dft approach full geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis were calculated for all structures at smd m06 2x 6 31 g d p level using water as solvent in the gaussian 09 software frisch et al 2009 due to the successful application of smd solvent model luo et al 2018 marenich et al 2009 and m06 2x functional an et al 2019 zhao and truhlar 2008 each transition state ts was further verified to uniquely connect the corresponding reactants and products along with the reaction pathway through the intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculation gonzalez and schlegel 1989 at the same level the single point energies were calculated at smd m06 2x 6 311 g 3df 2p level the gibbs free energies g kcal mol 1 were computed with standard state conversion 1 89 kcal mol 1 from gaseous phase at 1 atm to aqueous phase 1 m a higher level of cbs qb3 method montgomery et al 2000 was used for benchmark data calculation to validate the reliability of aforementioned calculation level the errors of the two methods were within 1 57 kcal mol 1 table s2 which is acceptable therefore the profiles of the reaction mechanisms were depicted at smd m06 2x 6 311 g 3df 2p smd m06 2x 6 31 g d p level average local ionization energies alie politzer et al 2010 sjoberg et al 1990 and highest occupied orbital energies e homo were calculated at smd m06 2x 6 31 g d p level for all the cationic neutral monoanionic and dianionic forms of the aromatic acids bases under investigation the alie van der waals surfaces were mapped through multiwfn 3 7 code lu and chen 2012 and vmd 1 9 3 program humphrey et al 1996 2 2 kinetics the apparent rate constants k app calculation were calculated through the conventional transition state theory tst coupled with diffusion limited effects collins and kimball 1949 of which the details were listed in supplementary material to consider the effect of ph on oh the kintecus program ianni 2019 yang et al 2019 was applied to simulate the chemical degradation processes of the selected aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 model the kintecus software has been successfully applied in various aops simulations with proven realibility recently chen et al 2019 lei et al 2020 velo gala et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 2 3 toxicity evaluation the eco toxicities of these aromatic acids bases and their oxidation by products were assessed by ecological structure activity relationship ecosar program ecosar v 2 0 as described in our previous studies an et al 2020 an et al 2019 in this program quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model a functional tool was used for forecasting and estimating the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms green algae daphnia and fish the acute toxicity values lc50 to fish daphnia and ec50 to green algae as well as chronic toxicity values chv were calculated for most conservative estimation for more comprehensive risk assessment the toxicities of these pollutants and their oxidation by products

lethal dose both the programs were developed by u s environmental protection agency usepa 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial reaction mechanisms to investigate the roles of ph on the hydroxylation of p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid the reaction mechanisms will be firstly discussed the pka values of hydroxyl radicals and the five aromatic acids bases are tabulated in table s1 together with the chemical structures of the twelve different dissociation forms the lowest energy conformations and their mole fractions are presented in figs s1 and s2 respectively the hydroxylation reaction mechanisms include radical adduct formation raf hydrogen atom abstraction haa and single electron transfer set the reaction mechanisms of o with these pollutant molecules are not considered in the study because the k app for the reactions of o are at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of oh poskrebyshev et al 2002 for clarity the reaction mechanisms of oh with p hydroxybenzoic acid will be analyzed first followed by the effect of various functional groups on reaction characteristics 3 1 1 reactions for p hydroxybenzoic acid the p hydroxybenzoic acid molecules include three ionic neutral species neutral form h2 p ha monoanionic form h p ha and dianionic form p ha2 table s1 and fig s1 the reaction mechanisms of oh with h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 are depicted in figs 1 s3 and s4 repectively as the oh approaches to p hydroxybenzoic acid molecules the first step is the formation of pre reaction complexes prcs and then the reactions climb energy barriers to transition states tss followed by the generation of raf or haa intermediates ims by releasing energy moreover the oh can also transfer electrons to the p hydroxybenzoic acid molecules forming oh and set intermediates to compare the feasibility of all the raf haa and set routes the energy barriers δg between reactants and tss and reaction energies δg between reactants and intermediates of all the reaction pathways are tabulated in table s3 the gibbs free energies of prcs relative to reactants δg are listed in table s4 according to table s3 for the hydroxylation of h2 p ha the set route is endothermic by 21 82 kcal mol 1 with energy barrier of 24 12 kcal mol 1 this means that the set reaction pathway is not spontaneous at ambient temperature the reaction energies of raf and haa routes are negative δg 27 51 5 13 kcal mol 1 indicating that these pathways are spontaneous the energy barriers of raf routes δg 5 87 9 98 kcal mol 1 are lower than that of haa routes δg 11 21 42 64 kcal mol 1 and set route δg 24 12 kcal mol 1 compared with haa and set routes raf routes are prone to be the most feasible reaction routes among raf routes the energy barriers of r2a and r6a routes are similar and lowest δg 6 kcal mol 1 to make the two reaction routes most realizable followed by route r4a δg 7 95 kcal mol 1 this indicates that the ortho para c sites to oh group are the preferential reactive sites and the case is the same for the hydroxylation of monoanionic form h p ha and dianionic form p ha2 table s3 the potential energy profiles of the most feasible raf routes r2a and r6a in h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 are depicted in fig 2 comparing the six raf pathways we can see that the tss for monoanionic form are lower in free energy by 1 40 and 1 36 kcal mol 1 than that for neutral form but higher in free energy by 8 92 and 9 28 kcal mol 1 than that for dianionic form the attack of oh on dianionic form has the lowest energy barrier δg 4 45 kcal mol 1 between reactants and tss indicating that the formation of im2a2 and im6a2 are most kinetically favored in addition the formations of im2a2 and im6a2 are also thermodynamically favored because they possess lower reaction energy by 4 13 5 71 kcal mol 1 than that of other intermediates im2a im6a im2a and im6a cinar et al cinar et al 2017 found a similar result that the hydroxylation of dcf ionic form of diclofenac possesses lower energy barriers and higher exothermicities than dcf neutral form of diclofenac therefore it is postulated that the hydroxylation reactivity is ph dependent since the cooh and oh groups will successively dissociate as the ph values increase to further confirm above results the average local ionization energies alie a real spatial function on the molecular surfaces of h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 have been calculated the alie van der waals surfaces are mapped in fig 3 according to the color changes the deeper the blue color is the lower the alie values and the more ionized and reactive the electrons the local minimum values of alie are displayed with azury balls among the c h sites where the electrophiles oh might attack the most active electrons are distributed on the ortho para c sites to oh o groups this reveals that these c sites can be more easily attacked by oh than other c sites which verifies the results obtained through energy barriers furthermore the local lowest alie values of h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 are 10 29 10 71 ev 10 05 10 30 ev and 9 03 9 05 ev respectively this manifests that the chemical reactivity order is p ha2 h p ha h2 p ha and the reactivity is ph dependent due to the ph dependent dissociation of cooh and oh groups which is also consistent with the results acquired from energy barriers it signifies that the dissociation of cooh and oh significantly affects the charge distribution of p hydroxybenzoic acid and therefore the energy barriers because the electron donating ability of o and coo are stronger than that of oh and cooh respectively in addition the local minimum values of alie also reflect that the activation capacity of oh and o groups is stronger than that of coo group since the three groups are electron donating groups activating the ortho para c sites 3 1 2 reaction characteristics the reaction mechanisms and the main reaction positions for the degradation of p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid are analyzed through the same scrutiny as for p hydroxybenzoic acid the δg and δg data are also summarized in table s3 the alie van der waals surfaces are mapped in fig s5 similar to the hydroxylation of p hydroxybenzoic acid h2 p ha and h p ha raf pathways also possess the lowest energy barriers in p aminophenol h2 p ap h p ap and p ap phenol h p and p aniline h a and a and benzoic acid h ba and ba based on recent researches the aromatics containing electron donating groups possess higher reactivity towards raf pathways of oh mei et al 2019 and set pathways of so4 luo et al 2017 luo et al 2018 than that containing electron withdrawing groups in this work the box plots of δg values for the raf pathways of all the ionic neutral species are sorted out against their substituent groups in fig 4 a and b an apparent correlation between δg values and the electron donating withdrawing capacity can be found the δg values decrease with the increase in the electron donating ability of the substituents the results once again reveal that the aromatics containing electron donating groups are more reactive towards electrophiles than that containing electron withdrawing groups meanwhile a strong ph dependent reactivity for oh towards p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid is also found attributable to the ph dependent dissociation of oh nh2 and cooh moieties in the molecule structures the higher the ph values are the higher the electron donating ability the lower the δg values and the more reactive the aromatics towards oh furthermore we can also find a linear correlation between the local minima alie values of c sites and the δg values of the corresponding raf sites fig 4c lower alie and δg values jointly represent higher reactivity of the aromatics towards oh the alie van der waals surfaces of the aromatics are ranked through the electron effects of functional groups figs s7 and s8 the blue zones of the aromatics become more obvious and the local minima alie values decrease with the increasing electron donating characteristics the results also signify the characteristic of higher chemical reactivity of the aromatics with stronger electron donating groups the linear correlation between e homo values and average δg values of raf routes for the corresponding aromatics further support the effect of substituents on hydroxylation reactivity fig 4d the molecular frontier orbitals of homo are shown in fig s6 the higher the e homo values are the higher the chemical activity of the aromatics towards electrophiles lee et al 2015 luo et al 2018 in addition due to the ortho para directing effect of the electron donating moieties o nh2 oh and coo the oh preferentially adds to electron rich positions which are ortho para to the groups figs s7 and s9 on the basis of quantum chemical calculations it can be judged that the ph dependent effect in reactivity towards oh is due to the enhancement of electron donating ability in deprotonated forms overall the results acquired provide molecular insight into the hydroxylation activity underlying the decrease of the energy barriers with the increase of the electron donating ability and reveal that the oh initiated degradation of aromatic acids bases will be influenced by the ph of the water surrounding 3 2 reaction kinetics 3 2 1 the ph dependent apparent rate constants based on the above thermodynamic data the apparent rate constants k app of the 12 ionic neutral species towards oh are calculated at 298 k table s5 supporting to the results of reaction mechanisms of oh with the aromatic acids bases it is shown that the k app of deprotonated form is higher than that of protonated form for each compound that is the deprotonated oh cooh groups and nonprotonated nh2 group make the aromatics react faster with oh than their protonated forms previous experiments showed that the k app of hydroxylation of nic neutral form of nicotine 6 7 109 m 1 s 1 was higher than that of nich monoprotonated form of nicotine 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 kosno et al 2014 which is the same as our calculated trend the k app values for one compound within ph 1 14 are calculated taking into account of the k app of each dissociation form and molar fraction of each dissociation form at each ph value in supplementary material the molar fraction of oh should also be considered due to the conversion of oh to o at ph above 10 fig s2f this work makes up the regret not considering the molar fraction of oh in our previous work an et al 2020 the ph dependent hydroxylation apparent rate constants k app of the five aromatic acids bases are shown in fig 5 the k app values continuously increase with the increasing ph values from about 1 to 10 because the deprotonated oh cooh groups and nonprotonated nh2 group make the aromatics react faster with oh than their protonated forms the k app values for aniline reveal an increase of more than one order of magnitude from the protonated form h a 1 26 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 1 to neutral form a 3 49 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 5 the ph dependent effect seems to be less obvious for the more reactive compounds the conversion of oh to o group in p aminophenol only makes the k app values slightly higher from 6 84 1010 to 7 86 1010 m 1 s 1 this ascribes to the fact that h p ap exhibits high k app with oh reacting at nearly diffusion controlled rate constants while the reaction for p ap is completely diffusion controlled table s5 the k app values for phenol are higher than that for benzoic acid over the whole ph range which is due to higher electron donating capacity of oh and o groups than that of cooh and coo groups respectively when the ph values increase from about 10 to 14 the k app values of the five aromatic acids bases decrease about two orders of magnitude due to the decreased molar fraction of oh specifically the peak k app values at the optimal ph values for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid are 4 87 1010 at ph 10 3 7 20 1010 at ph 10 1 6 19 1010 at ph 10 7 3 49 1010 at ph 7 7 8 5 and 4 16 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 8 9 respectively the available experimental k app values and the corresponding calculated values at the same ph values are displayed in table 1 the differences between experimental and calculated values are within one order of magnitude which is acceptable for one compound the experimental k app values increase as the ph values increase at the range of ph 10 which is consistant with the calculated trend therefore the calculated results are accurate and reliable in addition similar to the trend of the calculated results for hydroxylation previous experimental researches revealed that the ozonation k app values of dissociable drugs at high ph values are also higher than that at low ph values dodd et al 2006 prasse et al 2012 both oh and o3 are electrophiles compared with hydroxylation the ph dependent effect is much stronger for ozonization k app increasing 3 4 orders of magnitude due to lower reactivity of o3 than oh dodd et al 2006 prasse et al 2012 the ratios of the k app of independent pathways to the k app total the branching ratios γapp are also calculated table s5 with the increasing ph values from 1 to 14 although the branching ratios of haa and set routes increase to some extents the raf routes are still the most important routes due to lower δg values of raf routes than that of haa and set routes for all species fig s10 therefore the subsequent reactions are mainly focused on the oh adducts 3 2 2 kinetics simulation to estimate the effect of ph on oh and degradation efficiency in uv h2o2 process six kinetic models five single pollutant models and one mixed pollutants model are applied to simulate the degradation processes of the five aromatic acids bases in ultrapure water using the smart kintecus program the associated reactions involved are listed in table s6 and most of the apparent rate constants k app are acquired from previous research results the kinetic modeling results after 10 min at ph 3 0 9 5 are depicted in fig 6 for p hydroxybenzoic acid and p aminophenol fig s11 for phenol aniline and benzoic acid and fig 7 for the mixture of the five pollutants 3 2 2 1 single pollutant models we can see that the degradation efficiency of these aromatic acids bases is also ph dependent but the variation tendency is different from k app figs 6 and s11 this discrepancy can be explained by the variable oh at different ph values the oh at 10 min ranges from 1 99 10 13 to 2 41 10 12 m at ph 3 9 5 in the five systems and the oh decreases continuously with increasing alkalinity therefore the maximal ph values for degradation are the comprehensive results of k app and oh the optimal ph values are around 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid whereas 3 0 7 5 for phenol the relatively stable degradation efficiency value for phenol from 3 0 7 5 is due to the steady k app values ranging from 3 0 7 5 overall slightly acidic or neutral conditions are the optimal ph conditions for the degradation of the five aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 system the order of maximum degradation efficiency is p aminophenol 96 5 aniline 95 5 phenol 94 3 p hydroxybenzoic acid 93 8 benzoic acid 84 9 this order is the same as the k app order for the five compounds at ph 5 8 fig 5 3 2 2 2 mixed pollutants model to investigate the mutual influence of the five compounds on degradation efficiency a mixed solution system of the five pollutants is established the five separate and one total degradation efficiency values are shown in fig 7 the degradation efficiency values of p aminophenol p hydroxybenzoic acid and phenol stabilize at 94 100 at ph 3 9 5 however these values for aniline benzoic acid and total compounds increase as ph rises from 3 to 5 5 decrease as ph rises from 7 5 to 9 5 and stabilize at 100 60 and 91 at ph 5 7 respectively the order of maximum degradation efficiency is p aminophenol 100 aniline 100 phenol 99 4 p hydroxybenzoic acid 98 5 total 91 7 benzoic acid 60 8 which is the same with the tendency of that in single pollutant models however compared with single pollutant models the mixed pollutants model widens the gap between p aminophenol and benzoic acid for the maximum degradation efficiency this indicates that oh prefers to degrade more reactive compounds in mixed solution the optimal ph values are around 5 5 7 5 for aniline benzoic acid and total compounds therefore we suggest that the optimal ph values are 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid 3 0 7 5 for phenol and 5 5 7 5 for mixed pollutants of these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process although the real wastewater may contain many anions i e cl and hco3 which are not included in the simulated models acidic or neutral phs are still our recommendation to degrade these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process 3 3 subsequent reactions of oh adducts in aops the oh adducts of aromatics will undergo a string of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions mei et al 2020 mvula et al 2001 sun et al 2020 wei et al 2019a yamabe and yamazaki 2018 the neutral oh adducts are selected to investigate the subsequent reactions with o2 self decomposition reactions and h2o elimination reactions for phenolic compounds to obtain the main primary conversion stable products 3 3 1 subsequent reactions with o2 and self decomposition reactions the o2 will abstract one h atom from each oh adduct forming hydroxylation product fig s12 these processes are exothermic by 40 17 30 74 kcal mol 1 with energy barriers of 1 07 19 06 kcal mol 1 the self decomposition processes eliminating cooh or nh2 are slightly endothermic by 0 90 4 64 kcal mol 1 with energy barriers of 16 78 25 24 kcal mol 1 therefore the bimolecular reactions with o2 are more feasible compared with self decomposition processes 3 3 2 h2o elimination reactions the ipso ortho meta and para oh adducts of h2 p ha h p ap and h p are selected to investigate the h2o elimination reactions fig s13 these oh adducts could eliminate one h2o molecule forming three corresponding phenoxyl radicals due to the exothermicity of these reactions δg 33 02 16 77 kcal mol 1 however the direct intramolecular reaction pathways are not feasible due to long diatance or large steric hindrance in transition states an et al 2019 yamabe and yamazaki 2018 therefore h2o n molecules are added into the transition states of h2o elimination reactions participating in the bond interchange along hydrogen bonds the optimal numbers of adding water molecules are determined through the oh adducts of h p and the optimal numbers in red are two two three and three for ipso ortho meta and para oh adducts respectively fig s13c although the energy barriers of 20 17 32 27 kcal mol 1 are higher than that of h atom abstraction reactions of o2 the h2o elimination reactions are still possible pathways and then these phenoxyl radicals will undergo the radical radical recombination through barrierless addition of oh yielding hydroxy hexadienones with δg of 54 21 39 89 kcal mol 1 with the assisting of two h2o molecules the hydroxy hexadienones continue to react through h shift generating four hydroxylation products these processes are exothermic by 29 39 24 96 kcal mol 1 with energy barriers of 18 61 26 93 kcal mol 1 the hydroxylation by products obtained above were also detected in relevant experiments benito et al 2017 criquet and leitner 2015 duesteberg and waite 2007 rayaroth et al 2017 the following toxicity evaluation objects include all the five aromatic acids bases and their hydroxylation by products 1 p2 1 p6 for p hydroxybenzoic acid h2 p ha 2 p2 2 p6 for p aminophenol h p ap 3 p2 3 p6 for phenol h p 4 p1 4 p6 for aniline a and 5 p1 5 p6 for benzoic acid h ba 3 4 toxicity evaluation for the purpose of simulating the risk of the selected aromatic acids bases and their hydroxylation by products to ecosystem and human beings the toxicities of these compounds to aquatic organisms fish daphnia and green algae and rat oral are evaluated through ecosar and t e s t programs respectively the available experimental values and corresponding predicted values for acute toxicities of these compounds are shown in fig s14 most of the predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental values the following descriptions of the toxicity change from reactants to products are based on the predicted results 3 4 1 toxicity to aquatic organisms fig 8 a and c present the acute denoted as lc50 ec50 and chronic denoted as chv toxicities of p hydroxybenzoic acid h2 p ha p aminophenol h p ap phenol h p aniline a and benzoic acid h ba according to the criteria listed in table s7 the order of both acute and chronic toxicities is h p ap a h p h2 p ha h ba the h2 p ha is acutely not harmful to fish daphnia lc50 100 mg l 1 acutely harmful to green algae 10 ec50 100 mg l 1 and chronically not harmful to the three aquatic organisms chv 10 mg l 1 h p ap the most toxic compound is classified acutely harmful to fish acutely toxic to green algae acutely very toxic to daphnia chronically toxic to daphnia green algae and chronically very toxic to fish its acute toxicity values are 11 43 0 64 and 1 63 mg l 1 and chronic toxicity values are 0 09 0 14 and 0 26 mg l 1 for fish daphnia and green algae respectively fig 8 b and d show the acute and chronic toxicities of the hydroxylation by products of h2 p ha the acute toxicities to daphnia green algae and chronic toxicities to fish daphnia of 1 p2 1 p6 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid and 1 p3 1 p5 2 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid are lower than that of their parental h2 p ha nevertheless the acute toxicities to fish and chronic toxicities to green algae of these products are higher than that of h2 p ha particularly the product 1 p4 hydroquinone exhibits much higher toxicity than h2 p ha because 1 p4 is toxic and even very toxic 0 1 lc50 ec50 1 mg l 1 0 01 chv 1 mg l 1 to the three aquatic organisms the hydroxylation by products of h p ap h p and a are more or less toxic than their parental compounds fig s15 3 4 2 toxicity to rat the acute toxicities of these compounds to rat oral are also assessed for the evaluation of their risk to mammals according to the criteria set by the european union table s8 the toxicities are shown in fig 9 for the reactants and products of h2 p ha and fig s16 for the products of h p ap h p a and h ba for the reactants h2 p ha is not harmful to rat oral ld50 2000 mg kg 1 and others are harmful to rat oral 200 ld50 2000 mg kg 1 the toxicity order is h p ap h p a h ba h2 p ha which is different from the toxicity order to aquatic organisms however h p ap still possesses the highest toxicity ld50 221 22 mg kg 1 which is on the verge of toxic level all the hydroxylation by products of h2 p ha are harmful to rat e g the ld50 values are 200 2000 mg kg 1 making them more harmful than h2 p ha the products of a are also more harmful to rat oral than a due to lower ld50 values although the hydroxylation by products of h2 p ap are still harmful to rat oral 452 ld50 1034 mg kg 1 their toxicities are lower than h2 p ap the products of h p and h ba are more or less toxic than their parental compounds the follow up transformation reactions are still needed to obtain thorough mineralization for the degradation of the aromatic acids and bases through oh based aops because some hydroxylation by products are still more harmful or toxic to aquatic organisms and rat oral than their parental reactants 4 conclusions in this study we have systematically given the mechanistic and kinetic insights into the ph dependent degradation of five aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process moreover the toxicities of these pollutants and their hydroxylation by products to aquatic organisms and rat oral have been evaluated for risk assessment some detailed conclusions are listed as followings 1 the raf pathways possess lower energy barriers than haa and set pathways for the oh initiated reactions of the 12 ionic neutral species the electron donating groups activate the ortho and para positions for the addition reactions of oh 2 the reactivity of compounds towards oh is positively correlated with electron donating effect of substituents which contributes to the positively ph dependent reactivity of aromatic acids and bases towards oh 3 the hydroxylation apparent rate constants k app at 298 k increase as the ph values increase from about 1 to 10 but they decrease as the ph values increase from about 10 to 14 the raf routes are still the most important routes on the whole ph range although the branching ratios of haa and set routes increase to some extent with the increasing ph values from 1 to 14 4 the order of maximum degradation efficiency of the five aromatic acids bases are almost the same in separate models and mixed model the optimal degradation ph values are 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid 3 0 7 5 for phenol and 5 5 7 5 for mixed compounds of these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process 5 a significant number of hydroxylation by products are more toxic or harmful to aquatic organisms and rat oral than their parent pollutants the follow up transformation reactions are still needed to obtain thorough mineralization for the degradation of these aromatic acids and bases through oh based aops this work is helpful to assess the fate of aromatic acids bases in real

17243,advanced oxidation processes aops based on hydroxyl radicals oh are the most important technologies for the removal of bio recalcitrant organic pollutants in industrial wastewater the ph is one of the crucial environmental parameters that affect the removal efficiency of pollutants in aops in this work the mechanistic and kinetic insights into the roles of ph on the hydroxylation of five aromatic acids and bases in uv h2o2 process have been investigated using theoretical calculation methods results show that the reactivity of oh towards the twelve ionic neutral species is positively correlated with electron donating effect of substituents which contributes to the positively ph dependent reactivity of aromatic acids and bases towards oh the hydroxylation apparent rate constants k app m 1 s 1 at 298 k increase as the ph values increase from about 1 to 10 but they decrease as the ph values increase from about 10 to 14 however the best ph values for degradation are not around 10 because the oh decreases continuously with the increasing ph values from 3 to 9 5 combining the factors of k app and oh the best degradation ph values are around 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid 3 0 7 5 for phenol and 5 5 7 5 for mixed pollutants of these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process moreover a significant number of hydroxylation by products are more toxic or harmful to aquatic organisms and rat oral than their parental pollutants altogether this work provides comprehensive understanding of the roles of ph on oh initiated degradation behavior of aromatic acids and bases graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aromatic acids bases advanced oxidation processes ph hydroxylation theoretical calculations 1 introduction aromatic contaminants released from industrial wastewater have drawn worldwide concern due to their serious threat to the ecosystems michalowicz and duda 2007 and toxicity to humans bukowska and kowalska 2004 thereinto p hydroxybenzoic acid mainly discharged from olive oil industries azbar et al 2004 and benzoic acid mostly released from food industries rayaroth et al 2017 possess risk to the aquatic organisms lee and chen 2009 in addition p aminophenol and aniline the two aromatic bases are widely used in dye petroleum pharmaceuticals rubber and explosive industries huang et al 2017 xu et al 2005 their exposure would cause detrimental impact on human and animals because of their target sites of blood and kidneys chen 2006 harmon et al 2006 therefore it is indispensable to develop effective methods to destruct these aromatic acids and bases due to their toxicity to microorganisms biological treatments are usually not effective at removing these bio recalcitrant aromatic acids and bases chen 2006 gonzalez et al 1990 pan et al 2019 therefore advanced oxidation processes aops have been successfully applied in the removal of bio recalcitrant organic pollutants in wastewater treatment in recent years alvarez et al 2020 fernandes et al 2020 lin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 shao et al 2020 xiao et al 2020a xiao et al 2020b hydroxyl radicals oh are the most reactive electrophiles which can be generated in various h2o2 related processes gligorovski et al 2018 luo et al 2019 wang and xu 2012 zhao et al 2020 in these processes solution ph plays a vital role in controlling the concentration of hydroxyl radicals amina et al 2020 boczkaj and fernandes 2017 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2014 moreover hydroxyl radicals will be partly present as oxide radical anion o in basic media pka 11 54 poskrebyshev et al 2002 the apparent rate constants k app m 1 s 1 for the reactions of o are at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of oh poskrebyshev et al 2002 the aromatic acids and bases listed in table s1 possess dissociable oh cooh and nh2 groups whose dissociation forms are also strongly influenced by the ph of the aquatic environment that is the ph adjustment of the treated water will lead to the modification of oh concentration oh and the molecule structures of aromatic acids and bases our previous work has proved that the reactions of oh with different dissociation forms of syringol syringaldehyde containing oh group have different reaction reactivity and apparent rate constants an et al 2020 therefore it could be expected that ph influences the degradation efficiency of the aromatic acids bases by influencing not only oh but also k app in aops recently the degradation of these aromatic acids and bases has been investigated in various aops criquet and leitner 2015 duran et al 2017 nezamzadeh ejhieh and amiri 2013 qin et al 2018 rayaroth et al 2017 tang et al 2010 including h2o2 based processes duran et al duran et al 2017 have obtained the maximum degradation efficiency of aniline at ph 4 among ph 4 ph 6 and ph 11 in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 ps systems qin et al qin et al 2018 found that ph 5 is the optimal ph value among ph 2 11 for the treatment of aniline by o3 fenton process they thought that the oh is maximal at the best ph values for degradation experimental researches usually focused on the ph dependent oh concentration that influences the degradation efficiency however degradation efficiency is a macroscopical phenomenon of free radicals concentration and apparent rate constant between different dissociation forms and oh at a given ph value it is relatively difficult to explain the difference of reactivity between different ionic neutral species at the molecular level through experimental methods the possible ph dependent effect on the reactivity of aromatic acids and bases towards oh is still of interest and it is imperative to study the oh initiated degradation reaction of different ionic neutral species quantum chemical methods can explore the chemical reactivity of various species at the molecular level which is a strong supplement and direction to experiments fu et al 2020 luo et al 2017 su et al 2019 tan et al 2020 wei et al 2019b in this work p hydroxybenzoic acid benzoic acid p aminophenol aniline as well as phenol were chosen to study the ph dependent hydroxylation degradation processes of aromatic acids and bases in uv h2o2 process special emphases were laid on the roles of ph on hydroxylation reaction mechanisms and kinetics through investigating the effect of ph on dissociation forms and oh in addition the average local ionization energy alie and frontier molecule orbital fmo theory gave insight into the structural parameters that determine the reactivity and the optimal reaction positions moreover for the pupose of risk assessment the toxicities of these aromatic acids bases and their stable transformation products to aquatic organisms and rat oral were evaluated to ascertain the changes in health effect along with the degradation process 2 calculation methodology 2 1 electronic structures in present work the electronic structure calculations were based on density functional theory dft approach full geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis were calculated for all structures at smd m06 2x 6 31 g d p level using water as solvent in the gaussian 09 software frisch et al 2009 due to the successful application of smd solvent model luo et al 2018 marenich et al 2009 and m06 2x functional an et al 2019 zhao and truhlar 2008 each transition state ts was further verified to uniquely connect the corresponding reactants and products along with the reaction pathway through the intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculation gonzalez and schlegel 1989 at the same level the single point energies were calculated at smd m06 2x 6 311 g 3df 2p level the gibbs free energies g kcal mol 1 were computed with standard state conversion 1 89 kcal mol 1 from gaseous phase at 1 atm to aqueous phase 1 m a higher level of cbs qb3 method montgomery et al 2000 was used for benchmark data calculation to validate the reliability of aforementioned calculation level the errors of the two methods were within 1 57 kcal mol 1 table s2 which is acceptable therefore the profiles of the reaction mechanisms were depicted at smd m06 2x 6 311 g 3df 2p smd m06 2x 6 31 g d p level average local ionization energies alie politzer et al 2010 sjoberg et al 1990 and highest occupied orbital energies e homo were calculated at smd m06 2x 6 31 g d p level for all the cationic neutral monoanionic and dianionic forms of the aromatic acids bases under investigation the alie van der waals surfaces were mapped through multiwfn 3 7 code lu and chen 2012 and vmd 1 9 3 program humphrey et al 1996 2 2 kinetics the apparent rate constants k app calculation were calculated through the conventional transition state theory tst coupled with diffusion limited effects collins and kimball 1949 of which the details were listed in supplementary material to consider the effect of ph on oh the kintecus program ianni 2019 yang et al 2019 was applied to simulate the chemical degradation processes of the selected aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 model the kintecus software has been successfully applied in various aops simulations with proven realibility recently chen et al 2019 lei et al 2020 velo gala et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 2 3 toxicity evaluation the eco toxicities of these aromatic acids bases and their oxidation by products were assessed by ecological structure activity relationship ecosar program ecosar v 2 0 as described in our previous studies an et al 2020 an et al 2019 in this program quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model a functional tool was used for forecasting and estimating the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms green algae daphnia and fish the acute toxicity values lc50 to fish daphnia and ec50 to green algae as well as chronic toxicity values chv were calculated for most conservative estimation for more comprehensive risk assessment the toxicities of these pollutants and their oxidation by products

lethal dose both the programs were developed by u s environmental protection agency usepa 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial reaction mechanisms to investigate the roles of ph on the hydroxylation of p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid the reaction mechanisms will be firstly discussed the pka values of hydroxyl radicals and the five aromatic acids bases are tabulated in table s1 together with the chemical structures of the twelve different dissociation forms the lowest energy conformations and their mole fractions are presented in figs s1 and s2 respectively the hydroxylation reaction mechanisms include radical adduct formation raf hydrogen atom abstraction haa and single electron transfer set the reaction mechanisms of o with these pollutant molecules are not considered in the study because the k app for the reactions of o are at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of oh poskrebyshev et al 2002 for clarity the reaction mechanisms of oh with p hydroxybenzoic acid will be analyzed first followed by the effect of various functional groups on reaction characteristics 3 1 1 reactions for p hydroxybenzoic acid the p hydroxybenzoic acid molecules include three ionic neutral species neutral form h2 p ha monoanionic form h p ha and dianionic form p ha2 table s1 and fig s1 the reaction mechanisms of oh with h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 are depicted in figs 1 s3 and s4 repectively as the oh approaches to p hydroxybenzoic acid molecules the first step is the formation of pre reaction complexes prcs and then the reactions climb energy barriers to transition states tss followed by the generation of raf or haa intermediates ims by releasing energy moreover the oh can also transfer electrons to the p hydroxybenzoic acid molecules forming oh and set intermediates to compare the feasibility of all the raf haa and set routes the energy barriers δg between reactants and tss and reaction energies δg between reactants and intermediates of all the reaction pathways are tabulated in table s3 the gibbs free energies of prcs relative to reactants δg are listed in table s4 according to table s3 for the hydroxylation of h2 p ha the set route is endothermic by 21 82 kcal mol 1 with energy barrier of 24 12 kcal mol 1 this means that the set reaction pathway is not spontaneous at ambient temperature the reaction energies of raf and haa routes are negative δg 27 51 5 13 kcal mol 1 indicating that these pathways are spontaneous the energy barriers of raf routes δg 5 87 9 98 kcal mol 1 are lower than that of haa routes δg 11 21 42 64 kcal mol 1 and set route δg 24 12 kcal mol 1 compared with haa and set routes raf routes are prone to be the most feasible reaction routes among raf routes the energy barriers of r2a and r6a routes are similar and lowest δg 6 kcal mol 1 to make the two reaction routes most realizable followed by route r4a δg 7 95 kcal mol 1 this indicates that the ortho para c sites to oh group are the preferential reactive sites and the case is the same for the hydroxylation of monoanionic form h p ha and dianionic form p ha2 table s3 the potential energy profiles of the most feasible raf routes r2a and r6a in h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 are depicted in fig 2 comparing the six raf pathways we can see that the tss for monoanionic form are lower in free energy by 1 40 and 1 36 kcal mol 1 than that for neutral form but higher in free energy by 8 92 and 9 28 kcal mol 1 than that for dianionic form the attack of oh on dianionic form has the lowest energy barrier δg 4 45 kcal mol 1 between reactants and tss indicating that the formation of im2a2 and im6a2 are most kinetically favored in addition the formations of im2a2 and im6a2 are also thermodynamically favored because they possess lower reaction energy by 4 13 5 71 kcal mol 1 than that of other intermediates im2a im6a im2a and im6a cinar et al cinar et al 2017 found a similar result that the hydroxylation of dcf ionic form of diclofenac possesses lower energy barriers and higher exothermicities than dcf neutral form of diclofenac therefore it is postulated that the hydroxylation reactivity is ph dependent since the cooh and oh groups will successively dissociate as the ph values increase to further confirm above results the average local ionization energies alie a real spatial function on the molecular surfaces of h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 have been calculated the alie van der waals surfaces are mapped in fig 3 according to the color changes the deeper the blue color is the lower the alie values and the more ionized and reactive the electrons the local minimum values of alie are displayed with azury balls among the c h sites where the electrophiles oh might attack the most active electrons are distributed on the ortho para c sites to oh o groups this reveals that these c sites can be more easily attacked by oh than other c sites which verifies the results obtained through energy barriers furthermore the local lowest alie values of h2 p ha h p ha and p ha2 are 10 29 10 71 ev 10 05 10 30 ev and 9 03 9 05 ev respectively this manifests that the chemical reactivity order is p ha2 h p ha h2 p ha and the reactivity is ph dependent due to the ph dependent dissociation of cooh and oh groups which is also consistent with the results acquired from energy barriers it signifies that the dissociation of cooh and oh significantly affects the charge distribution of p hydroxybenzoic acid and therefore the energy barriers because the electron donating ability of o and coo are stronger than that of oh and cooh respectively in addition the local minimum values of alie also reflect that the activation capacity of oh and o groups is stronger than that of coo group since the three groups are electron donating groups activating the ortho para c sites 3 1 2 reaction characteristics the reaction mechanisms and the main reaction positions for the degradation of p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid are analyzed through the same scrutiny as for p hydroxybenzoic acid the δg and δg data are also summarized in table s3 the alie van der waals surfaces are mapped in fig s5 similar to the hydroxylation of p hydroxybenzoic acid h2 p ha and h p ha raf pathways also possess the lowest energy barriers in p aminophenol h2 p ap h p ap and p ap phenol h p and p aniline h a and a and benzoic acid h ba and ba based on recent researches the aromatics containing electron donating groups possess higher reactivity towards raf pathways of oh mei et al 2019 and set pathways of so4 luo et al 2017 luo et al 2018 than that containing electron withdrawing groups in this work the box plots of δg values for the raf pathways of all the ionic neutral species are sorted out against their substituent groups in fig 4 a and b an apparent correlation between δg values and the electron donating withdrawing capacity can be found the δg values decrease with the increase in the electron donating ability of the substituents the results once again reveal that the aromatics containing electron donating groups are more reactive towards electrophiles than that containing electron withdrawing groups meanwhile a strong ph dependent reactivity for oh towards p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid is also found attributable to the ph dependent dissociation of oh nh2 and cooh moieties in the molecule structures the higher the ph values are the higher the electron donating ability the lower the δg values and the more reactive the aromatics towards oh furthermore we can also find a linear correlation between the local minima alie values of c sites and the δg values of the corresponding raf sites fig 4c lower alie and δg values jointly represent higher reactivity of the aromatics towards oh the alie van der waals surfaces of the aromatics are ranked through the electron effects of functional groups figs s7 and s8 the blue zones of the aromatics become more obvious and the local minima alie values decrease with the increasing electron donating characteristics the results also signify the characteristic of higher chemical reactivity of the aromatics with stronger electron donating groups the linear correlation between e homo values and average δg values of raf routes for the corresponding aromatics further support the effect of substituents on hydroxylation reactivity fig 4d the molecular frontier orbitals of homo are shown in fig s6 the higher the e homo values are the higher the chemical activity of the aromatics towards electrophiles lee et al 2015 luo et al 2018 in addition due to the ortho para directing effect of the electron donating moieties o nh2 oh and coo the oh preferentially adds to electron rich positions which are ortho para to the groups figs s7 and s9 on the basis of quantum chemical calculations it can be judged that the ph dependent effect in reactivity towards oh is due to the enhancement of electron donating ability in deprotonated forms overall the results acquired provide molecular insight into the hydroxylation activity underlying the decrease of the energy barriers with the increase of the electron donating ability and reveal that the oh initiated degradation of aromatic acids bases will be influenced by the ph of the water surrounding 3 2 reaction kinetics 3 2 1 the ph dependent apparent rate constants based on the above thermodynamic data the apparent rate constants k app of the 12 ionic neutral species towards oh are calculated at 298 k table s5 supporting to the results of reaction mechanisms of oh with the aromatic acids bases it is shown that the k app of deprotonated form is higher than that of protonated form for each compound that is the deprotonated oh cooh groups and nonprotonated nh2 group make the aromatics react faster with oh than their protonated forms previous experiments showed that the k app of hydroxylation of nic neutral form of nicotine 6 7 109 m 1 s 1 was higher than that of nich monoprotonated form of nicotine 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 kosno et al 2014 which is the same as our calculated trend the k app values for one compound within ph 1 14 are calculated taking into account of the k app of each dissociation form and molar fraction of each dissociation form at each ph value in supplementary material the molar fraction of oh should also be considered due to the conversion of oh to o at ph above 10 fig s2f this work makes up the regret not considering the molar fraction of oh in our previous work an et al 2020 the ph dependent hydroxylation apparent rate constants k app of the five aromatic acids bases are shown in fig 5 the k app values continuously increase with the increasing ph values from about 1 to 10 because the deprotonated oh cooh groups and nonprotonated nh2 group make the aromatics react faster with oh than their protonated forms the k app values for aniline reveal an increase of more than one order of magnitude from the protonated form h a 1 26 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 1 to neutral form a 3 49 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 5 the ph dependent effect seems to be less obvious for the more reactive compounds the conversion of oh to o group in p aminophenol only makes the k app values slightly higher from 6 84 1010 to 7 86 1010 m 1 s 1 this ascribes to the fact that h p ap exhibits high k app with oh reacting at nearly diffusion controlled rate constants while the reaction for p ap is completely diffusion controlled table s5 the k app values for phenol are higher than that for benzoic acid over the whole ph range which is due to higher electron donating capacity of oh and o groups than that of cooh and coo groups respectively when the ph values increase from about 10 to 14 the k app values of the five aromatic acids bases decrease about two orders of magnitude due to the decreased molar fraction of oh specifically the peak k app values at the optimal ph values for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol phenol aniline and benzoic acid are 4 87 1010 at ph 10 3 7 20 1010 at ph 10 1 6 19 1010 at ph 10 7 3 49 1010 at ph 7 7 8 5 and 4 16 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 8 9 respectively the available experimental k app values and the corresponding calculated values at the same ph values are displayed in table 1 the differences between experimental and calculated values are within one order of magnitude which is acceptable for one compound the experimental k app values increase as the ph values increase at the range of ph 10 which is consistant with the calculated trend therefore the calculated results are accurate and reliable in addition similar to the trend of the calculated results for hydroxylation previous experimental researches revealed that the ozonation k app values of dissociable drugs at high ph values are also higher than that at low ph values dodd et al 2006 prasse et al 2012 both oh and o3 are electrophiles compared with hydroxylation the ph dependent effect is much stronger for ozonization k app increasing 3 4 orders of magnitude due to lower reactivity of o3 than oh dodd et al 2006 prasse et al 2012 the ratios of the k app of independent pathways to the k app total the branching ratios γapp are also calculated table s5 with the increasing ph values from 1 to 14 although the branching ratios of haa and set routes increase to some extents the raf routes are still the most important routes due to lower δg values of raf routes than that of haa and set routes for all species fig s10 therefore the subsequent reactions are mainly focused on the oh adducts 3 2 2 kinetics simulation to estimate the effect of ph on oh and degradation efficiency in uv h2o2 process six kinetic models five single pollutant models and one mixed pollutants model are applied to simulate the degradation processes of the five aromatic acids bases in ultrapure water using the smart kintecus program the associated reactions involved are listed in table s6 and most of the apparent rate constants k app are acquired from previous research results the kinetic modeling results after 10 min at ph 3 0 9 5 are depicted in fig 6 for p hydroxybenzoic acid and p aminophenol fig s11 for phenol aniline and benzoic acid and fig 7 for the mixture of the five pollutants 3 2 2 1 single pollutant models we can see that the degradation efficiency of these aromatic acids bases is also ph dependent but the variation tendency is different from k app figs 6 and s11 this discrepancy can be explained by the variable oh at different ph values the oh at 10 min ranges from 1 99 10 13 to 2 41 10 12 m at ph 3 9 5 in the five systems and the oh decreases continuously with increasing alkalinity therefore the maximal ph values for degradation are the comprehensive results of k app and oh the optimal ph values are around 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid whereas 3 0 7 5 for phenol the relatively stable degradation efficiency value for phenol from 3 0 7 5 is due to the steady k app values ranging from 3 0 7 5 overall slightly acidic or neutral conditions are the optimal ph conditions for the degradation of the five aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 system the order of maximum degradation efficiency is p aminophenol 96 5 aniline 95 5 phenol 94 3 p hydroxybenzoic acid 93 8 benzoic acid 84 9 this order is the same as the k app order for the five compounds at ph 5 8 fig 5 3 2 2 2 mixed pollutants model to investigate the mutual influence of the five compounds on degradation efficiency a mixed solution system of the five pollutants is established the five separate and one total degradation efficiency values are shown in fig 7 the degradation efficiency values of p aminophenol p hydroxybenzoic acid and phenol stabilize at 94 100 at ph 3 9 5 however these values for aniline benzoic acid and total compounds increase as ph rises from 3 to 5 5 decrease as ph rises from 7 5 to 9 5 and stabilize at 100 60 and 91 at ph 5 7 respectively the order of maximum degradation efficiency is p aminophenol 100 aniline 100 phenol 99 4 p hydroxybenzoic acid 98 5 total 91 7 benzoic acid 60 8 which is the same with the tendency of that in single pollutant models however compared with single pollutant models the mixed pollutants model widens the gap between p aminophenol and benzoic acid for the maximum degradation efficiency this indicates that oh prefers to degrade more reactive compounds in mixed solution the optimal ph values are around 5 5 7 5 for aniline benzoic acid and total compounds therefore we suggest that the optimal ph values are 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid 3 0 7 5 for phenol and 5 5 7 5 for mixed pollutants of these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process although the real wastewater may contain many anions i e cl and hco3 which are not included in the simulated models acidic or neutral phs are still our recommendation to degrade these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process 3 3 subsequent reactions of oh adducts in aops the oh adducts of aromatics will undergo a string of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions mei et al 2020 mvula et al 2001 sun et al 2020 wei et al 2019a yamabe and yamazaki 2018 the neutral oh adducts are selected to investigate the subsequent reactions with o2 self decomposition reactions and h2o elimination reactions for phenolic compounds to obtain the main primary conversion stable products 3 3 1 subsequent reactions with o2 and self decomposition reactions the o2 will abstract one h atom from each oh adduct forming hydroxylation product fig s12 these processes are exothermic by 40 17 30 74 kcal mol 1 with energy barriers of 1 07 19 06 kcal mol 1 the self decomposition processes eliminating cooh or nh2 are slightly endothermic by 0 90 4 64 kcal mol 1 with energy barriers of 16 78 25 24 kcal mol 1 therefore the bimolecular reactions with o2 are more feasible compared with self decomposition processes 3 3 2 h2o elimination reactions the ipso ortho meta and para oh adducts of h2 p ha h p ap and h p are selected to investigate the h2o elimination reactions fig s13 these oh adducts could eliminate one h2o molecule forming three corresponding phenoxyl radicals due to the exothermicity of these reactions δg 33 02 16 77 kcal mol 1 however the direct intramolecular reaction pathways are not feasible due to long diatance or large steric hindrance in transition states an et al 2019 yamabe and yamazaki 2018 therefore h2o n molecules are added into the transition states of h2o elimination reactions participating in the bond interchange along hydrogen bonds the optimal numbers of adding water molecules are determined through the oh adducts of h p and the optimal numbers in red are two two three and three for ipso ortho meta and para oh adducts respectively fig s13c although the energy barriers of 20 17 32 27 kcal mol 1 are higher than that of h atom abstraction reactions of o2 the h2o elimination reactions are still possible pathways and then these phenoxyl radicals will undergo the radical radical recombination through barrierless addition of oh yielding hydroxy hexadienones with δg of 54 21 39 89 kcal mol 1 with the assisting of two h2o molecules the hydroxy hexadienones continue to react through h shift generating four hydroxylation products these processes are exothermic by 29 39 24 96 kcal mol 1 with energy barriers of 18 61 26 93 kcal mol 1 the hydroxylation by products obtained above were also detected in relevant experiments benito et al 2017 criquet and leitner 2015 duesteberg and waite 2007 rayaroth et al 2017 the following toxicity evaluation objects include all the five aromatic acids bases and their hydroxylation by products 1 p2 1 p6 for p hydroxybenzoic acid h2 p ha 2 p2 2 p6 for p aminophenol h p ap 3 p2 3 p6 for phenol h p 4 p1 4 p6 for aniline a and 5 p1 5 p6 for benzoic acid h ba 3 4 toxicity evaluation for the purpose of simulating the risk of the selected aromatic acids bases and their hydroxylation by products to ecosystem and human beings the toxicities of these compounds to aquatic organisms fish daphnia and green algae and rat oral are evaluated through ecosar and t e s t programs respectively the available experimental values and corresponding predicted values for acute toxicities of these compounds are shown in fig s14 most of the predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental values the following descriptions of the toxicity change from reactants to products are based on the predicted results 3 4 1 toxicity to aquatic organisms fig 8 a and c present the acute denoted as lc50 ec50 and chronic denoted as chv toxicities of p hydroxybenzoic acid h2 p ha p aminophenol h p ap phenol h p aniline a and benzoic acid h ba according to the criteria listed in table s7 the order of both acute and chronic toxicities is h p ap a h p h2 p ha h ba the h2 p ha is acutely not harmful to fish daphnia lc50 100 mg l 1 acutely harmful to green algae 10 ec50 100 mg l 1 and chronically not harmful to the three aquatic organisms chv 10 mg l 1 h p ap the most toxic compound is classified acutely harmful to fish acutely toxic to green algae acutely very toxic to daphnia chronically toxic to daphnia green algae and chronically very toxic to fish its acute toxicity values are 11 43 0 64 and 1 63 mg l 1 and chronic toxicity values are 0 09 0 14 and 0 26 mg l 1 for fish daphnia and green algae respectively fig 8 b and d show the acute and chronic toxicities of the hydroxylation by products of h2 p ha the acute toxicities to daphnia green algae and chronic toxicities to fish daphnia of 1 p2 1 p6 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid and 1 p3 1 p5 2 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid are lower than that of their parental h2 p ha nevertheless the acute toxicities to fish and chronic toxicities to green algae of these products are higher than that of h2 p ha particularly the product 1 p4 hydroquinone exhibits much higher toxicity than h2 p ha because 1 p4 is toxic and even very toxic 0 1 lc50 ec50 1 mg l 1 0 01 chv 1 mg l 1 to the three aquatic organisms the hydroxylation by products of h p ap h p and a are more or less toxic than their parental compounds fig s15 3 4 2 toxicity to rat the acute toxicities of these compounds to rat oral are also assessed for the evaluation of their risk to mammals according to the criteria set by the european union table s8 the toxicities are shown in fig 9 for the reactants and products of h2 p ha and fig s16 for the products of h p ap h p a and h ba for the reactants h2 p ha is not harmful to rat oral ld50 2000 mg kg 1 and others are harmful to rat oral 200 ld50 2000 mg kg 1 the toxicity order is h p ap h p a h ba h2 p ha which is different from the toxicity order to aquatic organisms however h p ap still possesses the highest toxicity ld50 221 22 mg kg 1 which is on the verge of toxic level all the hydroxylation by products of h2 p ha are harmful to rat e g the ld50 values are 200 2000 mg kg 1 making them more harmful than h2 p ha the products of a are also more harmful to rat oral than a due to lower ld50 values although the hydroxylation by products of h2 p ap are still harmful to rat oral 452 ld50 1034 mg kg 1 their toxicities are lower than h2 p ap the products of h p and h ba are more or less toxic than their parental compounds the follow up transformation reactions are still needed to obtain thorough mineralization for the degradation of the aromatic acids and bases through oh based aops because some hydroxylation by products are still more harmful or toxic to aquatic organisms and rat oral than their parental reactants 4 conclusions in this study we have systematically given the mechanistic and kinetic insights into the ph dependent degradation of five aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process moreover the toxicities of these pollutants and their hydroxylation by products to aquatic organisms and rat oral have been evaluated for risk assessment some detailed conclusions are listed as followings 1 the raf pathways possess lower energy barriers than haa and set pathways for the oh initiated reactions of the 12 ionic neutral species the electron donating groups activate the ortho and para positions for the addition reactions of oh 2 the reactivity of compounds towards oh is positively correlated with electron donating effect of substituents which contributes to the positively ph dependent reactivity of aromatic acids and bases towards oh 3 the hydroxylation apparent rate constants k app at 298 k increase as the ph values increase from about 1 to 10 but they decrease as the ph values increase from about 10 to 14 the raf routes are still the most important routes on the whole ph range although the branching ratios of haa and set routes increase to some extent with the increasing ph values from 1 to 14 4 the order of maximum degradation efficiency of the five aromatic acids bases are almost the same in separate models and mixed model the optimal degradation ph values are 5 5 7 5 for p hydroxybenzoic acid p aminophenol aniline and benzoic acid 3 0 7 5 for phenol and 5 5 7 5 for mixed compounds of these aromatic acids bases in uv h2o2 process 5 a significant number of hydroxylation by products are more toxic or harmful to aquatic organisms and rat oral than their parent pollutants the follow up transformation reactions are still needed to obtain thorough mineralization for the degradation of these aromatic acids and bases through oh based aops this work is helpful to assess the fate of aromatic acids bases in real wastewater by uv h2o2 process at various ph values and assess their environment risk thereby understanding the use of ph values to improve their degradation efficiency declaration of competing

17244,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are transported in the atmosphere leading to both wet and dry deposition to the surface the concentrations of 15 pfas were measured at six locations in the ohio indiana region of the u s during the summer of 2019 and compared to samples collected at a distant site in nw wyoming σpfas concentrations ranged from 50 850 ng l 1 with trifluoroacetic acid tfa being the dominant compound 90 concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorosulfonic acid pfos were similar to amounts observed over the past 20 years indicating persistence in the atmosphere despite regulatory action and the newer species hfpo da genx was also widely detected in rainwater anova modeling and correlation matrices were used to determine association of pfas concentrations location and functional group and chain length statistically significant differences p 0 05 in pfas profiles across sites separated by 10 100 km indicate that local point sources strongly contribute to wet deposition this work introduces correlation plots for pfas that allow rapid visual comparison of multi analyte and multi site data sets graphical abstract image graphical

lengths barzen hanson et al 2017 buck et al 2011 clara et al 2008 the primary pfas species studied have been perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa which are the most commonly regulated pfas lynn wilder phd 2017 however shorter chain c6 compounds such as perfluorobutanoic acid pfba are of emerging concern based on their mobility in the environment due to their greater water solubility and volatility ateia et al 2019 chen et al 2019 the chemical and biological stability of pfas combined with their ongoing transport via the atmosphere tian et al 2018 and hydrosphere houtz

webster et al 2016 atmospheric transport of pfas compounds has led to detection in remote locations including in the high arctic butt et al 2010 macinnis et al 2019 2017 muir et al 2019 antarctic casal et al 2017 vento et al 2012 and oceans ahrens et al 2010 gonzález gaya et al 2014 wang et al 2015a wania 2007 yamashita et al 2008 wet deposition dreyer et al 2010 kwok et al 2010 wang et al 2014 and dry deposition wang et al 2015b have both been identified as modes of pfas accumulation from the atmosphere regional scale studies conducted in japan taniyasu et al 2013 malta sammut et al 2017 the great lakes gewurtz et al 2019 semi rural germany dreyer et al 2010 and switzerland müller et al 2011 measured spatial distributions and consistently detected pfas compounds in precipitation where perfluoroalkyl acid concentrations ranged from 1 ppt to 12 ppt johansson et al 2018 in malta rainwater was identified as the major source of pfas transport to both terrestrial and ocean environments diversity of pfas profiles varied geographically in japan which was attributed to post deposition transformation and the need for careful sampling strategies however two questions remain concerning atmospheric transport of pfas compounds 1 has the voluntary phase out of pfoa and pfos in the eu and us renner 2006 led to a concomitant reduction of these compounds in precipitation janousek et al 2019 2 are pfas compounds well mixed in the atmosphere leading to a global regional homogenous distribution or do local point sources dominate leading to heterogeneity in pfas concentrations in precipitation improved understanding could assist in mitigating pfas transport and exposure herein we have measured a set of 15 pfas concentrations in precipitation across a 450 km regional network of sampling sites in ohio and indiana usa during the summer of 2019 precipitation samples were also co collected in northwestern wyoming a geographically distant location well removed from urban centers perfluoroalkyl compounds measured were c2 and c4 c10 alkyl carboxylates c4 c6 and c8 alkylsulfonates hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da also known as genx and 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate kazil et al 2014 taniyasu et al 2008 wang et al 2014 the analytes were chosen due to their occurrence in other studies cited herein in addition to providing structural diversity including fluoroalkyl chain length and polar functional group identity hfpo da was added since this compound has recently been detected in the region galloway et al 2020 the overall goal of this work was to determine the degree of pfas heterogeneity in regional precipitation previously kwok et al kwok et al 2010 examined 20 pfas in rainwater from japan the united states china india and france collected between 2006 and 2008 samples collected in two cities in japan showed significant positive correlations p 0 05 between most perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas including pfna c9 and pfoa c8 however there was no strong correlation between samples collected in north america and asia similar work has been done across north america scott et al 2006b and elsewhere in asia chen et al 2019 wang et al 2019 2014 associations between pfas species functional group and chain length and location were examined here using anova modeling correlation matrixes constructed using pearson correlation coefficients were also used to determine regional scale differences which is a new application of statistical analysis to study pfas distributions in precipitation this new approach to graphically represent correlations between individual pfas analytes was developed to allow visual analysis of source heterogeneity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling rain samples were collected throughout the summer of 2019 by volunteers at seven different locations ashland rockford shaker heights willoughby and wooster ohio whitestown indiana and jackson hole wyoming these sites were chosen to be spread longitudinally across approximately the same latitude using a volunteer network figure 1 tables s1 and s2 the locations offered a mix of rural ashland rockport suburban shaker heights willoughby whitestown and small scale urban wooster locations sampling sites were roughly oriented along the axis of the prevailing southwesterly winds the jackson hole wy site offered a distant location 2 500 km of roughly equivalent latitude located outside the region and surrounded by 5 000 km2 of undeveloped land of significantly lower population density thus the wy site served as a reference point outside of the midwest all sites were 6 km from a commercial airport or military airfield the sampling site closest to a commercial airport was at jackson hole airport which was 16 8 km ne downwind of the jackson hole sampling location rain samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe tubs sp scienceware surface area 0 215 m2 and stored in hdpe bottles except in wooster oh where a hdpe funnel and carboy surface area 0 343 m2 were used in place of the tub collections took place approximately once a week following rain events and location blanks were collected at the beginning and end of the study at each site 2 2 reagents all pfas standards were obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa except for pfets kanto portland or usa and pfprs and hfpo da wellington guelph on canada the isotopically labelled internal standards listed in table s4 were obtained from wellington lc ms grade methanol was obtained from emd millipore 2 3 sample preparation samples were concentrated using solid phase extraction with oasis wax cartridges 250 mg waters in conjunction with isotopic dilution following previous methods taniyasu et al 2008 water samples generally 0 5 1 l measured by mass were spiked with 100 μl of 56 μg l 1 of each isotopically labeled standard see table s4 cartridges were conditioned with 4 ml methanol with 0 1 ammonia 4 ml methanol and 5 ml di water after application of the water sample and a 5 ml di water rinse elution of pfas was done with 4 ml methanol to elute fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs not analyzed in this work followed by 4 ml methanol 0 1 ammonia to elute anionic pfas analytes into a separate collection tube hdpe lines were used to perform spe and to dry the extracts to avoid trace contaminants from ptfe the eluate was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at room temperature and samples were reconstituted in 250 μl lc ms grade methanol 2 4 pfas analysis analysis of the pfcas carboxylic acids pfsas sulfonic acids and perfluoroalkyl ether acids was performed on an agilent 1200 series hplc coupled with an agilent 6410 qqq ms ms operating in negative ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring see table s7 for transitions the separation was carried out on a 2 0 150 mm rspak jj 50 2d ion exchange column using an isocratic method at 0 300 ml min with 20 80 50 mm ammonium acetate methanol and an injection volume of 25 μl 2 5 qa qc instrumental limits of detection and quantitation are presented in table s6 because the sample preparation procedure concentrated rainwater extracts by a factor of 1 000 the detection limits in rainwater were three orders of magnitude lower ranging from 0 017 ng l 1 for pfhxs to 1 4 ng l 1 for tfa the internal standards listed in table s4 were used to quantify pfas concentrations through the method of isotopic dilution the response factor f was calibrated for each analyte internal standard pair 1 f a p f a s c i s a i s c p f a s where a pfas is the integrated area of the pfas peak a is is the integrated area of the internal standard peak c is is the concentration of the internal standard and c pfas is the concentration of the pfas analyte calibration curves were created with samples ranging from 0 2 to 200 μg l 1 in lc ms grade methanol the ratio of peak areas a pfas a is was plotted against the ratio of concentrations c pfas c is and the response factor f was determined from the slope of the calibration curve with the intercept forced through zero then c pfas in the samples could be determined from the measured peak areas the known concentration of the internal standard and the calibrated response factor the general criterion for quality of fit in the calibration curves was r 2 0 95 recoveries were tested for a subset of ten pfas compounds in a simulated matrix by spiking the pfas standards at 50 ng l 1 the matrix contained humic acid ca2 mg2 na hco3 cl and so4 2 at concentrations of 1 0 10 1 5 14 25 22 and 10 mg l 1 respectively in nanopure water milliq 18 2 mω cm as shown in table s5 the average recoveries ranged from 87 115 except for pfos at 77 and the standard errors for n 5 trials ranged from 3 8 except for pfba at 11 to account for background contamination during sample preparation a method blank of nanopure water and a laboratory fortified blank nanopure water spiked with internal standards were extracted in tandem with each set of samples table s11 presents the mean and range of concentrations detected in the laboratory fortified blanks instrument performance checks at three different concentrations were run after every ten samples throughout the analysis and a sample from each location was also selected to run in triplicate to establish repeatability for the location specific matrices table s9 before modeling was performed compounds that did not have concentrations significantly higher in the rainwater samples than those in the method blanks by a one sided t test p 0 05 were removed from further analysis pfets pfprs pfbs pfhxs and adona approximately half of the compounds had significantly higher concentrations in rainwater than in the location blanks by a t test with p 0 05 tfa pfpea pfhpa pfoa pfprs and hfpo da but we note that the location blanks include contributions from dry deposition a known source of pfas wang et al 2015b concentrations in the blanks were not subtracted from concentrations in the samples 2 6 statistical analysis data analysis was completed using rstudio r version 3 6 2 dodder and mullen 2017 r core team 2013 analysis of variance anova two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks tests degroot and schervish 2012 and correlation matrices were used to analyze the data for the anova analysis a natural log transform was performed on pfas concentration in order to meet the assumption of normality of the residuals thus the independent variable for all modeling was ln pfas or the natural logarithm of the pfas concentration in ng l 1 coefficients and p values for the anova models are provided in the si data below the lod were treated numerically and conclusions were verified via non parametric analyses results were interpreted with respect to a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas occurrence in precipitation pfas were detected in all rainwater samples from all sites concentrations from samples and location blanks are summarized by species and by site in table 1 and table s11 the listed concentrations include the sum of all linear and branched isomers detected for each compound approximate deposition fluxes are estimated in table s10 from the measured concentrations and corresponding rainfall data from the national weather service in general the measurements were consistent with previous work conducted in the united states between 1998 1999 scott et al 2006b and 2006 2008 kim and kannan 2007 kwok et al 2010 in canada between 2002 2004 scott et al 2006b and 2006 2018 gewurtz et al 2019 in japan and hong kong from 2006 2008 kwok et al 2010 in china in 2006 liu et al 2009 and 2016 chen et al 2019 and in germany in 2007 2008 dreyer et al 2010 tfa had the highest detected concentration both overall and at each sampling site among our measurements this observation aligns with earlier studies berg et al 2000 chen et al 2019 römpp et al 2001 scott et al 2006b 2006a taniyasu et al 2008 wang et al 2014 and is reasonable given that tfa is volatile and has multiple sources including refrigerants manufacturing and oxidative degradation of ftohs ellis et al 2004 kazil et al 2014 young and mabury 2010 hfpo da is an emerging pfas of more recent study munoz et al 2019 which notably was detected at each site suggesting widescale transport for several of the pfcas such as hfpo da and pfhpa the chromatograms revealed a mix of linear and branched isomers dependent on the sampling site and the pfas source future studies quantifying the ratio of linear versus branched isomers could inform environmental forensics and source apportionment of pfas contamination 3 2 anova modeling one of our primary objectives was to assess whether localized point sources or atmospheric mixing dominates pfas contributions to wet deposition over the central u s to this end anova modeling was used to test whether the measured pfas concentrations could be predicted by some combination of the following variables pfas species functional group and chain length and location 3 2 1 pfas the identity of the pfas species was shown to be a significant predictor of ln pfas using one way anova modeling in other words pfas species significantly differed in the concentrations detected as noted above the concentration of tfa was consistently 1 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of the other pfas 3 2 2 functional group and chain length functional group carboxylic acids pfcas sulfonic acids pfsas and perfluoroalkyl ether acids and chain length ultrashort c2 short c4 c6 and long c7 c10 were modeled together to avoid overfitting the two way anova results indicate that both variables are significant predictors of ln pfas figure 2 a shows the boxplot of pfas concentrations arranged by functional group and chain length applying tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test to the results the perfluoroalkyl ether acid was determined to be significantly different from the pfcas and pfsa p 0 05 as can be seen in the boxplot in figure 2a however we note that the sulfonic acid and ether acid groups each contained only a single pfas pfos and hfpo da respectively short chain compounds and long chain compounds were not found to be significantly different from one another but ultra short chains i e tfa were predicted to have significantly higher values of ln pfas chain length was expected to have a significant effect on pfas concentrations because shorter chains are more volatile and more water soluble and therefore have been detected in higher concentrations than longer chain pfas in prior measurements of rainwater chen et al 2019 scott et al 2006b taniyasu et al 2008 the historic widespread use of long chain pfas could explain their greater prevalence in our precipitation samples than anticipated based on physical and chemical properties alone 3 2 3 location using a one way anova model location was found to be a significant predictor of ln pfas in other words the different sites showed distinct patterns of pfas concentrations according to tukey s hsd ln pfas was significantly highest in wooster oh see figure s9 concentrations were lowest in whitestown in though they were not significantly lower than in ashland willoughby or rockford oh some variation in concentration across sites was expected based on previous work chen et al 2019 kwok et al 2010 scott et al 2006b for example kwok et al demonstrated that rain collected in different countries showed different pfas species and concentrations but their work focused on global rather than regional transport kwok et al 2010 chen et al tracked pfas in rain across 28 cities in china and also found that pfas concentration and species differed by location indicating different point sources across mainland china chen et al 2019 in our study pfas concentrations were highest at the wooster oh sampling site which was located on the rooftop of the campus science building the campus is located at the center of both the city of wooster and wayne county ohio 1443 km2 where approximately 10 of residents pop 110 000 are employed in the manufacturing sector u s bureau of labor statistics 2020 in contrast the other midwest sampling sites are in rural or suburban residential areas the rooftop location is also near a variety of infrastructure components which may have pfas the higher location blanks at wooster may reflect the sampling site infrastructure most of the precipitation events were summer thunderstorms traveling on prevailing westerly wind flow the ashland oh site is located 40 km to the west of wooster and has statistically different pfas profiles overall the higher density of manufacturing near the wooster site may be the source of the higher pfas concentrations and these observations support the hypothesis that localized pfas sources impact precipitation concentrations future work conducting higher spatial resolution sampling in the wooster region coupled with meteorological analysis of air mass back trajectories may help to better understand localized pfas transport and origins jackson hole wy was selected to be a reference site that was meteorologically distinct from the midwest sampling cluster and located far from urban manufacturing centers interestingly jackson hole wy precipitation had detectable levels of pfas that were not significantly different from pfas concentrations in shaker heights willoughby ashland or rockford oh even though the chemical industry has a much greater presence across ohio than in northwestern wyoming it is possible that non local sources could be contributing to wet deposition of pfas in the rocky mountain region similar to what has been observed over the open pacific ocean taniyasu et al 2013 or there could be local point sources that have not yet been identified further measurements in the region along with air mass trajectories are needed to draw more definitive conclusions about pfas sources in low population regions like wyoming 3 2 4 pfas species and location although we observed interesting groupings in the one way anova model for location the location factor on its own did not explain much of the variation within the data the adjusted r 2 of the one way model was only 0 15 so a two way anova model was tested involving both pfas species and location the two way model had a much improved adjusted r 2 value of 0 70 and both pfas species and location were found to be significant predictors of ln pfas this two way model neglects any interaction between pfas and location for the sake of parsimony and to avoid overfitting figure s10 which displays the pfas concentrations at each sampling site sorted by species reinforces the results discussed above wooster oh had the most samples observed with concentrations greater than 1 ng l 1 and tfa was clearly the dominant species at all locations 3 2 5 functional group chain length and location the final anova model tested was a three way model involving functional group chain length and location figure 2b c groupings identified by tukey s hsd are listed in the si the prominence of ultra short chain pfas i e tfa is again notable in figure 2c the adjusted r 2 value of the three way model was 0 69 and it is the most extendable of the anova models tested 3 3 distribution functions by location to further explore possible effects of point sources on pfas concentrations in wet deposition two sample ks tests were applied to compare the empirical distribution functions for concentrations of pfoa pfos and hfpo da measured at the seven sampling locations compounds with similar empirical distribution functions likely originated from the same point source s the distribution of pfoa was determined to be significantly different p 0 05 between a number of sampling sites figure 3 a shows the empirical distribution functions for pfoa and the test statistics can be found in the si while many of the ohio sites were not determined to have significantly different underlying distributions rockford ashland willoughby wooster s pfoa distribution was different from all the other ohio sites wooster also had the highest detected concentration of pfoa overall in contrast no discernible trend with location was observed in the results from the two sample ks tests with pfos figure 3b the null hypothesis that the underlying pfos empirical distribution functions are the same was rejected for most of the location pairs locations where the null hypothesis was not rejected are not near one another which is surprising and indicates that multiple different point sources may be influencing the concentration of pfos detected however the limited sample size and low statistical power of ks tests must be kept in mind the ks test does not correct for multiple p values so the test is biased toward indicating that two populations are different most interestingly the underlying empirical distribution function of hfpo da figure 3c was determined to be consistent between all locations with p 0 05 we conclude that hfpo da concentrations in wet deposition may not be location dependent hfpo da c4 is more volatile than pfoa and pfos both c8 so hfpo da may more readily undergo long range transport in the atmosphere in contrast pfoa and pfos appear to be more dependent on point sources after the epa s stewardship program came into effect in the early 2000s hfpo da became one of the compounds replacing pfoa in common use if hfpo da transports more easily than legacy pfas then pfas contamination becomes no longer a localized issue 3 4 correlations to infer point sources a key question was to understand if the correlations between pfas concentrations were the same across the ohio indiana region or different due to local point sources the approach used was to determine the correlations between individual ln pfas concentrations at a site figure 4 shows how relationships among the concentrations of all individual pfas were explored across all samples at all sites with pearson s correlation coefficients wei et al 2017 positive correlations depicted by blue circles indicate that the concentrations of two analytes follow each other and potentially share a common source red circles indicate negative correlations whereby one analyte is detected in the absence of the other strong multi analyte positive correlations blue likely indicate common sources perhaps direct emission from a single point source or degradation from a shared atmospheric precursor the absence of correlation white or negative correlations red indicate mixtures of sources accordingly color coded cross correlation matrices provide a means to visualize pfas source heterogeneity in environmental samples collected over time previous rainwater measurements have found similar relationships between specific pfas within urban chen et al 2019 kwok et al 2010 scott et al 2006b rural dreyer et al 2010 and remote sammut et al 2017 environments for example kwok et al observed positive correlations between nearly all the pfcas tracked in two japanese cities kwok et al 2010 in particular pfoa and pfna were strongly correlated but pfoa and pfos were not scott et al also reported positive correlations of pfoa and pfna in samples collected in the united states scott et al 2006b as was observed in samples from the maltese islands sammut et al 2017 a similar trend is seen here for the aggregate sites in figure 4a pfoa and pfna are strongly correlated but the correlation between pfoa and pfos is much weaker chen et al also found strong positive correlations between many of the pfcas they tracked in china chen et al 2019 but no correlations between any of the pfsas here too no strong correlation is observed between pfos and any pfcas in summary strong correlations for pfcas may indicate that these compounds are originating from the same source s while lack of correlation for pfos likely means the species do not come from the same source correlation matrices created for each site show distinct patterns figure 4b g suggesting that different sources contribute at the different locations for example the wooster oh correlation matrix shows strong positive correlations between all pfcas suggesting a common source interestingly the ashland site located just 40 km to the northwest of wooster has a fully different set of correlations a single localized source hypothesis for wooster could explain the higher pfas concentrations that differ in profile and total concentration from the relatively close ashland site other sites are also distinct for example the whitestown in matrix indicates a weak negative relationship between many pfcas suggesting that multiple sources contribute to the concentrations of analytes such as pfpea and pfda in precipitation in whitestown just as was observed in the aggregate data pfoa and pfna are positively correlated at each individual location though the correlation is only weakly observed for samples collected in willoughby oh pfoa and pfna are both degradation products of 8 2 ftuca which is an oxidation product of 8 2 ftoh ellis et al 2004 in precipitation previously collected in north america a correlation among 8 2 ftuca pfoa and pfna was observed scott et al 2006b however no correlation was observed with 8 2 ftuca in rainwater from japan kwok et al 2010 further work to directly quantify ftohs is needed to evaluate whether ftoh degradation was a significant source of atmospheric pfas in our wet deposition samples notably rockford oh presents fewer correlations than other sampling locations this result could indicate that multiple nearby point sources impact the location alternatively the lack of correlation could be due to other sampling conditions such as changes in wind direction which was not tracked finally as this sampling site had the lowest concentrations overall there may have been insufficient data to establish clear correlations rockford is a small town with a population of only 1 000 residents and the nearest major metropolitan area fort wayne in is located 45 km away in the small scale urban environment of wooster oh where pfas concentrations were highest the strong positive correlations observed between all the pfcas point toward a common unknown point source in summary the correlation matrices provide a snapshot of the relative concentrations of pfas at each site the strong correlations observed at multiple locations between pfas reinforce the significance of point sources 3 5 implications pfas were detected in samples collected at all sites although remediation often focuses on local point sources the ability of pfas to undergo atmospheric transport and partition into rainwater makes the issue a global concern interestingly concentrations detected in these samples from 2019 0 1 10 ng l 1 were consistent with other north american studies performed between 1999 and 2004 scott et al 2006b and in 2006 barton et al 2007 notably the concentration of pfoa has not decreased meaningfully whereas the concentration of pfba has increased notably this trend indicates that the epa s stewardship program fact sheet 2010 2015 pfoa stewardship program 2006 has not been fully effective in removing pfoa from the environment and may have had the unintended consequence of increasing the use of other pfas such as pfba and hfpo da tfa was detected in highest concentration and may be present from either direct release or as a decomposition product of organic fluorinated and chlorinated substances berg et al 2000 solomon et al 2016 we note that all analysis in this work has been conducted on pfas concentrations rather than fluxes which incorporate contributions from the volume of precipitation during the sampling period and the surface area of the sampling vessel the precipitation volume matters because prior work has shown that pfas often wash out within the first mm of precipitation taniyasu et al 2013 we collected insufficient data from our volunteer citizen science network to calculate fluxes but we estimate that precipitation volumes varied by at most 3 fold thus concentration and flux are within an order of magnitude the surface area of our collection vessels was the same at all sites except for wooster where the vessel used was about 1 6 times larger than at the other sites this difference does not appear to be sufficient to fully account for the higher concentrations of pfas measured at wooster than at the other sites for example the mean concentration of pfba is still between 7 54 times greater at wooster than at any other site even after scaling down the wooster value by 60 finally we note that our reported pfas concentrations include contributions from dry deposition which we estimate to be minimal for most species based on location blank measurements table s11 a full treatment of fluxes is provided in the supporting information briefly table s10 presents approximate fluxes that have been estimated from precipitation statistics reported by the national weather service at surrounding stations there are no significant changes to the trends observed for pfas fluxes in comparison to the trends already noted for pfas concentrations to extend the analysis to be independent of precipitation volume we compared relative pfas concentrations normalized against the concentration of pfba one of the most abundant pfas detected in our samples that also had an available mass labelled internal standard when the concentrations of pfas were normalized to that of pfba pfas identity and location each remained significant predictors of ln pfas according to separate one way anova models functional group and chain length were significant according to the two way anova model as were pfas and location and location functional group and chain length were significant according to the three way anova model with r 2 0 61 figure s3 shows the related boxplots for the normalized pfas concentrations these more robust results confirm the findings already presented here for absolute concentrations future experiments are planned to explore pfas sources in our samples by quantifying isomers and ftohs the chromatograms for the samples in this study showed evidence of multiple isomers for hfpo da and several of the pfcas these isomeric fingerprints could possibly be used to trace pfas sources because different manufacturing processes produce different ratios of linear versus branched isomers benskin et al 2010 de silva et al 2009 johansson et al 2018 degradation mechanisms of pfas could further contribute to isomeric enrichment for example ftohs form solely linear pfcas when they undergo oxidative degradation ellis et al 2004 possible links between isomeric fingerprints and pfas sources should be explored in future studies we also hope to incorporate additional pfas analytes and branched isomer fluxes into future models correlations between a broader range of pfas precursors and pfcas could support the hypothesis that atmospheric degradation is a source of pfas at the locations under study identifying the sources of pfas is useful for both regulation and remediation if pfas precursors such as perfluorooctane sulfonamide pfosa and other sulfonamide based related compounds could be appreciable sources of pfoa and pfos then any regulation which targets pfoa and pfos but not their precursors should be further evaluated 4 conclusions this study provided regional scale data indicating the importance of local point sources on pfas profiles in precipitation as local sources were determined to be significant the results imply that local action can have an impact on pfas contamination in precipitation a three way anova model determined that functional group chain length and location were significant predictors of pfas concentrations tfa was the most concentrated pfas detected at every location highlighting the contributions of volatility in pfas transport the strong correlation of multiple pfas across several sites suggests that local point sources are important to the pfas concentration in regional rainfall accordingly the data suggest that mitigation of local

17244,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are transported in the atmosphere leading to both wet and dry deposition to the surface the concentrations of 15 pfas were measured at six locations in the ohio indiana region of the u s during the summer of 2019 and compared to samples collected at a distant site in nw wyoming σpfas concentrations ranged from 50 850 ng l 1 with trifluoroacetic acid tfa being the dominant compound 90 concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorosulfonic acid pfos were similar to amounts observed over the past 20 years indicating persistence in the atmosphere despite regulatory action and the newer species hfpo da genx was also widely detected in rainwater anova modeling and correlation matrices were used to determine association of pfas concentrations location and functional group and chain length statistically significant differences p 0 05 in pfas profiles across sites separated by 10 100 km indicate that local point sources strongly contribute to wet deposition this work introduces correlation plots for pfas that allow rapid visual comparison of multi analyte and multi site data sets graphical abstract image graphical

2014 and dry deposition wang et al 2015b have both been identified as modes of pfas accumulation from the atmosphere regional scale studies conducted in japan taniyasu et al 2013 malta sammut et al 2017 the great lakes gewurtz et al 2019 semi rural germany dreyer et al 2010 and switzerland müller et al 2011 measured spatial distributions and consistently detected pfas compounds in precipitation where perfluoroalkyl acid concentrations ranged from 1 ppt to 12 ppt johansson et al 2018 in malta rainwater was identified as the major source of pfas transport to both terrestrial and ocean environments diversity of pfas profiles varied geographically in japan which was attributed to post deposition transformation and the need for careful sampling strategies however two questions remain concerning atmospheric transport of pfas compounds 1 has the voluntary phase out of pfoa and pfos in the eu and us renner 2006 led to a concomitant reduction of these compounds in precipitation janousek et al 2019 2 are pfas compounds well mixed in the atmosphere leading to a global regional homogenous distribution or do local point sources dominate leading to heterogeneity in pfas concentrations in precipitation improved understanding could assist in mitigating pfas transport and exposure herein we have measured a set of 15 pfas concentrations in precipitation across a 450 km regional network of sampling sites in ohio and indiana usa during the summer of 2019 precipitation samples were also co collected in northwestern wyoming a geographically distant location well removed from urban centers perfluoroalkyl compounds measured were c2 and c4 c10 alkyl carboxylates c4 c6 and c8 alkylsulfonates hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da also known as genx and 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate kazil et al 2014 taniyasu et al 2008 wang et al 2014 the analytes were chosen due to their occurrence in other studies cited herein in addition to providing structural diversity including fluoroalkyl chain length and polar functional group identity hfpo da was added since this compound has recently been detected in the region galloway et al 2020 the overall goal of this work was to determine the degree of pfas heterogeneity in regional precipitation previously kwok et al kwok et al 2010 examined 20 pfas in rainwater from japan the united states china india and france collected between 2006 and 2008 samples collected in two cities in japan showed significant positive correlations p 0 05 between most perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas including pfna c9 and pfoa c8 however there was no strong correlation between samples collected in north america and asia similar work has been done across north america scott et al 2006b and elsewhere in asia chen et al 2019 wang et al 2019 2014 associations between pfas species functional group and chain length and location were examined here using anova modeling correlation matrixes constructed using pearson correlation coefficients were also used to determine regional scale differences which is a new application of statistical analysis to study pfas distributions in precipitation this new approach to graphically represent correlations between individual pfas analytes was developed to allow visual analysis of source heterogeneity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling rain samples were collected throughout the summer of 2019 by volunteers at seven different locations ashland rockford shaker heights willoughby and wooster ohio whitestown indiana and jackson hole wyoming these sites were chosen to be spread longitudinally across approximately the same latitude using a volunteer network figure 1 tables s1 and s2 the locations offered a mix of rural ashland rockport suburban shaker heights willoughby whitestown and small scale urban wooster locations sampling sites were roughly oriented along the axis of the prevailing southwesterly winds the jackson hole wy site offered a distant location 2 500 km of roughly equivalent latitude located outside the region and surrounded by 5 000 km2 of undeveloped land of significantly lower population density thus the wy site served as a reference point outside of the midwest all sites were 6 km from a commercial airport or military airfield the sampling site closest to a commercial airport was at jackson hole airport which was 16 8 km ne downwind of the jackson hole sampling location rain samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe tubs sp scienceware surface area 0 215 m2 and stored in hdpe bottles except in wooster oh where a hdpe funnel and carboy surface area 0 343 m2 were used in place of the tub collections took place approximately once a week following rain events and location blanks were collected at the beginning and end of the study at each site 2 2 reagents all pfas standards were obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa except for pfets kanto portland or usa and pfprs and hfpo da wellington guelph on canada the isotopically labelled internal standards listed in table s4 were obtained from wellington lc ms grade methanol was obtained from emd millipore 2 3 sample preparation samples were concentrated using solid phase extraction with oasis wax cartridges 250 mg waters in conjunction with isotopic dilution following previous methods taniyasu et al 2008 water samples generally 0 5 1 l measured by mass were spiked with 100 μl of 56 μg l 1 of each isotopically labeled standard see table s4 cartridges were conditioned with 4 ml methanol with 0 1 ammonia 4 ml methanol and 5 ml di water after application of the water sample and a 5 ml di water rinse elution of pfas was done with 4 ml methanol to elute fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs not analyzed in this work followed by 4 ml methanol 0 1 ammonia to elute anionic pfas analytes into a separate collection tube hdpe lines were used to perform spe and to dry the extracts to avoid trace contaminants from ptfe the eluate was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at room temperature and samples were reconstituted in 250 μl lc ms grade methanol 2 4 pfas analysis analysis of the pfcas carboxylic acids pfsas sulfonic acids and perfluoroalkyl ether acids was performed on an agilent 1200 series hplc coupled with an agilent 6410 qqq ms ms operating in negative ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring see table s7 for transitions the separation was carried out on a 2 0 150 mm rspak jj 50 2d ion exchange column using an isocratic method at 0 300 ml min with 20 80 50 mm ammonium acetate methanol and an injection volume of 25 μl 2 5 qa qc instrumental limits of detection and quantitation are presented in table s6 because the sample preparation procedure concentrated rainwater extracts by a factor of 1 000 the detection limits in rainwater were three orders of magnitude lower ranging from 0 017 ng l 1 for pfhxs to 1 4 ng l 1 for tfa the internal standards listed in table s4 were used to quantify pfas concentrations through the method of isotopic dilution the response factor f was calibrated for each analyte internal standard pair 1 f a p f a s c i s a i s c p f a s where a pfas is the integrated area of the pfas peak a is is the integrated area of the internal standard peak c is is the concentration of the internal standard and c pfas is the concentration of the pfas analyte calibration curves were created with samples ranging from 0 2 to 200 μg l 1 in lc ms grade methanol the ratio of peak areas a pfas a is was plotted against the ratio of concentrations c pfas c is and the response factor f was determined from the slope of the calibration curve with the intercept forced through zero then c pfas in the samples could be determined from the measured peak areas the known concentration of the internal standard and the calibrated response factor the general criterion for quality of fit in the calibration curves was r 2 0 95 recoveries were tested for a subset of ten pfas compounds in a simulated matrix by spiking the pfas standards at 50 ng l 1 the matrix contained humic acid ca2 mg2 na hco3 cl and so4 2 at concentrations of 1 0 10 1 5 14 25 22 and 10 mg l 1 respectively in nanopure water milliq 18 2 mω cm as shown in table s5 the average recoveries ranged from 87 115 except for pfos at 77 and the standard errors for n 5 trials ranged from 3 8 except for pfba at 11 to account for background contamination during sample preparation a method blank of nanopure water and a laboratory fortified blank nanopure water spiked with internal standards were extracted in tandem with each set of samples table s11 presents the mean and range of concentrations detected in the laboratory fortified blanks instrument performance checks at three different concentrations were run after every ten samples throughout the analysis and a sample from each location was also selected to run in triplicate to establish repeatability for the location specific matrices table s9 before modeling was performed compounds that did not have concentrations significantly higher in the rainwater samples than those in the method blanks by a one sided t test p 0 05 were removed from further analysis pfets pfprs pfbs pfhxs and adona approximately half of the compounds had significantly higher concentrations in rainwater than in the location blanks by a t test with p 0 05 tfa pfpea pfhpa pfoa pfprs and hfpo da but we note that the location blanks include contributions from dry deposition a known source of pfas wang et al 2015b concentrations in the blanks were not subtracted from concentrations in the samples 2 6 statistical analysis data analysis was completed using rstudio r version 3 6 2 dodder and mullen 2017 r core team 2013 analysis of variance anova two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks tests degroot and schervish 2012 and correlation matrices were used to analyze the data for the anova analysis a natural log transform was performed on pfas concentration in order to meet the assumption of normality of the residuals thus the independent variable for all modeling was ln pfas or the natural logarithm of the pfas concentration in ng l 1 coefficients and p values for the anova models are provided in the si data below the lod were treated numerically and conclusions were verified via non parametric analyses results were interpreted with respect to a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas occurrence in precipitation pfas were detected in all rainwater samples from all sites concentrations from samples and location blanks are summarized by species and by site in table 1 and table s11 the listed concentrations include the sum of all linear and branched isomers detected for each compound approximate deposition fluxes are estimated in table s10 from the measured concentrations and corresponding rainfall data from the national weather service in general the measurements were consistent with previous work conducted in the united states between 1998 1999 scott et al 2006b and 2006 2008 kim and kannan 2007 kwok et al 2010 in canada between 2002 2004 scott et al 2006b and 2006 2018 gewurtz et al 2019 in japan and hong kong from 2006 2008 kwok et al 2010 in china in 2006 liu et al 2009 and 2016 chen et al 2019 and in germany in 2007 2008 dreyer et al 2010 tfa had the highest detected concentration both overall and at each sampling site among our measurements this observation aligns with earlier studies berg et al 2000 chen et al 2019 römpp et al 2001 scott et al 2006b 2006a taniyasu et al 2008 wang et al 2014 and is reasonable given that tfa is volatile and has multiple sources including refrigerants manufacturing and oxidative degradation of ftohs ellis et al 2004 kazil et al 2014 young and mabury 2010 hfpo da is an emerging pfas of more recent study munoz et al 2019 which notably was detected at each site suggesting widescale transport for several of the pfcas such as hfpo da and pfhpa the chromatograms revealed a mix of linear and branched isomers dependent on the sampling site and the pfas source future studies quantifying the ratio of linear versus branched isomers could inform environmental forensics and source apportionment of pfas contamination 3 2 anova modeling one of our primary objectives was to assess whether localized point sources or atmospheric mixing dominates pfas contributions to wet deposition over the central u s to this end anova modeling was used to test whether the measured pfas concentrations could be predicted by some combination of the following variables pfas species functional group and chain length and location 3 2 1 pfas the identity of the pfas species was shown to be a significant predictor of ln pfas using one way anova modeling in other words pfas species significantly differed in the concentrations detected as noted above the concentration of tfa was consistently 1 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of the other pfas 3 2 2 functional group and chain length functional group carboxylic acids pfcas sulfonic acids pfsas and perfluoroalkyl ether acids and chain length ultrashort c2 short c4 c6 and long c7 c10 were modeled together to avoid overfitting the two way anova results indicate that both variables are significant predictors of ln pfas figure 2 a shows the boxplot of pfas concentrations arranged by functional group and chain length applying tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test to the results the perfluoroalkyl ether acid was determined to be significantly different from the pfcas and pfsa p 0 05 as can be seen in the boxplot in figure 2a however we note that the sulfonic acid and ether acid groups each contained only a single pfas pfos and hfpo da respectively short chain compounds and long chain compounds were not found to be significantly different from one another but ultra short chains i e tfa were predicted to have significantly higher values of ln pfas chain length was expected to have a significant effect on pfas concentrations because shorter chains are more volatile and more water soluble and therefore have been detected in higher concentrations than longer chain pfas in prior measurements of rainwater chen et al 2019 scott et al 2006b taniyasu et al 2008 the historic widespread use of long chain pfas could explain their greater prevalence in our precipitation samples than anticipated based on physical and chemical properties alone 3 2 3 location using a one way anova model location was found to be a significant predictor of ln pfas in other words the different sites showed distinct patterns of pfas concentrations according to tukey s hsd ln pfas was significantly highest in wooster oh see figure s9 concentrations were lowest in whitestown in though they were not significantly lower than in ashland willoughby or rockford oh some variation in concentration across sites was expected based on previous work chen et al 2019 kwok et al 2010 scott et al 2006b for example kwok et al demonstrated that rain collected in different countries showed different pfas species and concentrations but their work focused on global rather than regional transport kwok et al 2010 chen et al tracked pfas in rain across 28 cities in china and also found that pfas concentration and species differed by location indicating different point sources across mainland china chen et al 2019 in our study pfas concentrations were highest at the wooster oh sampling site which was located on the rooftop of the campus science building the campus is located at the center of both the city of wooster and wayne county ohio 1443 km2 where approximately 10 of residents pop 110 000 are employed in the manufacturing sector u s bureau of labor statistics 2020 in contrast the other midwest sampling sites are in rural or suburban residential areas the rooftop location is also near a variety of infrastructure components which may have pfas the higher location blanks at wooster may reflect the sampling site infrastructure most of the precipitation events were summer thunderstorms traveling on prevailing westerly wind flow the ashland oh site is located 40 km to the west of wooster and has statistically different pfas profiles overall the higher density of manufacturing near the wooster site may be the source of the higher pfas concentrations and these observations support the hypothesis that localized pfas sources impact precipitation concentrations future work conducting higher spatial resolution sampling in the wooster region coupled with meteorological analysis of air mass back trajectories may help to better understand localized pfas transport and origins jackson hole wy was selected to be a reference site that was meteorologically distinct from the midwest sampling cluster and located far from urban manufacturing centers interestingly jackson hole wy precipitation had detectable levels of pfas that were not significantly different from pfas concentrations in shaker heights willoughby ashland or rockford oh even though the chemical industry has a much greater presence across ohio than in northwestern wyoming it is possible that non local sources could be contributing to wet deposition of pfas in the rocky mountain region similar to what has been observed over the open pacific ocean taniyasu et al 2013 or there could be local point sources that have not yet been identified further measurements in the region along with air mass trajectories are needed to draw more definitive conclusions about pfas sources in low population regions like wyoming 3 2 4 pfas species and location although we observed interesting groupings in the one way anova model for location the location factor on its own did not explain much of the variation within the data the adjusted r 2 of the one way model was only 0 15 so a two way anova model was tested involving both pfas species and location the two way model had a much improved adjusted r 2 value of 0 70 and both pfas species and location were found to be significant predictors of ln pfas this two way model neglects any interaction between pfas and location for the sake of parsimony and to avoid overfitting figure s10 which displays the pfas concentrations at each sampling site sorted by species reinforces the results discussed above wooster oh had the most samples observed with concentrations greater than 1 ng l 1 and tfa was clearly the dominant species at all locations 3 2 5 functional group chain length and location the final anova model tested was a three way model involving functional group chain length and location figure 2b c groupings identified by tukey s hsd are listed in the si the prominence of ultra short chain pfas i e tfa is again notable in figure 2c the adjusted r 2 value of the three way model was 0 69 and it is the most extendable of the anova models tested 3 3 distribution functions by location to further explore possible effects of point sources on pfas concentrations in wet deposition two sample ks tests were applied to compare the empirical distribution functions for concentrations of pfoa pfos and hfpo da measured at the seven sampling locations compounds with similar empirical distribution functions likely originated from the same point source s the distribution of pfoa was determined to be significantly different p 0 05 between a number of sampling sites figure 3 a shows the empirical distribution functions for pfoa and the test statistics can be found in the si while many of the ohio sites were not determined to have significantly different underlying distributions rockford ashland willoughby wooster s pfoa distribution was different from all the other ohio sites wooster also had the highest detected concentration of pfoa overall in contrast no discernible trend with location was observed in the results from the two sample ks tests with pfos figure 3b the null hypothesis that the underlying pfos empirical distribution functions are the same was rejected for most of the location pairs locations where the null hypothesis was not rejected are not near one another which is surprising and indicates that multiple different point sources may be influencing the concentration of pfos detected however the limited sample size and low statistical power of ks tests must be kept in mind the ks test does not correct for multiple p values so the test is biased toward indicating that two populations are different most interestingly the underlying empirical distribution function of hfpo da figure 3c was determined to be consistent between all locations with p 0 05 we conclude that hfpo da concentrations in wet deposition may not be location dependent hfpo da c4 is more volatile than pfoa and pfos both c8 so hfpo da may more readily undergo long range transport in the atmosphere in contrast pfoa and pfos appear to be more dependent on point sources after the epa s stewardship program came into effect in the early 2000s hfpo da became one of the compounds replacing pfoa in common use if hfpo da transports more easily than legacy pfas then pfas contamination becomes no longer a localized issue 3 4 correlations to infer point sources a key question was to understand if the correlations between pfas concentrations were the same across the ohio indiana region or different due to local point sources the approach used was to determine the correlations between individual ln pfas concentrations at a site figure 4 shows how relationships among the concentrations of all individual pfas were explored across all samples at all sites with pearson s correlation coefficients wei et al 2017 positive correlations depicted by blue circles indicate that the concentrations of two analytes follow each other and potentially share a common source red circles indicate negative correlations whereby one analyte is detected in the absence of the other strong multi analyte positive correlations blue likely indicate common sources perhaps direct emission from a single point source or degradation from a shared atmospheric precursor the absence of correlation white or negative correlations red indicate mixtures of sources accordingly color coded cross correlation matrices provide a means to visualize pfas source heterogeneity in environmental samples collected over time previous rainwater measurements have found similar relationships between specific pfas within urban chen et al 2019 kwok et al 2010 scott et al 2006b rural dreyer et al 2010 and remote sammut et al 2017 environments for example kwok et al observed positive correlations between nearly all the pfcas tracked in two japanese cities kwok et al 2010 in particular pfoa and pfna were strongly correlated but pfoa and pfos were not scott et al also reported positive correlations of pfoa and pfna in samples collected in the united states scott et al 2006b as was observed in samples from the maltese islands sammut et al 2017 a similar trend is seen here for the aggregate sites in figure 4a pfoa and pfna are strongly correlated but the correlation between pfoa and pfos is much weaker chen et al also found strong positive correlations between many of the pfcas they tracked in china chen et al 2019 but no correlations between any of the pfsas here too no strong correlation is observed between pfos and any pfcas in summary strong correlations for pfcas may indicate that these compounds are originating from the same source s while lack of correlation for pfos likely means the species do not come from the same source correlation matrices created for each site show distinct patterns figure 4b g suggesting that different sources contribute at the different locations for example the wooster oh correlation matrix shows strong positive correlations between all pfcas suggesting a common source interestingly the ashland site located just 40 km to the northwest of wooster has a fully different set of correlations a single localized source hypothesis for wooster could explain the higher pfas concentrations that differ in profile and total concentration from the relatively close ashland site other sites are also distinct for example the whitestown in matrix indicates a weak negative relationship between many pfcas suggesting that multiple sources contribute to the concentrations of analytes such as pfpea and pfda in precipitation in whitestown just as was observed in the aggregate data pfoa and pfna are positively correlated at each individual location though the correlation is only weakly observed for samples collected in willoughby oh pfoa and pfna are both degradation products of 8 2 ftuca which is an oxidation product of 8 2 ftoh ellis et al 2004 in precipitation previously collected in north america a correlation among 8 2 ftuca pfoa and pfna was observed scott et al 2006b however no correlation was observed with 8 2 ftuca in rainwater from japan kwok et al 2010 further work to directly quantify ftohs is needed to evaluate whether ftoh degradation was a significant source of atmospheric pfas in our wet deposition samples notably rockford oh presents fewer correlations than other sampling locations this result could indicate that multiple nearby point sources impact the location alternatively the lack of correlation could be due to other sampling conditions such as changes in wind direction which was not tracked finally as this sampling site had the lowest concentrations overall there may have been insufficient data to establish clear correlations rockford is a small town with a population of only 1 000 residents and the nearest major metropolitan area fort wayne in is located 45 km away in the small scale urban environment of wooster oh where pfas concentrations were highest the strong positive correlations observed between all the pfcas point toward a common unknown point source in summary the correlation matrices provide a snapshot of the relative concentrations of pfas at each site the strong correlations observed at multiple locations between pfas reinforce the significance of point sources 3 5 implications pfas were detected in samples collected at all sites although remediation often focuses on local point sources the ability of pfas to undergo atmospheric transport and partition into rainwater makes the issue a global concern interestingly concentrations detected in these samples from 2019 0 1 10 ng l 1 were consistent with other north american studies performed between 1999 and 2004 scott et al 2006b and in 2006 barton et al 2007 notably the concentration of pfoa has not decreased meaningfully whereas the concentration of pfba has increased notably this trend indicates that the epa s stewardship program fact sheet 2010 2015 pfoa stewardship program 2006 has not been fully effective in removing pfoa from the environment and may have had the unintended consequence of increasing the use of other pfas such as pfba and hfpo da tfa was detected in highest concentration and may be present from either direct release or as a decomposition product of organic fluorinated and chlorinated substances berg et al 2000 solomon et al 2016 we note that all analysis in this work has been conducted on pfas concentrations rather than fluxes which incorporate contributions from the volume of precipitation during the sampling period and the surface area of the sampling vessel the precipitation volume matters because prior work has shown that pfas often wash out within the first mm of precipitation taniyasu et al 2013 we collected insufficient data from our volunteer citizen science network to calculate fluxes but we estimate that precipitation volumes varied by at most 3 fold thus concentration and flux are within an order of magnitude the surface area of our collection vessels was the same at all sites except for wooster where the vessel used was about 1 6 times larger than at the other sites this difference does not appear to be sufficient to fully account for the higher concentrations of pfas measured at wooster than at the other sites for example the mean concentration of pfba is still between 7 54 times greater at wooster than at any other site even after scaling down the wooster value by 60 finally we note that our reported pfas concentrations include contributions from dry deposition which we estimate to be minimal for most species based on location blank measurements table s11 a full treatment of fluxes is provided in the supporting information briefly table s10 presents approximate fluxes that have been estimated from precipitation statistics reported by the national weather service at surrounding stations there are no significant changes to the trends observed for pfas fluxes in comparison to the trends already noted for pfas concentrations to extend the analysis to be independent of precipitation volume we compared relative pfas concentrations normalized against the concentration of pfba one of the most abundant pfas detected in our samples that also had an available mass labelled internal standard when the concentrations of pfas were normalized to that of pfba pfas identity and location each remained significant predictors of ln pfas according to separate one way anova models functional group and chain length were significant according to the two way anova model as were pfas and location and location functional group and chain length were significant according to the three way anova model with r 2 0 61 figure s3 shows the related boxplots for the normalized pfas concentrations these more robust results confirm the findings already presented here for absolute concentrations future experiments are planned to explore pfas sources in our samples by quantifying isomers and ftohs the chromatograms for the samples in this study showed evidence of multiple isomers for hfpo da and several of the pfcas these isomeric fingerprints could possibly be used to trace pfas sources because different manufacturing processes produce different ratios of linear versus branched isomers benskin et al 2010 de silva et al 2009 johansson et al 2018 degradation mechanisms of pfas could further contribute to isomeric enrichment for example ftohs form solely linear pfcas when they undergo oxidative degradation ellis et al 2004 possible links between isomeric fingerprints and pfas sources should be explored in future studies we also hope to incorporate additional pfas analytes and branched isomer fluxes into future models correlations between a broader range of pfas precursors and pfcas could support the hypothesis that atmospheric degradation is a source of pfas at the locations under study identifying the sources of pfas is useful for both regulation and remediation if pfas precursors such as perfluorooctane sulfonamide pfosa and other sulfonamide based related compounds could be appreciable sources of pfoa and pfos then any regulation which targets pfoa and pfos but not their precursors should be further evaluated 4 conclusions this study provided regional scale data indicating the importance of local point sources on pfas profiles in precipitation as local sources were determined to be significant the results imply that local action can have an impact on pfas contamination in precipitation a three way anova model determined that functional group chain length and location were significant predictors of pfas concentrations tfa was the most concentrated pfas detected at every location highlighting the contributions of volatility in pfas transport the strong correlation of multiple pfas across several sites suggests that local point sources are important to the pfas concentration in regional rainfall accordingly the data suggest that mitigation of local
