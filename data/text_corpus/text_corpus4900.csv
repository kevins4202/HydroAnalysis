24500,that tree species mixing may strongly affect tree structure and tree growth is so far hardly considered in tree and stand models hence for a better understanding and design of mixed species stands the inter specific facilitation and competition needs better representation in individual tree models here we show for the five most common tree species combinations in central europe that mixing causes facilitation and competition reduction in mixed stands and how such effects can be implemented in individual tree stem diameter growth models this study was based on 62 long term experimental plots belonging to 10 chronosequences in germany with repeated spatially explicit stand inventories from 1991 to 2016 they covered monospecific and mixed species stands of norway spruce picea abies l karst scots pine pinus sylvestris l european beech fagus sylvatica l sessile oak quercus petraea matt liebl european ash fraxinus excelsior l and sycomore maple acer pseudoplatanus l the study represented medium and high qualitative site conditions fully stocked or only moderately thinned stands of 22 238 years of age and the mixing patterns ranged from individual tree to cluster mixtures based on spatially explicit measurements we quantified for each tree the intra or interspecific neighborhood local stand density and growth we applied mixed models to analyze how inter specific neighborhood modified tree growth first we showed that the inter specific neighborhood can increase tree growth significantly beyond the level of open grown trees in intra specific neighborhoods net faciltation the potential growth rates of the fastest growing trees in mixed stands were 14 78 higher compared to monospecific stands matched for size crown and site index the mixing effect differed between species combinations second we provided evidence that mixing on average reduced competition by 16 and that this effect increased with the mixing proportion in four out of the five species combinations we observed a competition reduction of both associated tree species mutualistic relationship third for the mixtures of norway spruce european beech and sessile oak european beech that covered a broader range of site conditions we found a mainly positive modulation of facilitation and competition depending on site conditions we discussed the potential causes for the observed facilitation and competition reduction their implementation in tree growth models and the relevance of the findings for the design and management of mixed species stands graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords facilitation competition competition reduction canopy density niche complementarity individual tree model growth modifier 1 introduction the widely used individual tree models for forest stands represent a bottom up approach which starts with the individuals of a system ends at the stand level and aims to understand and predict how a stand s properties emerge from the interaction between its trees weiskittel et al 2011 grimm 1999 the core of most of these models is a potential modifier algorithm burkhart and tomé 2012 biging and dobbertin 1995 moore 1989 botkin et al 1972 the potential modifier approach is based on the potential tree growth expected without competition and this potential growth is modified according to the current competition by neighbors the prediction of growth and mortality of all individuals the ingrowth of regeneration and the consideration of management interventions enables a simulation of the stand dynamics in 1 or 5 year increments or other time intervals previous literature provides excellent overviews of such models weiskittel et al 2011 their evaluation mette et al 2009 and their application in science grimm 1999 and forest management hilmers et al 2020 weiskittel et al 2016 pretzsch et al 2002 since their introduction individual tree growth models have greatly facilitated insights into the patterns and processes in forest ecosystems grimm 1999 shugart 1984 shugart and west 1981 however their impact on forest management was initially low due to the scarce information on initialization and parameterization the limited computing power available for their application and their limited added value for the mass oriented forestry with homogeneuos monocultures that was dominating in the past then the following five trends substantially promoted the application of individual tree growth models in forest management and planning over the last decades first individual tree based forest experiments forest inventories and remote sensing techniques strongly improved the database for analyzing and modeling individual tree growth nagel et al 2012 second computing capacity rapidly increased allowing for individual tree based scenario analyses at the regional national or even global level using microcomputers third many forests have been transformed from homogeneous to more heterogeneous stands del rio et al 2016 reventlow et al 2021 pommerening and murphy 2004 whereas monocultures may be abstracted by mean characteristics or frequency distribution models multi layered mixed species stands are better modeled using individual tree approaches coates et al 2013 fourth the paradigm shift from mass oriented forestry to multipurpose approaches has been accompanied by spatially explicit individual tree models the latter enable the prediction of structural heterogeneity wood quality micro habitats and even recreational and esthetic values pretzsch et al 2006 fifth the individual tree approach aligns well with many innovative prescriptions to silviculturally steer complex forest stands bravo et al 2019 these five trends have resulted in a boom in the development and use of individual tree models in forest management examples of this development include the models heureka wikström et al 2011 bwinpro by nagel et al 2006 prognaus ledermann 2004 sterba and monserud 1997 and silva pretzsch et al 2002 2008 in view of the establishment and silvicultural steering of even more heterogeneous mixed forest stands most existing individual tree models appear as an oversimplification as they often neglect species interactions pretzsch et al 2015 this study aims to contribute to the adaptation of existing individual tree models to the needs of forest science and practice we address an improved integration of tree species mixing effects in particular the effects of inter specific facilitation and competition reduction fig 1 visualizes the basic relationship of the potential modifier approach commonly used in individual tree growth models the potential modifier approach is competition based and assumes that the rate of tree size growth peaks when trees grow open solitarily and with no or only little competition the growth rate of open grown trees is assumed to be the potential growth and set to 1 0 in fig 1 the absolute level of the potential growth is certainly depending among others on the tree species the respective site conditions and the crown size however most models assume that any competition quantified e g by competition indices or local stand density grams et al 2021 pretzsch et al 2015 burkhart and tomé 2012 biging and dobbertin 1995 reduces the tree growth in models the potential growth rate is modified by multiplicator mod which decreases exponentially with increasing competition or local stand density in fig 1 the decreasing curve represents the modifier function the tree growth results from i d i d p o t m o d the fact that neighbors especially of other species can facilitate growth e g by atmospheric nitrogen fixation hydraulic lift or nutrient upward transport from deeper soil layers is known from scattered experiments but rarely considered in individual tree simulation models so far most available individual tree models have been parametrized using data from solitary trees in order to derive the potential growth rate hasenauer 1997 they used mainly trees in monospecific stands to parametrize the modifier function hasenauer et al 2006 pretzsch et al 2002 the application of such models to mixed stands will produce useful results only if trees behave similarly in inter as in intra specific neighborhoods however recent studies stress that mixed species stands can be by 2 59 more productive than monospecific stands ruiz peinado et al 2021 steckel et al 2019 jactel et al 2018 and that their maximum stand density can be by 5 25 higher thurm and pretzsch 2021 pretzsch and del río 2020 pretzsch and biber 2016 binkley 1984 hence it is possible to increase forest diversity by tree species mixing with a potential increase in tree growth compared to monospecific stands chamagne et al 2017 obviously when growing together some tree species can facilitate each other the effect can be similar to a fertilization one or both species may grow more due to inter specific facilitation forrester 2014 pretzsch et al 2013 kelty 1992 additionally there may be a competition reduction when different species are mixed leading to higher packing density this may be caused by morphological complementarity and spatial niche separation pretzsch 2014 von felten and schmid 2008 or by temporal asynchronity del rio et al 2017 jucker et al 2015 both may result in a reduction of the inter specific compare to intra specific competition metz et al 2020 forrester 2017 pretzsch 2017 pretzsch 2022 such effects of tree species mixing should be considered to better model understand and design mixed species stands because of their advantageous functioning and provisioning of ecosystem services dieler et al 2017 especially under changing environmental conditions del río et al 2017 jucker et al 2014 mixed stands are presently on the rise and suitable models guidelines and training plots are essential for their promotion coll et al 2018 a more detailed understanding of how an interspecific neighborhood can facilitate tree growth and raise the potential growth rate similarly to fertilization but without the respective costs may improve the nature based design of resource efficient forest ecosystems quantifying how mixing may modify tree growth efficiency is a pertinent issue in view of the increasing spread and relevance of mixed stands monitoring inventories and sampling should consider the spatial neighborhood to appropriately interpret the recorded tree growth models should be adapted to mixed species stands silvicultural prescriptions based on monospecific stands may be misleading when applied to mixed species stands for instance they may neglect that mixed stands enable increased growth rates even when growing at higher stand densities consequently they may prescribe overly strong stand density reductions and thereby undercut maximum stand productivity here we used a unique dataset of mono and mixed species growth conditions to quantify the effects of mixing on both the modification of the potential growth rate and the reduction of competition in inter versus intra specific neighborhoods to address these questions we posed the following hypotheses h i inter specific neighborhood can increase tree growth significantly above the level of open grown trees in intra specific neighborhoods the potential growth rate in mixed stands can be higher compared to monospecific stands that are matched for size crown and site index h ii tree species mixing can reduce competition this competition reduction increases with the mixing proportion h iii facilitation and competition reduction are modulated by site conditions facilitation and competition increase with the quality of the respective sites 2 material and methods 2 1 the study plots the study based on 10 chronosequences see example in fig 2 with altogether 62 long term plots in southern germany with repeated stand inventories the plots were established in the 1990ies in 18 238 years old stands they cover the main tree species in central europe in intra and interspecific neighborhood throughout the whole rotation the plots represent the most common medium and high quality site conditions table 1 fully to moderately thinned stands and mixture patterns reaching from individual tree to cluster mixtures since their establishment and first survey the chronosequenes were remeasured up to 5 times in this way the original chronosequences have become real time series of long term survey and cover for all considered mixtures an age span of a whole rotation the surveys cover the tree and stand growth in the time period 1991 2016 the three dimensional visualization of the age series fre 813 in fig 2 was based on the inventory of the tree co ordinates and species identity first recorded in 1991 and the measurements of the stem diameters tree heights crown sizes surveyed in autumn 1994 the plots size increases from the young to the old stands see 20 m scale at the bottom of each plot in order to cover representative sections of the representative stand development phases for the sake of simplicity we visualized the crown diameters calculated as the quadratic mean of the eight crown radius measurements 2 2 measurements metrics objective variables table 2 gives an overview of the main measurement variables and metrics used in this study from each tree on the 62 plots we recorded the species identity measured the x and y stem coordinates at the first survey and all stem diameters at each of the up to 5 surveys fig 3 a table 3 tree height h and height to the crown base hcb were sampled 30 trees per species sampled over the whole range of stem diameters at each survey the stand age was read off from the historical documentation of the stand establishment if such documents were not available we derived the tree age by tree ring counting on increment cores sampled at the foot of the trunks of three trees of each species per plot stand ages were assumed to be identical with mean tree age in case of natural regenerated stands in planted stands stand age were assumed to be mean tree age minus three years to take into account the usual age of plants coming from the nursery 2 3 descriptive data evaluation 2 3 1 stand level evaluation to give an overview of the included chronosequences we first evaluated them at the stand level using standard procedures biber 2013 pretzsch 2009 johann 1993 the reported stand level data was derived from the diameter and height records as well as from the removal of trees the results encompassed the quadratic mean tree diameter stand volume and volume growth see stand variables in table 2 and overview of the tree and stand characteristics of the results section for characterization of the site productivity we used the hq values and stand ages on the plots to derived the hq at stand age 100 as site index for the site indexing we applied the yield tables moderate thinning for norway spruce by wiedemann 1936 42 for scots pine by wiedemann 1943 for european beech by schober 1967 1975 sessile oak by jüttner 1955 european ash by volquardts 1958 and sycomore maple by nagel 1986 2 3 2 tree level evaluation tree height estimation as boundary and search radius s r for the neighborhood analyses fig 3b we used the quarter of the individual height of every tree however in the course of the repeated surveys the stem diameters were measured completely the tree heights only randomly for estimation of the individual tree height h depending on the stem diameter and tree age we parameterized the model 1 ln h a 0 a 1 ln d a 2 ln a g e a 3 ln d ln a g e for each species on each of the 10 age series separately for model parameters see supplement table 1 the tree heights were also used for stem volume estimation in dependence on tree diameter tree height and form factor for considering the stem form we used the approach by franz et al 1973 with the stem form equations and coefficients published by pretzsch 2002 p 170 neighborhood analyses within sample circles to analyze the individual trees competition indices we used the concept of the stand density index sdi reineke 1933 for this purpose we defined around the position of each tree an influence zone by a circle with search radius s r 1 0 25 h 1 see fig 3b this study and a preliminar study by pretzsch and schütze 2021 showed that this circle size resulted in the highest correlations between the characteristics of stand structure and growth all trees within the circle except the center tree were used to calculate the local density n on circle area a n 10 000 a n was the respective tree number upscaled to one hectare for the n trees we calculated the quadratic mean stem diameter d q based on n and d q we then calculated the local density s d i n 25 d q α around each individual tree in the constructed circles there were on average 8 9 trees and at least 5 6 most impactful neighbors prodan 1968a b the local sdi was calculated using species specific allometric exponents derived by pretzsch and biber 2005 they were applied for the component species in intra and interspecific neighborhood as general allometric exponents for mixed stands were not yet available note that the latter exponents α were derived on a grade and unthinned plots of long term experiments in south germany that are located in the same area as the age series of this study they deviate from the species overarching exponent of 1 605 as proposed by reineke 1933 are species specific and representative for south germany the resulting local density index sdi was distant dependent and easy to interpret to standardize the density we applied the equivalence factors by pretzsch and biber 2016 these factors for the main tree species assemblages are shown in supplementary table 2 edge correction before calculating the local sdi values and mixing proportions for neighborhood analysis we established a toroidal shift of the plot to all eight directions of the plot periphery for edge bias compensation radtke and burkhart 1998 pommerening and stoyan 2006 pretzsch 2009 we use the plot son 814 2 at the survey in autumn 2011 for visualization of this method in supplementary figure 4 using the toroidal shift we extended the same mixing patterns and distances between trees in all eight directions and avoided any overestimation of density as it could result from other techniques radtke and burkhart 1998 mixing proportions the trees sampled in the circle were also used to calculate local mixing proportions the mixing proportions m p o r t i o n 1 m p o r t i o n n should reflect the area proportions of two or more species in the observed mixed stands pretzsch and del río 2020 dirnberger et al 2017 tree number basal area or volume proportions are only appropriate for this purpose if the mixed species have similar growing area requirements pretzsch et al 2017 tree species can vary per se in the growing area requirement and maximum stand density in fully stocked stands de prado et al 2020 for example a european beech with a stem diameter of 25 cm may require approximately double the growing space as a norway spruce of the same diameter this means the density in terms of trees per hectare is only half of that of norway spruce to calculate the unbiased area related mixing proportions we again applied the equivalence factors shown in supplementary table 2 grouping of trees growing in mixed versus monospecific environment for further exploration of co determining variables on the mixing effects we introduced the binary variable mfactor that indicated the respective species assemblage circles with an admixture smaller than 10 of another species based on the sdi were classified as monospecific mfactor 0 circles with an admixture of more than 10 were classified as mixed mfactor 1 2 4 statistical models for hypotheses testing 2 4 1 inter specific neighborhood can facilitate tree growth h i for scrutiny whether maximum stem diameter growth rates at parity of competition can be increased in inter specific compared with intra specific neighborhood we used the individual trees annual stem diameter growth the local competition sdi and the mixing proportions within the respective circles fig 3b the data was grouped in trees from monospecific and mixed circles we then sorted the trees into classes of increasing local sdi values from sdi 0 100 100 200 1800 2000 trees per hectar for each sdi class we used the 10 fastest growing trees and calculated the mean and standard error of their stem diameter growth in this way we could find out whether the best growing trees in the mixed group grow better than in the monospecific group the species specific id sdi relationships were visualized for each mixture in total but also for each ages series separately any exceedance of the tree growth in mixed neighborhood above the respective growth in monospecific neighborhood provided evidence for facilitation the detailed statistical analysis of facilitation by inter specific neighborhood was also based on the 10 fastest growing trees on each plot and in each group mono and mixed by using only the respective 10 fastest growing trees we addressed the potential growth in this way we eliminated growth reductions by genetically determined low growth crown size and shape effects e g crown transparency and leaf losses detrimental silvicultural treatment in the longer past e g narrow spacing abrupt and strong competition release or abiotic e g drought frost and biotic e g bark beetle fungal infestation damages this approach is suitable for addressing whether ceteris paribus the potential tree growth rates in inter specific neighborhood can exceed those in intra specific conditions indicating facilitation h i the following mixed linear model revealed the mean effect of inter versus intra specific neighborhood after elimination of all relevant co determining effects see last paragraph of this section for a comprehensive explanation of the notation and assumptions used for testing h i ii and iii 2 ln i d a 0 a 1 m f a c t o r i a 2 ln d i k a 3 ln c r i k a 4 ln s d i i k a 5 ln s i i k b i ε i k eq 2 represented the full model if all variables would be included depending on the respective species specific relationships it was simplified we eliminated those variables that were not significant i e p 0 05 and did not lower the aic value the model eq 2 with mfactor being the binary 0 1 variable addressed the effect of monospecific mfactor 0 or mixed stand condition mfactor 1 the back transformed version e g y e a 0 e a 1 m f a c t o r showed that the dummy variable mfactor results in e 0 1 in case of monoculture and e a 1 in case of mixed stands this means that e a 1 directly reveals any multiplicative effects of mixing on the dependent variables suppose a 1 0 25 the mixing effect on the target variable would be e 0 25 1 284 and the effect size would be 28 4 this helps to easily interprete the biological meaning of the respective coefficients of mfactor in model 2 2 4 2 tree species mixing reduces the competition and the competition reduction increases with the mixing proportion h ii for testing this hypothesis model 3 was formulated as follows 3 ln i d a 0 a 1 ln d i k a 2 ln a g e i k a 3 ln s d i i k a 4 ln m p o r t i o n i k a 5 ln s d i i k ln m p o r t i o n i k b i ε i k this model was fitted for each species using the whole dataset i e using all data including the 10 fastest growing trees 2 4 3 facilitation and competition reduction are modulated by site conditions h iii the plots of the mixture of norway spruce and european beech and of sessile oak and european beech covered a sufficiently wide range of site conditions for analyzing any interaction between mixing and site index on growth we first analyzed the interaction between mixing and site index on the growth of the 10 fastest growing trees by model 4 4 ln i d a 0 a 1 m f a c t o r i a 2 ln s i i k a 3 m f a c t o r i ln s i i k b i ε i k using the same model we further analyzed the interaction between mixing and site index based on the full dataset for the mixtures of norway spruce and european beech and of sessile oak and european beech for testing h i h iii we applied linear mixed models the dependent variable was the mean annual stem diameter growth id the independent variables were individual tree diameter d tree age local sdi the binary variable mfactor 0 1 for mono mixed mixing proportion mportion and site index si in all equations the indexes i and k represented the kth observation of the ith tree the fixed effects were covered by the parameters a 0 a n with the random effect b i n 0 τ 2 we cover the correlation between the single observations on tree level in preliminary model formulations we also worked with random effects on plot level i e one additional nesting level as this caused confounding effects with the fixed effect we constrained ourselves to the simpler random effect structure of eqs 2 4 with ε i k we denote the independently and identically distributed errors ε i k n 0 σ 2 for all calculations we used the statistical software r 3 6 3 r core team 2019 for fitting the mixed linear models explained above we in particular used the libraries nlme pinheiro et al 2018 and lme4 bates et al 2015 3 results 3 1 overview of the tree and stand characteristics the mixtures were represented by young to old stands with an age range of 15 238 years supplementary table 3 the mean diameter ranged from 7 8 to 51 5 cm the standing volume was the highest 1774 m3 ha 1 in mature stands of norway spruce and european beech the annual stem volume growth was the highest 36 2 m3 ha 1 yr 1 in the stands with norway spruce and european beech and scots pine and european beech for further information see supplementary table 3 the models could be based on n 1112 6233 observations per species and species combination supplementary table 4 the annual stem diameter growth rates ranged from 0 01 to 1 48 cm yr 1 and the diameters from 9 28 to 103 40 cm the crown diameters ranged from 0 18 to 15 58 m and the crown ratios from 0 05 to 0 94 m m the data covered low local competition of sdi 2 64 but also very dense stand parts with sdi 4487 49 trees per hectare compared to the usually reported stand related sdi values of 500 2000 trees per hectare pretzsch 2019 sterba 1981 the local sdi s can become low as well as very high as they refer to the local density within the search radius s r the site index related to the quadratic mean height at age 100 and based on the yield tables quoted in the section descriptive data evaluation the si ranged between 20 43 m at age 100 the mixing proportions cover the whole range between monospecific conditions of one to the other species especially the wide range of diameters local densities mixing proportions and site indices made the data suitable for testing of h i h iii for further information see supplementary table 4 3 2 facilitation and increase of potential growth rate in inter versus intraspecific environment h i fig 4 shows that the annual stem diameter growth of the 10 fastest growing trees in inter specific neighborhood green can significantly exceed the growth rates under monospecific conditions at parity of stand density the horizontal broken lines indicate the growth rate of the 10 fastest growing trees in monospecific neighborhood for trees with competition of sdi 250 500 trees in mixed stands green curves the growth rates exceed this level by up to 40 the finding that the potential growth is superior in mixed environment provides evidence of inter specific net facilitation in seven out of 10 cases this net facilitation occurs mainly under low competition for detailed information about the stem diameters of the 10 fastest growing trees see supplementary table 5 for fig 4 we pooled all trees of all chronosequences of the same species assemblage for separate visualization of each of the ten chronosequences of this study see supplement figs 1 3 in summary 8 out of 10 species assemblages provided evidence of net facilitation and increased potential growth rates in mixed compared with monospecific environment for further statistical analysis of any facilitation effects by inter specific neighborhood on the potential growth rate of trees we used again the fastest 10 of trees without and with interspecific neighborhood table 4 reflects that in all 10 cases the growth in the inter specific group was significantly higher than in the intra specific group at least at the level p 0 05 the superiority ranged between a plus of 14 in case of norway spruce in european beech or sessile oak in european beech the superiority amounted to plus 74 and 78 in case of norway spruce when growing in scots pine or sycomore maple growing mixed with european ash in most cases the crown ratio had and additional positive influence in some cases also the other considered variables such as d sdi and si had an additional effect this covariance analyses of the potential stem diameter growth in inter versus intra specific neighborhood factor m based on model 2 the model included the covariables stem diameter crown ratio local sdi and site index in case that they were significant at least at the level p 0 05 and that they increased the aic criteria of the regression compared with the basic model id f factor this variable selection resulted in the model variants 2 1 2 8 presented in table 4 fig 5 visualizes the results for four selected tree species combinations where the potential growth was 14 78 higher in mixed compared with monospecific neighborhood factor 1 14 1 78 in three out of the shown four cases the crown ratio had an additional positive effect on the growth rate fig 5 corroborates that any benefit of mixing depends on both the species identify of the basis species and the neighbors fig 5 a and b show that the potential growth rate of norway spruce benefitted moderately when mixed with european beech 14 but much stronger when mixed with scots pine 74 fig 5 c and d show a plus of 38 for european beech when mixed with norway spruce and a plus of 69 when mixed with scots pine note that the mentioned superiorities refer to growth rates of the 10 best growing trees in both groups mixed versus mono after elimination of any additional effects of d cr sdi si thus the 14 78 plus reflects mainly the effect of facilitation of the different neighboring tree species in low density environment and at parity of other modulating factors such as d si this means that competition and density effects were as far as possible eliminated by only selecting the fastest growing trees per plot and group and by elimination of any other size or density related group differences group a4 std a4 p value a5 std a5 p value n sp e be 1 38 0 36 0 001 n sp e be 0 12 0 05 0 049 1 12 0

increasing admixture proportion table 5 for norway spruce when mixed with european beech we found a neutral effect of admixture there was no significant facilitation in most species assemblages both tree species benefitted from the mixture see e g fig 6 c and d in the mixture of norway spruce and european beech only the latter benefitted fig 6 a and b there were no cases were one species benefitted at the expense of the other species i e that an increase of one was coupled with a loss of the other in all mixtures the growth of european beech strongly benefitted from living in mixture

conditions was first tested for the collective of the 10 fastest growing trees per group and plot by model 4 any dependencies of the mixing effects on the site conditions were analyzed only for the mixtures of norway spruce european beech and sessile oak european beech for the other species the range of the site conditions was too narrow for analogous analyses we found a significantly positive effect of inter specific neighborhood on growth however this on average positive effect remained constant along the whole site gradient in none of the cases there was a significant interaction between site conditions and mixing effect see coefficients a3 in table 6 fig 7 visualizes that in both mixtures the fastest growing trees benefitted from living in mixture however the benefit did not change along the site gradient si 20 40 m mean height at age 100 covered by this study an analogous analysis based on model 4 was done based on the whole dataset in order to reveal any modulation of the competition reduction by site quality for the competition reduction we found a tendency of increase with site quality that was close to significant for the mixture of norway spruce and european beech see table 7 and fig 8 for european beech when growing in association with oak we found a significant p 0 002 increase of competition reduction with increasing site quality cases see last row in table 7 and fig 7d in summary in all cases diameter growth was higher in mixed compared with monospecific stands in case of beech in oak the superiority increased slightly with improving site quality 4 discussion 4 1 a consolidated view of facilitation and competition effects on growth analyzing understanding modeling and prognosticating monocultures often entails a thorough consideration of the effects of competition between neighboring plants larocque et al 2013 nambiar and sands 1993 but hardly of the facilitation or reduction of competition by neighbors maestre et al 2009 bruno et al 2003 vandermeer 1992 the results of this study provide evidence that the assumption of maximum growth under solitary conditions and of an exponential growth reduction through increased competition and density as shown in fig 1 is an over simplification in particular we show that tree growth can be increased beyond solitary growth by 14 78 through an inter specific neighborhood under moderate density fig 5 and table 4 we analyzed the feedback spatial stand structure facilitation and competition tree growth and its dependency on site conditions e g site index and silvicultural interventions e g stand density mixing proportion fig 9 by modeling the effects of different stand characteristic on individual tree growth we showed that tree growth can be promoted or reduced facilitation versus competition by intra and interspecific neighborhood models 1 3 showed for different species combinations how the facilitation and competition is modulated by site conditions and stand density our results suggest that the growth competition relationship is uni modal as represent by the bold curve in fig 10 a facilitation and competition act simultaneously pretzsch 2017 vandermeer 1992 they are difficult to disentangle and the measured growth reaction represents the net effect of the interaction between facilitation and competition thin and broken lines respectively in fig 10a in fig 10a the tree growth in solitary conditions is used as a reference 1 0 line and indicates that the trajectory of the measured growth may result from the interplay between facilitation and competition this pattern may apply even in some monospecific populations especially under harsh conditions callaway and walker 1997 canham et al 1994 2004 we also found that an inter specific neighborhood can increase the facilitation and reduce the competition so that the net effect on growth becomes more positive see fig 10b vertical and horizontal arrows fig 10b indicates the shift of the tree growth density relationship due to a facilitation e g tapping of nutrients in deep soil layers which are favorable for species 1 or a reduction in competition e g by spatial or temporal niche complementarity further the inter specific neighborhood may cause a widening of the density range with net facilitation horizontal arrow this may cause a narrowing of the range where net competition has the upper hand figs 4 and 5 showed such a facilitation of trees in mixed stands in several cases trees with moderate density grew even faster in an inter specific neighborhood than trees with low competition in monospecific stands fig 10a shows that net facilitation may dominate at low densities and that net competition may predominate in denser stands the reason may be that around widely spaced trees the negative effect of competition on growth may be still low enough to be compensated or even overcompensated for by the positive effect of facilitation when stand density further increases the growth reduction cannot be balanced out as easily by facilitation and may cause net competition although not easy to detect and to disentangle from competition facilitation may also play a role in closed forest stands with high stand density the study further showed that facilitation and competition reduction may depend on environmental conditions gonzales de andres et al 2018 they may become stronger in high quality sites this means that the stand density range with a net facilitation effect and an increase of tree growth is extended towards higher stand densities see horizontal arrow in fig 10c finally this study showed a strong facilitation and competition reduction through inter specific conditions however this facilitation was site invariant fig 7 table 6 the competition reduction increased only slightly with improving site quality fig 6 table 7 4 2 causes of facilitation and reduction of competition in an inter specific neighborhood comparing the 10 fastest growing trees in a mixed versus monospecific neighborhood fig 5 table 4 showed a 14 78 increase in growth in mixed stands this result remained consistent across different neighboring tree species in low density environments and at parity of other modulating factors such as d and si the finding that stem diameter was not always significant in the models may be attributed to the fact that other tree dimensions such as crown ratio or age overtopped d in correlation with growth the finding that the 10 fastest growing trees of several species were superior means that they had a higher growth rate when surrounded with other species than when growing widely spaced and open we furthermore found a competition reduction of 16 on average ranging from 1 36 calculated for a local sdi value of 1000 ha 1 quadratic mean diameter of 25 cm stand age of 30 years and a mixing proportion of 50 50 for each pair of species fig 5 table 5 how can a higher growth in inter specific mixtures compared to growth without neighbors be explained i e how is it possible that the positive effect of a neighbors is higher than the negative effect what may be the main causes underlying the demonstrated competition reduction under high density conditions the measured net effects of density and distance of neighboring trees on tree growth allowed us the following speculations about the potential mechanisms underpinning the revealed mixing effects norway spruce and european beech many studies showed that the negative effects of soil compaction wiedemann 1923 acidification pallant and rihac 1990 and nutrient depletion kaarakka et al 2014 through norway spruce monocultures can be mitigated by many species admixtures and especially by european beech rothe and binkley 2001 rothe 1997 wiedemann 1942 the latter can facilitate the growing conditions of norway spruce by increasing the temperature especially in early spring by improving litter decomposition and nutrient cycling and turnover pretzsch et al 2020 2010 goisser et al 2016 rothe et al 2002 2003 furthermore beech can benefit from norway spruce through its higher leaf area resulting in higher eutrophic deposition filtering alveteg et al 1998 cannell et al 1998 van dijk and roelofs 1988 an advantage and competition reductions for both species may be their crown shape complementarity i e the shaped norway spruce bottom heavy versus shaped european beech top heavy crowns enable a higher canopy packing density barbeito et al 2017 jucker et al 2015 pretzsch 2014 complementarity in shape may across all mixtures reduce mechanical abrasion and crown shyness hajek et al 2015 fish et al 2006 meng et al 2006 it may also cause higher canopy packing density stand density thurm and pretzsch 2021 and stand leaf area pretzsch and schütze 2021 peng et al 2017 in this way complementarity in shape may result in overyielding williams et al 2017 in addition physiological asynchronity of tree species may be beneficial for their growth pretzsch 2005 rötzer et al 2017 schober 1950 51 for instance norway spruce may benefit of a reduced competition for water in early spring when european beech is still leafless and lives from the reserves of the previous year during this period photosynthesis and growth of spruce may further profit from higher temperatures and light supply until beech sprouts in april may sessile oak and european beech in mixture with oak beech may be facilitated by hydraulic lift this has been observed in particular on dry sites with deeply extending root systems which release water at night into surface near soil horizons of low water potential caldwell et al 1998 prieto et al 2012 sessile oak may benefit from beech by the improvement of soil activity decomposition and nutrient turnover jonard et al 2008 competition reduction may promote european beech when admixed to all species that are less shade tolerant e g oak european beech benefits in such cases by increasing lateral crown expansion or often simply by penetrating crowns of neighbor trees that are less shade tolerant metz et al 2020 bayer et al 2013 ellenberg and leuschner 2010 scots pine and european beech especially on poor sites scots pine can be facilitated by the substantial nutrient input from european beech induced litter translocation and the improved decomposition and turnover of the mixed litter yeste et al 2021 this can improve the water storage and have a particularly positive effect on the mineral nutrient supply european beech can have a beneficial effect on pine primarily through stimulation of the bio element turnover and by improving the nutrition of pine in comparison to pine beech litter has a higher ca mg and k content as well as a lower c n ratio augusto et al 2002 moreover activity of soil fauna and microflora is higher in beech than in conifer stands resulting in a higher litter decomposition rate augusto et al 2002 wiedemann 1942 reduced acidity and a better humus type block et al 1997 scots pine and norway spruce both species complement each other in light ecology crown and root shape and in behavior under drought ruiz peinado et al 2021 wellhausen et al 2017 competition reduction may result from the fact that pine is light demanding round crowned deep rooted and less drought sensitive whereas spruce is shade tolerant slim crowned shallow rooted and strongly isohydric table 1 in drössler et al 2018 p 3 european ash and sycamore maple this species combination creates high biodiversity in the soil high nutrient turnover and a suppression of other competing species e g european beech in its stand ellenberg and leuchner 2010 pp 297 303 frech 2006 these effects may facilitate both component species in such mixtures this brief literature review of the most likely mixing effects within the five analyzed species combinations suggests a differentiation between i density invariant far range effects such as far reaching root systems mycorrhiza nickel et al 2018 and other root associated microbial networks steidinger et al 2019 to this category of effects also belong the slowing down of wind speed avoidance of storm breakage shading and avoidance of sunburn provision of barriers against spread of insects suppression of forest floor vegetation and competing weeds and protection against snow slides or browsing by different neighboring tree species a second category of effects may be ii density driven close range mixing effects such as mechanical abrasion crown shyness and pre emption of water and light by neighbors of a different tree species our results show that density invariant far range effects may cause facilitation and growth increase at low stand density low density conditions are often created in contemporary forest management through edges strong thinning opening for natural regeneration or by natural disturbances they generate the potential of considerable facilitation of tree growth this may not raise the stand related productivity above the level of closed stands but can reduce the losses brought about by density reduction this is in line with the finding by thurm and pretzsch 2021 that the stand density productivity relationship has a broader plateau in mixed compared with monospecific stands in mixed stands the plateau of the stand density productivity relationship may reach further into both the low density and also high density range the percentage of diameter growth increase caused by reduction of competition 16 on average ranging from 1 to 36 is in line with the magnitude of overyielding reported for the respective mixtures in fully stocked stands see introduction this indicates that the overyielding in fully stocked stands may be driven mainly by close range effects it may result from competition reduction and increased density resulting in an advantageous productivity this is in line with thurm and pretzsch 2021 who recently showed that density can be raised by tree species mixing and that overyielding in mixed stands can peak at maximum density 4 3 consequences of the facilitation and competition reduction for individual tree modeling the potential modifier approach for individual tree growth modeling splits the prediction of the size growth e g stem diameter growth into two components pretzsch et al 2019 weiskittel et al 2016 the first is the estimation of the potential tree growth rate i e the expected growth without competition that mainly depends on the tree and site characteristics the second component is the modifier that reduces the potential growth rate depending on the competition and density in the tree s neighborhood our results suggest that in contrast to the common assumptions made in many individual tree models the tree stem growth may not peak under monospecific open grown conditions but rather in mixed species environments and at moderate stand density thus the potential modifier function may not exponentially decrease but rather grow unimodal with modifier values above 1 0 at moderate density in mixtures in contrast to the declining modifier function shown in fig 1 the modifier function in mixed stands may be bell shaped as shown in fig 10 further research considering other tree species species combinations site conditions and stand structures is required to for substantiation these assumptions relevant for modeling are the mostly positive interactions between mixing proportion and local competition that we found in this study positive interactions between tree species were also found by rebola lichtenberg et al 2021 cavard et al 2011 or forrester et al 2011 however our results indicate that the competition reduction through an inter specific neighborhood is even stronger in denser stands we also found a slight positive interaction effect of site index and mixing proportion on growth of european beech when mixed with sessile oak fig 8 this suggests that the competition reduction may be stronger on high quality sites certainly site index is a vague proxy marker of site quality analyses based on environmental factors and resource supply will provide further insight into the relationships between environmental conditions and competition reduction accordingly the potential modifier models should modify the potential growth rate to the expected rate depending on among others crown characteristics and competition index burkhart and tomé 2012 p 314 315 but also stand age and site variables presently used models largely neglect the revealed mixing effects on stem diameter growth however silvicultural guidelines and forest management are often derived from or supported by management models hilmers et al 2020 mason et al 2018 hanewinkel and pretzsch 2000 the presented findings may aid the further development of individual tree models 4 4 consequences of the results for forest management this study aimed to answer several of the ten highest ranked questions regarding mixed forests that coll et al 2018 table 1 identified by interviewing 168 managers from european countries specifically the study addressed which species combinations are beneficial question 4 how the productivity of mixtures differs from that in monospecific stands 5 and which positive and negative effects mixtures can have 6 and 7 this study substantiated that at parity of tree size and stand density trees in the most common species combinations in central europe grew faster than in monospecific stands in the considered time period 1991 2016 this superior wood production of trees in mixed stands adds to their well known advantages in biodiversity dieler et al 2017 felton et al 2010 stability hilmers et al 2020 knoke et al 2008 and recreation edwards et al 2012 pukkala et al 1988 services in forest management facilitation effects are so far specifically used in terms of nurse crop against frost damage pommerening and murphy 2004 and in the admixture of atmospheric nitrogen fixing tree species such as alnus robinia or acacia binkley 2003 carl et al 2018 forrester et al 2006 it is also well known that trees growing in group structures in the alpine zone compete for light but their neighbours also protect them against snow and wind so that they frequently benefit from being associated and grow more than solitary trees forest management makes use of such a permanent facilitation by planting trees in groups or clusters known as rotten in the alpine zone strobel 1995 and nester in the lowlands saha et al 2012 the results of this study quantified the facilitation in inter specific neighborhood it showed that facilitation can improve tree growth in common mixed species forests in both widely spaced stands by far range facilitation effects and in dense stands by near distant competition reduction effects both effects are relevant for silviculture facilitation even at low density conditions enable the production of large and long lived forest products with lower expenses in terms of stand stock and mass productivity at the stand level this means an advantageous growth at low density as commonly observed in selective or future crop tree thinning systems for individual tree size growth acceleration schober 1988a and b abetz 1975 schädelin 1942 competition reduction enables an increase in stand density mass production and climate change mitigation through higher carbon storage the competition reduction observed here enables the maximization of mass production at high density stand management in mixed stands zeller et al 2021 de prado et al 2020 pretzsch 2020 2022 assmann 1970 silvicultural management mainly entails the modification of spatial design and interference into stand structure the distinction between i density invariant far range effects and ii density driven close range operating mechanisms may be a step forward for future spatially explicit tree and stand modeling approaches and experiments as well as for a more goal oriented silvicultural design and stand establishment thus silvicultural measures are suitable for the regulation of density driven close range mixing effects both facilitation and competition reduction can result in higher growth per unit area and be exploited by low or high stand density respectively the reported effects apply to all analyzed species and sites to implement these findings they should be integrated into silvicultural guidelines for mixed species stands as claimed by coll et al 2018 and proposed by mason et al 2018 and pretzsch and zenner 2017 credit authorship

24500,that tree species mixing may strongly affect tree structure and tree growth is so far hardly considered in tree and stand models hence for a better understanding and design of mixed species stands the inter specific facilitation and competition needs better representation in individual tree models here we show for the five most common tree species combinations in central europe that mixing causes facilitation and competition reduction in mixed stands and how such effects can be implemented in individual tree stem diameter growth models this study was based on 62 long term experimental plots belonging to 10 chronosequences in germany with repeated spatially explicit stand inventories from 1991 to 2016 they covered monospecific and mixed species stands of norway spruce picea abies l karst scots pine pinus sylvestris l european beech fagus sylvatica l sessile oak quercus petraea matt liebl european ash fraxinus excelsior l and sycomore maple acer pseudoplatanus l the study represented medium and high qualitative site conditions fully stocked or only moderately thinned stands of 22 238 years of age and the mixing patterns ranged from individual tree to cluster mixtures based on spatially explicit measurements we quantified for each tree the intra or interspecific neighborhood local stand density and growth we applied mixed models to analyze how inter specific neighborhood modified tree growth first we showed that the inter specific neighborhood can increase tree growth significantly beyond the level of open grown trees in intra specific neighborhoods net faciltation the potential growth rates of the fastest growing trees in mixed stands were 14 78 higher compared to monospecific stands matched for size crown and site index the mixing effect differed between species combinations second we provided evidence that mixing on average reduced competition by 16 and that this effect increased with the mixing proportion in four out of the five species combinations we observed a competition reduction of both associated tree species mutualistic relationship third for the mixtures of norway spruce european beech and sessile oak european beech that covered a broader range of site conditions we found a mainly positive modulation of facilitation and competition depending on site conditions we discussed the potential causes for the observed facilitation and competition reduction their implementation in tree growth models and the relevance of the findings for the design and management of mixed species stands graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords facilitation competition competition reduction canopy density niche complementarity individual tree model growth modifier 1 introduction the widely used individual tree models for forest stands represent a bottom up approach which starts with the individuals of a system ends at the stand level and aims to understand and predict how a stand s properties emerge from the interaction between its trees weiskittel et al 2011 grimm 1999 the core of most of these models is a potential modifier algorithm burkhart and tomé 2012 biging and dobbertin 1995 moore 1989 botkin et al 1972 the potential modifier approach is based on the potential tree growth expected without competition and this potential growth is modified according to the current competition by neighbors the prediction of growth and mortality of all individuals the ingrowth of regeneration and the consideration of management interventions enables a simulation of the stand dynamics in 1 or 5 year increments or other time intervals previous literature provides excellent overviews of such models weiskittel et al 2011 their evaluation mette et al 2009 and their application in science grimm 1999 and forest management hilmers et al 2020 weiskittel et al 2016 pretzsch et al 2002 since their introduction individual tree growth models have greatly facilitated insights into the patterns and processes in forest ecosystems grimm 1999 shugart 1984 shugart and west 1981 however their impact on forest management was initially low due to the scarce information on initialization and parameterization the limited computing power available for their application and their limited added value for the mass oriented forestry with homogeneuos monocultures that was dominating in the past then the following five trends substantially promoted the application of individual tree growth models in forest management and planning over the last decades first individual tree based forest experiments forest inventories and remote sensing techniques strongly improved the database for analyzing and modeling individual tree growth nagel et al 2012 second computing capacity rapidly increased allowing for individual tree based scenario analyses at the regional national or even global level using microcomputers third many forests have been transformed from homogeneous to more heterogeneous stands del rio et al 2016 reventlow et al 2021 pommerening and murphy 2004 whereas monocultures may be abstracted by mean characteristics or frequency distribution models multi layered mixed species stands are better modeled using individual tree approaches coates et al 2013 fourth the paradigm shift from mass oriented forestry to multipurpose approaches has been accompanied by spatially explicit individual tree models the latter enable the prediction of structural heterogeneity wood quality micro habitats and even recreational and esthetic values pretzsch et al 2006 fifth the individual tree approach aligns well with many innovative prescriptions to silviculturally steer complex forest stands bravo et al 2019 these five trends have resulted in a boom in the development and use of individual tree models in forest management examples of this development include the models heureka wikström et al 2011 bwinpro by nagel et al 2006 prognaus ledermann 2004 sterba and monserud 1997 and silva pretzsch et al 2002 2008 in view of the establishment and silvicultural steering of even more heterogeneous mixed forest stands most existing individual tree models appear as an oversimplification as they often neglect species interactions pretzsch et al 2015 this study aims to contribute to the adaptation of existing individual tree models to the needs of forest science and practice we address an improved integration of tree species mixing effects in particular the effects of inter specific facilitation and competition reduction fig 1 visualizes the basic relationship of the potential modifier approach commonly used in individual tree growth models the potential modifier approach is competition based and assumes that the rate of tree size growth peaks when trees grow open solitarily and with no or only little competition the growth rate of open grown trees is assumed to be the potential growth and set to 1 0 in fig 1 the absolute level of the potential growth is certainly depending among others on the tree species the respective site conditions and the crown size however most models assume that any competition quantified e g by competition indices or local stand density grams et al 2021 pretzsch et al 2015 burkhart and tomé 2012 biging and dobbertin 1995 reduces the tree growth in models the potential growth rate is modified by multiplicator mod which decreases exponentially with increasing competition or local stand density in fig 1 the decreasing curve represents the modifier function the tree growth results from i d i d p o t m o d the fact that neighbors especially of other species can facilitate growth e g by atmospheric nitrogen fixation hydraulic lift or nutrient upward transport from deeper soil layers is known from scattered experiments but rarely considered in individual tree simulation models so far most available individual tree models have been parametrized using data from solitary trees in order to derive the potential growth rate hasenauer 1997 they used mainly trees in monospecific stands to parametrize the modifier function hasenauer et al 2006 pretzsch et al 2002 the application of such models to mixed stands will produce useful results only if trees behave similarly in inter as in intra specific neighborhoods however recent studies stress that mixed species stands can be by 2 59 more productive than monospecific stands ruiz peinado et al 2021 steckel et al 2019 jactel et al 2018 and that their maximum stand density can be by 5 25 higher thurm and pretzsch 2021 pretzsch and del río 2020 pretzsch and biber 2016 binkley 1984 hence it is possible to increase forest diversity by tree species mixing with a potential increase in tree growth compared to monospecific stands chamagne et al 2017 obviously when growing together some tree species can facilitate each other the effect can be similar to a fertilization one or both species may grow more due to inter specific facilitation forrester 2014 pretzsch et al 2013 kelty 1992 additionally there may be a competition reduction when different species are mixed leading to higher packing density this may be caused by morphological complementarity and spatial niche separation pretzsch 2014 von felten and schmid 2008 or by temporal asynchronity del rio et al 2017 jucker et al 2015 both may result in a reduction of the inter specific compare to intra specific competition metz et al 2020 forrester 2017 pretzsch 2017 pretzsch 2022 such effects of tree species mixing should be considered to better model understand and design mixed species stands because of their advantageous functioning and provisioning of ecosystem services dieler et al 2017 especially under changing environmental conditions del río et al 2017 jucker et al 2014 mixed stands are presently on the rise and suitable models guidelines and training plots are essential for their promotion coll et al 2018 a more detailed understanding of how an interspecific neighborhood can facilitate tree growth and raise the potential growth rate similarly to fertilization but without the respective costs may improve the nature based design of resource efficient forest ecosystems quantifying how mixing may modify tree growth efficiency is a pertinent issue in view of the increasing spread and relevance of mixed stands monitoring inventories and sampling should consider the spatial neighborhood to appropriately interpret the recorded tree growth models should be adapted to mixed species stands silvicultural prescriptions based on monospecific stands may be misleading when applied to mixed species stands for instance they may neglect that mixed stands enable increased growth rates even when growing at higher stand densities consequently they may prescribe overly strong stand density reductions and thereby undercut maximum stand productivity here we used a unique dataset of mono and mixed species growth conditions to quantify the effects of mixing on both the modification of the potential growth rate and the reduction of competition in inter versus intra specific neighborhoods to address these questions we posed the following hypotheses h i inter specific neighborhood can increase tree growth significantly above the level of open grown trees in intra specific neighborhoods the potential growth rate in mixed stands can be higher compared to monospecific stands that are matched for size crown and site index h ii tree species mixing can reduce competition this competition reduction increases with the mixing proportion h iii facilitation and competition reduction are modulated by site conditions facilitation and competition increase with the quality of the respective sites 2 material and methods 2 1 the study plots the study based on 10 chronosequences see example in fig 2 with altogether 62 long term plots in southern germany with repeated stand inventories the plots were established in the 1990ies in 18 238 years old stands they cover the main tree species in central europe in intra and interspecific neighborhood throughout the whole rotation the plots represent the most common medium and high quality site conditions table 1 fully to moderately thinned stands and mixture patterns reaching from individual tree to cluster mixtures since their establishment and first survey the chronosequenes were remeasured up to 5 times in this way the original chronosequences have become real time series of long term survey and cover for all considered mixtures an age span of a whole rotation the surveys cover the tree and stand growth in the time period 1991 2016 the three dimensional visualization of the age series fre 813 in fig 2 was based on the inventory of the tree co ordinates and species identity first recorded in 1991 and the measurements of the stem diameters tree heights crown sizes surveyed in autumn 1994 the plots size increases from the young to the old stands see 20 m scale at the bottom of each plot in order to cover representative sections of the representative stand development phases for the sake of simplicity we visualized the crown diameters calculated as the quadratic mean of the eight crown radius measurements 2 2 measurements metrics objective variables table 2 gives an overview of the main measurement variables and metrics used in this study from each tree on the 62 plots we recorded the species identity measured the x and y stem coordinates at the first survey and all stem diameters at each of the up to 5 surveys fig 3 a table 3 tree height h and height to the crown base hcb were sampled 30 trees per species sampled over the whole range of stem diameters at each survey the stand age was read off from the historical documentation of the stand establishment if such documents were not available we derived the tree age by tree ring counting on increment cores sampled at the foot of the trunks of three trees of each species per plot stand ages were assumed to be identical with mean tree age in case of natural regenerated stands in planted stands stand age were assumed to be mean tree age minus three years to take into account the usual age of plants coming from the nursery 2 3 descriptive data evaluation 2 3 1 stand level evaluation to give an overview of the included chronosequences we first evaluated them at the stand level using standard procedures biber 2013 pretzsch 2009 johann 1993 the reported stand level data was derived from the diameter and height records as well as from the removal of trees the results encompassed the quadratic mean tree diameter stand volume and volume growth see stand variables in table 2 and overview of the tree and stand characteristics of the results section for characterization of the site productivity we used the hq values and stand ages on the plots to derived the hq at stand age 100 as site index for the site indexing we applied the yield tables moderate thinning for norway spruce by wiedemann 1936 42 for scots pine by wiedemann 1943 for european beech by schober 1967 1975 sessile oak by jüttner 1955 european ash by volquardts 1958 and sycomore maple by nagel 1986 2 3 2 tree level evaluation tree height estimation as boundary and search radius s r for the neighborhood analyses fig 3b we used the quarter of the individual height of every tree however in the course of the repeated surveys the stem diameters were measured completely the tree heights only randomly for estimation of the individual tree height h depending on the stem diameter and tree age we parameterized the model 1 ln h a 0 a 1 ln d a 2 ln a g e a 3 ln d ln a g e for each species on each of the 10 age series separately for model parameters see supplement table 1 the tree heights were also used for stem volume estimation in dependence on tree diameter tree height and form factor for considering the stem form we used the approach by franz et al 1973 with the stem form equations and coefficients published by pretzsch 2002 p 170 neighborhood analyses within sample circles to analyze the individual trees competition indices we used the concept of the stand density index sdi reineke 1933 for this purpose we defined around the position of each tree an influence zone by a circle with search radius s r 1 0 25 h 1 see fig 3b this study and a preliminar study by pretzsch and schütze 2021 showed that this circle size resulted in the highest correlations between the characteristics of stand structure and growth all trees within the circle except the center tree were used to calculate the local density n on circle area a n 10 000 a n was the respective tree number upscaled to one hectare for the n trees we calculated the quadratic mean stem diameter d q based on n and d q we then calculated the local density s d i n 25 d q α around each individual tree in the constructed circles there were on average 8 9 trees and at least 5 6 most impactful neighbors prodan 1968a b the local sdi was calculated using species specific allometric exponents derived by pretzsch and biber 2005 they were applied for the component species in intra and interspecific neighborhood as general allometric exponents for mixed stands were not yet available note that the latter exponents α were derived on a grade and unthinned plots of long term experiments in south germany that are located in the same area as the age series of this study they deviate from the species overarching exponent of 1 605 as proposed by reineke 1933 are species specific and representative for south germany the resulting local density index sdi was distant dependent and easy to interpret to standardize the density we applied the equivalence factors by pretzsch and biber 2016 these factors for the main tree species assemblages are shown in supplementary table 2 edge correction before calculating the local sdi values and mixing proportions for neighborhood analysis we established a toroidal shift of the plot to all eight directions of the plot periphery for edge bias compensation radtke and burkhart 1998 pommerening and stoyan 2006 pretzsch 2009 we use the plot son 814 2 at the survey in autumn 2011 for visualization of this method in supplementary figure 4 using the toroidal shift we extended the same mixing patterns and distances between trees in all eight directions and avoided any overestimation of density as it could result from other techniques radtke and burkhart 1998 mixing proportions the trees sampled in the circle were also used to calculate local mixing proportions the mixing proportions m p o r t i o n 1 m p o r t i o n n should reflect the area proportions of two or more species in the observed mixed stands pretzsch and del río 2020 dirnberger et al 2017 tree number basal area or volume proportions are only appropriate for this purpose if the mixed species have similar growing area requirements pretzsch et al 2017 tree species can vary per se in the growing area requirement and maximum stand density in fully stocked stands de prado et al 2020 for example a european beech with a stem diameter of 25 cm may require approximately double the growing space as a norway spruce of the same diameter this means the density in terms of trees per hectare is only half of that of norway spruce to calculate the unbiased area related mixing proportions we again applied the equivalence factors shown in supplementary table 2 grouping of trees growing in mixed versus monospecific environment for further exploration of co determining variables on the mixing effects we introduced the binary variable mfactor that indicated the respective species assemblage circles with an admixture smaller than 10 of another species based on the sdi were classified as monospecific mfactor 0 circles with an admixture of more than 10 were classified as mixed mfactor 1 2 4 statistical models for hypotheses testing 2 4 1 inter specific neighborhood can facilitate tree growth h i for scrutiny whether maximum stem diameter growth rates at parity of competition can be increased in inter specific compared with intra specific neighborhood we used the individual trees annual stem diameter growth the local competition sdi and the mixing proportions within the respective circles fig 3b the data was grouped in trees from monospecific and mixed circles we then sorted the trees into classes of increasing local sdi values from sdi 0 100 100 200 1800 2000 trees per hectar for each sdi class we used the 10 fastest growing trees and calculated the mean and standard error of their stem diameter growth in this way we could find out whether the best growing trees in the mixed group grow better than in the monospecific group the species specific id sdi relationships were visualized for each mixture in total but also for each ages series separately any exceedance of the tree growth in mixed neighborhood above the respective growth in monospecific neighborhood provided evidence for facilitation the detailed statistical analysis of facilitation by inter specific neighborhood was also based on the 10 fastest growing trees on each plot and in each group mono and mixed by using only the respective 10 fastest growing trees we addressed the potential growth in this way we eliminated growth reductions by genetically determined low growth crown size and shape effects e g crown transparency and leaf losses detrimental silvicultural treatment in the longer past e g narrow spacing abrupt and strong competition release or abiotic e g drought frost and biotic e g bark beetle fungal infestation damages this approach is suitable for addressing whether ceteris paribus the potential tree growth rates in inter specific neighborhood can exceed those in intra specific conditions indicating facilitation h i the following mixed linear model revealed the mean effect of inter versus intra specific neighborhood after elimination of all relevant co

eliminated those variables that were not significant i e p 0 05 and did not lower the aic value the model eq 2 with mfactor being the binary 0 1 variable addressed the effect of monospecific mfactor 0 or mixed stand condition mfactor 1 the back transformed version e g y e a 0 e a 1 m f a c t o r showed that the dummy variable mfactor results in e 0 1 in case of monoculture and e a 1 in case of mixed stands this means that e a 1 directly reveals any multiplicative effects of mixing on the dependent variables suppose a 1 0 25 the mixing effect on the target variable would be e 0 25 1 284 and the effect size would be 28 4 this helps to easily interprete the biological meaning of the respective coefficients of mfactor in model 2 2 4 2 tree species mixing reduces the competition and the

facilitation and competition reduction are modulated by site conditions h iii the plots of the mixture of norway spruce and european beech and of sessile oak and european beech covered a sufficiently wide range of site conditions for analyzing any interaction between mixing and site index on growth we first analyzed the interaction between mixing and site index on the growth of the 10 fastest

correlation between the single observations on tree level in preliminary model formulations we also worked with random effects on plot level i e one additional nesting level as this caused confounding effects with the fixed effect we constrained ourselves to the simpler random effect structure of eqs 2 4 with ε i k we denote the independently and identically distributed errors ε i k n 0 σ 2 for all calculations we used the statistical software r 3 6 3 r core team 2019 for fitting the mixed linear models explained above we in particular used the libraries nlme pinheiro et al 2018 and lme4 bates et al 2015 3 results 3 1 overview of the tree and stand characteristics the mixtures were represented by young to old stands with an age range of 15 238 years supplementary table 3 the mean diameter ranged from 7 8 to 51 5 cm the standing volume was the highest 1774 m3 ha 1 in mature stands of norway spruce and european beech the annual stem volume growth was the highest 36 2 m3 ha 1 yr 1 in the stands with norway spruce and european beech and scots pine and european beech for further information see supplementary table 3 the models could be based on n 1112 6233 observations per species and species combination supplementary table 4 the annual stem diameter growth rates ranged from 0 01 to 1 48 cm yr 1 and the diameters from 9 28 to 103 40 cm the crown diameters ranged from 0 18 to 15 58 m and the crown ratios from 0 05 to 0 94 m m the data covered low local competition of sdi 2 64 but also very dense stand parts with sdi 4487 49 trees per hectare compared to the usually reported stand related sdi values of 500 2000 trees per hectare pretzsch 2019 sterba 1981 the local sdi s can become low as well as very high as they refer to the local density within the search radius s r the site index related to the quadratic mean height at age 100 and based on the yield tables quoted in the section descriptive data evaluation the si ranged between 20 43 m at age 100 the mixing proportions cover the whole range between monospecific conditions of one to the other species especially the wide range of diameters local densities mixing proportions and site indices made the data suitable for testing of h i h iii for further information see supplementary table 4 3 2 facilitation and increase of potential growth rate in inter versus intraspecific environment h i fig 4 shows that the annual stem diameter growth of the 10 fastest growing trees in inter specific neighborhood green can significantly exceed the growth rates under monospecific conditions at parity of stand density the horizontal broken lines indicate the growth rate of the 10 fastest growing trees in monospecific neighborhood for trees with competition of sdi 250 500 trees in mixed stands green curves the growth rates exceed this level by up to 40 the finding that the potential growth is superior in mixed environment provides evidence of inter specific net facilitation in seven out of 10 cases this net facilitation occurs mainly under low competition for detailed information about the stem diameters of the 10 fastest growing trees see supplementary table 5 for fig 4 we pooled all trees of all chronosequences of the same species assemblage for separate visualization of each of the ten chronosequences of this study see supplement figs 1 3 in summary 8 out of 10 species assemblages provided evidence of net facilitation and increased potential growth rates in mixed compared with monospecific environment for further statistical analysis of any facilitation effects by inter specific neighborhood on the potential growth rate of trees we used again the fastest 10 of trees without and with interspecific neighborhood table 4 reflects that in all 10 cases the growth in the inter specific group was significantly higher than in the intra specific group at least at the level p 0 05 the superiority ranged between a plus of 14 in case of norway spruce in european beech or sessile oak in european beech the superiority amounted to plus 74 and 78 in case of norway spruce when growing in scots pine or sycomore maple growing mixed with european ash in most cases the crown ratio had and additional positive influence in some cases also the other considered variables such as d sdi and si had an additional effect this covariance analyses of the potential stem diameter growth in inter versus intra specific neighborhood factor m based on model 2 the model included the covariables stem diameter crown ratio local sdi and site index in case that they were significant at least at the level p 0 05 and that they increased the aic criteria of the regression compared with the basic model id f factor this variable selection resulted in the model variants 2 1 2 8 presented in table 4 fig 5 visualizes the results for four selected tree species combinations where the potential growth was 14 78 higher in mixed compared with monospecific neighborhood factor 1 14 1 78 in three out of the shown four cases the crown ratio had an additional positive effect on the growth rate fig 5 corroborates that any benefit of mixing depends on both the species identify of the basis species and the neighbors fig 5 a and b show that the potential growth rate of norway spruce benefitted moderately when mixed with european beech 14 but much stronger when mixed with scots pine 74 fig 5 c and d show a plus of 38 for european beech when mixed with norway spruce and a plus of 69 when mixed with scots pine note that the mentioned superiorities refer to growth rates of the 10 best growing trees in both groups mixed versus mono after elimination of any additional effects of d cr sdi si thus the 14 78 plus reflects mainly the effect of facilitation of the different neighboring tree species in low density environment and at parity of other modulating factors such as d si this means that competition and density effects were as far as possible eliminated by only selecting the fastest growing

increasing admixture proportion table 5 for norway spruce when mixed with european beech we found a neutral effect of admixture there was no significant facilitation in most species assemblages both tree species benefitted from the mixture see e g fig 6 c and d in the mixture of norway spruce and european beech only the latter benefitted fig 6 a and b there were no cases were one species benefitted at the expense of the other species i e that an increase of one was coupled with a loss of the other in all mixtures the growth of european beech strongly benefitted from living in mixture

conditions was first tested for the collective of the 10 fastest growing trees per group and plot by model 4 any dependencies of the mixing effects on the site conditions were analyzed only for the mixtures of norway spruce european beech and sessile oak european beech for the other species the range of the site conditions was too narrow for analogous analyses we found a significantly positive effect of inter specific neighborhood on growth however this on average positive effect remained constant along the whole site gradient in none of the cases there was a significant interaction between site conditions and mixing effect see coefficients a3 in table 6 fig 7 visualizes that in both mixtures the fastest growing trees benefitted from living in mixture however the benefit did not change along the site gradient si 20 40 m mean height at age 100 covered by this study an analogous analysis based on model 4 was done based on the whole dataset in order to reveal any modulation of the competition reduction by site quality for the competition reduction we found a tendency of increase with site quality that was close to significant for the mixture of norway spruce and european beech see table 7 and fig 8 for european beech when growing in association with oak we found a significant p 0 002 increase of competition reduction with increasing site quality cases see last row in table 7 and fig 7d in summary in all cases diameter growth was higher in mixed compared with monospecific stands in case of beech in oak the superiority increased slightly with improving site quality 4 discussion 4 1 a consolidated view of facilitation and competition effects on growth analyzing understanding modeling and prognosticating monocultures often entails a thorough consideration of the effects of competition between neighboring plants larocque et al 2013 nambiar and sands 1993 but hardly of the facilitation or reduction of competition by neighbors maestre et al 2009 bruno et al 2003 vandermeer 1992 the results of this study provide evidence that the assumption of maximum growth under solitary conditions and of an exponential growth reduction through increased competition and density as shown in fig 1 is an over simplification in particular we show that tree growth can be increased beyond solitary growth by 14 78 through an inter specific neighborhood under moderate density fig 5 and table 4 we analyzed the feedback spatial stand structure facilitation and competition tree growth and its dependency on site conditions e g site index and silvicultural interventions e g stand density mixing proportion fig 9 by modeling the effects of different stand characteristic on individual tree growth we showed that tree growth can be promoted or reduced facilitation versus competition by intra and interspecific neighborhood models 1 3 showed for different species combinations how the facilitation and competition is modulated by site conditions and stand density our results suggest that the growth competition relationship is uni modal as represent by the bold curve in fig 10 a facilitation and competition act simultaneously pretzsch 2017 vandermeer 1992 they are difficult to disentangle and the measured growth reaction represents the net effect of the interaction between facilitation and competition thin and broken lines respectively in fig 10a in fig 10a the tree growth in solitary conditions is used as a reference 1 0 line and indicates that the trajectory of the measured growth may result from the interplay between facilitation and competition this pattern may apply even in some monospecific populations especially under harsh conditions callaway and walker 1997 canham et al 1994 2004 we also found that an inter specific neighborhood can increase the facilitation and reduce the competition so that the net effect on growth becomes more positive see fig 10b vertical and horizontal arrows fig 10b indicates the shift of the tree growth density relationship due to a facilitation e g tapping of nutrients in deep soil layers which are favorable for species 1 or a reduction in competition e g by spatial or temporal niche complementarity further the inter specific neighborhood may cause a widening of the density range with net facilitation horizontal arrow this may cause a narrowing of the range where net competition has the upper hand figs 4 and 5 showed such a facilitation of trees in mixed stands in several cases trees with moderate density grew even faster in an inter specific neighborhood than trees with low competition in monospecific stands fig 10a shows that net facilitation may dominate at low densities and that net competition may predominate in denser stands the reason may be that around widely spaced trees the negative effect of competition on growth may be still low enough to be compensated or even overcompensated for by the positive effect of facilitation when stand density further increases the growth reduction cannot be balanced out as easily by facilitation and may cause net competition although not easy to detect and to disentangle from competition facilitation may also play a role in closed forest stands with high stand density the study further showed that facilitation and competition reduction may depend on environmental conditions gonzales de andres et al 2018 they may become stronger in high quality sites this means that the stand density range with a net facilitation effect and an increase of tree growth is extended towards higher stand densities see horizontal arrow in fig 10c finally this study showed a strong facilitation and competition reduction through inter specific conditions however this facilitation was site invariant fig 7 table 6 the competition reduction increased only slightly with improving site quality fig 6 table 7 4 2 causes of facilitation and reduction of competition in an inter specific neighborhood comparing the 10 fastest growing trees in a mixed versus monospecific neighborhood fig 5 table 4 showed a 14 78 increase in growth in mixed stands this result remained consistent across different neighboring tree species in low density environments and at parity of other modulating factors such as d and si the finding that stem diameter was not always significant in the models may be attributed to the fact that other tree dimensions such as crown ratio or age overtopped d in correlation with growth the finding that the 10 fastest growing trees of several species were superior means that they had a higher growth rate when surrounded with other species than when growing widely spaced and open we furthermore found a competition reduction of 16 on average ranging from 1 36 calculated for a local sdi value of 1000 ha 1 quadratic mean diameter of 25 cm stand age of 30 years and a mixing proportion of 50 50 for each pair of species fig 5 table 5 how can a higher growth in inter specific mixtures compared to growth without neighbors be explained i e how is it possible that the positive effect of a neighbors is higher than the negative effect what may be the main causes underlying the demonstrated competition reduction under high density conditions the measured net effects of density and distance of neighboring trees on tree growth allowed us the following speculations about the potential mechanisms underpinning the revealed mixing effects norway spruce and european beech many studies showed that the negative effects of soil compaction wiedemann 1923 acidification pallant and rihac 1990 and nutrient depletion kaarakka et al 2014 through norway spruce monocultures can be mitigated by many species admixtures and especially by european beech rothe and binkley 2001 rothe 1997 wiedemann 1942 the latter can facilitate the growing conditions of norway spruce by increasing the temperature especially in early spring by improving litter decomposition and nutrient cycling and turnover pretzsch et al 2020 2010 goisser et al 2016 rothe et al 2002 2003 furthermore beech can benefit from norway spruce through its higher leaf area resulting in higher eutrophic deposition filtering alveteg et al 1998 cannell et al 1998 van dijk and roelofs 1988 an advantage and competition reductions for both species may be their crown shape complementarity i e the shaped norway spruce bottom heavy versus shaped european beech top heavy crowns enable a higher canopy packing density barbeito et al 2017 jucker et al 2015 pretzsch 2014 complementarity in shape may across all mixtures reduce mechanical abrasion and crown shyness hajek et al 2015 fish et al 2006 meng et al 2006 it may also cause higher canopy packing density stand density thurm and pretzsch 2021 and stand leaf area pretzsch and schütze 2021 peng et al 2017 in this way complementarity in shape may result in overyielding williams et al 2017 in addition physiological asynchronity of tree species may be beneficial for their growth pretzsch 2005 rötzer et al 2017 schober 1950 51 for instance norway spruce may benefit of a reduced competition for water in early spring when european beech is still leafless and lives from the reserves of the previous year during this period photosynthesis and growth of spruce may further profit from higher temperatures and light supply until beech sprouts in april may sessile oak and european beech in mixture with oak beech may be facilitated by hydraulic lift this has been observed in particular on dry sites with deeply extending root systems which release water at night into surface near soil horizons of low water potential caldwell et al 1998 prieto et al 2012 sessile oak may benefit from beech by the improvement of soil activity decomposition and nutrient turnover jonard et al 2008 competition reduction may promote european beech when admixed to all species that are less shade tolerant e g oak european beech benefits in such cases by increasing lateral crown expansion or often simply by penetrating crowns of neighbor trees that are less shade tolerant metz et al 2020 bayer et al 2013 ellenberg and leuschner 2010 scots pine and european beech especially on poor sites scots pine can be facilitated by the substantial nutrient input from european beech induced litter translocation and the improved decomposition and turnover of the mixed litter yeste et al 2021 this can improve the water storage and have a particularly positive effect on the mineral nutrient supply european beech can have a beneficial effect on pine primarily through stimulation of the bio element turnover and by improving the nutrition of pine in comparison to pine beech litter has a higher ca mg and k content as well as a lower c n ratio augusto et al 2002 moreover activity of soil fauna and microflora is higher in beech than in conifer stands resulting in a higher litter decomposition rate augusto et al 2002 wiedemann 1942 reduced acidity and a better humus type block et al 1997 scots pine and norway spruce both species complement each other in light ecology crown and root shape and in behavior under drought ruiz peinado et al 2021 wellhausen et al 2017 competition reduction may result from the fact that pine is light demanding round crowned deep rooted and less drought sensitive whereas spruce is shade tolerant slim crowned shallow rooted and strongly isohydric table 1 in drössler et al 2018 p 3 european ash and sycamore maple this species combination creates high biodiversity in the soil high nutrient turnover and a suppression of other competing species e g european beech in its stand ellenberg and leuchner 2010 pp 297 303 frech 2006 these effects may facilitate both component species in such mixtures this brief literature review of the most likely mixing effects within the five analyzed species combinations suggests a differentiation between i density invariant far range effects such as far reaching root systems mycorrhiza nickel et al 2018 and other root associated microbial networks steidinger et al 2019 to this category of effects also belong the slowing down of wind speed avoidance of storm breakage shading and avoidance of sunburn provision of barriers against spread of insects suppression of forest floor vegetation and competing weeds and protection against snow slides or browsing by different neighboring tree species a second category of effects may be ii density driven close range mixing effects such as mechanical abrasion crown shyness and pre emption of water and light by neighbors of a different tree species our results show that density invariant far range effects may cause facilitation and growth increase at low stand density low density conditions are often created in contemporary forest management through edges strong thinning opening for natural regeneration or by natural disturbances they generate the potential of considerable facilitation of tree growth this may not raise the stand related productivity above the level of closed stands but can reduce the losses brought about by density reduction this is in line with the finding by thurm and pretzsch 2021 that the stand density productivity relationship has a broader plateau in mixed compared with monospecific stands in mixed stands the plateau of the stand density productivity relationship may reach further into both the low density and also high density range the percentage of diameter growth increase caused by reduction of competition 16 on average ranging from 1 to 36 is in line with the magnitude of overyielding reported for the respective mixtures in fully stocked stands see introduction this indicates that the overyielding in fully stocked stands may be driven mainly by close range effects it may result from competition reduction and increased density resulting in an advantageous productivity this is in line with thurm and pretzsch 2021 who recently showed that density can be raised by tree species mixing and that overyielding in mixed stands can peak at maximum density 4 3 consequences of the facilitation and competition reduction for individual tree modeling the potential modifier approach for individual tree growth modeling splits the prediction of the size growth e g stem diameter growth into two components pretzsch et al 2019 weiskittel et al 2016 the first is the estimation of the potential tree growth rate i e the expected growth without competition that mainly depends on the tree and site characteristics the second component is the modifier that reduces the potential growth rate depending on the competition and density in the tree s neighborhood our results suggest that in contrast to the common assumptions made in many individual tree models the tree stem growth may not peak under monospecific open grown conditions but rather in mixed species environments and at moderate stand density thus the potential modifier function may not exponentially decrease but rather grow unimodal with modifier values above 1 0 at moderate density in mixtures in contrast to the declining modifier function shown in fig 1 the modifier function in mixed stands may be bell shaped as shown in fig 10 further research considering other tree species species combinations site conditions and stand structures is required to for substantiation these assumptions relevant for modeling are the mostly positive interactions between mixing proportion and local competition that we found in this study positive interactions between tree species were also found by rebola lichtenberg et al 2021 cavard et al 2011 or forrester et al 2011 however our results indicate that the competition reduction through an inter specific neighborhood is even stronger in denser stands we also found a slight positive interaction effect of site index and mixing proportion on growth of european beech when mixed with sessile oak fig 8 this suggests that the competition reduction may be stronger on high quality sites certainly site index is a vague proxy marker of site quality analyses based on environmental factors and resource supply will provide further insight into the relationships between environmental conditions and competition reduction accordingly the potential modifier models should modify the potential growth rate to the expected rate depending on among others crown characteristics and competition index burkhart and tomé 2012 p 314 315 but also stand age and site variables presently used models largely neglect the revealed mixing effects on stem diameter growth however silvicultural guidelines and forest management are often derived from or supported by management models hilmers et al 2020 mason et al 2018 hanewinkel and pretzsch 2000 the presented findings may aid the further development of individual tree models 4 4 consequences of the results for forest management this study aimed to answer several of the ten highest ranked questions regarding mixed forests that coll et al 2018 table 1 identified by interviewing 168 managers from european countries specifically the study addressed which species combinations are beneficial question 4 how the productivity of mixtures differs from that in monospecific stands 5 and which positive and negative effects mixtures can have 6 and 7 this study substantiated that at parity of tree size and stand density trees in the most common species combinations in central europe grew faster than in monospecific stands in the considered time period 1991 2016 this superior wood production of trees in mixed stands adds to their well known advantages in biodiversity dieler et al 2017 felton et al 2010 stability hilmers et al 2020 knoke et al 2008 and recreation edwards et al 2012 pukkala et al 1988 services in forest management facilitation effects are so far specifically used in terms of nurse crop against frost damage pommerening and murphy 2004 and in the admixture of atmospheric nitrogen fixing tree species such as alnus robinia or acacia binkley 2003 carl et al 2018 forrester et al 2006 it is also well known that trees growing in group structures in the alpine zone compete for light but their neighbours also protect them against snow and wind so that they frequently benefit from being associated and grow more than solitary trees forest management makes use of such a permanent facilitation by planting trees in groups or clusters known as rotten in the alpine zone strobel 1995 and nester in the lowlands saha et al 2012 the results of this study quantified the facilitation in inter specific neighborhood it showed that facilitation can improve tree growth in common mixed species forests in both widely spaced stands by far range facilitation effects and in dense stands by near distant competition reduction effects both effects are relevant for silviculture facilitation even at low density conditions enable the production of large and long lived forest products with lower expenses in terms of stand stock and mass productivity at the stand level this means an advantageous growth at low density as commonly observed in selective or future crop tree thinning systems for individual tree size growth acceleration schober 1988a and b abetz 1975 schädelin 1942 competition reduction enables an increase in stand density mass production and climate change mitigation through higher carbon storage the competition reduction observed here enables the maximization of mass production at high density stand management in mixed stands zeller et al 2021 de prado et al 2020 pretzsch 2020 2022 assmann 1970 silvicultural management mainly entails the modification of spatial design and interference into stand structure the distinction between i density invariant far range effects and ii density driven close range operating mechanisms may be a step forward for future spatially explicit tree and stand modeling approaches and experiments as well as for a more goal oriented silvicultural design and stand establishment thus silvicultural measures are suitable for the regulation of density driven close range mixing effects both facilitation and competition reduction can result in higher growth per unit area and be exploited by low or high stand density respectively the reported effects apply to all analyzed species and sites to implement these findings they should be integrated into silvicultural guidelines for mixed species stands as claimed by coll et al 2018 and proposed by mason et al 2018 and pretzsch and zenner 2017 credit authorship

24501,many studies of animal distributions use habitat and climactic variables to explain patterns of observed space use however without behavioral information we can only speculate as to why and how these characteristics are important to species persistence animal borne accelerometer and magnetometer data loggers can be used to detect behaviors and when coupled with telemetry improve our understanding of animal space use and habitat requirements however these loggers collect tremendous quantities of data requiring automated machine learning techniques to identify patterns in the data supervised machine learning requires a set of training signals with known behaviors to train the model to identify the unique signal characteristics associated with each behavior in contrast unsupervised approaches aggregate unlabeled signals into groups based purely on signal similarity but without additional information do not identify specific behaviors in this paper we propose a probabilistic framework for interpreting uncertainty in machine learning techniques the probability profile and demonstrate how to post hoc identify behaviors within signal groups we assess model performance using a matrix based measure of dissimilarity we used a random forest rf and a clustered self organizing map csom for comparison and demonstrate the use of a behavioral profile for each using a data set of high frequency accelerometer and magnetometer data collected from 7 captive wild pigs sus scrofa moving in a 1 ha outdoor enclosure we found that the rf had more discrimination than the csom which had fewer clusters associated with high probabilities of a single behavior 50 the leave p out cross validation statistic of the probability matrix l 1 indicated that there was an average maximum dissimilarity of 20 and 65 between the training and test data sets for the rf and csom methods respectively using a probability profile to describe groups predicted from machine learning allows the variation and error inherent in behavioral prediction to be incorporated directly into the model to better reflect the nuances of behavior derived from accelerometer and or magnetometer signals we discuss the data requirements of this framework demonstrate its application to field data highlight critical assumptions and caveats and examine how it may be used to generate new ecological inference keywords accelerometers behavior machine learning k means clustering som random forest 1 introduction a central aim of ecology is to understand the environmental drivers of fitness and the spatial distribution of individuals resources e g energy water nutrients are required for animal survival growth and reproduction thus resource availability is an important predictor of animal fitness brown et al 2004 matthiopoulos et al 2015 how organisms seek and acquire resources can also be influenced by predation risk decesare et al 2014 thermoregulation street et al 2016 social interactions cozzi et al 2018 and landscape structure beyer et al 2016 therefore animal spatial distributions are the result of interacting and competing immediate and long term needs nathan et al 2008 species distribution models use knowledge of habitat and behavioral requirements to explain observed patterns of use boyce and mcdonald 1999 elith and leathwick 2009 guisan and thuiller 2005 however individuals may exhibit variation in space use across habitat types or utilize a single landscape for multiple purposes mitchell et al 2020 street et al 2016 quantifying this variation is an important step in understanding animal distributions johnson 1980 matthiopoulos et al 2015 nathan et al 2008 van horne 1982 early studies used direct observation to study animal space use yet many animals are difficult to observe in situ resulting in low sample sizes human observer bias and or detection bias aebischer et al 1993 altmann 1974 burghardt et al 2012 johnson 1980 telemetry and gps reduce these issues by allowing animals to be relocated from a distance cochran and rexford 1963 rodgers et al 1996 many approaches exist to associate animal spatial locations with habitat characteristics including compositional analysis aebischer et al 1993 resource and step selection functions boyce and mcdonald 1999 fortin et al 2005 and poisson point process models warton and shepherd 2010 however these approaches are often coarse in scale and thus divorced from the decision making processes made by animals on a per step basis further these models are correlative and the behavioral drivers of animal presence must be inferred or hypothesized from model outputs characteristics of movement tracks such as step length and turning angle may be used to identify coarse behavioral states such as encamped and exploratory behavioral states thereby improving the accuracy of distribution models abrahms et al 2017 auger méthé et al 2016 morales et al 2004 but these states are also correlative for example a small step length and broad turning angle are often associated with an encamped state morales et al 2004 but numerous animal behaviors may occur within that state so long as they are characterized by similar steps and angles e g fighting resting area restricted foraging etc these states may be better thought of as movement modes and without additional information such modes cannot explicitly identify the behaviors performed in a particular state animal borne accelerometer and magnetometer dataloggers measure the change in speed direction and orientation of an animal in the longitudinal lateral and dorso ventral x y and z axes allowing for more detailed behavioral identification abrahms et al 2017 brown et al 2013 shepard et al 2008 williams et al 2020 wilson et al 2008 in such a data set a behavior such as resting may be sensed as a lateral orientation with little to no acceleration versus walking as an upright orientation with oscillations corresponding to each step chakravarty et al 2019 wilson et al 2018 however for many behaviors high sampling frequencies are required for detailed resolution of signals while these signals can be distinguished visually loggers often produce tremendous quantities of data requiring automated techniques such as decision trees random forests rfs and artificial neural networks ann halsey et al 2009 nathan et al 2012 wang and xu 2015 yoda et al 2001 to identify the behaviors associated with a given signal much accelerometer research has applied machine learning techniques in a supervised manner which requires a priori labeling of training signals with known behaviors so that the trained model can classify similar signals throughout the full data chakravarty et al 2020 leos barajas et al 2017 nathan et al 2012 these approaches predict the behavior associated with a signal based on its similarity to the training signal but are limited to pre defined behaviors for signal identification nathan et al 2012 wang and xu 2015 by contrast unsupervised approaches group the data signals based purely on similarity but biological interpretation of the signal groups identified requires additional post hoc attention chimienti et al 2016 sakamoto et al 2009 this has often been accomplished by using auxiliary information such as depth or altitude to determine the behavior or behaviors within the groups sakamoto et al 2009 this is further complicated by the highly subjective nature of behavior and the rarity of standardized ethograms stanton et al 2015 behaviors can be characterized on multiple scales and depending on the definition a single behavior may be characterized by multiple signals which may occur in different groups or be so similar in their movement characteristics as to be indistinguishable for example behaviors such as grazing and browsing have different head postures and may produce distinct signals though both may be classified by the analyst as foraging conversely a single signal may be shared across many behaviors sniffing and rooting may share a head down and meandering trajectory but have different implications for the animal one is searching and the other is consuming traditionally a signal group cluster or class would be defined as its majority behavior and other behaviors that produce the same signal determine the error rate e g nathan et al 2012 although we may see variation in a signal group due to model error this can be assessed through model validation still a well validated model that assigns a group its majority behavior ignores much of the potential for biomechanical similarity among behavioral signals and unrealistically simplifies behavior the aggregated error may reveal interesting behavior specific trends such as signal commonalities between behaviors or unique signals from a single behavior understanding the probability of observing one of many possible behaviors rather than a single behavior given a data signal can lead to new tools and insights in theoretical and applied ecology here we propose a framework to investigate variation in behavioral classification and clustering by explicitly characterizing the probability of observing target behaviors given a data signal we demonstrate the construction of stochastic matrices for unique data signals groups and develop a cross validation procedure with matrix based validation metrics to evaluate model fit and the consistency of predicted behavioral profiles our framework can be applied using either supervised and unsupervised approaches to identify behaviors from biologger data and we demonstrate the application and interpretation of outputs using both approaches applied to empirical data 2 methods 2 1 workflow overview our proposed approach uses two data sources 1 a time series of accelerometer and magnetometer signals and 2 temporally explicit behavioral observations collected simultaneously using these two data streams our workflow is 1 combine accelerometer and magnetometer data with behavioral observations 2 process the data to reduce noise and compress the data over a time interval 3 perform a machine learning method to group the signals 4 construct a matrix of stochastic vectors for the behavioral probabilities given data signals 5 evaluate the predictive accuracy of the matrix given new data there is a large body of literature on the deployment and use of accelerometers and magnetometers brown et al 2013 williams et al 2020 wilson et al 2008 and on classifying animal behaviors from direct observation chakravarty et al 2020 nathan et al 2012 shepard et al 2008 wilson et al 2020 yoda et al 2001 as such we do not discuss these here and presume that readers have already collected the relevant data fig 1 2 2 data preprocessing there are many ways to preprocess accelerometer magnetometer hereafter am data for analysis but these often involve calculating additional metrics smoothing and dimensionality reduction animal borne accelerometers measure both the dynamic acceleration due to animal movement and the static pull of earth s gravitational field thus many separate the raw acceleration into the static and dynamic components of acceleration shepard et al 2008 the dynamic acceleration can then be used to derive proxies for energy expenditure such as vedba the vectorial sum of dynamic body acceleration or odba overall dynamic body acceleration gleiss et al 2011 qasem et al 2012 wilson et al 2020 but regardless of the input channels chosen by the analyst accelerometer and magnetometer measurements are often noisy and require smoothing of data channels to isolate the signals from the noise viviani et al 2005 given an appropriate smoothing procedure smoothed signals may be evenly resampled and subsequently subjected to dimensionality reduction fig 2 appendix vi 5 many analysts choose a fixed time period segmentation e g 1 s and summarize the data over this period using running averages and standard deviations shepard et al 2008 alternatively principal components analysis pca can be used to compress the data but retain the critical characteristics of the data górecki and krzyśko 2012 appendix vi 7 the processed data are then paired to their respective direct behavioral observations by their shared dates and times to construct a time series of dimensionally reduced accelerometer and or magnetometer signals and their associated behaviors 2 3 machine learning for classification or clustering we next must group the signals based on common signal structures and characterize them in terms of the behaviors observed for each signal type this may be performed using either supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms and the analyst may use whatever procedure is most appropriate for their data and hypotheses here we demonstrate behavioral classification using a common supervised algorithm random forests rfs and signal clustering using a novel application of an uncommon unsupervised algorithm clustered self organizing maps csoms we chose these to demonstrate the robustness of the framework to the nuances and complexity of the selected procedure because rfs are increasingly common in ecology we do not discuss details of rf based analysis and instead direct interested readers to previous literature on these subjects see cutler et al 2007 ladds et al 2017 nathan et al 2012 soms are a type of unsupervised artificial neural network ann and are comprised of two neural layers and their weighted connections chon 2011 kohonen 2013 appendix vi 8 each input neuron associated with an explanatory feature in the data is exhaustively connected to all output neurons cells on the map appendix i figure s1 each cell represents data that share similar characteristics and neighboring cells are generally more closely related than to more distant cells kohonen 2013 appendix i figure s2 soms learn by the exposure of data points to a randomly weighted initialized network each exposure for a total of nepoch rounds results in a winning neuron the weighted neuron that best matches the datapoint during the initial covering phase both the winning neurons and their neighbors are updated each round according to the initial covering c the number of times neighbors will be updated and the initial neighborhood radius rinit which controls how many neighboring neurons are updated with the winning neuron during this phase the neighborhood radius will decrease incrementally from rinit to 1 to minimize overfitting where r 1 is only the winning neuron and r 2 is the winning neuron and its immediate neighbors jafari marandi and keramati 2014 after the initial covering phase only the winning neuron will be updated for the remaining rounds given an index for an updated neuron i a winning neuron c an exposure number t an epoch number t a model associated with neuron i at t mi t and a data point being exposed to the network x t the model at time t 1 is 1 m i t 1 m i t h i t c r x t m i t the sub function hi t c r controls the degree of change in the iterated model based on the proximity of neuron i to neuron c the winning neuron the epoch t and the current neighborhood radius r the number of distinct signal types cells on the map is determined by the analyst determination of the optimal number of cells in the som for a given data set is the subject of much debate in the literature chon 2011 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 spanakis and weiss 2017 while there is no hard and fast rule it is recommended to run soms with multiple grid sizes shalaginov and franke 2015 regardless of grid size chosen an objective approach is needed following som creation to identify the number of unique signal types that occur in the som because adjacent cells of the som are more similar than are more distant cells kohonen 2013 we use k means clustering to group similar cells into clusters jafari marandi et al 2017 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 appendix vi 9 this approach produces a new csom wherein each cell is assigned a cluster based on its similarity to its neighbors and the number of clusters k to be identified fig 3 typically k means clustering requires k to be defined beforehand vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 but by using a silhouette analysis rousseeuw 1987 conducted on a range of k we can eliminate subjectivity in cluster parameterization given k total clusters the silhouette for a given cell i in cluster l is 2 s i l min b i j a i l max a i l min b i j where ai l is the average distance between cell i and all other cells in l and bi j is the average distance between cell i and all cells within cluster j j 1 2 k excluding l the average silhouette s l indicates within cluster similarity with values approaching 1 indicating appropriate and 1 inappropriate clustering rousseeuw 1987 because k means clustering is sensitive to the starting observations at initialization vesanto alhoniemi 2000 the datapoints must be randomized and the clustering repeated nrep times with s l calculated for each cluster and each repetition the value of k that maximizes the average s l across all nrep trials kbest is the optimal number of clusters appendix i figure s3 after fitting the som and identifying the optimal number of signal types we produce a clustering scheme whereby data in a som cell are assigned to the l th cluster and observations in l are as similar as possible to determine the behaviors associated with each cluster and assess the discriminatory power of the scheme we pair the observation time of the behaviors to the time of each clustered signal to identify the behaviors that occur in each cluster 2 4 behavioral probability matrix we summarize the results of the classification and clustering procedures by constructing a probability profile describing the probability of observing each of the potential behaviors given that the data signal was categorized into a signal group cluster or class for either the rf or csom or both we may construct a n k matrix d where each entry is the probability of observing the i th behavior in the j th cluster class we then use d the probability profile as our classifier to maintain the signal specific behavioral variation this matrix improves upon previous attempts at remote identification of animal behavior as it explicitly characterizes the probabilities of each behavior given a signal type nathan et al 2012 to derive d we construct a n k contingency table from the behaviorally explicit data matrix a describing the proportion of each behavior by group combination relative to the entire data set i e p behavior and group the summation of each column in a produces a 1 k vector b that describes the probability of observing a signal group independent of the behaviors i e p group and the summation of each row in a produces a n 1 vector c that describes the probability of observing a behavior in the data set independent of the groups i e p behavior we may calculate d by dividing each entry in column j of a by its associated column sum or value in b fig 4 appendix vi 10 the resulting matrix d represents the probability that a signal is associated with each behavior given that it was assigned to a specific group i e p behavior group tables 1 2 to extend prediction to data for which there are no corresponding direct behavioral observations i e data whose true behaviors are unknown we expose the new data to the model to obtain a class or cluster assignment assuming the training data is representative of new data we can use d from the original data to approximate the unknown profile d 2 5 model validation to test model performance and assess whether d from the original data approximates the unknown profile d we must perform model validation validation is conducted using a resampling exercise whereby data with corresponding direct behavioral observations hereafter termed the known behavioral data set are randomly subsetted into test holdout and training total excluding holdout data sets james et al 2013 ch 5 for example the test subset may contain ntest 100 random observations from the known behavior data set and the remaining training data may be used to create a validation model for the rf we construct a classification matrix dtrain using a rf algorithm applied to the training data and the test data are subsequently exposed to the same rf to classify the holdout signals and construct the matrix dtest appendix vi 14 for the som we construct a validation som vsom using the training data and the number of clusters kbest as determined by the general som all known behavior to maintain consistency across the iterations the matrix dtrain is constructed from vsom and the test data is then exposed to the vsom to obtain cluster assignments and construct dtest appendix vi 11 12 if the clustering or classification system is effective then on average dtrain and dtest should be similar to evaluate this we calculate the l 1 norm l 1 a measure of matrix dissimilarity between dtrain and dtest paolini et al 2018 given n observed behaviors i e the number of rows in d and k clusters i e the number of columns in d l 1 is the maximum across the k clusters 3 l 1 max i 1 n d i k t e s t d i k t r a i n k 1 2 k the theoretical interval of l 1 as calculated here is 0 2 representing the cases where there is complete similarity l 1 0 and at least one column of complete dissimilarity l 1 2 between the test and training datasets i e the behavior predicted and the true behavior are different thus we divide l 1 by 2 to produce l 1 such that 0 represents perfect similarity and 1 perfect dissimilarity between test and training data sets if the test data are representative of the training data and if the algorithm accurately predicts new data then over many iterations of this procedure using m randomly selected test training sets we expect l 1 to approach 0 fig 5 note that l1 is inherently a conservative metric as it characterizes performance of d only by its worst performing column alternatively rather than the maximum one could use a standardized arithmetic mean for a metric that may better describe overall performance 4 l a v g k 1 k i 1 n d i k t e s t d i k t r a i n 2 k 2 6 application to field data wild pigs we used an am data set collected on wild pigs sus scrofa in a semi natural enclosure to demonstrate the application of this framework to field data biologging data was collected from wild pigs translocated to a 1 ha enclosure in starkville ms the enclosure was equipped with 6 motion activated infrared cameras synced to the internet to maintain accurate time seven wild pigs 3 males and 4 females were captured and fitted with daily diary dd accelerometer and magnetometer data loggers wildbytes inc swansea uk sampling at 40 and 13 hz respectively we include these data for demonstration purposes only and emphasize that further processing may be necessary for biological inference e g by assessing different tri axial rotation rules see brown et al 2013 shepard et al 2008 wilson et al 2008 individual pigs were identified from videos and the time behavior exhibited and duration of behavior were recorded behaviors were classified into 5 broad categories in order of importance 1 consumption 2 resting 3 environmental interaction 4 locomotion and 5 social interaction appendix ii we used a ranking system to ensure that we detected behaviors even if they commonly occurred with other behaviors i e head down and consuming food continuously while walking would be classified as consumption each observation was trimmed i e the first and last second removed resulting in a 1 sec minimum for all observations if a single behavior was interrupted by a brief bout of a different behavior 2 s whereafter the original behavior was resumed the whole bout was classified as the first behavior for example a time series consisting of walking 5 s freeze and scan for predators 1 s and resume walking 5 s would be classified as locomotion 11 s behaviors were paired with dd data by using the video timestamp and the dd s internal clock synched prior to deployment each second of dd data 7 channels acc x acc y acc z mag x mag y mag z vedba at 40 hz channel was smoothed using a cubic polynomial spline λ 1 and resampled evenly from each curve 7 channels x 50 samples s 350 measurements s a pca was performed on the samples for each of the 7 data channels and the first 3 principal component vectors pcs 95 99 of the variation per channel

appendix iv for additional analyses using alternative grid sizes the rf was fit with 500 trees 8418 videos of 7 captive wild pigs were recorded and classified manually resulting in 75 601 s 21 h 3 hrs pig of observed behavior from 5 behavioral categories only biologging data for which there was a corresponding behavioral observation were used in the analysis the number of observed behaviors in each group were tallied and matrices a and d and vectors b and c were constructed data cleaning pairing and analyses were conducted in daily diary multi trace v 25 feb 2018 wildbytes inc program r v 3 3 1 r core team 2016 appendix vi 1 3 10 12 14 and matlab 2017a the mathworks inc 2017a appendix vi 4 9 11 15 the random forests were fit with the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 appendix vi 13 14 3 results as proportions of the entire data set environmental interaction 37 62 and locomotion 25 90 were the most observed behaviors followed by consumption 17 76 resting 11 52 and social interaction 7 21 the average silhouette for the general som was maximized at k 9 s l 0 4895 appendix i figure s3 the random forest converged after 100 trees for the rf method there was an overall 22 out of bag error rate irrespective of class each group was best predicted by a single behavior ranging from 97 resting to 70 locomotion table 1 the consumption group group 1 was most likely to be the consumption behavior 76 followed by locomotion behavior 15 the locomotion group group 2 was most likely to be a locomotion behavior 70 followed by a consumption behavior 17 5 the environmental interaction group group 3 was most likely to be an environmental interaction behavior 74 followed by a consumption behavior 16 this might suggest that behaviors associated with consumption in wild pigs produce several variable signals with some that appear more similar to a locomotion or environmental interaction signal than most consumption signals this might be explained by blended signals where an animal is consuming food and thus its behavior is classified under consumption but is simultaneously walking or scanning locomotion or environmental interaction respectively for the csom method the clusters represented diverse behaviors with a high proportion of clusters that predicted behavioral combinations rather than a single behavior only 4 9 total clusters exhibited a 50 probability for a single behavior 2 environmental interaction 1 locomotion 1 consumption table 2 the remaining clusters had a dominant behavior that was larger than the other behaviors but 50 of the total probability of the cluster 3 environmental interaction 1 locomotion 1 resting environmental interaction was the most prevalent behavior in our data and was either the most or second most probable in all clusters this may indicate that the csom struggled to distinguish environmental interaction from the other behaviors perhaps because the primary behaviors that compose environmental interaction i e sniffing scanning may not have particularly distinctive signals further pigs frequently interrupted one behavior with brief bouts of other behaviors that may have introduced variation in our classification system or produced blended signals making it difficult to separate the behaviors into discrete categories locomotion was the second most prevalent behavior with the majority probability in clusters 2 and 8 and was second most probable in 3 clusters many non locomotive behaviors were frequently accompanied by meandering slow tortuous movement which may share similar signal characteristics to walking locomotion or were punctuated by bouts of walking which may mask the other behavior s signals completely consumption composed 60 of cluster 3 and resting behavior was the most prevalent in cluster 9 at 38 although social interaction did not dominate any cluster it was the second most likely behavior at 25 in cluster 1 the resampling procedure showed that there was an average maximum cluster dissimilarity of l 1 0 65 or 65 between the training and test data sets and an average mean cluster dissimilarity of l a v g 0 31 or 31 using the csom and an average maximum cluster dissimilarity of l 1 0 20 or 20 and an average mean cluster dissimilarity of l a v g 0 11 or 11 for the rf fig 6 this may be interpreted as 35 similarity between the test and training probability matrices for the csom method and 80 similarity for the rf method indicating that the rf approach better predicted new data even though the hold out data was 1 1000th the size of the training data this is good evidence to conclude that the rf on average accurately predicted new data and that the clusters identified as most distinctive by the 20 20 csom method did not match our assigned behavioral labels thus by performing this crucial validation step we can conclude that matrix d obtained from the trained rf but not the csom can be used to approximate the probabilistic behavioral profiles d from unobserved data but see appendix iv for additional csom analyses 4 discussion behavior is an important but often overlooked tool in interpreting animal distributions abrahms et al 2017 roever et al 2014 and a variety of approaches have been used to link animal behavior to data sets of acceleration brown et al 2013 wilson et al 2008 here we presented a probabilistic framework for interpreting animal behavior classified or clustered from am signals we applied two machine learning techniques one supervised where behaviors were paired with accelerometer data prior to classification and one unsupervised which first clustered the signals and then used the observed behaviors sakamoto et al 2009 chimienti et al 2016 nathan et al 2012 both approaches ultimately produce a matrix identifying the probability of observing a behavior given a known acceleration signal fig 3 tables 1 2 but validation showed that the csom method performed poorly and thus the probability profile cannot be trusted though most current approaches assign a signal type to a target behavior nathan et al 2012 the rf showed many behaviors exhibited similar data signals and several groups were likely to reflect multiple rather than single behaviors this may be because some behaviors may be difficult to discriminate using collar attached accelerometers e g nathan et al 2012 wang and xu 2015 and by using a probability profile we accommodate this explicitly quantifying the variation in animal behaviors across landscapes is crucial for our understanding of animal movement johnson 1980 matthiopoulos et al 2015 nathan et al 2008 van horne 1982 animals may use a single landscape for multiple purposes complicating the ability of researchers to predict a single behavior from landscape features street et al 2016 using a probability profile accounts for this but also allows for the empirical calculation of multiple behavioral probabilities for any landscape thus this may be used to estimate the relative probability that an animal will engage in a behavior provided an environmental context conceptually similar to a resource selection function rsf boyce and mcdonald 1999 one could estimate the probability of observing the behavior given a suite of covariates and thus predict the relative probability of observing a given behavior in space and time we foresee 2 general approaches to producing such a model first a simple logit model as commonly applied to e g rsfs could produce the desired spatial model of behavior however the very high refresh rates for accelerometers e g 1 hz will typically produce many behavioral observations at a given spatial location particularly if the resolution of the spatial layers is large as is common for remotely sensed landscape data products application of logit models will thus require researchers to consider how best to accommodate what is a clear violation of independence for such a model this could be accomplished by sub sampling data to a single observation per pixel or by aggregating averaging probabilities for behaviors within a given pixel neither outcome is particularly appealing due to loss of information but the resulting logit models are well described in the literature and have ample tools for model validation calibration and sensitivity e g chivers et al 2014 harrell 2016 alternatively hidden markov models hmms have been recently applied to accelerometry data leos barajas 2017 though far less common than standard logit models these or similar models that incorporate autocorrelation structures e g temporal autoregressive models hooten et al 2017 could be used to generate the desired spatial models while accommodating dependence between consecutive observations provided that we have a properly parameterized probabilistic spatial model of behavior multiplicative pairing of such models with simple models of space use e g rsfs combines the relative probability of occurrence with the relative probability of observing different behaviors in that location akin to a utilization kernel for animal behavior this behavior kernel should reflect the relative probability of a known behavior weighted by the probability of the animal using that space worton 1989 these models enabled by the probabilistic framework presented here may offer tremendous opportunities for new insight for example the ideal free distribution ifd posits the equilibrium distribution of a population will be achieved when all individuals have equal fitness relative to local density and environmental quality fretwell and lucas 1969 if animal fitness may be thought of as an energy budget whereby animals must balance energetic costs with inputs brown et al 2004 then we should expect that animal fitness will be highest in areas where energy intake exceeds expenditure these areas of high relative fitness should be identifiable following the two stage model described above as locations with high probabilities of occurrence and of behaviors promoting energy intake we expect that the behavior kernel will strongly correlate with the ifd and provide a mechanistic link between the behaviors of individuals and the distributions of populations a longstanding goal of predictive ecology matthiopoulos et al 2015 one concern with our approach is that the model may not accurately represent the behavioral probabilities of new data yates et al 2018 by performing a resampling exercise and using the l 1 matrix based statistic we observed that data withheld from the rf were accurately classified but the csom method did not accurately identify new data thus the csom model overall did not perform well and thus is not suitable for either the direct assignment or probability profile approach our approach acknowledges that behaviors with similar characteristics should be difficult to identify in any machine learning approach although this problem may be more pronounced in unsupervised learning algorithms nathan et al 2012 it is a common challenge of working with behavioral data we emphasize that the type of machine learning technique used should be dictated by the questions the analyst has for the data set however use of a probability profile rather than a direct assignment can be adopted regardless of the algorithm used to group the data provided that the model validates well it is also worth noting that the apparent poor performance of the csom may be attributed to the validation metric l 1 this metric is mathematically well described and is calculated as the maximum observed summed difference between entries of the columns of two matrices if two matrices are identical save for a single column l 1 bases dissimilarity only on the differing column l 1 is thus a highly conservative metric of matrix dissimilarity that may be interpreted as the maximum dissimilarity observed across signal types by contrast we may instead evaluate matrix dissimilarity using the arithmetic mean of the summed differences between columns rather than the maximum this metric is no longer conservative but may be a better reflection of overall performance when few signal types perform poorly indeed the average summed differences showed overall better agreement between dtest and dtrain than suggested by l 1 for the both the csom and rf approaches fig 6 selection of the validation metric should be determined by the specific needs of the project and the degree of predictive accuracy desired there was likely some error in label assignment as it was difficult to identify individual pigs and to temporally synchronize dd observations to videos additionally the behavioral proportions observed via video may not represent the true frequency of pig behavior in the enclosure and may differ from those of wild pigs burghardt et al 2012 because captive pigs were supplied with food they may spend less time engaging in consumption behaviors as their wild counterparts grandia et al 2001 however of critical concern is the possibility that certain behaviors may not be represented in the training data e g swimming for such cases our system would be incapable of identifying these behaviors we reiterate that data need to be representative of the total variation in data signals and behaviors and emphasize that validation is

24501,many studies of animal distributions use habitat and climactic variables to explain patterns of observed space use however without behavioral information we can only speculate as to why and how these characteristics are important to species persistence animal borne accelerometer and magnetometer data loggers can be used to detect behaviors and when coupled with telemetry improve our understanding of animal space use and habitat requirements however these loggers collect tremendous quantities of data requiring automated machine learning techniques to identify patterns in the data supervised machine learning requires a set of training signals with known behaviors to train the model to identify the unique signal characteristics associated with each behavior in contrast unsupervised approaches aggregate unlabeled signals into groups based purely on signal similarity but without additional information do not identify specific behaviors in this paper we propose a probabilistic framework for interpreting uncertainty in machine learning techniques the probability profile and demonstrate how to post hoc identify behaviors within signal groups we assess model performance using a matrix based measure of dissimilarity we used a random forest rf and a clustered self organizing map csom for comparison and demonstrate the use of a behavioral profile for each using a data set of high frequency accelerometer and magnetometer data collected from 7 captive wild pigs sus scrofa moving in a 1 ha outdoor enclosure we found that the rf had more discrimination than the csom which had fewer clusters associated with high probabilities of a single behavior 50 the leave p out cross validation statistic of the probability matrix l 1 indicated that there was an average maximum dissimilarity of 20 and 65 between the training and test data sets for the rf and csom methods respectively using a probability profile to describe groups predicted from machine learning allows the variation and error inherent in behavioral prediction to be incorporated directly into the model to better reflect the nuances of behavior derived from accelerometer and or magnetometer signals we discuss the data requirements of this framework demonstrate its application to field data highlight critical assumptions and caveats and examine how it may be used to generate new ecological inference keywords accelerometers behavior machine learning k means clustering som random forest 1 introduction a central aim of ecology is to understand the environmental drivers of fitness and the spatial distribution of individuals resources e g energy water nutrients are required for animal survival growth and reproduction thus resource availability is an important predictor of animal fitness brown et al 2004 matthiopoulos et al 2015 how organisms seek and acquire resources can also be influenced by predation risk decesare et al 2014 thermoregulation street et al 2016 social interactions cozzi et al 2018 and landscape structure beyer et al 2016 therefore animal spatial distributions are the result of interacting and competing immediate and long term needs nathan et al 2008 species distribution models use knowledge of habitat and behavioral requirements to explain observed patterns of use boyce and mcdonald 1999 elith and leathwick 2009 guisan and thuiller 2005 however individuals may exhibit variation in space use across habitat types or utilize a single landscape for multiple purposes mitchell et al 2020 street et al 2016 quantifying this variation is an important step in understanding animal distributions johnson 1980 matthiopoulos et al 2015 nathan et al 2008 van horne 1982 early studies used direct observation to study animal space use yet many animals are difficult to observe in situ resulting in low sample sizes human observer bias and or detection bias aebischer et al 1993 altmann 1974 burghardt et al 2012 johnson 1980 telemetry and gps reduce these issues by allowing animals to be relocated from a distance cochran and rexford 1963 rodgers et al 1996 many approaches exist to associate animal spatial locations with habitat characteristics including compositional analysis aebischer et al 1993 resource and step selection functions boyce and mcdonald 1999 fortin et al 2005 and poisson point process models warton and shepherd 2010 however these approaches are often coarse in scale and thus divorced from the decision making processes made by animals on a per step basis further these models are correlative and the behavioral drivers of animal presence must be inferred or hypothesized from model outputs characteristics of movement tracks such as step length and turning angle may be used to identify coarse behavioral states such as encamped and exploratory behavioral states thereby improving the accuracy of distribution models abrahms et al 2017 auger méthé et al 2016 morales et al 2004 but these states are also correlative for example a small step length and broad turning angle are often associated with an encamped state morales et al 2004 but numerous animal behaviors may occur within that state so long as they are characterized by similar steps and angles e g fighting resting area restricted foraging etc these states may be better thought of as movement modes and without additional information such modes cannot explicitly identify the behaviors performed in a particular state animal borne accelerometer and magnetometer dataloggers measure the change in speed direction and orientation of an animal in the longitudinal lateral and dorso ventral x y and z axes allowing for more detailed behavioral identification abrahms et al 2017 brown et al 2013 shepard et al 2008 williams et al 2020 wilson et al 2008 in such a data set a behavior such as resting may be sensed as a lateral orientation with little to no acceleration versus walking as an upright orientation with oscillations corresponding to each step chakravarty et al 2019 wilson et al 2018 however for many behaviors high sampling frequencies are required for detailed resolution of signals while these signals can be distinguished visually loggers often produce tremendous quantities of data requiring automated techniques such as decision trees random forests rfs and artificial neural networks ann halsey et al 2009 nathan et al 2012 wang and xu 2015 yoda et al 2001 to identify the behaviors associated with a given signal much accelerometer research has applied machine learning techniques in a supervised manner which requires a priori labeling of training signals with known behaviors so that the trained model can classify similar signals throughout the full data chakravarty et al 2020 leos barajas et al 2017 nathan et al 2012 these approaches predict the behavior associated with a signal based on its similarity to the training signal but are limited to pre defined behaviors for signal identification nathan et al 2012 wang and xu 2015 by contrast unsupervised approaches group the data signals based purely on similarity but biological interpretation of the signal groups identified requires additional post hoc attention chimienti et al 2016 sakamoto et al 2009 this has often been accomplished by using auxiliary information such as depth or altitude to determine the behavior or behaviors within the groups sakamoto et al 2009 this is further complicated by the highly subjective nature of behavior and the rarity of standardized ethograms stanton et al 2015 behaviors can be characterized on multiple scales and depending on the definition a single behavior may be characterized by multiple signals which may occur in different groups or be so similar in their movement characteristics as to be indistinguishable for example behaviors such as grazing and browsing have different head postures and may produce distinct signals though both may be classified by the analyst as foraging conversely a single signal may be shared across many behaviors sniffing and rooting may share a head down and meandering trajectory but have different implications for the animal one is searching and the other is consuming traditionally a signal group cluster or class would be defined as its majority behavior and other behaviors that produce the same signal determine the error rate e g nathan et al 2012 although we may see variation in a signal group due to model error this can be assessed through model validation still a well validated model that assigns a group its majority behavior ignores much of the potential for biomechanical similarity among behavioral signals and unrealistically simplifies behavior the aggregated error may reveal interesting behavior specific trends such as signal commonalities between behaviors or unique signals from a single behavior understanding the probability of observing one of many possible behaviors rather than a single behavior given a data signal can lead to new tools and insights in theoretical and applied ecology here we propose a framework to investigate variation in behavioral classification and clustering by explicitly characterizing the probability of observing target behaviors given a data signal we demonstrate the construction of stochastic matrices for unique data signals groups and develop a cross validation procedure with matrix based validation metrics to evaluate model fit and the consistency of predicted behavioral profiles our framework can be applied using either supervised and unsupervised approaches to identify behaviors from biologger data and we demonstrate the application and interpretation of outputs using both approaches applied to empirical data 2 methods 2 1 workflow overview our proposed approach uses two data sources 1 a time series of accelerometer and magnetometer signals and 2 temporally explicit behavioral observations collected simultaneously using these two data streams our workflow is 1 combine accelerometer and magnetometer data with behavioral observations 2 process the data to reduce noise and compress the data over a time interval 3 perform a machine learning method to group the signals 4 construct a matrix of stochastic vectors for the behavioral probabilities given data signals 5 evaluate the predictive accuracy of the matrix given new data there is a large body of literature on the deployment and use of accelerometers and magnetometers brown et al 2013 williams et al 2020 wilson et al 2008 and on classifying animal behaviors from direct observation chakravarty et al 2020 nathan et al 2012 shepard et al 2008 wilson et al 2020 yoda et al 2001 as such we do not discuss these here and presume that readers have already collected the relevant data fig 1 2 2 data preprocessing there are many ways to preprocess accelerometer magnetometer hereafter am data for analysis but these often involve calculating additional metrics smoothing and dimensionality reduction animal borne accelerometers measure both the dynamic acceleration due to animal movement and the static pull of earth s gravitational field thus many separate the raw acceleration into the static and dynamic components of acceleration shepard et al 2008 the dynamic acceleration can then be used to derive proxies for energy expenditure such as vedba the vectorial sum of dynamic body acceleration or odba overall dynamic body acceleration gleiss et al 2011 qasem et al 2012 wilson et al 2020 but regardless of the input channels chosen by the analyst accelerometer and magnetometer measurements are often noisy and require smoothing of data channels to isolate the signals from the noise viviani et al 2005 given an appropriate smoothing procedure smoothed signals may be evenly resampled and subsequently subjected to dimensionality reduction fig 2 appendix vi 5 many analysts choose a fixed time period segmentation e g 1 s and summarize the data over this period using running averages and standard deviations shepard et al 2008 alternatively principal components analysis pca can be used to compress the data but retain the critical characteristics of the data górecki and krzyśko 2012 appendix vi 7 the processed data are then paired to their respective direct behavioral observations by their shared dates and times to construct a time series of dimensionally reduced accelerometer and or magnetometer signals and their associated behaviors 2 3 machine learning for classification or clustering we next must group the signals based on common signal structures and characterize them in terms of the behaviors observed for each signal type this may be performed using either supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms and the analyst may use whatever procedure is most appropriate for their data and hypotheses here we demonstrate behavioral classification using a common supervised algorithm random forests rfs and signal clustering using a novel application of an uncommon unsupervised algorithm clustered self organizing maps csoms we chose these to demonstrate the robustness of the framework to the nuances and complexity of the selected procedure because rfs are increasingly common in ecology we do not discuss details of rf based analysis and instead direct interested readers to previous literature on these subjects see cutler et al 2007 ladds et al 2017 nathan et al 2012 soms are a type of unsupervised artificial neural network ann and are comprised of two neural layers and their weighted connections chon 2011 kohonen 2013 appendix vi 8 each input neuron associated with an explanatory feature in the data is exhaustively connected to all output neurons cells on the map appendix i figure s1 each cell represents data that share similar characteristics and neighboring cells are generally more closely related than to more distant cells kohonen 2013 appendix i figure s2 soms learn by the exposure of data points to a randomly weighted initialized network each exposure for a total of nepoch rounds results in a winning neuron the weighted neuron that best matches the datapoint during the initial covering phase both the winning neurons and their neighbors are updated each round according to the initial covering c the number of times neighbors will be updated and the initial neighborhood radius rinit which controls how many neighboring neurons are updated with the winning neuron during this phase the neighborhood radius will decrease incrementally from rinit to 1 to minimize overfitting where r 1 is only the winning neuron and r 2 is the winning neuron and its immediate neighbors jafari marandi and keramati 2014 after the initial covering phase only the winning neuron will be updated for the remaining rounds given an index for an updated neuron i a winning neuron c an exposure number t an epoch number t a model associated with neuron i at t mi t and a data point being exposed to the network x t the model at time t 1 is 1 m i t 1 m i t h i t c r x t m i t the sub function hi t c r controls the degree of change in the iterated model based on the proximity of neuron i to neuron c the winning neuron the epoch t and the current neighborhood radius r the number of distinct signal types cells on the map is determined by the analyst determination of the optimal number of cells in the som for a given data set is the subject of much debate in the literature chon 2011 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 spanakis and weiss 2017 while there is no hard and fast rule it is recommended to run soms with multiple grid sizes shalaginov and franke 2015 regardless of grid size chosen an objective approach is needed following som creation to identify the number of unique signal types that occur in the som because adjacent cells of the som are more similar than are more distant cells kohonen 2013 we use k means clustering to group similar cells into clusters jafari marandi et al 2017 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 appendix vi 9 this approach produces a new csom wherein each cell is assigned a cluster based on its similarity to its neighbors and the number of clusters k to be identified fig 3 typically k means clustering requires k to be defined beforehand vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 but by using a silhouette analysis rousseeuw 1987 conducted on a range of k we can eliminate subjectivity in cluster parameterization given k total clusters the silhouette for a given cell i in cluster l is 2 s i l min b i j a i l max a i l min b i j where ai l is the average distance between cell i and all other cells in l and bi j is the average distance between cell i and all cells within cluster j j 1 2 k excluding l the average silhouette s l indicates within cluster similarity with values approaching 1 indicating appropriate and 1 inappropriate clustering rousseeuw 1987 because k means clustering is sensitive to the starting observations at initialization vesanto alhoniemi 2000 the datapoints must be randomized and the clustering repeated nrep times with s l calculated for each cluster and each repetition the value of k that maximizes the average s l across all nrep trials kbest is the optimal number of clusters appendix i figure s3 after fitting the som and identifying the optimal number of signal types we produce a clustering scheme whereby data in a som cell are assigned to the l th cluster and observations in l are as similar as possible to determine the behaviors associated with each cluster and assess the discriminatory power of the scheme we pair the observation time of the behaviors to the time of each clustered signal to identify the behaviors that occur in each cluster 2 4 behavioral probability matrix we summarize the results of the classification and clustering procedures by constructing a probability profile describing the probability of observing each of the potential behaviors given that the data signal was categorized into a signal group cluster or class for either the rf or csom or both we may construct a n k matrix d where each entry is the probability of observing the i th behavior in the j th cluster class we then use d the probability profile as our classifier to maintain the signal specific behavioral variation this matrix improves upon previous attempts at remote identification of animal behavior as it explicitly characterizes the probabilities of each behavior given a signal type nathan et al 2012 to derive d we construct a n k contingency table from the behaviorally explicit data matrix a describing the proportion of each behavior by group combination relative to the entire data set i e p behavior and group the summation of each column in a produces a 1 k vector b that describes the probability of observing a signal group independent of the behaviors i e p group and the summation of each row in a produces a n 1 vector c that describes the probability of observing a behavior in the data set independent of the groups i e p behavior we may calculate d by dividing each entry in column j of a by its associated column sum or value in b fig 4 appendix vi 10 the resulting matrix d represents the probability that a signal is associated with each behavior given that it was assigned to a specific group i e p behavior group tables 1 2 to extend prediction to data for which there are no corresponding direct behavioral observations i e data whose true behaviors are unknown we expose the new data to the model to obtain a class or cluster assignment assuming the training data is representative of new data we can use d from the original data to approximate the unknown profile d 2 5 model validation to test model performance and assess whether d from the original data approximates the unknown profile d we must perform model validation validation is conducted using a resampling exercise whereby data with corresponding direct behavioral observations hereafter termed the known behavioral data set are randomly subsetted into test holdout and training total excluding holdout data sets james et al 2013 ch 5 for example the test subset may contain ntest 100 random observations from the known behavior data set and the remaining training data may be used to create a validation model for the rf we construct a classification matrix dtrain using a rf algorithm applied to the training data and the test data are subsequently exposed to the same rf to classify the holdout signals and construct the matrix dtest appendix vi 14 for the som we construct a validation som vsom using the training data and the number of clusters kbest as determined by the general som all known behavior to maintain consistency across the iterations the matrix dtrain is constructed from vsom and the test data is then exposed to the vsom to obtain cluster assignments and construct dtest appendix vi 11 12 if the clustering or classification system is effective then on average dtrain and dtest should be similar to evaluate this we calculate the l 1 norm l 1 a measure of matrix dissimilarity between dtrain and dtest paolini et al 2018 given n observed behaviors i e the number of rows in d and k clusters i e the number of columns in d l 1 is the maximum across the k clusters 3 l 1 max i 1 n d i k t e s t d i k t r a i n k 1 2 k the theoretical interval of l 1 as calculated here is 0 2 representing the cases where there is complete similarity l 1 0 and at least one column of complete dissimilarity l 1 2 between the test and training datasets i e the behavior predicted and the true behavior are different thus we divide l 1 by 2 to produce l 1 such that 0 represents perfect similarity and 1 perfect dissimilarity between test and training data sets if the test data are representative of the training data and if the algorithm accurately predicts new data then over many iterations of this procedure using m randomly selected test training sets we expect l 1 to approach 0 fig 5 note that l1 is inherently a conservative metric as it characterizes performance of d only by its worst performing column alternatively rather than the maximum one could use a standardized arithmetic mean for a metric that may better describe overall performance 4 l a v g k 1 k i 1 n d i k t e s t d i k t r a i n 2 k 2 6 application to field data wild pigs we used an am data set collected on wild pigs sus scrofa in a semi natural enclosure to demonstrate the application of this framework to field data biologging data was collected from wild pigs translocated to a 1 ha enclosure in starkville ms the enclosure was equipped with 6 motion activated infrared cameras synced to the internet to maintain accurate time seven wild pigs 3 males and 4 females were captured and fitted with daily diary dd accelerometer and magnetometer data loggers wildbytes inc swansea uk sampling at 40 and 13 hz respectively we include these data for demonstration purposes only and emphasize that further processing may be necessary for biological inference e g by assessing different tri axial rotation rules see brown et al 2013 shepard et al 2008 wilson et al 2008 individual pigs were identified from videos and the time behavior exhibited and duration of behavior were recorded behaviors were classified into 5 broad categories in order of importance 1 consumption 2 resting 3 environmental interaction 4 locomotion and 5 social interaction appendix ii we used a ranking system to ensure that we detected behaviors even if they commonly occurred with other behaviors i e head down and consuming food continuously while walking would be classified as consumption each observation was trimmed i e the first and last second removed resulting in a 1 sec minimum for all observations if a single behavior was interrupted by a brief bout of a different behavior 2 s whereafter the original behavior was resumed the whole bout was classified as the first behavior for example a time series consisting of walking 5 s freeze and scan for predators 1 s and resume walking 5 s would be classified as locomotion 11 s behaviors were paired with dd data by using the video timestamp and the dd s internal clock synched prior to deployment each second of dd data 7 channels acc x acc y acc z mag x mag y mag z vedba at 40 hz channel was smoothed using a cubic polynomial spline λ 1 and resampled evenly from each curve 7 channels x 50 samples s 350 measurements s a pca was performed on the samples for each of the 7 data channels and the first 3 principal component vectors pcs 95 99 of the variation per channel

appendix iv for additional analyses using alternative grid sizes the rf was fit with 500 trees 8418 videos of 7 captive wild pigs were recorded and classified manually resulting in 75 601 s 21 h 3 hrs pig of observed behavior from 5 behavioral categories only biologging data for which there was a corresponding behavioral observation were used in the analysis the number of observed behaviors in each group were tallied and matrices a and d and vectors b and c were constructed data cleaning pairing and analyses were conducted in daily diary multi trace v 25 feb 2018 wildbytes inc program r v 3 3 1 r core team 2016 appendix vi 1 3 10 12 14 and matlab 2017a the mathworks inc 2017a appendix vi 4 9 11 15 the random forests were fit with the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 appendix vi 13 14 3 results as proportions of the entire data set environmental interaction 37 62 and locomotion 25 90 were the most observed behaviors followed by consumption 17 76 resting 11 52 and social interaction 7 21 the average silhouette for the general som was maximized at k 9 s l 0 4895 appendix i figure s3 the random forest converged after 100 trees for the rf method there was an overall 22 out of bag error rate irrespective of class each group was best predicted by a single behavior ranging from 97 resting to 70 locomotion table 1 the consumption group group 1 was most likely to be the consumption behavior 76 followed by locomotion behavior 15 the locomotion group group 2 was most likely to be a locomotion behavior 70 followed by a consumption behavior 17 5 the environmental interaction group group 3 was most likely to be an environmental interaction behavior 74 followed by a consumption behavior 16 this might suggest that behaviors associated with consumption in wild pigs produce several variable signals with some that appear more similar to a locomotion or environmental interaction signal than most consumption signals this might be explained by blended signals where an animal is consuming food and thus its behavior is classified under consumption but is simultaneously walking or scanning locomotion or environmental interaction respectively for the csom method the clusters represented diverse behaviors with a high proportion of clusters that predicted behavioral combinations rather than a single behavior only 4 9 total clusters exhibited a 50 probability for a single behavior 2 environmental interaction 1 locomotion 1 consumption table 2 the remaining clusters had a dominant behavior that was larger than the other behaviors but 50 of the total probability of the cluster 3 environmental interaction 1 locomotion 1 resting environmental interaction was the most prevalent behavior in our data and was either the most or second most probable in all clusters this may indicate that the csom struggled to distinguish environmental interaction from the other behaviors perhaps because the primary behaviors that compose environmental interaction i e sniffing scanning may not have particularly distinctive signals further pigs frequently interrupted one behavior with brief bouts of other behaviors that may have introduced variation in our classification system or produced blended signals making it difficult to separate the behaviors into discrete categories locomotion was the second most prevalent behavior with the majority probability in clusters 2 and 8 and was second most probable in 3 clusters many non locomotive behaviors were frequently accompanied by meandering slow tortuous movement which may share similar signal characteristics to walking locomotion or were punctuated by bouts of walking which may mask the other behavior s signals completely consumption composed 60 of cluster 3 and resting behavior was the most prevalent in cluster 9 at 38 although social interaction did not dominate any cluster it was the second most likely behavior at 25 in cluster 1 the resampling procedure showed that there was an average maximum cluster dissimilarity of l 1 0 65 or 65 between the training and test data sets and an average mean cluster dissimilarity of l a v g 0 31 or 31 using the csom and an average maximum cluster dissimilarity of l 1 0 20 or 20 and an average mean cluster dissimilarity of l a v g 0 11 or 11 for the rf fig 6 this may be interpreted as 35 similarity between the test and training probability matrices for the csom method and 80 similarity for the rf method indicating that the rf approach better predicted new data even though the hold out data was 1 1000th the size of the training data this is good evidence to conclude that the rf on average accurately predicted new data and that the clusters identified as most distinctive by the 20 20 csom method did not match our assigned behavioral labels thus by performing this crucial validation step we can conclude that matrix d obtained from the trained rf but not the csom can be used to approximate the probabilistic behavioral profiles d from unobserved data but see appendix iv for additional csom analyses 4 discussion behavior is an important but often overlooked tool in interpreting animal distributions abrahms et al 2017 roever et al 2014 and a variety of approaches have been used to link animal behavior to data sets of acceleration brown et al 2013 wilson et al 2008 here we presented a probabilistic framework for interpreting animal behavior classified or clustered from am signals we applied two machine learning techniques one supervised where behaviors were paired with accelerometer data prior to classification and one unsupervised which first clustered the signals and then used the observed behaviors sakamoto et al 2009 chimienti et al 2016 nathan et al 2012 both approaches ultimately produce a matrix identifying the probability of observing a behavior given a known acceleration signal fig 3 tables 1 2 but validation showed that the csom method performed poorly and thus the probability profile cannot be trusted though most current approaches assign a signal type to a target behavior nathan et al 2012 the rf showed many behaviors exhibited similar data signals and several groups were likely to reflect multiple rather than single behaviors this may be because some behaviors may be difficult to discriminate using collar attached accelerometers e g nathan et al 2012 wang and xu 2015 and by using a probability profile we accommodate this explicitly quantifying the variation in animal behaviors across landscapes is crucial for our understanding of animal movement johnson 1980 matthiopoulos et al 2015 nathan et al 2008 van horne 1982 animals may use a single landscape for multiple purposes complicating the ability of researchers to predict a single behavior from landscape features street et al 2016 using a probability profile accounts for this but also allows for the empirical calculation of multiple behavioral probabilities for any landscape thus this may be used to estimate the relative probability that an animal will engage in a behavior provided an environmental context conceptually similar to a resource selection function rsf boyce and mcdonald 1999 one could estimate the probability of observing the behavior given a suite of covariates and thus predict the relative probability of observing a given behavior in space and time we foresee 2 general approaches to producing such a model first a simple logit model as commonly applied to e g rsfs could produce the desired spatial model of behavior however the very high refresh rates for accelerometers e g 1 hz will typically produce many behavioral observations at a given spatial location particularly if the resolution of the spatial layers is large as is common for remotely sensed landscape data products application of logit models will thus require researchers to consider how best to accommodate what is a clear violation of independence for such a model this could be accomplished by sub sampling data to a single observation per pixel or by aggregating averaging probabilities for behaviors within a given pixel neither outcome is particularly appealing due to loss of information but the resulting logit models are well described in the literature and have ample tools for model validation calibration and sensitivity e g chivers et al 2014 harrell 2016 alternatively hidden markov models hmms have been recently applied to accelerometry data leos barajas 2017 though far less common than standard logit models these or similar models that incorporate autocorrelation structures e g temporal autoregressive models hooten et al 2017 could be used to generate the desired spatial models while accommodating dependence between consecutive observations provided that we have a properly parameterized probabilistic spatial model of behavior multiplicative pairing of such models with simple models of space use e g rsfs combines the relative probability of occurrence with the relative probability of observing different behaviors in that location akin to a utilization kernel for animal behavior this behavior kernel should reflect the relative probability of a known behavior weighted by the probability of the animal using that space worton 1989 these models enabled by the probabilistic framework presented here may offer tremendous opportunities for new insight for example the ideal free distribution ifd posits the equilibrium distribution of a population will be achieved when all individuals have equal fitness relative to local density and environmental quality fretwell and lucas 1969 if animal fitness may be thought of as an energy budget whereby animals must balance energetic costs with inputs brown et al 2004 then we should expect that animal fitness will be highest in areas where energy intake exceeds expenditure these areas of high relative fitness should be identifiable following the two stage model described above as locations with high probabilities of occurrence and of behaviors promoting energy intake we expect that the behavior kernel will strongly correlate with the ifd and provide a mechanistic link between the behaviors of individuals and the distributions of populations a longstanding goal of predictive ecology matthiopoulos et al 2015 one concern with our approach is that the model may not accurately represent the behavioral probabilities of new data yates et al 2018 by performing a resampling exercise and using the l 1 matrix based statistic we observed that data withheld from the rf were accurately classified but the csom method did not accurately identify new data thus the csom model overall did not perform well and thus is not suitable for either the direct assignment or probability profile approach our approach acknowledges that behaviors with similar characteristics should be difficult to identify in any machine learning approach although this problem may be more pronounced in unsupervised learning algorithms nathan et al 2012 it is a common challenge of working with behavioral data we emphasize that the type of machine learning technique used should be dictated by the questions the analyst has for the data set however use of a probability profile rather than a direct assignment can be adopted regardless of the algorithm used to group the data provided that the model validates well it is also worth noting that the apparent poor performance of the csom may be attributed to the validation metric l 1 this metric is mathematically well described and is calculated as the maximum observed summed difference between entries of the columns of two matrices if two matrices are identical save for a single column l 1 bases dissimilarity only on the differing column l 1 is thus a highly conservative metric of matrix dissimilarity that may be interpreted as the maximum dissimilarity observed across signal types by contrast we may instead evaluate matrix dissimilarity using the arithmetic mean of the summed differences between columns rather than the maximum this metric is no longer conservative but may be a better reflection of overall performance when few signal types perform poorly indeed the average summed differences showed overall better agreement between dtest and dtrain than suggested by l 1 for the both the csom and rf approaches fig 6 selection of the validation metric should be determined by the specific needs of the project and the degree of predictive accuracy desired there was likely some error in label assignment as it was difficult to identify individual pigs and to temporally synchronize dd observations to videos additionally the behavioral proportions observed via video may not represent the true frequency of pig behavior in the enclosure and may differ from those of wild pigs burghardt et al 2012 because captive pigs were supplied with food they may spend less time engaging in consumption behaviors as their wild counterparts grandia et al 2001 however of critical concern is the possibility that certain behaviors may not be represented in the training data e g swimming for such cases our system would be incapable of identifying these behaviors we reiterate that data need to be representative of the total variation in data signals and behaviors and emphasize that validation is

24502,in face of global changes projecting and mapping biodiversity changes are of critical importance to support management and conservation measures of marine ecosystems despite the development of a wide variety of ecosystem models capable of integrating an increasing number of ecological processes most projections of climate induced changes in marine biodiversity are based on species distribution models sdms these correlative models present a significant advantage when the lack of knowledge on the species physiology is counterbalanced by the availability of relevant environmental variables over the species geographical range however correlative sdms neglect intra and inter specific interactions and thereby can lead to biased projections of changes in biodiversity distribution to evaluate the influence of trophic interactions on projections of species richness and assemblage composition under climate change scenarios we compared biodiversity projections derived from an ensemble of different sdms to projections derived from a hybrid model coupling sdms and a multispecies trophic model in the mediterranean sea our results show that accounting for trophic interactions modifies projections of future biodiversity in the mediterranean sea under the rcp8 5 scenario sdms tended to overestimate the gains and underestimate the losses of species richness by the end of the 21st century with marked local differences in projections both in terms of magnitude and trend in some biodiversity hotspots in both sdms and hybrid approaches nestedness with gains in species richness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future fish and macro invertebrate species assemblages at the mediterranean basin scale however at local scale we highlighted some differences in the relative contribution of nestedness vs replacement in driving dissimilarity our results call for the development of integrated modelling tools that can mechanistically consider

integrate an increasing number of ecological processes a majority 64 according to the recent global assessment of the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes of global and regional scale scenarios of climate induced changes in marine biodiversity rely solely on correlative approaches gavish et al 2017 ipbes 2019 such approaches based on the ecological niche conceptualised by hutchinson 1957 and commonly named species distribution models sdms or environmental niche models enms are empirical statistical models relating species distribution data occurrences or abundances to a set of environmental descriptors to predict where a species is likely to be present in unsampled locations or time periods see guisan and thuiller 2005 or elith and leathwick 2009 for a review sdms have become very popular to project past present and future diversity distributions under various climate change scenarios bellard et al 2012 gavish et al 2017 guisan and thuiller 2005 the development of ready to use and generic software has greatly contributed to the widespread use of sdms in ecology e g biomod r package thuiller et al 2009 2016 as well as the accessibility to global occurrence datasets for an increasing number of taxa with the growing number of studies involving the use of sdms however came a growing recognition of their limitations in projecting future distributions under new environmental conditions araújo and luoto 2007 davis et al 1998 dormann 2007 elith and leathwick 2009 heikkinen et al 2006 hof et al 2012 morin and lechowicz 2008 in particular and even though observed presence absence data result from complex processes sdms do not explicitly consider key ecological processes such as species interactions e g predation competition mutualism or facilitation adaptation e g phenotypic plasticity or population dynamics which greatly influence the distribution of species at local to global scales araújo et al 2014 araújo and luoto 2007 elith and leathwick 2009 giannini et al 2013 guisan and thuiller 2005 lavergne et al 2010 palacio and girini 2018 wisz et al 2013 de facto by ignoring biotic interactions and most often relying on presence absence data rather than abundance data sdms may under or overestimate the number of species that can coexist at a given location time and environmental condition and thus lead to distorted spatial projections of future biodiversity engelhardt et al 2020 gavish et al 2017 gilman et al 2010 urban et al 2013 while the role of biotic interactions population dynamics and life history processes in shaping distributions and species assemblages is well recognized very few studies and essentially all in the terrestrial realm have attempted to investigate the effects of considering biotic interactions on projections of climate change effects on species richness and community composition araújo and luoto 2007 hof et al 2012 kissling et al 2010 so far the inclusion of biotic interactions e g using patterns of species co occurrence wisz et al 2013 has been shown to affect sdms performance but we still lack an understanding of how such interactions when explicitly considered in the modelling of species distributions will alter projections of biodiversity distribution under climate change in addition when biotic interactions were considered they were in most cases assumed to be static in time and space an assumption often unverified in nature davis et al 1998 klanderud and totland 2005 the mediterranean sea is rare in that it is both a biodiversity and global change hotspot coll et al 2012 2010 cramer et al 2018 giorgi 2006 soto navarro et al 2020 several studies have projected that fish invertebrates and zoo and phyto plankton species will shift their distribution under climate change leading to local changes in species richness and composition alterations in food web structure and decreases in functional and phylogenetic diversity ben rais lasram and mouillot 2009 ben rais lasram et al 2010 albouy et al 2012 2015a a b hattab et al 2016 benedetti et al 2018 2019 these studies however invariably relied on environmental niche modelling that either overlooked intra and inter specific interactions or considered trophic links and food web structure emerging from sdm projections of co occurrence and not from climate driven processes driving individual species distributions and dynamics albouy et al 2014b hattab et al 2016 in this study we evaluated and quantified the influence of considering trophic interactions on changes in species richness and assemblage composition under climate change by comparing biodiversity projections α and ß diversities derived from an ensemble of sdms and those from a hybrid model coupling sdms and a multispecies trophic model in the mediterranean sea under the no mitigation climate change scenario rcp8 5 we used a new hybrid model osmose med which allows to represent the spatial dynamics of interacting marine fishes and macroinvertebrates in the mediterranean sea moullec et al 2019a 2019b including key life history processes such as growth reproduction and mortality 2 materials and

sea appendix a1 in supplementary data under the high emission no mitigation policy ipcc representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario the distribution maps produced by the sdms were then used to force the spatial distribution of species within the osmose med hybrid model fig 1 as the development and calibration of sdms and osmose med hybrid model are fully described in moullec et al 2019b and moullec et al 2019a only a brief presentation of the models is given here 2 1 species distribution modelling the spatial occurrence data of each species were compiled and merged from multiple databases the global biodiversity information system gbif the ocean biogeographic information system obis the food and agriculture organization s geonetwork portal www fao org geonetwork and the fishmed database albouy et al 2015a only occurrences recorded since 1975 were kept decadal climatologies of temperature and salinity within 40 depth layers were used to generate predictor variables used to calibrate sdms these data were extracted from the global world ocean database 2013 version 2 at a spatial resolution of 1 4 and were then interpolated by bilinear methods on a 1 12th ca 7 km in the mediterranean sea grid in order to take into account environment experienced by differences in the vertical distribution of species in the water column six environmental metrics were derived from temperature and salinity climatologies from 1975 to 2012 average sea surface temperature and salinity 0 50 m depth average vertical temperature and salinity 0 200 m depth and average sea bottom temperature and salinity bottom 50 m depth we used temperature and salinity to calibrate sdms i e environmental niche models as these climatic variables are typically the major factors determining large scale patterns of species distribution and are commonly used as explanatory variables in sdms in the mediterranean sea and across the world s oceans albouy et al 2013 ben rais lasram et al 2010 benedetti et al 2019 cheung et al 2009 schickele et al 2020 to account for the uncertainty associated with the choice of a particular correlative statistical method for climatic niche modelling we used an ensemble forecasting approach implementing a set of eight different methods generalized linear models generalized additive models classification tree analysis boosted regression trees random forests multivariate adaptive regression splines artificial neural networks and flexible discriminant analysis embedded in the biomod2 multi model platform thuiller et al 2016 models were calibrated using data with a global coverage to capture all climate conditions encountered by the species and avoid truncated climate niche thuiller et al 2004 pseudo absences were randomly generated in order to better characterize the environmental conditions experienced by species within their current ranges see hattab et al 2013 2014 for methodology and moullec et al 2019b for more details models were evaluated according to the true skill statistic criterion tss allouche et al 2006 with a three fold cross validation first only models with a tss higher than 0 6 were kept for each species second the consensus distribution was obtained with an ensemble forecast approach meaning that results were weighted according to the tss finally consensus distributions were transformed into presence absence maps by using the probability threshold that maximizes the model s tss meaning that the occurrence probability for grid cells under this threshold was set to zero sdms calibrated under present day conditions were then used to make projections of the spatial distribution of species in 2071 2100 based on projected future environmental predictors moullec et al 2019a sea temperature and salinity values at different depths were acquired for the historical period 1970 2005 and the end of the century 2071 2100 under rcp8 5 scenario from the regional climate system model cnrm rcsm4 sevault et al 2014 that was driven by atmosphere and ocean boundary conditions extracted from the general circulation model cnrm cm5 voldoire et al 2013 cnrm rcsm4 showed high skill in reproducing the interannual to decadal mediterranean variability for sea surface temperature and salinity sevault et al 2014 anomalies between the historical simulated period 1970 2005 and the future period 2071 2100 were calculated and added to present climate and salinity climatologies to project future species geographical distribution moullec et al 2019a to match the spatial resolution of the osmose med hybrid model all species distribution layers were resampled on a regular grid of 20 20 km using nearest neighbour interpolation 2 2 the osmose med hybrid model osmose med considered as a hybrid model in this paper is a consistent end to end modelling chain including a general circulation model cnrm cm5 voldoire et al 2013 a regional climate model cnrm rcsm4 sevault et al 2014 a regional biogeochemistry model eco3m s auger et al 2011 and a multispecies trophic model osmose moullec et al 2019b eco3m s simulates the lower trophic part of the food wed i e phyto and zoo plankton groups and is driven one way by the ocean and atmosphere outputs of cnrm rcsm4 the food web model osmose which simulates the higher trophic level part of the food web i e fish cephalopods crustaceans is in turn driven by the biogeochemistry outputs of eco3m s phyto and zoo plankton biomass the modelling chain has been implemented under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario allowing to consider not only potential changes in species distribution from sdms outputs but also changes in planktonic productivity by the end of the 21st century in the mediterranean sea moullec et al 2019a osmose is a multispecies and individual based model spatially explicit and representing the whole life cycle of several interacting marine fish and macro invertebrates species from eggs to adult stages shin and cury 2004 2001 major ecological processes of the life cycle namely growth predation reproduction various sources of mortality including fishing mortality are modelled step by step 15 days in our study appendix a2 in supplementary data and see osmose model org for a full description of the osmose model osmose assumes opportunistic predation based on spatio temporal co occurrence and size adequacy between a predator and its prey allowing the emergence of complex trophic interactions the model is forced by species specific spatial distribution maps one unique map per species throughout its life cycle built from the sdms approach described above see section 2 1 our application covered the whole mediterranean sea on a regular grid of 20 20 km 6229 cells and modelled the same one hundred marine species mainly fish 85 species but also cephalopods 5 species and crustaceans 10 species than in the sdms approach overall the species represent around 95 of total declared catches in the region over the 2006 2013 period a full description of the parameterization and calibration of osmose med can be found in moullec et al 2019b to our knowledge despite its complexity and associated uncertainty the modelling chain used in the present study is the first able to project climate change and fishing effects on mediterranean marine biodiversity in an integrated way i e considering explicit and consistent changes in regional climate ocean dynamics nutrient cycle plankton production shifts in species distributions their life cycles and their trophodynamic interactions moullec et al 2019a 2 3 comparing projections of species richness and assemblage composition between sdms and the osmose med hybrid model following albouy et al 2012 benedetti et al 2018 and le marchand et al 2020 we used species richness and the ß ratio to characterize temporal community change related to α and ß diversities the two diversity indices obtained within each grid cell using the sdms approach were then compared with those obtained using the osmose med approach i e additionally constraining the trophic interactions and the whole species life cycle α diversity was calculated by tailing species numbers for each time period present and future and modelling approach sdms and osmose med by stacking all the presence absence maps 0 1 and counting the number of present species within each grid cell to derive presence absence maps from osmose med outputs we transformed abundance distribution map per species in presence absence map a species with a null abundance in a cell being considered as absent from this cell differences in species richness were computed as the difference between the future 2071 2100 with climate change and present species richness 2006 2013 in a second step we computed the ß ratio index in order to quantify the relative contribution of species replacement i e turnover vs nestedness i e species loss or gain in temporal changes in community composition baselga 2012 disentangling the contribution of these two components of ß diversity patterns is indeed fundamental to understanding how communities react to spatial environmental and temporal changes carvalho et al 2012 to calculate the ß ratio we computed the pairwise jaccard s dissimilarity measure and calculated the ratio between its two additive components the dissimilarity due to species replacement or turnover ßjtu and the dissimilarity due to nestedness ßjne see baselga 2010 2012 a ß ratio value smaller than 0 5 indicates than dissimilarity in assemblage is mainly driven by species replacement and a ß ratio value higher than 0 5 indicates that dissimilarity is mainly driven by nestedness furthermore as any ß ratio value can be associated with either gains or losses in species richness baselga 2010 to simultaneously analyse changes in species richness and assemblage composition we analysed and mapped the ß ratio values and related changes in species richness albouy et al 2012 benedetti et al 2018 in a final step α and ß diversity projections were compared between the sdms and osmose med approaches at different spatial scales geographical sub areas gsas the spatial scale used for assessment and management of fisheries resources in the mediterranean sea marine ecoregions as listed in the marine strategy framework directive msfd and the whole mediterranean basin appendix a2 in

species richness under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario 16 and 15 species are projected to increase their geographic range by the end of the century 2071 2100 with average gains in range area of ca 163 and ca 131 according to sdms and osmose med respectively on the contrary the range of 25 sdms and 27 osmose med species is expected to shrink with average losses in range area of ca 29 sdms and ca 37 osmose med amongst the loser species 3 species are projected to become extinct no more presence in osmose med while sdms projected only a reduction of their climate suitable areas in average 45 at the scale of the whole mediterranean basin the average differences in species richness sr between the present and future periods rcp8 5 scenario were 0 37 species per grid cell when running the sdms only mean sr for the present period being 28 45 species per grid cell and 0 37 species per grid cell when running osmose med mean sr for the present period being 28 1 species per grid cell with both modelling approaches a contrasted spatial pattern emerged from the simulations between the western mediterranean sea characterized by an overall decrease in sr and the central and eastern mediterranean sea characterized by an overall increase in sr the differences between sr projections from sdms and osmose med were predominantly localized on the continental shelf with some exceptions e g in the levantine sea fig 2 at both marine ecoregions and geographical sub areas scales significative differences between sr projections from sdms and osmose med were apparent however under different orders of magnitude appendix a3 in supplementary data projected changes in sr diverged the most between sdms and osmose med in the tunisian gulfs of hammamet and gabes the northern adriatic sea the north aegean sea and along the egyptian coasts in the northern adriatic sea gsa 17 the average loss in sr was 0 61 species per grid cell in sdms while it was 3 4 species per grid cell according to osmose med in the gulfs of hammamet and gabes gsa 13 and 14 sdms projected average gains in sr of 0 34 and 1 18 species per grid cell respectively and osmose med on the contrary projected corresponding losses in sr of 1 85 and 1 1 species per grid cell at the mediterranean sea scale 44 15 and 48 93 of the cells mainly in the central and eastern mediterranean sea exhibited an increase in sr by the end of the century according to sdms and osmose med respectively on the contrary cells showing a decrease in sr represented 39 75 of the mediterranean sea in sdms and 47 09 in osmose med and were mainly located on the continental shelf of the western mediterranean sea and in the adriatic sea net differences in sr result from gains and losses in sr that spatially differed between osmose med and sdms fig 2 and appendix a4 in supplementary data using sdms higher gains in species richness were projected by the end of the century in the gulfs of hammamet and gabes on average 2 7 and 4 1 times more respectively p 0 05 in the northern adriatic sea on average 1 9 times more p 0 05 in the levantine sea on average 1 2 times more p 0 05 and to a lesser extent in the aegean sea on average 1 12 times more p 0 05 on the other hand lower losses in sr were projected by sdms on the continental slope of the gulf of gabes on average 3 7 times less p 0 05 in the northern adriatic sea on average 2 6 times less p 0 05 the gulf of lions on average 1 4 times less p 0 05 the continental shelf of the catalan sea on average 1 3 times less p 0 05 and the alboran sea on average 1 24 times less p 0 05 in the adriatic sea for example the number of cells affected by a decrease in sr was ca 29 lower in sdms compared to osmose med in the gulf of gabes ca 41 more cells were concerned by gains in sr in sdms compared to osmose med in other words under climate change scenario sdms overestimated the gains and underestimated the losses in species richness compared to osmose med 3 2 projecting changes in species composition comparing projections of simultaneous changes in species richness α diversity and species composition ß diversity from sdms and osmose med revealed similar changes in species composition between sdms and osmose med at the mediterranean scale mean ß jaccard 0 02 albeit with more than 35 6 of the cells showing a non zero dissimilarity at a finer spatial scale gsas dissimilarities in species composition by the end of the century between the two approaches were more apparent fig 3 and fig 4 and appendix a5 in supplementary data notably in the southern alboran sea the gulf of gabes the adriatic sea and the levantine sea for both modelling approaches species nestedness i e ß ratio 0 5 accompanied by gains in species richness contributed more than other patterns in driving dissimilarity between present and future assemblages nestedness with gains in sr represented ca 37 and ca 34 of the mediterranean sea surface according to sdms and osmose med respectively fig 3 and appendix a5 in supplementary data in both approaches nestedness represented ca 64 of the whole mediterranean sea but with marked local differences in projections through a west east gradient the western mediterranean sea was dominated by nestedness and a clear decrease in species richness mean ß ratio 0 76 and 0 77 for sdms and osmose med respectively p 0 05 the central mediterranean sea gulfs of gabes and sidra showed a combination of nestedness and replacement with gains and losses in sr mean ß ratio 0 24 and 0 23 for sdms and osmose med respectively p 0 05 and the eastern mediterranean sea was characterized by nestedness associated to a net increase in species richness mean ß ratio 0 78 for both sdms and osmose med p 0 05 whether for nestedness or replacement sdms projected greater gains and lower losses in species richness compared to osmose med when analysing beta diversity patterns at a finer spatial scale i e at the gsas scale the relative contribution of nestedness and replacement did not drastically differ between sdms and osmose med projections appendix a5 in supplementary data however in the gulf of gabes sdms projected that species replacement with increases in species richness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between time periods but with many local patches on the continental shelf where nestedness associated to gains in sr was the main driver while osmose med projected a decrease in sr associated with species replacement only 10 of the cells in sdms and three fold less 3 in osmose med were associated with nestedness projections also markedly differed in the southern alboran sea 28 of the cells in sdms and 50 in osmose med were associated with nestedness the northern adriatic sea 7 of the cells in sdms and almost double in osmose med 13 were associated with nestedness the northernmost parts of the aegean sea and at the mouth of the nile 4 discussion most studies projecting climate change impacts on species assemblages have used environmental niche modelling approaches that overlook key biological mechanisms such as demography dispersal eco evolution and species interactions shaping the distribution and productivity of species bellard et al 2012 urban et al 2016 our analysis suggested that sdms represent a relevant and parsimonious statistical tool to project the environmental suitability of species at large spatial scales at local scales however projections from sdms alone and from a model using sdms to drive biotic trophic interactions markedly differed at the local scale geographical sub area in our study projections of climate driven changes in assemblage composition and richness were both qualitatively and quantitatively different when species interactions were considered in the modelling of species distributions when applied alone sdms produced more optimistic projections of climate induced changes in species richness in the mediterranean sea overestimating gains and underestimating losses of species richness compared to the model including trophodynamics in particular important differences were found in some areas of high conservation interest such as the northern adriatic sea and the gulf of gabes both recognized as biodiversity hotspots in the mediterranean sea ben rais lasram et al 2009 coll et al 2010 mouillot et al 2011 our results agree with other studies showing that species interactions may slow climate tracking and produce more extinctions than in environmental niche models see urban et al 2013 in addition changes in species composition and single species extinctions may modify the web of interactions within a community and may lead to cascading effects and potential coextinctions processes not reflected in sdms but captured by osmose med bellard et al 2012 brook et al 2008 the projected extent of expansion or contraction of geographical ranges of species by the end of the century differed depending on whether species interactions were considered with lower gains and higher losses in our model including trophodynamic interactions various theoretical modelling studies have suggested that changes in intensity and nature of biotic interactions such as an increase in predation or a release of competition modulate not only the direction but also the magnitude of species range shifts lenoir et al 2010 svenning et al 2014 urban et al 2013 in the osmose model the presence of a species in a given grid cell i e at least one individual is based on the one hand by specific distribution maps from sdms and on the other hand by its ability to maintain itself in its suitable climatic space by feeding competing displaying somatic growth reproducing and resisting natural and anthropogenic pressures i e fishing mortality these added processes can cause more rapid changes in the sizes of home ranges compared to spatial changes predicted merely by sdms that consider only the suitability of abiotic factors for example sea warming could lead to the arrival of new species in an area which could directly compete with and displace native species alexander et al 2018 however there is still no consensus on whether considering trophic interactions produces more pessimistic climate induced shifts in biodiversity distribution for example fernandes et al 2013 showed that the inclusion of trophic interactions in the species based dynamic bioclimate envelope model dbem led to lower projected poleward latitudinal shifts in the distribution of marine fish especially for pelagic species while engelhardt et al 2020 reported that ignoring trophic interactions tended to overestimate the effects of climate induced changes in species distributions climate change directly impacts species physiology and spatial distribution but also engage species in novel interactions such as competition for food with potential feedbacks on species distribution araújo and luoto 2007 araújo and rozenfeld 2014 gallardo et al 2016 mcknight et al 2017 valiente banuet et al 2015 wiens 2016 even if it is still an immense challenge for ecologists and modellers mechanistically considering these interactions is essential to explore the effects of future climate change on biodiversity distribution jackson et al 2009 pellissier et al 2013 van der putten et al 2010 wisz et al 2013 the osmose med model explicitly considers the whole life cycle of species climate change can have different and potentially more severed effects on specific life stages for example the recruitment year class success of marine fish is normally established by processes impacting early life stages such as eggs and larvae that are planktonic free floating and more sensitive than juveniles and adults to changes in abiotic factors and prone to higher rates of mortality due to starvation and or predation durant et al 2007 llopiz et al 2014 furthermore predation is modelled as a size based and opportunistic process in osmose med not predefined based on diet matrices of species making it a powerful tool to predict potential interactions of species that do not currently co occur or interact but may do so in the future with all these processes represented our osmose med hybrid model intends to better capture the future realized niche of the species for producing more robust biodiversity projections our results pointed that in both sdms and osmose med approaches at the mediterranean sea scale dissimilarity between present day and future assemblages was mainly driven by nestedness with increases in species richness in contrast to what has been suggested for endemic species by ben rais lasram et al 2010 climate change might thus increase or decrease the richness of the initial assemblage without a total turnover of assemblages the projected patterns were spatially contrasted with for instance in the gulf of gabes three times as many grid cells concerned by nestedness in the sdms compared to osmose med in this area while sdms projected changes in species composition almost entirely driven by species replacement with gains in richness osmose med projected that changes could be mainly caused by replacement with species losses depending on the spatial scale considered our results can highly differ from previous studies in the region that focused on projections based on environmental niche modelling approaches albouy et al 2012 2013 ben rais lasram et al 2010 benedetti et al 2019 2018 for instance under the sres a2 scenario albouy et al 2012 found that species replacement was the dominant pattern of change projected in mediterranean coastal fish assemblages accounting for 98 of the continental shelf in contrast and in agreement with our estimates benedetti et al 2018 found that nestedness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future copepod assemblages our results also differed from albouy et al 2013 who projected that ca 70 of the continental shelf could experience a decrease and ca 27 an increase in species richness by the end of the century 47 and 44 respectively at the whole mediterranean sea scale according to osmose med compared to albouy et al 2012 and benedetti et al 2019 the average rate of change in species richness that we found at the mediterranean sea scale was also much lower with higher losses in the western regions and lower losses in the eastern ones this pattern was partly related to the large increase in abundance of thermophilic and or exotic species in the eastern mediterranean and to the decrease in abundance of some species of high commercial interest in the western part see moullec et al 2019a for an extended discussion on climate change consequences on the structure and functioning of the mediterranean sea by the end of the 21st century there are several explanations for the differences in projections first the environmental niche models used by albouy et al 2012 2013 were not trained at the global scale but at the mediterranean sea scale which can lead to truncated environmental niches and overestimation of extinction rates thuiller et al 2004 second not the same set of species endemic species vs one hundred miscellaneous species in our study and the area continental shelf vs whole mediterranean sea in our study were modelled which could also contribute to the discrepancies between the studies third previous studies used a different ipcc climate change scenario namely the special report on emission scenario sres a2 vs the rcp8 5 scenario and an older version of the regional circulation model cnrm rcsm4 ipcc 2014 rogelj et al 2012 fourth in contrast to previous niche modelling approaches the end to end model osmose med that we developed is fully integrated and considers for the first time in the region major biotic and abiotic processes that drive changes in population dynamics and community structure and composition despite attempts to make projections more realistic and credible several caveats persist in our approach for example we did not consider other drivers of fish distribution e g seafloor oxygen concentration that may prevail at local scales to prevent life cycle closure and population persistence petitgas et al 2013 and which will most likely be impacted by future anthropogenic pressures we also did not consider the potential arrivals of thermophilic non native species from the atlantic or the red sea which will likely influence the future biodiversity in the mediterranean sea ben rais lasram and mouillot 2009 parravicini et al 2015 and could dramatically affect future assemblages edelist et al 2013 another limit in our projections was that phenotypic plasticity and genetic evolution were not included into osmose med to mechanistically depict the potential eco evolutionary dynamics shaping future communities and food webs peck et al 2018 yet these adaptive processes might allow species to evolve in a new ecological niche thus dampening climate change impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems beaugrand and kirby 2018 cotto et al 2017 although our end to end approach considers two major components of global change climate change and fishing pressure we neglected other anthropogenic pressures such as pollution or habitat destruction which can act in synergy and exacerbate the vulnerability of species ultimately accelerating changes in species composition and richness and making the estimates from our projections conservative in terms of biodiversity loss finally for practical and pragmatic reasons moullec et al 2019a 2019b and similar to most studies conducted in the region we did not thoroughly investigate the uncertainty associated with our projections although some aspects of structural uncertainty were addressed by using an ensemble estimate of sdms other sources of uncertainty stemming from differences amongst scenarios global climate models and regional physical biogeochemical models were not included peck et al 2020 this is clearly one of the future challenges that need to be addressed when tackling biodiversity projections especially with increasingly complex models ipbes

24502,in face of global changes projecting and mapping biodiversity changes are of critical importance to support management and conservation measures of marine ecosystems despite the development of a wide variety of ecosystem models capable of integrating an increasing number of ecological processes most projections of climate induced changes in marine biodiversity are based on species distribution models sdms these correlative models present a significant advantage when the lack of knowledge on the species physiology is counterbalanced by the availability of relevant environmental variables over the species geographical range however correlative sdms neglect intra and inter specific interactions and thereby can lead to biased projections of changes in biodiversity distribution to evaluate the influence of trophic interactions on projections of species richness and assemblage composition under climate change scenarios we compared biodiversity projections derived from an ensemble of different sdms to projections derived from a hybrid model coupling sdms and a multispecies trophic model in the mediterranean sea our results show that accounting for trophic interactions modifies projections of future biodiversity in the mediterranean sea under the rcp8 5 scenario sdms tended to overestimate the gains and underestimate the losses of species richness by the end of the 21st century with marked local differences in projections both in terms of magnitude and trend in some biodiversity hotspots in both sdms and hybrid approaches nestedness with gains in species richness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future fish and macro invertebrate species assemblages at the mediterranean basin scale however at local scale we highlighted some differences in the relative contribution of nestedness vs replacement in driving dissimilarity our results call for the development of integrated modelling tools that can mechanistically consider multiple biotic and abiotic drivers to improve projections of future marine biodiversity graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords beta diversity climate change end to

accelerating at such a rapid pace that they may dominate impacts resulting from other drivers of change in the coming decades cheng et al 2019 ipcc 2019 pinsky et al 2019 in response to climate change

marine species have already altered their geographical distributions to stay within suitable environmental conditions lenoir et al 2020 and these shifts will likely continue or accelerate in the future baudron et al 2020 cheung et al 2009 2016 garcía molinos et al 2016 pecl et al 2017 pinsky et al 2020 poloczanska et al 2013 it is therefore critical to develop our capacity to project and map biodiversity changes to support management and conservation measures of marine ecosystems bellard et al 2012 ipbes 2016 parmesan et al 2011 a major challenge for the mitigation of current biodiversity losses and the achievement of the united nation s sustainable development goal 14 pinsky et al 2018 singh et al 2019 despite the development of increasingly sophisticated models that are able to integrate an increasing number of ecological processes a majority 64 according to the recent global assessment of the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes of global and regional scale scenarios of climate induced changes in marine biodiversity rely solely on correlative approaches gavish et al 2017 ipbes 2019 such approaches based on the ecological niche conceptualised by hutchinson 1957 and commonly named species distribution models sdms or environmental niche models enms are empirical statistical models relating species distribution data occurrences or abundances to a set of environmental descriptors to predict where a species is likely to be present in unsampled locations or time periods see guisan and thuiller 2005 or elith and leathwick 2009 for a review sdms have become very popular to project past present and future diversity distributions under various climate change scenarios bellard et al 2012 gavish et al 2017 guisan and thuiller 2005 the development of ready to use and generic software has greatly contributed to the widespread use of sdms in ecology e g biomod r package thuiller et al 2009 2016 as well as the accessibility to global occurrence datasets for an increasing number of taxa with the growing number of studies involving the use of sdms however came a growing recognition of their limitations in projecting future distributions under new environmental conditions araújo and luoto 2007 davis et al 1998 dormann 2007 elith and leathwick 2009 heikkinen et al 2006 hof et al 2012 morin and lechowicz 2008 in particular and even though observed presence absence data result from complex processes sdms do not explicitly consider key ecological processes such as species interactions e g predation competition mutualism or facilitation adaptation e g phenotypic plasticity or population dynamics which greatly influence the distribution of species at local to global scales araújo et al 2014 araújo and luoto 2007 elith and leathwick 2009 giannini et al 2013 guisan and thuiller 2005 lavergne et al 2010 palacio and girini 2018 wisz et al 2013 de facto by ignoring biotic interactions and most often relying on presence absence data rather than abundance data sdms may under or overestimate the number of species that can coexist at a given location time and environmental condition and thus lead to distorted spatial projections of future biodiversity engelhardt et al 2020 gavish et al 2017 gilman et al 2010 urban et al 2013 while the role of biotic interactions population dynamics and life history processes in shaping distributions and species assemblages is well recognized very few studies and essentially all in the terrestrial realm have attempted to investigate the effects of considering biotic interactions on projections of climate change effects on species richness and community composition araújo and luoto 2007 hof et al 2012 kissling et al 2010 so far the inclusion of biotic interactions e g using patterns of species co occurrence wisz et al 2013 has been shown to affect sdms performance but we still lack an understanding of how such interactions when explicitly considered in the modelling of species distributions will alter projections of biodiversity distribution under climate change in addition when biotic interactions were considered they were in most cases assumed to be static in time and space an assumption often unverified in nature davis et al 1998 klanderud and totland 2005 the mediterranean sea is rare in that it is both a biodiversity and global change hotspot coll et al 2012 2010 cramer et al 2018 giorgi 2006 soto navarro et al 2020 several studies have projected that fish invertebrates and zoo and phyto plankton species will shift their distribution under climate change leading to local changes in species richness and composition alterations in food web structure and decreases in functional and phylogenetic diversity ben rais lasram and mouillot 2009 ben rais lasram et al 2010 albouy et al 2012 2015a a b hattab et al 2016 benedetti et al 2018 2019 these studies however invariably relied on environmental niche modelling that either overlooked intra and inter specific interactions or considered trophic links and food web structure emerging from sdm projections of co occurrence and not from climate driven processes driving individual species distributions and dynamics albouy et al 2014b hattab et al 2016 in this study we evaluated and quantified the influence of considering trophic interactions on changes in species richness and assemblage composition under climate change by comparing biodiversity projections α and ß diversities derived from an ensemble of sdms and those from a hybrid model coupling sdms and a multispecies trophic model in the mediterranean sea under the no mitigation climate change scenario rcp8 5 we used a new hybrid model osmose med which allows to represent the spatial dynamics of interacting marine fishes and macroinvertebrates in the mediterranean sea moullec et al 2019a 2019b including key life history processes such as growth reproduction and mortality 2 materials and methods we used sdms to estimate present day 2006 2013 and future 2071 2100 climatic suitability here after called species distributions of one hundred species currently inhabiting the mediterranean sea appendix a1 in supplementary data under the high emission no mitigation policy ipcc representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario the distribution maps produced by the sdms were then used to force the spatial distribution of species within the osmose med hybrid model fig 1 as the development and calibration of sdms and osmose med hybrid model are fully described in moullec et al 2019b and moullec et al 2019a only a brief presentation of the models is given here 2 1 species distribution modelling the spatial occurrence data of each species were compiled and merged from multiple databases the global biodiversity information system gbif the ocean biogeographic information system obis the food and agriculture organization s geonetwork portal www fao org geonetwork and the fishmed database albouy et al 2015a only occurrences recorded since 1975 were kept decadal climatologies of temperature and salinity within 40 depth layers were used to generate predictor variables used to calibrate sdms these data were extracted from the global world ocean database 2013 version 2 at a spatial resolution of 1 4 and were then interpolated by bilinear methods on a 1 12th ca 7 km in the mediterranean sea grid in order to take into account environment experienced by differences in the vertical distribution of species in the water column six environmental metrics were derived from temperature and salinity climatologies from 1975 to 2012 average sea surface temperature and salinity 0 50 m depth average vertical temperature and salinity 0 200 m depth and average sea bottom temperature and salinity bottom 50 m depth we used temperature and salinity to calibrate sdms i e environmental niche models as these climatic variables are typically the major factors determining large scale patterns of species distribution and are commonly used as explanatory variables in sdms in the mediterranean sea and across the world s oceans albouy et al 2013 ben rais lasram et al 2010 benedetti et al 2019 cheung et al 2009 schickele et al 2020 to account for the uncertainty associated with the choice of a particular correlative statistical method for climatic niche modelling we used an ensemble forecasting approach implementing a set of eight different methods generalized linear models generalized additive models classification tree analysis boosted regression trees random forests multivariate adaptive regression splines artificial neural networks and flexible discriminant analysis embedded in the biomod2 multi model platform thuiller et al 2016 models were calibrated using data with a global coverage to capture all climate conditions encountered by the species and avoid truncated climate niche thuiller et al 2004 pseudo absences were randomly generated in order to better characterize the environmental conditions experienced by species within their current ranges see hattab et al 2013 2014 for methodology and moullec et al 2019b for more details models were evaluated according to the true skill statistic criterion tss allouche et al 2006 with a three fold cross validation first only models with a tss higher than 0 6 were kept for each species second the consensus distribution was obtained with an ensemble forecast approach meaning that results were weighted according to the tss finally consensus distributions were transformed into presence absence maps by using the probability threshold that maximizes the model s tss meaning that the occurrence probability for grid cells under this threshold was set to zero sdms calibrated under present day conditions were then used to make projections of the spatial distribution of species in 2071 2100 based on projected future environmental predictors moullec et al 2019a sea temperature and salinity values at different depths were acquired for the historical period 1970 2005 and the end of the century 2071 2100 under rcp8 5 scenario from the regional climate system model cnrm rcsm4 sevault et al 2014 that was driven by atmosphere and ocean boundary conditions extracted from the general circulation model cnrm cm5 voldoire et al 2013 cnrm rcsm4 showed high skill in reproducing the interannual to decadal mediterranean variability for sea surface temperature and salinity sevault et al 2014 anomalies between the historical simulated period 1970 2005 and the future period 2071 2100 were calculated and added to present climate and salinity climatologies to project future species geographical distribution moullec et al 2019a to match the spatial resolution of the osmose med hybrid model all species distribution layers were resampled on a regular grid of 20 20 km using nearest neighbour interpolation 2 2 the osmose med hybrid model osmose med considered as a hybrid model in this paper is a consistent end to end modelling chain including a general circulation model cnrm cm5 voldoire et al 2013 a regional climate model cnrm rcsm4 sevault et al 2014 a regional biogeochemistry model eco3m s auger et al 2011 and a multispecies trophic model osmose moullec et al 2019b eco3m s simulates the lower trophic part of the food wed i e phyto and zoo plankton groups and is driven one way by the ocean and atmosphere outputs of cnrm rcsm4 the food web model osmose which simulates the higher trophic level part of the food web i e fish cephalopods crustaceans is in turn driven by the biogeochemistry outputs of eco3m s phyto and zoo plankton biomass the modelling chain has been implemented under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario allowing to consider not only potential changes in species distribution from sdms outputs but also changes in planktonic productivity by the end of the 21st century in the mediterranean sea moullec et al 2019a osmose is a multispecies and individual based model spatially explicit and representing the whole life cycle of several interacting marine fish and macro invertebrates species from eggs to adult stages shin and cury 2004 2001 major ecological processes of the life cycle namely growth predation reproduction various sources of mortality including fishing mortality are modelled step by step 15 days in our study appendix a2 in supplementary data and see osmose model org for a full description of the osmose model osmose assumes opportunistic predation based on spatio temporal co occurrence and size adequacy between a predator and its prey allowing the emergence of complex trophic interactions the model is forced by species specific spatial distribution maps one unique map per species throughout its life cycle built from the sdms approach described above see section 2 1 our application covered the whole mediterranean sea on a regular grid of 20 20 km 6229 cells and modelled the same one hundred marine species mainly fish 85 species but also cephalopods 5 species and crustaceans 10 species than in the sdms approach overall the species represent around 95 of total declared catches in the region over the 2006 2013 period a full description of the parameterization and calibration of osmose med can be found in moullec et al 2019b to our knowledge despite its complexity and associated uncertainty the modelling chain used in the present study is the first able to project climate change and fishing effects on mediterranean marine biodiversity in an integrated way i e considering explicit and consistent changes in regional climate ocean dynamics nutrient cycle plankton production shifts in species distributions their life cycles and their trophodynamic interactions moullec et al 2019a 2 3 comparing projections of species richness and assemblage composition between sdms and the osmose med hybrid model following albouy et al 2012 benedetti et al 2018 and le marchand et al 2020 we used species richness and the ß ratio to characterize temporal community change related to α and ß diversities the two diversity indices obtained within each grid cell using the sdms approach were then compared with those obtained using the osmose med approach i e additionally constraining the trophic interactions and the whole species life cycle α diversity was calculated by tailing species numbers for each time period present and future and modelling approach sdms and osmose med by stacking all the presence absence maps 0 1 and counting the number of present species within each grid cell to derive presence absence maps from osmose med outputs we transformed abundance distribution map per species in presence absence map a species with a null abundance in a cell being considered as absent from this cell differences in species richness were computed as the difference between the future 2071 2100 with climate change and present species richness 2006 2013 in a second step we computed the ß ratio index in order to quantify the relative contribution of species replacement i e turnover vs nestedness i e species loss or gain in temporal changes in community composition baselga 2012 disentangling the contribution of these two components of ß diversity patterns is indeed fundamental to understanding how communities react to spatial environmental and temporal changes carvalho et al 2012 to calculate the ß ratio we computed the pairwise jaccard s dissimilarity measure and calculated the ratio between its two additive components the dissimilarity due to species replacement or turnover ßjtu and the dissimilarity due to nestedness ßjne see baselga 2010 2012 a ß ratio value smaller than 0 5 indicates than dissimilarity in assemblage is mainly driven by species replacement and a ß ratio value higher than 0 5 indicates that dissimilarity is mainly driven by nestedness furthermore as any ß ratio value can be associated with either gains or losses in species richness baselga 2010 to simultaneously analyse changes in species richness and assemblage composition we analysed and mapped the ß ratio values and related changes in species richness albouy et al 2012 benedetti et al 2018 in a final step α and ß diversity projections were compared between the sdms and osmose med approaches at different spatial scales geographical sub areas gsas the spatial scale used for assessment and management of fisheries resources in the mediterranean sea marine ecoregions as listed in the marine strategy framework directive msfd and the whole mediterranean basin appendix a2 in supplementary data all analyses were performed with r r version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 using the betapart package for ß diversity analyses baselga and orme 2012 3 results 3 1 projecting changes in species richness under the rcp8 5 climate change scenario 16 and 15 species are projected to increase their geographic range by the end of the century 2071 2100 with average gains in range area of ca 163 and ca 131 according to sdms and osmose med respectively on the contrary the range of 25 sdms and 27 osmose med species is expected to shrink with average losses in range area of ca 29 sdms and ca 37 osmose med amongst the loser species 3 species are projected to become extinct no more presence in osmose med while sdms projected only a reduction of their climate suitable areas in average 45 at the scale of the whole mediterranean basin the average differences in species richness sr between the present and future periods rcp8 5 scenario were 0 37 species per grid cell when running the sdms only mean sr for the present period being 28 45 species per grid cell and 0 37 species per grid cell when running osmose med mean sr for the present period being 28 1 species per grid cell with both modelling approaches a contrasted spatial pattern emerged from the simulations between the western mediterranean sea characterized by an overall decrease in sr and the central and eastern mediterranean sea characterized by an overall increase in sr the differences between sr projections from sdms and osmose med were predominantly localized on the continental shelf with some exceptions e g in the levantine sea fig 2 at both marine ecoregions and geographical sub areas scales significative differences between sr projections from sdms and osmose med were apparent however under different orders of magnitude appendix a3 in supplementary data projected changes in sr diverged the most between sdms and osmose med in the tunisian gulfs of hammamet and gabes the northern adriatic sea the north aegean sea and along the egyptian coasts in the northern adriatic sea gsa 17 the average loss in sr was 0 61 species per grid cell in sdms while it was 3 4 species per grid cell according to osmose med in the gulfs of hammamet and gabes gsa 13 and 14 sdms projected average gains in sr of 0 34 and 1 18 species per grid cell respectively and osmose med on the contrary projected corresponding losses in sr of 1 85 and 1 1 species per grid cell at the mediterranean sea scale 44 15 and 48 93 of the cells mainly in the central and eastern mediterranean sea exhibited an increase in sr by the end of the century according to sdms and osmose med respectively on the contrary cells showing a decrease in sr represented 39 75 of the mediterranean sea in sdms and 47 09 in osmose med and were mainly located on the continental shelf of the western mediterranean sea and in the adriatic sea net differences in sr result from gains and losses in sr that spatially differed between osmose med and sdms fig 2 and appendix a4 in supplementary data using sdms higher gains in species richness were projected by the end of the century in the gulfs of hammamet and gabes on average 2 7 and 4 1 times more respectively p 0 05 in the northern adriatic sea on average 1 9 times more p 0 05 in the levantine sea on average 1 2 times more p 0 05 and to a lesser extent in the aegean sea on average 1 12 times more p 0 05 on the other hand lower losses in sr were projected by sdms on the continental slope of the gulf of gabes on average 3 7 times less p 0 05 in the northern adriatic sea on average 2 6 times less p 0 05 the gulf of lions on average 1 4 times less p 0 05 the continental shelf of the catalan sea on average 1 3 times less p 0 05 and the alboran sea on average 1 24 times less p 0 05 in the adriatic sea for example the number of cells affected by a decrease in sr was ca 29 lower in sdms compared to osmose med in the gulf of gabes ca 41 more cells were concerned by gains in sr in sdms compared to osmose med in other words under climate change scenario sdms overestimated the gains and underestimated the losses in species richness compared to osmose med 3 2 projecting changes in species composition comparing projections of simultaneous changes in species richness α diversity and species composition ß diversity from sdms and osmose med revealed similar changes in species composition between sdms and osmose med at the mediterranean scale mean ß jaccard 0 02 albeit with more than 35 6 of the cells showing a non zero dissimilarity at a finer spatial scale gsas dissimilarities in species composition by the end of the century between the two approaches were more apparent fig 3 and fig 4 and appendix a5 in supplementary data notably in the southern alboran sea the gulf of gabes the adriatic sea and the levantine sea for both modelling approaches species nestedness i e ß ratio 0 5 accompanied by gains in species richness contributed more than other patterns in driving dissimilarity between present and future assemblages nestedness with gains in sr represented ca 37 and ca 34 of the mediterranean sea surface according to sdms and osmose med respectively fig 3 and appendix a5 in supplementary data in both approaches nestedness represented ca 64 of the whole mediterranean sea but with marked local differences in projections through a west east gradient the western mediterranean sea was dominated by nestedness and a clear decrease in species richness mean ß ratio 0 76 and 0 77 for sdms and osmose med respectively p 0 05 the central mediterranean sea gulfs of gabes and sidra showed a combination of nestedness and replacement with gains and losses in sr mean ß ratio 0 24 and 0 23 for sdms and osmose med respectively p 0 05 and the eastern mediterranean sea was characterized by nestedness associated to a net increase in species richness mean ß ratio 0 78 for both sdms and osmose med p 0 05 whether for nestedness or replacement sdms projected greater gains and lower losses in species richness compared to osmose med when analysing beta diversity patterns at a finer spatial scale i e at the gsas scale the relative contribution of nestedness and replacement did not drastically differ between sdms and osmose med projections appendix a5 in supplementary data however in the gulf of gabes sdms projected that species replacement with increases in species richness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between time periods but with many local patches on the continental shelf where nestedness associated to gains in sr was the main driver while osmose med projected a decrease in sr associated with species replacement only 10 of the cells in sdms and three fold less 3 in osmose med were associated with nestedness projections also markedly differed in the southern alboran sea 28 of the cells in sdms and 50 in osmose med were associated with nestedness the northern adriatic sea 7 of the cells in sdms and almost double in osmose med 13 were associated with nestedness the northernmost parts of the aegean sea and at the mouth of the nile 4 discussion most studies projecting climate change impacts on species assemblages have used environmental niche modelling approaches that overlook key biological mechanisms such as demography dispersal eco evolution and species interactions shaping the distribution and productivity of species bellard et al 2012 urban et al 2016 our analysis suggested that sdms represent a relevant and parsimonious statistical tool to project the environmental suitability of species at large spatial scales at local scales however projections from sdms alone and from a model using sdms to drive biotic trophic interactions markedly differed at the local scale geographical sub area in our study projections of climate driven changes in assemblage composition and richness were both qualitatively and quantitatively different when species interactions were considered in the modelling of species distributions when applied alone sdms produced more optimistic projections of climate induced changes in species richness in the mediterranean sea overestimating gains and underestimating losses of species richness compared to the model including trophodynamics in particular important differences were found in some areas of high conservation interest such as the northern adriatic sea and the gulf of gabes both recognized as biodiversity hotspots in the mediterranean sea ben rais lasram et al 2009 coll et al 2010 mouillot et al 2011 our results agree with other studies showing that species interactions may slow climate tracking and produce more extinctions than in environmental niche models see urban et al 2013 in addition changes in species composition and single species extinctions may modify the web of interactions within a community and may lead to cascading effects and potential coextinctions processes not reflected in sdms but captured by osmose med bellard et al 2012 brook et al 2008 the projected extent of expansion or contraction of geographical ranges of species by the end of the century differed depending on whether species interactions were considered with lower gains and higher losses in our model including trophodynamic interactions various theoretical modelling studies have suggested that changes in intensity and nature of biotic interactions such as an increase in predation or a release of competition modulate not only the direction but also the magnitude of species range shifts lenoir et al 2010 svenning et al 2014 urban et al 2013 in the osmose model the presence of a species in a given grid cell i e at least one individual is based on the one hand by specific distribution maps from sdms and on the other hand by its ability to maintain itself in its suitable climatic space by feeding competing displaying somatic growth reproducing and resisting natural and anthropogenic pressures i e fishing mortality these added processes can cause more rapid changes in the sizes of home ranges compared to spatial changes predicted merely by sdms that consider only the suitability of abiotic factors for example sea warming could lead to the arrival of new species in an area which could directly compete with and displace native species alexander et al 2018 however there is still no consensus on whether considering trophic interactions produces more pessimistic climate induced shifts in biodiversity distribution for example fernandes et al 2013 showed that the inclusion of trophic interactions in the species based dynamic bioclimate envelope model dbem led to lower projected poleward latitudinal shifts in the distribution of marine fish especially for pelagic species while engelhardt et al 2020 reported that ignoring trophic interactions tended to overestimate the effects of climate induced changes in species distributions climate change directly impacts species physiology and spatial distribution but also engage species in novel interactions such as competition for food with potential feedbacks on species distribution araújo and luoto 2007 araújo and rozenfeld 2014 gallardo et al 2016 mcknight et al 2017 valiente banuet et al 2015 wiens 2016 even if it is still an immense challenge for ecologists and modellers mechanistically considering these interactions is essential to explore the effects of future climate change on biodiversity distribution jackson et al 2009 pellissier et al 2013 van der putten et al 2010 wisz et al 2013 the osmose med model explicitly considers the whole life cycle of species climate change can have different and potentially more severed effects on specific life stages for example the recruitment year class success of marine fish is normally established by processes impacting early life stages such as eggs and larvae that are planktonic free floating and more sensitive than juveniles and adults to changes in abiotic factors and prone to higher rates of mortality due to starvation and or predation durant et al 2007 llopiz et al 2014 furthermore predation is modelled as a size based and opportunistic process in osmose med not predefined based on diet matrices of species making it a powerful tool to predict potential interactions of species that do not currently co occur or interact but may do so in the future with all these processes represented our osmose med hybrid model intends to better capture the future realized niche of the species for producing more robust biodiversity projections our results pointed that in both sdms and osmose med approaches at the mediterranean sea scale dissimilarity between present day and future assemblages was mainly driven by nestedness with increases in species richness in contrast to what has been suggested for endemic species by ben rais lasram et al 2010 climate change might thus increase or decrease the richness of the initial assemblage without a total turnover of assemblages the projected patterns were spatially contrasted with for instance in the gulf of gabes three times as many grid cells concerned by nestedness in the sdms compared to osmose med in this area while sdms projected changes in species composition almost entirely driven by species replacement with gains in richness osmose med projected that changes could be mainly caused by replacement with species losses depending on the spatial scale considered our results can highly differ from previous studies in the region that focused on projections based on environmental niche modelling approaches albouy et al 2012 2013 ben rais lasram et al 2010 benedetti et al 2019 2018 for instance under the sres a2 scenario albouy et al 2012 found that species replacement was the dominant pattern of change projected in mediterranean coastal fish assemblages accounting for 98 of the continental shelf in contrast and in agreement with our estimates benedetti et al 2018 found that nestedness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future copepod assemblages our results also differed from albouy et al 2013 who projected that ca 70 of the continental shelf could experience a decrease and ca 27 an increase in species richness by the end of the century 47 and 44 respectively at the whole mediterranean sea scale according to osmose med compared to albouy et al 2012 and benedetti et al 2019 the average rate of change in species richness that we found at the mediterranean sea scale was also much lower with higher losses in the western regions and lower losses in the eastern ones this pattern was partly related to the large increase in abundance of thermophilic and or exotic species in the eastern mediterranean and to the decrease in abundance of some species of high commercial interest in the western part see moullec et al 2019a for an extended discussion on climate change consequences on the structure and functioning of the mediterranean sea by the end of the 21st century there are several explanations for the differences in projections first the environmental niche models used by albouy et al 2012 2013 were not trained at the global scale but at the mediterranean sea scale which can lead to truncated environmental niches and overestimation of extinction rates thuiller et al 2004 second not the same set of species endemic species vs one hundred miscellaneous species in our study and the area continental shelf vs whole mediterranean sea in our study were modelled which could also contribute to the discrepancies between the studies third previous studies used a different ipcc climate change scenario namely the special report on emission scenario sres a2 vs the rcp8 5 scenario and an older version of the regional circulation model cnrm rcsm4 ipcc 2014 rogelj et al 2012 fourth in contrast to previous niche modelling approaches the end to end model osmose med that we developed is fully integrated and considers for the first time in the region major biotic and abiotic processes that drive changes in population dynamics and community structure and composition despite attempts to make projections more realistic and credible several caveats persist in our approach for example we did not consider other drivers of fish distribution e g seafloor oxygen concentration that may prevail at local scales to prevent life cycle closure and population persistence petitgas et al 2013 and which will most likely be impacted by future anthropogenic pressures we also did not consider the potential arrivals of thermophilic non native species from the atlantic or the red sea which will likely influence the future biodiversity in the mediterranean sea ben rais lasram and mouillot 2009 parravicini et al 2015 and could dramatically affect future assemblages edelist et al 2013 another limit in our projections was that phenotypic plasticity and genetic evolution were not included into osmose med to mechanistically depict the potential eco evolutionary dynamics shaping future communities and food webs peck et al 2018 yet these adaptive processes might allow species to evolve in a new ecological niche thus dampening climate change impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems beaugrand and kirby 2018 cotto et al 2017 although our end to end approach considers two major components of global change climate change and fishing pressure we neglected other anthropogenic pressures such as pollution or habitat destruction which can act in synergy and exacerbate the vulnerability of species ultimately accelerating changes in species composition and richness and making the estimates from our projections conservative in terms of biodiversity loss finally for practical and pragmatic reasons moullec et al 2019a 2019b and similar to most studies conducted in the region we did not thoroughly investigate the uncertainty associated with our projections although some aspects of structural uncertainty were addressed by using an ensemble estimate of sdms other sources of uncertainty stemming from differences amongst scenarios global climate models and regional physical biogeochemical models were not included peck et al 2020 this is clearly one of the future challenges that need to be addressed when tackling biodiversity projections especially with increasingly complex models ipbes

24503,the effects of climate change on agriculture are a major concern for global food security in this study the impacts of climate change on rainfed rice production in the granary of cambodia were examined on a basin scale by developing and applying a combined model consisting of a crop model and a basin scale distributed hydrological model the response of rice production to soil water availability was simulated for past 1981 2000 and future 2041 2060 2081 2100 periods from 34 general circulation models gcms that participated in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 5 gcms were selected by evaluating monthly rainfall in the past although annual rainfall was projected to increase by all five selected gcms notable decreases in rainfed rice production were projected with 3 gcms while small changes were projected with the other 2 gcms the main factor restricting future rice production was soil water availability brought by the projected change in the seasonal distribution of rainfall and the projected more severe dry spells in the early monsoon season the results suggest the importance of the selection and bias correction of gcms to force rice crop models and of the simulation of soil water flow on a basin scale for the assessment of rain fed rice production in particular improvements in projections of rainfall amounts over shorter periods rather than annual or seasonal periods which fit within the time scales of rice plant growth were suggested to be important keywords climate change impact assessment soil moisture crop model rice

multidecadal global warming since the 1950s is unequivocal ipcc 2014 the sixth assessment report ar6 is currently under preparation to be released between 2021 and 2022 and public concern about the impact of climate change is arising climate change has severely affected many agricultural regions and is one of the major concerns for global food security as it restricts stable crop production mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture are considered more serious in tropical developing countries because frequent heat stress and drought are combined with low levels of technological development li et al 2017 cambodia is a developing country located in the lower mekong river basin on the indochina peninsula it relies heavily on agriculture for its economic development more than half of the total workforce is engaged in agriculture and agriculture contributed approximately 32 of the national gross domestic product gdp as of 2011 national climatic change committe 2013 irrigation rates remain low at approximately 12 of the cropland mekong river commission 2018 and most crops are rainfed accordingly a change in rainfall under climate change is a great threat to agricultural management crop production and socioeconomic activity in cambodia with increasing demand for agricultural products from the lower mekong river basin sustaining and improving rice production under climate change is key for the development of the country a quantitative impact assessment of climate change on rice production is essential for informing policies on adaptation strategies including investment in irrigation facilities and other agricultural infrastructure given the increasing socioeconomic need in cambodia for agricultural management under climate change this study carries out an impact assessment on rainfed paddy rice production in cambodia among various climatic factors rainfall temperature solar radiation and co2 concentration are the most important climate factors affecting crop productivity li et al 2017 there are many studies dealing with the effects of increasing co2 and they show clear evidence that when interactions with other climate variables are ignored more co2 leads to higher crop yields ainsworth and long 2005 kim et al 2003 kimball et al 2002 because of enhanced photosynthesis in more realistic studies however higher air temperatures from elevated co2 levels tend to suppress the increase in yield krishnan et al 2007 for rice a rise in air temperature is generally considered to decrease yield because of the lower spikelet fertility prasad et al 2006 as well as the higher evaporative demand of the crop deb et al 2016 because of such interactions of various climatological factors the ipcc ar5 ipcc 2014 reports high variability in the projected changes in rice production under climate change recent studies on biophysical process based rice crop modeling include the applications and developments of simriw horie et al 1992 1995 oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 the ceres rice model mahmood 1998 of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 1998 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 these models are designed to simulate rice plant growth including photosynthesis respiration leaf area development dry matter accumulation phenological development and yield through simulations of the water and nitrogen balance in the soil accounting for the effects of the temperature and co2 concentration in the atmosphere crop details soil properties weather conditions and rice management practices are the main inputs to drive these models each of these models has a series of developmental varieties in their modules and has been applied to climate change impact studies by many researchers worldwide simriw rainfed selected for this study was derived from simriw to simulate rice plant growth under limited conditions for water and nitrogen homma and horie 2009 ohnishi et al 1997 the model was validated in thailand and indonesia homma and horie 2009 homma et al 2017b and its modified version for remote sensing was also validated in thailand and lao pdr maki et al 2017 raksapatcharawong et al 2020 however these abovementioned rice crop models including simriw rainfed model are developed on a point scale basis without consideration of the basin scale hydrological cycle and its associated soil water flow in the basin although water availability is the most important factor for rain fed rice production for predicting the global climate gcms are the primary tools and many studies have used gcms with rice crop models to assess the potential effects of climate change on rice production impact assessments of rice production based on multimodel ensemble projections using the gcms included in cmip5 taylor et al 2012 have been conducted in many areas in the world including iran darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 china he et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zheng et al 2020 vietnam deb et al 2016 and thailand arunrat et al 2018 boonwichai et al 2019 however uncertainty in gcm projections of soil moisture over monsoon regions is reported to be higher than that of other variables because of the diverse soil schemes and vegetation parameterizations in gcms zhang et al 2019b thus the effect of soil moisture stress can be largely dependent on the selection of the gcms to be used as inputs to the rice model the selection of the gcms and the gcm related uncertainties have not been however paid enough attention in earlier studies in applying rice models for climate change impact assessments the uncertainties in projected rice production can therefore be larger for rain fed paddies while many of the earlier studies assessing climate change impacts on crop production assumed irrigated conditions with high soil water availability the potential effects of water stress on rainfed paddies have not been well examined babel et al 2011 despite the prevalence of rainfed paddies in many developing countries and the knowledge that water stress drought is one of the main factors restricting rice production homma et al 2004 prabnakorn et al 2018 in assessing rain fed rice production the daily evolution of soil moisture in the growing season is key to assessing the water stress impact on rice growth and yield therefore precipitation radiation and air temperature need to be appropriately given from the gcms to the rice model to simulate the actual evapotranspiration in the limited condition of soil water in this regard the evaluation and selection of gcms in terms of reproducibility on a daily scale should be examined carefully while many earlier studies pay little attention to them and are mainly based on monthly reproducibility although increases in soil moisture were projected in earlier studies in the asian monsoon region for india saseendran et al 2000 and the yangtze river basin in china sun et al 2019 our hypothesis is that the drought effect on rain fed rice production can be highly affected by the finer time scale distributions of rainfall and soil moisture and thus drought can be more severe even under the increased rainfall amount over a time period from several months to a year for reliable projections of soil moisture and rainfed rice production it is considered more effective to simulate the soil water flow with vegetation effects at higher spatiotemporal resolution instead of directly using the gcm outputs in this study we thus developed and applied a combined hydrologic and crop rice model which is named mizuha to concurrently simulate horizontal and vertical soil water flows based on the basin scale hydrologic cycle and the growth and yield of rice in response to root zone soil moisture by developing the research methodology framework to select the best gcms to be used for rain fed rice production assessment and to use the combined hydrologic rice growth model we quantified the gcm related uncertainty in assessing the impact of climate change on rain fed rice production where soil moisture plays a key role with this study we aim to provide suggestions to the scientific community for future improvement of the gcm from the viewpoint of simulating rain fed rice production and to provide information for local policy makers in cambodia for climate change adaptation 2 materials and methods in this study rain fed rice production in cambodia under future climates was assessed the overall procedure and the scientific questions to be solved in this study are conceptually described in fig 1 this study is unique in that future rice production is assessed not on a point scale but on a basin scale by combining hydrologic and rice growth models to improve the simulation accuracy of soil moisture and soil water stress to rice growth under nonirrigated conditions in addition it is notable that the selection and bias correction methods of the gcms have been deeply examined to be properly given to the rice growth model in the context of obtaining climatic variables with their time series that affect rice growth the detailed procedures are shown in the following sections 2 1 study area the pursat river basin in western cambodia fig 2 a and b was selected as the study area its watershed area is approximately 6760 km2 and it runs from southwest to northeast to flow into tonle sap lake based on the elevation data from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster nasa 2020 nine main subbasins were defined by the pfafstetter algorithm yang et al 2002 as indicated in fig 2b with odd subbasin numbers 1 3 5 7 9 along the main stream and even numbers 2 4 6 8 for tributaries the land use distribution fig 2c was obtained from the u s geological survey global data global land cover characterization version 1 2 usgs 2020a and all the cropland in the middle to lower basin 1396 km2 was assumed to be paddy since the authors observed the prevalence of paddy fields through the middle to lower basin with other crop types distributed mainly in the upper basin another correspondence table for the original usgs categorization and the model application in this study is shown in table s1 of the supplementary material the soil types and their properties including the van genuchten parameters are given by the food and agriculture organization fao 2007 fig 2d and table 1 2 2 rice growth model simriw rainfed the simulation model for rice weather relations simriw rainfed homma and horie 2009 was applied in this study to simulate the growth and yield of rice plants simriw rainfed is based on simriw horie et al 1992 1995 with additional components to include water stress effects on rice plants phenological development is based on simriw horie et al 1992 1995 and is described with the developmental index dvi for which its value is defined as 0 for seeding emergence 1 for heading and 2 for maturity the dvi is calculated as the integration of the daily developmental rate dvr 1 d v i d v r the leaf area index lai l a i aboveground dry matter d m and grain yield y i e l d are represented as 2 l a i f 1 r e r m a x r d r t a i r δ n u p w s d v i 3 d m f 2 r c e s d t a i r l a i δ n u p w s 4 y i e l d f 3 d m h i n u p w s d v i where rer max is the maximum relative expansion rate of lai r d r is the relative leaf death rate r c e is the radiation conversion efficiency and h i is the harvest index t a i r and s d are air temperature and solar radiation respectively and are given through the hydrological submodel web dhm to simriw rainfed in the model n u p and w s are plant nitrogen uptake and water stress respectively and are given with the following equations 5 δ n p o o l f 4 t a i r s m c f e r t i l i z e r n u p 6 δ n u p f 5 n p o o l w s d v i 7 w s d v i 0 f 6 s w c where n p o o l is the available nitrogen in the soil f e r t i l i z e r is the fertilizer application amount and s w c is the root zone soil moisture which is calculated in web dhm in this study the water stress is calculated as the accumulated values from the initiation of the growth following simriw rainfed the effect of w s is considered in the calculation of d v r as well although many factors change from present to future and affect rice production we considered only meteorological factors such as rainfall through s w c t a i r and s d for the changes it was assumed that no changes would occur in other factors including co2 concentration fertilizer irrigation and rice cultivars and the same values were used in all the past and future simulations the co2 concentration was set to 370 ppm the parameters that were calibrated for rainfed rice in northeast thailand were used but the phenological development of rice cultivars and farmer management were adjusted to approximate the conditions in cambodia in 2013 2014 hirooka et al 2016 kodo et al 2021 damage by pests and diseases was not considered and only the damage brought by water stress was evaluated to highlight the hydrological restriction on rain fed rice production in this region only single cropping in the rainy season under rainfed conditions without irrigation was considered 2 3 combined hydrologic rice growth model mizuha the combined simriw rainfed model with a hydrological model was applied in this study to hourly simulate the concurrent responses of the basin scale hydrologic cycle and rice growth with consideration of soil water flow in the basin and improved soil moisture estimation for the hydrologic model the water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm wang et al 2009b was used the web dhm is based on the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 2002 and is characterized by the incorporation wang et al 2009a of the modified simple biosphere model 2 sib2 sellers et al 1996 to realize a process based description for evapotranspiration considering the water and energy fluxes from the land surface and soil water flow the combined model of web dhm and simriw rainfed is named mizuha in this study and was previously used for climate change impact assessment in cambodia with cmip3 data soso im et al 2014 and in indonesia with cmip5 data homma et al 2017a for web dhm application the target basin was divided into 500 m 500 m square grids in which soil water flow was calculated by the richards equation richards 1931 considering the soil water retention characteristics modeled by van genuchten van genuchten 1980 in paddy grids the root zone depth was set to 50 cm and vertically discretized into 5 cm sublayers in the root zone and 10 cm sublayers below the root zone for soil water flow simulation the hillslope flow and subsurface flow from the grids were integrated for each flow interval in a subbasin to obtain river discharge the root zone soil moisture calculated in web dhm was put into simriw rainfed paddy grids at each time step to simulate water stress and rice plant growth the lai expansion was simulated by simriw rainfed in response to water stress and was returned to web dhm to be used for the hydrologic simulation in the next time step in web dhm the lai is used together with the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar to simulate canopy interception transpiration and surface energy budget except for paddy grids for which the lai simulated by simriw rainfed grids is passed to web dhm the 8 day composites of lai and fpar from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis onboard the terra and aqua satellites mcd15a2h v006 product usgs 2020d are used because of the limited period 2003 present of data availability for the lai and fpar from terra aqua modis the data from 2003 and 2019 were used in all the years in the past and future runs respectively thus outside of paddy areas only the 8 day seasonal changes in lai and fpar were considered and their yearly changes in each period were not considered one of the challenges in simulating rainfed rice production is data scarcity with respect to the crop calendar because rice is rainfed the planting date is not fixed to a certain calendar date and data on basin wide planting dates are not available we thus applied a satellite data based estimation method tsujimoto et al 2021 using the 16 day enhanced vegetation index evi mod13q1 and myd13q1 v006 products usgs 2020b 2020c from modis to estimate the planting dates and used those for the rice growth simulations by mizuha this algorithm was originally developed by tsujimoto et al 2019 by using field observation data in the pursat river basin by hirooka et al 2016 since the modis evi is only available after 2000 we used the estimated results in 2016 for both the past and future simulations taking into consideration that the planting dates in 2016 are considered an average over the last 20 years tsujimoto et al 2021 2 4 past and future climate a simulation of the 20 year period from january 1981 to december 2000 was conducted to compare the results with those for future climates and to validate the model with observations and statistics the years from 1981 to 2000 are referred to as the past period in this study for future climate the outputs from the gcms contributing to cmip5 were used as a reference two projection periods the near future 2041 2060 and the far future 2081 2100 were considered in this study under the representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the meteorological data in the past and future periods were interpolated into 500 m 500 m mizuha simulation grids using the inverse distance weight idw method and linearly interpolated to hourly 2 4 1 past data the japanese 55 year reanalysis data jra 55 harada et al 2016 hou et al 2014 kobayashi et al 2015 were referenced to describe the past climate variables in the two dimensional diagnostic fields fcst surf and fcst phy2m were used as forcing data in mizuha including air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m height wind speed at 10 m height total cloud coverage downward longwave radiation downward solar radiation and surface air pressure these variables are provided at an approximately 55 km horizontal resolution and are available every three hours in each simulation grid of mizuha the air temperature was adjusted by the lapse rate based on the difference between the jra 55 level 2 m and the grid elevation for rainfall amount in the past period the observation based dataset asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward evaluation of water resources aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 was used its spatial resolution is 0 25 latitude by 0 25 longitude although the number of rain gage stations in cambodia is limited in the aphrodite dataset we compared the aphrodite data for the past period with intensive rain gage observation results from 2010 to 2015 the 20 year mean annual rainfall in 1981 2000 over the target basin was 1134 mm which was comparable to the annual totals of 1087 to 1528 mm over cambodia from 2010 to 2015 tsujimoto et al 2018 2 4 2 evaluation and selection of gcms the acquisition evaluation and bias correction of the gcms were performed using a tool for cmip5 from the data integration and analysis system dias https diasjp net kawasaki et al 2017 among the 34 cmip5 gcms we evaluated the 18 gcms for which future projection data under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were available at dias the gcms were evaluated from the viewpoint of rainfall reproductivity to be properly used for assessing rain fed rice production for each gcm the 20 year mean monthly rainfall during 1981 2000 were compared against data from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp adler et al 2003 in the same period the spatial correlation coefficient scorr and root mean square error rmse between the gcm and gpcp monthly rainfall were calculated by the following equations 8 s c o r r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 where x i and y i are the gcm and gpcp rainfall at grid i respectively and x and y are the means of the gcm and gpcp rainfall over the entire grid in the study area respectively if scorr 1 for the spatial distribution and rmse 0 for the absolute value then the spatial distribution pattern of the gcm outputs completely matches that of the gpcp to use both the scorr and rmse for gcm evaluation the simple demerit point system used in eastham et al 2008 was adopted in this study the gcm performance was deemed poor when scorr 0 6 or rmse 2 and 1 demerit point was assigned to the gcm for each of the scorr and rmse indices that indicated poor performance while eastham et al 2008 calculated the demerit points for rainy and dry seasons we calculated them for each month to examine the rainfall reproducibility at fine temporal resolution thus the maximum number of demerit points is 24 2 indices 12 months where more demerit points correspond to lower reproducibility in addition to evaluate rainfall reproducibility for both monsoonal and local rainfall we calculated demerit points over two regions the indochina peninsula and cambodia domains 1 and 2 respectively fig 2a and summed their demerit points to select the best gcms for assessing the impact of climate change on rainfed paddy rice production in this region since the calculated scorr and rmse showed a smaller difference among ensemble runs from each gcm compared with those among gcms we used only one ensemble member r1i1p1 to calculate demerit points for all of the gcms to maintain equitability regardless of the number of ensemble members of each gcm 2 4 3 bias correction of the gcm rainfall statistical bias correction was applied to the daily rainfall amounts in the selected gcms the details of this bias correction method are provided in nyunt et al 2016 in short this method addressed the three main gcm deficiencies i e underestimation of extremes high frequency of rainy days and poor seasonal simulation through a 3 step statistical bias correction here the gcm biases in the past climate were assumed to be stationary in the future climate and the same transfer function f gc m past derived from the gcm hindcast was applied to the gcm future projection 10 x gc m past f obs 1 f gc m past x gc m past 11 x gc m future f obs 1 f gc m past x gc m f u t u r e where x gc m past and x gc m future represent bias corrected gcm rainfall for past and future periods respectively and f obs is the distribution function of the observed rainfall during the past period the generalized pareto distribution function was used in eqs 10 11 to determine f gc m past and f obs to correct for extreme rainfall the frequency of rainy days was then corrected by assuming the same number of rainy days in the observation as in the gcm hindcast using a simple rank order statistic the gcm rainfall corresponding to the same rank as that of the observation was defined as a correction threshold and gcm future rainfall beyond this threshold was corrected to zero finally monthly grouped normal rainfall was adjusted to fit a gamma distribution by mapping the cumulative distribution function of daily gcm rainfall to that of the observed rainfall and corrections were made through eqs 10 11 in this study aphrodite was used as the observational data through the bias correction process rainfall from all the gcms was spatially interpolated to the same grids as the reference aphrodite which is 0 25 latitude by 0 25 longitude although the original grid resolutions were different among the gcms only rainfall was bias corrected and other meteorological variables air temperature and humidity wind speed pressure total cloud fraction solar radiation and longwave radiation at the ground surface were used without bias correction data on radiation and cloud fraction for ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 were not available at dias and thus the equivalent data from miroc5 were used for mizuha simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 3 results 3 1 model validation because of the limited availability of basin wide soil moisture data river discharge was used for model validation on the spatiotemporal distribution of the simulated soil moisture regarding river discharge as the spatially and temporally integrated result of soil moisture distribution in the basin the availability of river discharge data masumoto et al 2016 was limited to 2010 2011 and thus the model parameters were calibrated against these two years the comparison of observed and simulated river discharge is shown in fig 3 although their agreement was not perfect we adopted the calibrated parameters for the past and future simulations in this study because of the limited availability and uncertainties in both rainfall and river discharge data since rice production statistics in the target basin were not available the basin averaged simulated results were compared with the nationwide fao statistics fao 2019 for yield harvested area and total production as indicated in fig 4 a c in these figures yield fig 4a is shown as rice production fig 4c per unit harvested area fig 4b changes in the harvested area occur both from changes in the sowed planted area and from crop loss or damage over the entire sowed planted area during cultivation clearly increasing trends from the past to the present were recognized in yield and harvested area these were considered to arise because of technological developments such as increased fertilizer application improvement in rice cultivars increased irrigation and agricultural land development to distill the year to year fluctuation caused by meteorological factors we calculated the anomalies from the trend assuming a linear trend from 1981 to 2000 the anomalies in the fao statistics showed correspondence with the simulation results by mizuha especially in harvested area and total production with lower production in 1984 1987 and 1994 and higher production in 1989 1995 and 1999 fig 4d shows the scatter plot between the anomalies of production in the fao statistics and the mizuha simulation indicating that the overall characteristics of year to year fluctuation were well described by mizuha although they are not in perfect agreement in this study we used this model and these parameters for past and future simulations 3 2 past and future rainfall by the selected gcms the evaluation results of the 18 gcms from cmip5 are listed in table 2 the five gcms with the smallest demerit points were ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 miroc5 mpi esm lr and noresm1 m as shown with asterisks in table 2 as explained in the earlier section with eqs 8 9 the selected gcms with smaller demerit points have relatively high scorrs and low rmses for monthly rainfall reproducibility in the past through january to december and thus it is generally recognizable that future rainfall predictions by these gcms are more reliable than others both in their absolute values from rmses and spatial distributions from scorrs thus we adopted these 5 gcms in this study to assess rain fed rice production for this region the daily rainfall amounts from these selected gcms are shown in fig 5 along with the reference data from aphrodite to show the validation of the reproducibility of the daily basis rainfall amount by the selected gcms and the effectiveness of the bias correction applied in this study the daily rainfall amounts on all the days in each month from may to december over the 20 years were plotted as jitter plots and boxplots for the past 1981 2000 and future 2041 2060 under rcp4 5 periods overall all the selected gcms were found to overestimate past rainfall compared with aphrodite after bias correction was applied the medians and the other quartile values of the past rainfall estimates of the gcms were comparable to those of aphrodite as shown in the boxplots using the same transfer function future rainfall projections were corrected to be smaller than their original values in almost all the gcms and months these bias correction results indicate that even through selecting the better performing gcms in representing the past rainfall they tend to overestimate the future annual rainfall for this region thus they will underestimate the drought damage on rain fed rice production if they are applied without bias correction based on the bias corrected future rainfall the 20 year averaged annual total amount in 2041 2060 under rcp4 5 was 1190 mm ccsm4 1328 mm cesm1 cam5 1216 mm miroc5 1227 mm mpi esm lr and 1343 mm noresm1 m showing a slight 5 18 increase compared with the past period 1134 mm in aphrodite thus it is very likely that annual rainfall in cambodia will increase in the future from the viewpoint of agricultural water resources however not only annual total but also its seasonal distribution is important fig 6 shows the bias corrected future monthly rainfall compared with the past data in aphrodite shown as the areally averaged values for each subbasin subbasin 9 for the upper stream and 1 for the lower stream as their locations are shown in fig 2b in fig 6 the rainy season in the past was approximately may october with rainfall peaking in september october in the future the rainfall peak was projected to be earlier in ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 shifting to august september with less rainfall in october in mpi esm lr two rainfall peaks in may june and september were projected in miroc5 the rainfall peak was projected to be later with increased rainfall in september october and less rainfall in the early rainy season in june july the rainfall amount was larger in the upper subbasins 7 9 than in the lower subbasins 1 5 in the past and the difference between the upper and lower subbasins tended to become more pronounced in the future in all the gcms especially in the months with abundant rainfall the future rainfall tendency was recognized to be common regardless of the future periods and rcp scenarios see fig s1 in the supplementary material 3 3 rice production 3 3 1 projected change in rice production the effects on rice production appeared as both damaged areas and yield losses fig 7 shows simulated rice yield under the past and future 2041 2060 climates indicated with the percentages of the damaged planted but not harvested areas see fig s2 in supplementary material for 2081 2100 the future simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 showed little change in yield regardless of the periods and rcp scenarios whereas the results with miroc5 and noresm1 m showed remarkable decreases in future yield compared with the past run with aphrodite especially in the simulation with miroc5 for 2041 2060 under the rcp4 5 scenario frequent occurrences of low yield at less than 250 t ha 1 were projected in simulations with noresm1 m not only the median but also the maximum yields were projected to decrease under all three rcp scenarios in the near and far future periods with little difference among scenarios periods the differences among scenarios periods were larger in miroc5 and mpi esm lr than in the other models and these two models showed larger year to year and location to location fluctuations indicated by longer boxplots the totally damaged area was 11 3 in the past run and the ratio was similar or even smaller in the future runs with ccsm4 9 9 10 8 cesm1 cam5 9 7 10 5 and noresm1 m 9 9 10 6 regardless of the periods or rcp scenarios however in future runs with miroc5 13 0 18 7 and mpi esm lr 14 5 16 3 increases in the totally damaged area were projected 3 3 2 affecting factors on rain fed rice production under the given conditions in this study i e nonirrigated rainfed paddies with constant co2 concentrations and fertilizer application rates fixed rice cultivars and without consideration of pests and diseases water stress to rice plants is the most important potential factor for lower rice production fig 8 shows the root zone soil moisture in the rice growing season in the results from miroc5 in which simulated rice production was lower than that of the other gcms soil moisture was comparable to that of the past and future simulations with the other gcms at the beginning may and end october of the rainy season but it was lower in the early rainy season in june and july in addition the soil moisture variability was larger in july and august with the frequent occurrence of distinctively low soil moisture such dry spells just after the beginning of the rainy season in july are often observed in cambodia causing serious damage to agriculture more severe dry spells were projected in miroc5 than in the other gcms during the early rainy season over this region similarly in the simulations with mpi esm lr which showed high variability in rice production as with miroc5 in fig 7 large fluctuations in soil water availability throughout the rainy season under future climates are projected on the other hand in the simulated results from ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 in which simulated rice production was larger than that of the other gcms the median simulated soil moisture was higher than that of the past with relatively small variability in all rainy season months the simulation results with noresm1 m are unique in that it showed lower production than that of the other gcms fig 7 while its soil moisture was similar to that of the high yield simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 fig 8 this suggests the existence of other factors affecting rice production under climate change fig 9 shows the other meteorological forcing data used to run mizuha for the past and future periods fig 9 reveals that noresm1 m projected less shortwave radiation and a higher cloud fraction during the rainy season from may to november than those of the other gcms and jra 55 thus the air temperature was lower in noresm1 m than in the other gcms and even in the past reanalysis of jra 55 even though the projections with climate change are under increased radiative forcing the projected low solar radiation and air temperature are considered to be the reasons why rice production was consistently lower in simulations by mizuha with noresm1 m than the other gcms this result highlights the importance of the solar radiation amount during the rainy season or the relationship between rainfall and solar radiation this relationship is closely linked with the diurnal cycle of rainfall or convective activity because if rainfall and cloud coverage are concentrated at night the amount of daily solar radiation does not decrease even on rainy days in earlier studies the diurnal and seasonal distributions of solar radiation in cambodia were observed to be as strong in the rainy season as in the dry season because of the predominantly evening rainfall tsujimoto et al 2008 2018 and convective activity from midnight to early morning over tonle sap lake and its lakeshore tsujimoto et al 2018 as tsujimoto et al 2008 pointed out the diurnal cycle of rainfall and the amount of solar radiation on rainy days differ across regions and seasons and thus it is important to take them into consideration when assessing the factors affecting agricultural production in the region this study suggests the importance of considering the reproducibility of the diurnal cycle of rainfall convective activity and solar radiation to assess the impact of climate change on crop production which depends on solar radiation air temperature and rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 future projection of rice production in cambodia the assessment of climate change impacts in data scarce regions was one of the major challenges in this study especially in conducting assessments not only at the field scale but also at the basin scale considering the basin hydrological cycle and spatial distribution of rainfall and soil moisture within a basin although uncertainty remains the following five points are suggested from this study first excluding noresm1 m two out of four gcms ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 showed little change in future rice production compared with that of the past in terms of the median and other quartile values from basin wide statistics over 20 years however the year to year and location to location fluctuations shown as the width of the jitter plots in the future are much larger than those in the past even in the simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 this suggests higher spatiotemporal variability in rice production in the basin which can be a great threat to individual farmers even though rice production on a basin scale may not be significantly impacted under such conditions a framework to share or allocate potential risks and resources within the basin may be an effective long term risk management strategy second considering that one of the selected gcms miroc5 suggested the potential intensification of dry spells in the early rainy season preparation for supplementary irrigation in this season or a shifting of the crop calendar may be options as adaptation strategies third since most of the selected gcms showed an increase in the regional difference in rainfall between the upper and lower basins in the pursat river basin with more rainfall in the upper basin and less rainfall in the lower basin where most of the paddies are located the effective storage of excess rainfall from the upper basin using reservoirs along with irrigation facilities in downstream paddy fields can also be an option fourth differences among the future periods either the near future in 2041 2060 or far future in 2081 2100 and rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 were not significant in the simulations with ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 and noresm1 m whereas they were large in miroc5 and mpi esm lr from this study it is difficult to conclude whether the impact on rice production changes with time or with rcp rather further investigation of the rainfall pattern that affects rainfed paddy rice production should be taken to improve the methods for climate change impact assessment of rice production including the improvement selection and bias correction of gcms finally although this study neglected the effects of increasing co2 concentrations rice yield has been reported to increase with more co2 in addition the effects of the changes in co2 as well as soil moisture solar radiation and air temperature differ among different rice cultivars changes in the application rate of fertilizer and irrigation clearly affect rice production but the extent of their effects also depends on the cultivar iwahashi et al 2021 kodo et al 2021 moreover as such changes in agronomic management shifts in the crop calendar especially on planting dates are known to affect rice production even under the same meteorological conditions hirooka et al 2016 using the present study as a base scenario effective adaptation strategies that also consider other effects such as cultivars co2 concentration fertilizer irrigation and crop calendar should be examined 4 2 quantification of the gcm related uncertainties and suggestions from the viewpoint of gcm application to rain fed rice production simulations in an earlier study that examined changes in soil moisture under climate change saseendran et al 2000 assessed the tropical humid climate in india and suggested that increased rainfall will increase soil moisture and thus increase rice production similarly sun et al 2019 projected future agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin in china under climate change and suggested an increase in soil moisture however these studies examined changes in rainfall and soil moisture on an annual or monthly basis without considering finer temporal scale distributions or the duration of dry spells our study showed the importance of analysis with a higher temporal resolution than annual or monthly to assess the impact of soil moisture on rice production as dry spells lasting less than 1 month can severely affect rice growth and thus monthly or annually based evaluation can underestimate the drought damage to rice production this is especially the case for cambodia where the annual rainfall is projected to increase to properly take into consideration the effect of soil moisture deficiency on rain fed rice production the methodologies for the selection and bias correction of the gcms as well as for downscaling simulation of the soil water flow in the basin are the key to improving the accuracy of future projections these are the keys of this study in a similar study over the lower mekong river basin ruan et al 2018 ranked the 34 gcms in cmip5 according to their rainfall reproducibility against the aphrodite data using rmse scorr and six other statistical indices mpi esm lr was selected as the best model followed by ipsl cm5a mr when the gcms were evaluated by their rainy season may october dry season november april and annual total rainfall accumulations the scores for ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 were also high with better scores for the dry season in ccsm4 and for the rainy season in cesm1 cam5 the other two gcms selected in our study noresm1 m and miroc5 were ranked 12th and 20th respectively however in evaluating rainfall reproducibility over the mekong river basin at monsoon onset with the gpcp and other data hasson et al 2016 found a better performance in ccsm4 miroc5 and noresm1 m than in cesm1 cam5 and mpi esm lr comparing the results of our study with these earlier studies we can see that the evaluation of gcms is highly dependent on the evaluation periods and metrics this suggests the importance of examining the appropriate time span when evaluating gcms for assessing impacts on rice production considering the potential time span that is critical for rainfed rice a shorter period rather than annual or seasonal periods will be more effective for evaluating rainfall reproducibility in this regard the gcms that were selected in this study based on monthly rainfall were considered more suitable than those selected in earlier studies for assessing the impact of climate change on rainfed rice production the predictability of dry spells during monsoonal rainfall was suggested to be important because farmers generally start planting rainfed paddies in accordance with the onset of the rainy season since rainfall or soil water availability during the early growing season is important for successful rice growth the predictability of dry spells greatly affects the accuracy of rainfed paddy rice production estimates although the escalating number of dry spells in the early monsoon season was projected only by miroc5 and not by the other four gcms hasson et al 2016 found that miroc5 had a better performance in reproducing rainfall at the monsoon onset this suggests that detailed examination of the reproducibility and future projection of rainfall at monsoon onset and of dry spells is required in addition this study indicates the potential overestimation of daily rainfall amount by the gcms throughout the rainy season for this region even for the selected gcms and suggests the importance of bias correction in addition to the selection of the gcms however the bias correction method also needs to be examined further in the bias correction method used in this study gcm biases were considered to be stationary from the past to the future and the same transfer function was applied for the gcm hindcasts and predictions the weak rainfall features in gcms that were under a determined threshold value derived from the hindcast were then removed completely as a result in the bias corrected gcm outputs weak rainfall was artificially removed in some months and models this is apparent in fig 5 for march and april in noresm1 m for june in miroc5 from july through november in ccsm4 and for october november in cesm1 cam5 however because even weak rainfall can have an important effect on the wetness of the root zone soil accurate bias correction of rainfall to reproduce root zone soil wetness is necessary when using gcms to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture the removal of weak rainfall in miroc5 in june is considered one reason for the decreased soil moisture in june and lowered rice production in the mizuha simulations with miroc5 although this study directly applies the bias correction method by nyunt et al 2016 the bias correction method itself should be further examined depending on the objectives to use future rainfall data and for assessing rain fed rice production the bias correction method for weak rainfall events should be improved finally the reproducibility of solar radiation in connection with the diurnal cycle of rainfall was also shown to be important for noresm1 m although atmospheric processes are calculated at a finer time resolution than daily for the application of gcm outputs to climate change impact assessments of agriculture and other socioeconomic sectors often only daily or monthly data are used and gcm evaluation is also conducted at these time scales this study showed the importance of evaluating gcm rainfall with its diurnal cycle to select gcms that have higher reproducibility not only for rainfall but also for radiation and air temperature which are the three important limiting factors for crop production the simulated results with noresm1 m in this study were thus not considered reliable because of the observed relationship between rainfall and solar radiation however changes in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and its effect on solar radiation on rainy days may also change in the future this aspect should be monitored when assessing the agricultural impacts of climate change 5 conclusions through the evaluation and bias correction of the gcms that participated in cmip5 all five selected gcms showed future increases in annual rainfall in this region under all three rcp scenarios despite the commonly projected increase in rainfall on an annual basis the projected effect on rain fed rice production differed depending on the gcms to force the rice model and three out of five selected gcms resulted in a projected decrease in rice production the major cause was revealed to be the changes in the seasonal distribution of rainfall and it was different among the five gcms the rainfall peak was projected to shift earlier in ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 to august september with less rainfall in october two rainfall peaks in may june and september were projected in mpi esm lr and in miroc5 the rainfall peak was projected to shift later with increased rainfall in september october and less rainfall in june july the simulated lower yield with noresm1 m was attributable to the projected lower solar radiation which was considered erroneous based on the observed solar radiation for simulations with miroc5 and mpi esm lr high variability in lower than average root zone soil moisture was considered the main factor restricting rice production in miroc5 dry spells in the early monsoon season were projected to be more severe than those in the other gcms these results suggest the importance of the ability of gcms to project the diurnal cycle of rainfall or solar radiation on rainy days they also show the importance of using accumulated rainfall amount in shorter periods than annual or seasonal in the time scale of the potential damage to rice growth including the onset and withdrawal of the monsoons timing and length of dry spells and weak rainfall events in using the present results for policy making this study raises the importance of improving the projection ability of climate which includes the improvement of gcms themselves and of methods for their evaluation selection and bias correction the appropriate methods may differ depending on the objectives for example those for assessing the impact on agriculture may differ from those for assessing flood risk the examination and establishment of appropriate methods for targeting the assessment of vegetation crop growth are greatly needed in addition to the continuous improvement of the predictability of atmospheric fields by global and regional climate models for reliable future projections in addition to model development access to local data on related variables and human related activities such as land use distribution and agricultural management crop calendar application of irrigation fertilizer pesticide application and so on are essential for the calibration validation and bias correction of the models such hydrometeorological and agricultural data especially those in long term periods in turn will contribute to future projection accuracy and to promoting the socioeconomic development of the country and thus will be highly

24503,the effects of climate change on agriculture are a major concern for global food security in this study the impacts of climate change on rainfed rice production in the granary of cambodia were examined on a basin scale by developing and applying a combined model consisting of a crop model and a basin scale distributed hydrological model the response of rice production to soil water availability was simulated for past 1981 2000 and future 2041 2060 2081 2100 periods from 34 general circulation models gcms that participated in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 5 gcms were selected by evaluating monthly rainfall in the past although annual rainfall was projected to increase by all five selected gcms notable decreases in rainfed rice production were projected with 3 gcms while small changes were projected with the other 2 gcms the main factor restricting future rice production was soil water availability brought by the projected change in the seasonal distribution of rainfall and the projected more severe dry spells in the early monsoon season the results suggest the importance of the selection and bias correction of gcms to force rice crop models and of the simulation of soil water flow on a basin scale for the assessment of rain fed rice production in particular improvements in projections of rainfall amounts over shorter periods rather than annual or seasonal periods which fit within the time scales of rice plant growth were suggested to be important keywords climate change impact assessment soil moisture crop model rice

multidecadal global warming since the 1950s is unequivocal ipcc 2014 the sixth assessment report ar6 is currently under preparation to be released between 2021 and 2022 and public concern about the impact of climate change is arising climate change has severely affected many agricultural regions and is one of the major concerns for global food security as it restricts stable crop production mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture are considered more serious in tropical developing countries because frequent heat stress and drought are combined with low levels of technological development li et al 2017 cambodia is a developing country located in the lower mekong river basin on the indochina peninsula it relies heavily on agriculture for its economic development more than half of the total workforce is engaged in agriculture and agriculture contributed approximately 32 of the national gross domestic product gdp as of 2011 national climatic change committe 2013 irrigation rates remain low at approximately 12 of the cropland mekong river commission 2018 and most crops are rainfed accordingly a change in rainfall under climate change is a great threat to agricultural management crop production and socioeconomic activity in cambodia with increasing demand for agricultural products from the lower mekong river basin sustaining and improving rice production under climate change is key for the development of the country a quantitative impact assessment of climate change on rice production is essential for informing policies on adaptation strategies including investment in irrigation facilities and other agricultural infrastructure given the increasing socioeconomic need in cambodia for agricultural management under climate change this study carries out an impact assessment on rainfed paddy rice production in cambodia among various climatic factors rainfall temperature solar radiation and co2 concentration are the most important climate factors affecting crop productivity li et al 2017 there are many studies dealing with the effects of increasing co2 and they show clear evidence that when interactions with other climate variables are ignored more co2 leads to higher crop yields ainsworth and long 2005 kim et al 2003 kimball et al 2002 because of enhanced photosynthesis in more realistic studies however higher air temperatures from elevated co2 levels tend to suppress the increase in yield krishnan et al 2007 for rice a rise in air temperature is generally considered to decrease yield because of the lower spikelet fertility prasad et al 2006 as well as the higher evaporative demand of the crop deb et al 2016 because of such interactions of various climatological factors the ipcc ar5 ipcc 2014 reports high variability in the projected changes in rice production under climate change recent studies on biophysical process based rice crop modeling include the applications and developments of simriw horie et al 1992 1995 oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 the ceres rice model mahmood 1998 of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 1998 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 these models are designed to simulate rice plant growth including photosynthesis respiration leaf area development dry matter accumulation phenological development and yield through simulations of the water and nitrogen balance in the soil accounting for the effects of the temperature and co2 concentration in the atmosphere crop details soil properties weather conditions and rice management practices are the main inputs to drive these models each of these models has a series of developmental varieties in their modules and has been applied to climate change impact studies by many researchers worldwide simriw rainfed selected for this study was derived from simriw to simulate rice plant growth under limited conditions for water and nitrogen homma and horie 2009 ohnishi et al 1997 the model was validated in thailand and indonesia homma and horie 2009 homma et al 2017b and its modified version for remote sensing was also validated in thailand and lao pdr maki et al 2017 raksapatcharawong et al 2020 however these abovementioned rice crop models including simriw rainfed model are developed on a point scale basis without consideration of the basin scale hydrological cycle and its associated soil water flow in the basin although water availability is the most important factor for rain fed rice production for predicting the global climate gcms are the primary tools and many studies have used gcms with rice crop models to assess the potential effects of climate change on rice production impact assessments of rice production based on multimodel ensemble projections using the gcms included in cmip5 taylor et al 2012 have been conducted in many areas in the world including iran darzi naftchali and karandish 2019 china he et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zheng et al 2020 vietnam deb et al 2016 and thailand arunrat et al 2018 boonwichai et al 2019 however uncertainty in gcm projections of soil moisture over monsoon regions is reported to be higher than that of other variables because of the diverse soil schemes and vegetation parameterizations in gcms zhang et al 2019b thus the effect of soil moisture stress can be largely dependent on the selection of the gcms to be used as inputs to the rice model the selection of the gcms and the gcm related uncertainties have not been however paid enough attention in earlier studies in applying rice models for climate change impact assessments the uncertainties in projected rice production can therefore be larger for rain fed paddies while many of the earlier studies assessing climate change impacts on crop production assumed irrigated conditions with high soil water availability the potential effects of water stress on rainfed paddies have not been well examined babel et al 2011 despite the prevalence of rainfed paddies in many developing countries and the knowledge that water stress drought is one of the main factors restricting rice production homma et al 2004 prabnakorn et al 2018 in assessing rain fed rice production the daily evolution of soil moisture in the growing season is key to assessing the water stress impact on rice growth and yield therefore precipitation radiation and air temperature need to be appropriately given from the gcms to the rice model to simulate the actual evapotranspiration in the limited condition of soil water in this regard the evaluation and selection of gcms in terms of reproducibility on a daily scale should be examined carefully while many earlier studies pay little attention to them and are mainly based on monthly reproducibility although increases in soil moisture were projected in earlier studies in the asian monsoon region for india saseendran et al 2000 and the yangtze river basin in china sun et al 2019 our hypothesis is that the drought effect on rain fed rice production can be highly affected by the finer time scale distributions of rainfall and soil moisture and thus drought can be more severe even under the increased rainfall amount over a time period from several months to a year for reliable projections of soil moisture and rainfed rice production it is considered more effective to simulate the soil water flow with vegetation effects at higher spatiotemporal resolution instead of directly using the gcm outputs in this study we thus developed and applied a combined hydrologic and crop rice model which is named mizuha to concurrently simulate horizontal and vertical soil water flows based on the basin scale hydrologic cycle and the growth and yield of rice in response to root zone soil moisture by developing the research methodology framework to select the best gcms to be used for rain fed rice production assessment and to use the combined hydrologic rice growth model we quantified the gcm related uncertainty in assessing the impact of climate change on rain fed rice production where soil moisture plays a key role with this study we aim to provide suggestions to the scientific community for future improvement of the gcm from the viewpoint of simulating rain fed rice production and to provide information for local policy makers in cambodia for climate change adaptation 2 materials and methods in this study rain fed rice production in cambodia under future climates was assessed the overall procedure and the scientific questions to be solved in this study are conceptually described in fig 1 this study is unique in that future rice production is assessed not on a point scale but on a basin scale by combining hydrologic and rice growth models to improve the simulation accuracy of soil moisture and soil water stress to rice growth under nonirrigated conditions in addition it is notable that the selection and bias correction methods of the gcms have been deeply examined to be properly given to the rice growth model in the context of obtaining climatic variables with their time series that affect rice growth the detailed procedures are shown in the following sections 2 1 study area the pursat river basin in western cambodia fig 2 a and b was selected as the study area its watershed area is approximately 6760 km2 and it runs from southwest to northeast to flow into tonle sap lake based on the elevation data from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster nasa 2020 nine main subbasins were defined by the pfafstetter algorithm yang et al 2002 as indicated in fig 2b with odd subbasin numbers 1 3 5 7 9 along the main stream and even numbers 2 4 6 8 for tributaries the land use distribution fig 2c was obtained from the u s geological survey global data global land cover characterization version 1 2 usgs 2020a and all the cropland in the middle to lower basin 1396 km2 was assumed to be paddy since the authors observed the prevalence of paddy fields through the middle to lower basin with other crop types distributed mainly in the upper basin another correspondence table for the original usgs categorization and the model application in this study is shown in table s1 of the supplementary material the soil types and their properties including the van genuchten parameters are given by the food and agriculture organization fao 2007 fig 2d and table 1 2 2 rice growth model simriw rainfed the simulation model for rice weather relations simriw rainfed homma and horie 2009 was applied in this study to simulate the growth and yield of rice plants simriw rainfed is based on simriw horie et al 1992 1995 with additional components to include water stress effects on rice plants phenological development is based on simriw horie et al 1992 1995 and is described with the developmental index dvi for which its value is defined as 0 for seeding emergence 1 for heading and 2 for maturity the dvi is calculated as the integration of the daily developmental rate dvr 1 d v i d v r the leaf area index lai l a i aboveground dry matter d m and grain yield y i e l d are represented as 2 l a i f 1 r e r m a x r d r t a i r δ n u p w s d v i 3 d m f 2 r c e s d t a i r l a i δ n u p w s 4 y i e l d f 3 d m h i n u p w s d v i where rer max is the maximum relative expansion rate of lai r d r is the relative leaf death rate r c e is the radiation conversion efficiency and h i is the harvest index t a i r and s d are air temperature and solar radiation respectively and are given through the hydrological submodel web dhm to simriw rainfed in the model n u p and w s are plant nitrogen uptake and water stress respectively and are given with the following equations 5 δ n p o o l f 4 t a i r s m c f e r t i l i z e r n u p 6 δ n u p f 5 n p o o l w s d v i 7 w s d v i 0 f 6 s w c where n p o o l is the available nitrogen in the soil f e r t i l i z e r is the fertilizer application amount and s w c is the root zone soil moisture which is calculated in web dhm in this study the water stress is calculated as the accumulated values from the initiation of the growth following simriw rainfed the effect of w s is considered in the calculation of d v r as well although many factors change from present to future and affect rice production we considered only meteorological factors such as rainfall through s w c t a i r and s d for the changes it was assumed that no changes would occur in other factors including co2 concentration fertilizer irrigation and rice cultivars and the same values were used in all the past and future simulations the co2 concentration was set to 370 ppm the parameters that were calibrated for rainfed rice in northeast thailand were used but the phenological development of rice cultivars and farmer management were adjusted to approximate the conditions in cambodia in 2013 2014 hirooka et al 2016 kodo et al 2021 damage by pests and diseases was not considered and only the damage brought by water stress was evaluated to highlight the hydrological restriction on rain fed rice production in this region only single cropping in the rainy season under rainfed conditions without irrigation was considered 2 3 combined hydrologic rice growth model mizuha the combined simriw rainfed model with a hydrological model was applied in this study to hourly simulate the concurrent responses of the basin scale hydrologic cycle and rice growth with consideration of soil water flow in the basin and improved soil moisture estimation for the hydrologic model the water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm wang et al 2009b was used the web dhm is based on the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 2002 and is characterized by the incorporation wang et al 2009a of the modified simple biosphere model 2 sib2 sellers et al 1996 to realize a process based description for evapotranspiration considering the water and energy fluxes from the land surface and soil water flow the combined model of web dhm and simriw rainfed is named mizuha in this study and was previously used for climate change impact assessment in cambodia with cmip3 data soso im et al 2014 and in indonesia with cmip5 data homma et al 2017a for web dhm application the target basin was divided into 500 m 500 m square grids in which soil water flow was calculated by the richards equation richards 1931 considering the soil water retention characteristics modeled by van genuchten van genuchten 1980 in paddy grids the root zone depth was set to 50 cm and vertically discretized into 5 cm sublayers in the root zone and 10 cm sublayers below the root zone for soil water flow simulation the hillslope flow and subsurface flow from the grids were integrated for each flow interval in a subbasin to obtain river discharge the root zone soil moisture calculated in web dhm was put into simriw rainfed paddy grids at each time step to simulate water stress and rice plant growth the lai expansion was simulated by simriw rainfed in response to water stress and was returned to web dhm to be used for the hydrologic simulation in the next time step in web dhm the lai is used together with the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar to simulate canopy interception transpiration and surface energy budget except for paddy grids for which the lai simulated by simriw rainfed grids is passed to web dhm the 8 day composites of lai and fpar from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis onboard the terra and aqua satellites mcd15a2h v006 product usgs 2020d are used because of the limited period 2003 present of data availability for the lai and fpar from terra aqua modis the data from 2003 and 2019 were used in all the years in the past and future runs respectively thus outside of paddy areas only the 8 day seasonal changes in lai and fpar were considered and their yearly changes in each period were not considered one of the challenges in simulating rainfed rice production is data scarcity with respect to the crop calendar because rice is rainfed the planting date is not fixed to a certain calendar date and data on basin wide planting dates are not available we thus applied a satellite data based estimation method tsujimoto et al 2021 using the 16 day enhanced vegetation index evi mod13q1 and myd13q1 v006 products usgs 2020b 2020c from modis to estimate the planting dates and used those for the rice growth simulations by mizuha this algorithm was originally developed by tsujimoto et al 2019 by using field observation data in the pursat river basin by hirooka et al 2016 since the modis evi is only available after 2000 we used the estimated results in 2016 for both the past and future simulations taking into consideration that the planting dates in 2016 are considered an average over the last 20 years tsujimoto et al 2021 2 4 past and future climate a simulation of the 20 year period from january 1981 to december 2000 was conducted to compare the results with those for future climates and to validate the model with observations and statistics the years from 1981 to 2000 are referred to as the past period in this study for future climate the outputs from the gcms contributing to cmip5 were used as a reference two projection periods the near future 2041 2060 and the far future 2081 2100 were considered in this study under the representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the meteorological data in the past and future periods were interpolated into 500 m 500 m mizuha simulation grids using the inverse distance weight idw method and linearly interpolated to hourly 2 4 1 past data the japanese 55 year reanalysis data jra 55 harada et al 2016 hou et al 2014 kobayashi et al 2015 were referenced to describe the past climate variables in the two dimensional diagnostic fields fcst surf and fcst phy2m were used as forcing data in mizuha including air temperature and specific humidity at 2 m height wind speed at 10 m height total cloud coverage downward longwave radiation downward solar radiation and surface air pressure these variables are provided at an approximately 55 km horizontal resolution and are available every three hours in each simulation grid of mizuha the air temperature was adjusted by the lapse rate based on the difference between the jra 55 level 2 m and the grid elevation for rainfall amount in the past period the observation based dataset asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward evaluation of water resources aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 was used its spatial resolution is 0 25 latitude by 0 25 longitude although the number of rain gage stations in cambodia is limited in the aphrodite dataset we compared the aphrodite data for the past period with intensive rain gage observation results from 2010 to 2015 the 20 year mean annual rainfall in 1981 2000 over the target basin was 1134 mm which was comparable to the annual totals of 1087 to 1528 mm over cambodia from 2010 to 2015 tsujimoto et al 2018 2 4 2 evaluation and selection of gcms the acquisition evaluation and bias correction of the gcms were performed using a tool for cmip5 from the data integration and analysis system dias https diasjp net kawasaki et al 2017 among the 34 cmip5 gcms we evaluated the 18 gcms for which future projection data under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were available at dias the gcms were evaluated from the viewpoint of rainfall reproductivity to be properly used for assessing rain fed rice production for each gcm the 20 year mean monthly rainfall during 1981 2000 were compared against data from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp adler et al 2003 in the same period the spatial correlation coefficient scorr and root mean square error rmse between the gcm and gpcp monthly rainfall were calculated by the following equations 8 s c o r r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 where x i and y i are the gcm and gpcp rainfall at grid i respectively and x and y are the means of the gcm and gpcp rainfall over the entire grid in the study area respectively if scorr 1 for the spatial distribution and rmse 0 for the absolute value then the spatial distribution pattern of the gcm outputs completely matches that of the gpcp to use both the scorr and rmse for gcm evaluation the simple demerit point system used in eastham et al 2008 was adopted in this study the gcm performance was deemed poor when scorr 0 6 or rmse 2 and 1 demerit point was assigned to the gcm for each of the scorr and rmse indices that indicated poor performance while eastham et al 2008 calculated the demerit points for rainy and dry seasons we calculated them for each month to examine the rainfall reproducibility at fine temporal resolution thus the maximum number of demerit points is 24 2 indices 12 months where more demerit points correspond to lower reproducibility in addition to evaluate rainfall reproducibility for both monsoonal and local rainfall we calculated demerit points over two regions the indochina peninsula and cambodia domains 1 and 2 respectively fig 2a and summed their demerit points to select the best gcms for assessing the impact of climate change on rainfed paddy rice production in this region since the calculated scorr and rmse showed a smaller difference among ensemble runs from each gcm compared with those among gcms we used only one ensemble member r1i1p1 to calculate demerit points for all of the gcms to maintain equitability regardless of the number of ensemble members of each gcm 2 4 3 bias correction of the gcm rainfall statistical bias correction was applied to the daily rainfall amounts in the selected gcms the details of this bias correction method are provided in nyunt et al 2016 in short this method addressed the three main gcm deficiencies i e underestimation of extremes high frequency of rainy days and poor seasonal simulation through a 3 step statistical bias correction here the gcm biases in the past climate were assumed to be stationary in the future climate and the same transfer function f gc m past derived from the gcm hindcast was applied to the gcm future projection 10 x gc m past f obs 1 f gc m past x gc m past 11 x gc m future f obs 1 f gc m past x gc m f u t u r e where x gc m past and x gc m future represent bias corrected gcm rainfall for past and future periods respectively and f obs is the distribution function of the observed rainfall during the past period the generalized pareto distribution function was used in eqs 10 11 to determine f gc m past and f obs to correct for extreme rainfall the frequency of rainy days was then corrected by assuming the same number of rainy days in the observation as in the gcm hindcast using a simple rank order statistic the gcm rainfall corresponding to the same rank as that of the observation was defined as a correction threshold and gcm future rainfall beyond this threshold was corrected to zero finally monthly grouped normal rainfall was adjusted to fit a gamma distribution by mapping the cumulative distribution function of daily gcm rainfall to that of the observed rainfall and corrections were made through eqs 10 11 in this study aphrodite was used as the observational data through the bias correction process rainfall from all the gcms was spatially interpolated to the same grids as the reference aphrodite which is 0 25 latitude by 0 25 longitude although the original grid resolutions were different among the gcms only rainfall was bias corrected and other meteorological variables air temperature and humidity wind speed pressure total cloud fraction solar radiation and longwave radiation at the ground surface were used without bias correction data on radiation and cloud fraction for ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 were not available at dias and thus the equivalent data from miroc5 were used for mizuha simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 3 results 3 1 model validation because of the limited availability of basin wide soil moisture data river discharge was used for model validation on the spatiotemporal distribution of the simulated soil moisture regarding river discharge as the spatially and temporally integrated result of soil moisture distribution in the basin the availability of river discharge data masumoto et al 2016 was limited to 2010 2011 and thus the model parameters were calibrated against these two years the comparison of observed and simulated river discharge is shown in fig 3 although their agreement was not perfect we adopted the calibrated parameters for the past and future simulations in this study because of the limited availability and uncertainties in both rainfall and river discharge data since rice production statistics in the target basin were not available the basin averaged simulated results were compared with the nationwide fao statistics fao 2019 for yield harvested area and total production as indicated in fig 4 a c in these figures yield fig 4a is shown as rice production fig 4c per unit harvested area fig 4b changes in the harvested area occur both from changes in the sowed planted area and from crop loss or damage over the entire sowed planted area during cultivation clearly increasing trends from the past to the present were recognized in yield and harvested area these were considered to arise because of technological developments such as increased fertilizer application improvement in rice cultivars increased irrigation and agricultural land development to distill the year to year fluctuation caused by meteorological factors we calculated the anomalies from the trend assuming a linear trend from 1981 to 2000 the anomalies in the fao statistics showed correspondence with the simulation results by mizuha especially in harvested area and total production with lower production in 1984 1987 and 1994 and higher production in 1989 1995 and 1999 fig 4d shows the scatter plot between the anomalies of production in the fao statistics and the mizuha simulation indicating that the overall characteristics of year to year fluctuation were well described by mizuha although they are not in perfect agreement in this study we used this model and these parameters for past and future simulations 3 2 past and future rainfall by the selected gcms the evaluation results of the 18 gcms from cmip5 are listed in table 2 the five gcms with the smallest demerit points were ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 miroc5 mpi esm lr and noresm1 m as shown with asterisks in table 2 as explained in the earlier section with eqs 8 9 the selected gcms with smaller demerit points have relatively high scorrs and low rmses for monthly rainfall reproducibility in the past through january to december and thus it is generally recognizable that future rainfall predictions by these gcms are more reliable than others both in their absolute values from rmses and spatial distributions from scorrs thus we adopted these 5 gcms in this study to assess rain fed rice production for this region the daily rainfall amounts from these selected gcms are shown in fig 5 along with the reference data from aphrodite to show the validation of the reproducibility of the daily basis rainfall amount by the selected gcms and the effectiveness of the bias correction applied in this study the daily rainfall amounts on all the days in each month from may to december over the 20 years were plotted as jitter plots and boxplots for the past 1981 2000 and future 2041 2060 under rcp4 5 periods overall all the selected gcms were found to overestimate past rainfall compared with aphrodite after bias correction was applied the medians and the other quartile values of the past rainfall estimates of the gcms were comparable to those of aphrodite as shown in the boxplots using the same transfer function future rainfall projections were corrected to be smaller than their original values in almost all the gcms and months these bias correction results indicate that even through selecting the better performing gcms in representing the past rainfall they tend to overestimate the future annual rainfall for this region thus they will underestimate the drought damage on rain fed rice production if they are applied without bias correction based on the bias corrected future rainfall the 20 year averaged annual total amount in 2041 2060 under rcp4 5 was 1190 mm ccsm4 1328 mm cesm1 cam5 1216 mm miroc5 1227 mm mpi esm lr and 1343 mm noresm1 m showing a slight 5 18 increase compared with the past period 1134 mm in aphrodite thus it is very likely that annual rainfall in cambodia will increase in the future from the viewpoint of agricultural water resources however not only annual total but also its seasonal distribution is important fig 6 shows the bias corrected future monthly rainfall compared with the past data in aphrodite shown as the areally averaged values for each subbasin subbasin 9 for the upper stream and 1 for the lower stream as their locations are shown in fig 2b in fig 6 the rainy season in the past was approximately may october with rainfall peaking in september october in the future the rainfall peak was projected to be earlier in ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 shifting to august september with less rainfall in october in mpi esm lr two rainfall peaks in may june and september were projected in miroc5 the rainfall peak was projected to be later with increased rainfall in september october and less rainfall in the early rainy season in june july the rainfall amount was larger in the upper subbasins 7 9 than in the lower subbasins 1 5 in the past and the difference between the upper and lower subbasins tended to become more pronounced in the future in all the gcms especially in the months with abundant rainfall the future rainfall tendency was recognized to be common regardless of the future periods and rcp scenarios see fig s1 in the supplementary material 3 3 rice production 3 3 1 projected change in rice production the effects on rice production appeared as both damaged areas and yield losses fig 7 shows simulated rice yield under the past and future 2041 2060 climates indicated with the percentages of the damaged planted but not harvested areas see fig s2 in supplementary material for 2081 2100 the future simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 showed little change in yield regardless of the periods and rcp scenarios whereas the results with miroc5 and noresm1 m showed remarkable decreases in future yield compared with the past run with aphrodite especially in the simulation with miroc5 for 2041 2060 under the rcp4 5 scenario frequent occurrences of low yield at less than 250 t ha 1 were projected in simulations with noresm1 m not only the median but also the maximum yields were projected to decrease under all three rcp scenarios in the near and far future periods with little difference among scenarios periods the differences among scenarios periods were larger in miroc5 and mpi esm lr than in the other models and these two models showed larger year to year and location to location fluctuations indicated by longer boxplots the totally damaged area was 11 3 in the past run and the ratio was similar or even smaller in the future runs with ccsm4 9 9 10 8 cesm1 cam5 9 7 10 5 and noresm1 m 9 9 10 6 regardless of the periods or rcp scenarios however in future runs with miroc5 13 0 18 7 and mpi esm lr 14 5 16 3 increases in the totally damaged area were projected 3 3 2 affecting factors on rain fed rice production under the given conditions in this study i e nonirrigated rainfed paddies with constant co2 concentrations and fertilizer application rates fixed rice cultivars and without consideration of pests and diseases water stress to rice plants is the most important potential factor for lower rice production fig 8 shows the root zone soil moisture in the rice growing season in the results from miroc5 in which simulated rice production was lower than that of the other gcms soil moisture was comparable to that of the past and future simulations with the other gcms at the beginning may and end october of the rainy season but it was lower in the early rainy season in june and july in addition the soil moisture variability was larger in july and august with the frequent occurrence of distinctively low soil moisture such dry spells just after the beginning of the rainy season in july are often observed in cambodia causing serious damage to agriculture more severe dry spells were projected in miroc5 than in the other gcms during the early rainy season over this region similarly in the simulations with mpi esm lr which showed high variability in rice production as with miroc5 in fig 7 large fluctuations in soil water availability throughout the rainy season under future climates are projected on the other hand in the simulated results from ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 in which simulated rice production was larger than that of the other gcms the median simulated soil moisture was higher than that of the past with relatively small variability in all rainy season months the simulation results with noresm1 m are unique in that it showed lower production than that of the other gcms fig 7 while its soil moisture was similar to that of the high yield simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 fig 8 this suggests the existence of other factors affecting rice production under climate change fig 9 shows the other meteorological forcing data used to run mizuha for the past and future periods fig 9 reveals that noresm1 m projected less shortwave radiation and a higher cloud fraction during the rainy season from may to november than those of the other gcms and jra 55 thus the air temperature was lower in noresm1 m than in the other gcms and even in the past reanalysis of jra 55 even though the projections with climate change are under increased radiative forcing the projected low solar radiation and air temperature are considered to be the reasons why rice production was consistently lower in simulations by mizuha with noresm1 m than the other gcms this result highlights the importance of the solar radiation amount during the rainy season or the relationship between rainfall and solar radiation this relationship is closely linked with the diurnal cycle of rainfall or convective activity because if rainfall and cloud coverage are concentrated at night the amount of daily solar radiation does not decrease even on rainy days in earlier studies the diurnal and seasonal distributions of solar radiation in cambodia were observed to be as strong in the rainy season as in the dry season because of the predominantly evening rainfall tsujimoto et al 2008 2018 and convective activity from midnight to early morning over tonle sap lake and its lakeshore tsujimoto et al 2018 as tsujimoto et al 2008 pointed out the diurnal cycle of rainfall and the amount of solar radiation on rainy days differ across regions and seasons and thus it is important to take them into consideration when assessing the factors affecting agricultural production in the region this study suggests the importance of considering the reproducibility of the diurnal cycle of rainfall convective activity and solar radiation to assess the impact of climate change on crop production which depends on solar radiation air temperature and rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 future projection of rice production in cambodia the assessment of climate change impacts in data scarce regions was one of the major challenges in this study especially in conducting assessments not only at the field scale but also at the basin scale considering the basin hydrological cycle and spatial distribution of rainfall and soil moisture within a basin although uncertainty remains the following five points are suggested from this study first excluding noresm1 m two out of four gcms ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 showed little change in future rice production compared with that of the past in terms of the median and other quartile values from basin wide statistics over 20 years however the year to year and location to location fluctuations shown as the width of the jitter plots in the future are much larger than those in the past even in the simulations with ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 this suggests higher spatiotemporal variability in rice production in the basin which can be a great threat to individual farmers even though rice production on a basin scale may not be significantly impacted under such conditions a framework to share or allocate potential risks and resources within the basin may be an effective long term risk management strategy second considering that one of the selected gcms miroc5 suggested the potential intensification of dry spells in the early rainy season preparation for supplementary irrigation in this season or a shifting of the crop calendar may be options as adaptation strategies third since most of the selected gcms showed an increase in the regional difference in rainfall between the upper and lower basins in the pursat river basin with more rainfall in the upper basin and less rainfall in the lower basin where most of the paddies are located the effective storage of excess rainfall from the upper basin using reservoirs along with irrigation facilities in downstream paddy fields can also be an option fourth differences among the future periods either the near future in 2041 2060 or far future in 2081 2100 and rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 were not significant in the simulations with ccsm4 cesm1 cam5 and noresm1 m whereas they were large in miroc5 and mpi esm lr from this study it is difficult to conclude whether the impact on rice production changes with time or with rcp rather further investigation of the rainfall pattern that affects rainfed paddy rice production should be taken to improve the methods for climate change impact assessment of rice production including the improvement selection and bias correction of gcms finally although this study neglected the effects of increasing co2 concentrations rice yield has been reported to increase with more co2 in addition the effects of the changes in co2 as well as soil moisture solar radiation and air temperature differ among different rice cultivars changes in the application rate of fertilizer and irrigation clearly affect rice production but the extent of their effects also depends on the cultivar iwahashi et al 2021 kodo et al 2021 moreover as such changes in agronomic management shifts in the crop calendar especially on planting dates are known to affect rice production even under the same meteorological conditions hirooka et al 2016 using the present study as a base scenario effective adaptation strategies that also consider other effects such as cultivars co2 concentration fertilizer irrigation and crop calendar should be examined 4 2 quantification of the gcm related uncertainties and suggestions from the viewpoint of gcm application to rain fed rice production simulations in an earlier study that examined changes in soil moisture under climate change saseendran et al 2000 assessed the tropical humid climate in india and suggested that increased rainfall will increase soil moisture and thus increase rice production similarly sun et al 2019 projected future agricultural drought in the yangtze river basin in china under climate change and suggested an increase in soil moisture however these studies examined changes in rainfall and soil moisture on an annual or monthly basis without considering finer temporal scale distributions or the duration of dry spells our study showed the importance of analysis with a higher temporal resolution than annual or monthly to assess the impact of soil moisture on rice production as dry spells lasting less than 1 month can severely affect rice growth and thus monthly or annually based evaluation can underestimate the drought damage to rice production this is especially the case for cambodia where the annual rainfall is projected to increase to properly take into consideration the effect of soil moisture deficiency on rain fed rice production the methodologies for the selection and bias correction of the gcms as well as for downscaling simulation of the soil water flow in the basin are the key to improving the accuracy of future projections these are the keys of this study in a similar study over the lower mekong river basin ruan et al 2018 ranked the 34 gcms in cmip5 according to their rainfall reproducibility against the aphrodite data using rmse scorr and six other statistical indices mpi esm lr was selected as the best model followed by ipsl cm5a mr when the gcms were evaluated by their rainy season may october dry season november april and annual total rainfall accumulations the scores for ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 were also high with better scores for the dry season in ccsm4 and for the rainy season in cesm1 cam5 the other two gcms selected in our study noresm1 m and miroc5 were ranked 12th and 20th respectively however in evaluating rainfall reproducibility over the mekong river basin at monsoon onset with the gpcp and other data hasson et al 2016 found a better performance in ccsm4 miroc5 and noresm1 m than in cesm1 cam5 and mpi esm lr comparing the results of our study with these earlier studies we can see that the evaluation of gcms is highly dependent on the evaluation periods and metrics this suggests the importance of examining the appropriate time span when evaluating gcms for assessing impacts on rice production considering the potential time span that is critical for rainfed rice a shorter period rather than annual or seasonal periods will be more effective for evaluating rainfall reproducibility in this regard the gcms that were selected in this study based on monthly rainfall were considered more suitable than those selected in earlier studies for assessing the impact of climate change on rainfed rice production the predictability of dry spells during monsoonal rainfall was suggested to be important because farmers generally start planting rainfed paddies in accordance with the onset of the rainy season since rainfall or soil water availability during the early growing season is important for successful rice growth the predictability of dry spells greatly affects the accuracy of rainfed paddy rice production estimates although the escalating number of dry spells in the early monsoon season was projected only by miroc5 and not by the other four gcms hasson et al 2016 found that miroc5 had a better performance in reproducing rainfall at the monsoon onset this suggests that detailed examination of the reproducibility and future projection of rainfall at monsoon onset and of dry spells is required in addition this study indicates the potential overestimation of daily rainfall amount by the gcms throughout the rainy season for this region even for the selected gcms and suggests the importance of bias correction in addition to the selection of the gcms however the bias correction method also needs to be examined further in the bias correction method used in this study gcm biases were considered to be stationary from the past to the future and the same transfer function was applied for the gcm hindcasts and predictions the weak rainfall features in gcms that were under a determined threshold value derived from the hindcast were then removed completely as a result in the bias corrected gcm outputs weak rainfall was artificially removed in some months and models this is apparent in fig 5 for march and april in noresm1 m for june in miroc5 from july through november in ccsm4 and for october november in cesm1 cam5 however because even weak rainfall can have an important effect on the wetness of the root zone soil accurate bias correction of rainfall to reproduce root zone soil wetness is necessary when using gcms to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture the removal of weak rainfall in miroc5 in june is considered one reason for the decreased soil moisture in june and lowered rice production in the mizuha simulations with miroc5 although this study directly applies the bias correction method by nyunt et al 2016 the bias correction method itself should be further examined depending on the objectives to use future rainfall data and for assessing rain fed rice production the bias correction method for weak rainfall events should be improved finally the reproducibility of solar radiation in connection with the diurnal cycle of rainfall was also shown to be important for noresm1 m although atmospheric processes are calculated at a finer time resolution than daily for the application of gcm outputs to climate change impact assessments of agriculture and other socioeconomic sectors often only daily or monthly data are used and gcm evaluation is also conducted at these time scales this study showed the importance of evaluating gcm rainfall with its diurnal cycle to select gcms that have higher reproducibility not only for rainfall but also for radiation and air temperature which are the three important limiting factors for crop production the simulated results with noresm1 m in this study were thus not considered reliable because of the observed relationship between rainfall and solar radiation however changes in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and its effect on solar radiation on rainy days may also change in the future this aspect should be monitored when assessing the agricultural impacts of climate change 5 conclusions through the evaluation and bias correction of the gcms that participated in cmip5 all five selected gcms showed future increases in annual rainfall in this region under all three rcp scenarios despite the commonly projected increase in rainfall on an annual basis the projected effect on rain fed rice production differed depending on the gcms to force the rice model and three out of five selected gcms resulted in a projected decrease in rice production the major cause was revealed to be the changes in the seasonal distribution of rainfall and it was different among the five gcms the rainfall peak was projected to shift earlier in ccsm4 and cesm1 cam5 to august september with less rainfall in october two rainfall peaks in may june and september were projected in mpi esm lr and in miroc5 the rainfall peak was projected to shift later with increased rainfall in september october and less rainfall in june july the simulated lower yield with noresm1 m was attributable to the projected lower solar radiation which was considered erroneous based on the observed solar radiation for simulations with miroc5 and mpi esm lr high variability in lower than average root zone soil moisture was considered the main factor restricting rice production in miroc5 dry spells in the early monsoon season were projected to be more severe than those in the other gcms these results suggest the importance of the ability of gcms to project the diurnal cycle of rainfall or solar radiation on rainy days they also show the importance of using accumulated rainfall amount in shorter periods than annual or seasonal in the time scale of the potential damage to rice growth including the onset and withdrawal of the monsoons timing and length of dry spells and weak rainfall events in using the present results for policy making this study raises the importance of improving the projection ability of climate which includes the improvement of gcms themselves and of methods for their evaluation selection and bias correction the appropriate methods may differ depending on the objectives for example those for assessing the impact on agriculture may differ from those for assessing flood risk the examination and establishment of appropriate methods for targeting the assessment of vegetation crop growth are greatly needed in addition to the continuous improvement of the predictability of atmospheric fields by global and regional climate models for reliable future projections in addition to model development access to local data on related variables and human related activities such as land use distribution and agricultural management crop calendar application of irrigation fertilizer pesticide application and so on are essential for the calibration validation and bias correction of the models such hydrometeorological and agricultural data especially those in long term periods in turn will contribute to future projection accuracy and to promoting the socioeconomic development of the country and thus will be highly

24504,research on biological responses to water quality monitoring and toxicity prediction has increased in recognition in recent years a great deal of biological response data has been produced through online monitoring systems however comprehensive information on biological response is missing consequently biological responses cannot be used to monitor water quality we can resolve this problem through mathematical models we used the persistent model on behavioral strength data and derived a mathematic model the threshold points for safe acclimatization adjustment and toxicity stages were calculated precisely we obtained normal bn and persistence bp responses on behavior data when the environmental conditions of fish changed transfer of behavior strength from safe mode ms to acclimatization mode mac and mac to adjustment stage maj resulted rapidly this indicates that fish sensed the environment changes serials of maj stages were also visualized hence we determined upwards and downwards trends for each maj the toxicity stage mt has occurred after the extended maj stage indicating that the toxic effect of the stressors overwhelmed the adaptive capability of the fish we derived the threshold point for each stage precisely on the fish behavior strength dataset thus the proposed mathematical model is an efficient model for determining the behavioral changes when toxicants enter an organism s body although the proposed mathematical model is derived using specific factors such as fishes pollutants and concentrations it can be applicable for other biological models based on the normal and persistent responses for toxicity prediction this study strengthens the available alternative environmental monitoring techniques towards water quality monitoring

body homeostasis sun et al 2016 brijs et al 2019 golla et al 2020 park et al 2020 nonnis et al 2021 in this situation the primary response that we can observe from them is behavioral change behavior is the response of an organism to its internal or external environmental stimuli behavioral change is the abnormalities that occur on an organism s regular action under undesirable environmental internal or external conditions behavioral changes are primarily associated with stress internally or externally and biochemical alterations generally organisms maintain behavioral homeostasis responding to emergencies response coping with resistance and exhaustion under environmental stress a series of behavioral changes can occur to sustain body homeostasis under stress among the different behavioral activities swimming activity is the fish s natural behavior which may reveal the relationship between the body s physical condition and environmental stress under unescapable closed environmental conditions organisms exhibit different swimming behavior to stressors and we can determine different modes thresholds stepwise behavior response model sbrm such as no effect acclimation adjustments and toxic effect on fish swimming behavior sbrm can reveal fish s responses normal activity hyperactivity or hypoactivity to their current environment in response to changes in the environment fish are actively swimming hyperactivity this stage indicates a stimulation state under normal conditions fish swim against the water flow however under stressful conditions stimulation state their footprint can reach in all directions stimulation state indicates the avoidance behavior of fish no toxic effects are likely to occur during the stimulation state if the environmental conditions change critically the fish would slow down and settle on the bottom to cope with the stress this phase signifies the acclimation state of the fish concurrently the adjustment of swimming activity may indicate the alarm situation threshold 1 on the fish when behavioral responses reach an acclimation state a different state may occur 1 if the stress overwhelms the adaptive capacity of the fish the toxic effect may occur during this situation fish cease swimming fish footprints may be static or occasional death may happen 2 if coping capacity overwhelms stress fish step to adjustment state this stage might result for certain periods based on the toxicity of stress depending on the improvement of coping capacity to a stressor a series of adjustments or readjustments threshold 2 3 4 n may occur during threshold 2 and above state fish prefer to swim slowly and sometimes for short periods the footprint may be mobile at the bottom ren et al 2016 thus the swimming behavior of fish can be an ideal parameter for assessing biological and environmental stress it is not easy labor intensive expensive time consuming and so on to assess the swimming behavior of fish by traditional methods this issue accelerated research hunt for new and efficient real time swimming behavior monitoring methods appreciatively the recent development of engineering technologies quantifies the real time behavior activity of organisms including fish under different environmental conditions in recent years different types of computer based real time fish behavior monitoring methods have been developed poopal et al 2020 hu et al 2021 bownik and wlodkowic 2021 based on published literature we can understand that much data is generated using online monitoring systems oms but the information is limited moreover the limitations difficulty in managing dataset time consuming and so on in traditionally based water quality monitoring statistics delayed the decision making process these limitations paved the way for artificial intelligence models develop more effective algorithms and underlying theories for machine learning appreciably the development in engineering technologies particularly in data analysis help us to determine the in depth variations on real time datasets shamshirband et al 2019 hu et al 2021 to better understand the functioning of biological

environmentalists developed different types of artificial intelligence models artificial neural networks fuzzy based support vector machine complementary models nature inspired and others these artificial neural networks learning capability is higher for real time data tiyasha et al 2020 noteworthy artificial neural networks function on the raw datasets efficiently it can extract higher level features intricate structures concerning real time datasets by employing multiple hidden processing layers between the input and output layers we can quantify the uncertainty hidden information on real time datasets through different techniques for example pre processing techniques the fuzzy clustering method the wavelet transform and the bias correction method and post processing techniques the multiple linear regression the kalman filtering the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation the bayesian model average and the bayesian uncertainty processor researchers routinely used these methods for water quality prediction zhou 2020 the kalman filter is an ideal probabilistic post processing technique for real time monitoring studies it is a recursive state estimator hence it can reduce prediction uncertainty it provides a theoretical post processing framework the kalman filter is classified as the linear kalman filter and the non linear kalman filter we can identify the linear error estimation by linear kalman filter and quantify the non linear error estimation by non linear kalman filter zhou et al 2020 noteworthy machine learning methods are an emerging field in rapidly improving the analyses of complex datasets with minimal errors additionally the artificial neural network tends to recognize linear or non linear relationships at minimal data inputs and without a prior understanding of the underlying mechanism it can recognize complex patterns in a dataset zhou et al 2020 self organized map som or kohonen map is a computational method that provides a complete result of data compression in visual patterns park and chon 2015 yang et al 2020 clark et al 2020 time series directed acyclic graphs are efficiently managed using recursive som recsom the

online datasets a forthright visual summary of the system and inter component relationships voegtlin 2002 hammer et al 2004 li et al 2020 persistence is the protected phase of the cell under unfavorable conditions and the cell may return to normal states after removing the stressor from its environment balaban et al 2004 vandervelde et al 2016 greaves et al 2020 marangoni et al 2020 ross et al 2020 like balaban s 2004 theory it is possible to classify normal and persistence factors on fish behavior differences in behavioral activity stepwise behavior response model sbrm occur due to maintaining bodily homeostasis to sustain stress in fish maintaining normal swimming activity by balancing homeostasis when the fish did not experience stress can be referred to as normal responders bn we can denote differences in behavioral activity under stress conditions to maintain homeostasis as persistent bp noteworthy the coping capacity of fish to a stressor that is switching back bp to bn can be calculated based on different thresholds environmental stress e stressor concentration c and exposure duration t can influence both bn and bp the e and threshold of the test organisms ti will determine the behavioral response modes m thus we hypothesized that the trend of total behavioral strength bt and behavioral modulation normal recovery and intoxicating behavior could be determined using persistent models most of the available real time monitoring techniques focus on quantitative characterization and trend analysis of the dose effect relationship park et al 2005 perez escudero et al 2014 kim et al 2015 wu et al 2015 xia et al 2016 which did not consider the biological survival adaptability and tolerance ability based on homeostatic regulation moreover studies on exposure time t concentration d and behavioral capacity b to relate behavioral responses to environmental stress on organisms are lacking ren et al 2016 yin et al 2016 we believe that these factors t d b are significant in analysing dynamic behavior response modes and real time responses of organisms under environmental stress s we aimed to study the t d and b relationship using swimming strength of eco toxicological models daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish under different concentrations of pesticides as per our previous study ren et al 2016 different m such as safe mode ms acclimation mode mac adjustment mode maj and toxic effect mt can differentiate significantly each stage has its eigenvalue fitting slope of each stage and this value especially the adjustment stage only relates to the concentration of environmental stress once the relationship between concentration and eigenvalue is standardized the method will help determine the new situation of the organism under the same environmental pressure research lacuna on in depth analysis of different behavioral response modes is a barrier to using an online monitoring system in water quality assessment this issue can be solved by piece wise function analysis as a result the threshold switch mac for the stepwise behavioral responses can be determined this study adopted a theory of persistence p based on a bacterial model balaban et al 2004 on online biomonitoring study datasets we believe that the organisms daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish survival adaptability and tolerance on the resistance to s can be determined by p to achieve that we studied the switch function of the environmental stress threshold sth to different behavior modes bm using p then we constructed the sth bm switch model based on variables t and d after normalized time dose response analysis further we used recsom to validate the results 2 experimental details 2 1 analysis of swimming behavior of aquatic organisms using oms for determination of sbrm we purchased pesticides malathion parathion trichlorfon arprocarb carbofuran methomyl and oxamyl from the china standard sample center technical purity more than 95 we prepared a new stock solution for each chemical test dimethyl sulfoxide was used as a cosolvent for stock preparation and the final concentration of the cosolvent did not exceed 0 5 in all pesticide treated groups we collected healthy fishes daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish from the fish breeding laboratory in the institute of environment and ecology at shandong normal university jinan china fish species were maintained individually in a glass aquarium with a flow through water system under fourteen light and ten dark hours we held a temperature of 26 5 1 5 ºc a water hardness of 250 20 mg l and a ph 7 8 0 03 of the water in the rearing system throughout the study periods fish were fed commercial feed twice a day morning and evening we collected daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish from their respective rearing system and stocked them in a separate tank we maintained them similar to the rearing system feeding was withheld 24 h before the commencement of the study no mortality has occurred during study periods we developed an online behavior monitoring system oms in our laboratory to quantify the behavior responses of fish ren et al 2021 zebrafish 3 fish from the stock was introduced into the fish chamber of the oms a water tank connected to the inlet of the fish chamber functions as an oms water source we added no test chemicals to the control group we chose lc50 48 value of each test chemicals as 1 tu please see suppl table docx different concentrations 0 1 1 5 10 tu of test chemicals pesticides were introduced in their respective water tanks for the toxicity test groups we control the water flow at 30 ml minute with a peristaltic pump in parallel three replicates were also maintained with similar setups the study was conducted for 48 h test chemical concentration we held identical experimental designs for daphnia magna fathead minnow and japanese medaka 2 2 parameters related to sbrm we analyzed the threshold switch of sbrm precisely using a piece wise function f b m ms mac re maj mt this model is vital to complete the sth bm to understand and to resolve the scientific issues related to the sth bm on water quality monitoring model we examined the following steps dynamic behavioral response process of fish the linear function normalization analysis of the relationship between bm bn normal behavior and bp persistence behavior and t and d influencing s were combined we determined the range of different parameters of the sth bm switch model we classified the following modes after obtaining the fitting result mode 1 if the intensity of base value ranges between 0 7 0 9 it is considered constant and signifies ms states mode 2 if the intensity sharply declines it must be a drop of more than 20 it represents mac states mode 3 if the intensity is below 0 2 and constantly fluctuates by 10 it denotes maj states to indicate the process of adjustment adaptation and readjustment mode 4 if the intensity is below 0 2 for a more extended period it represents mt states 2 3 persistence model 2 3 1 dynamic balance of behavior responses the dynamic changes of normal and persistence factors under environmental stress s can determine the switching conditions of each mode sth bm under normal environmental conditions water quality remains unchanged with the result that fish behavior may not change and bn normal behavior is the dominant mode under conditions of environmental change water quality begins to decline thus changes in behavior were observed with the fish this situation may trigger behavior mode from bn to bp once the behavior mode reaches the switch the fish will begin its resisting ability thus the change from bn to bp could occur after a certain period fish might cope with the environmental stress as a result a balance may occur between the behavior bp and bn and the external environment after sensing the environmental stress fish may experience excitement stimulation behavior where the dominant mode is bn normal behavior the termination of these states is the first environmental stress threshold sth after experiencing the first sth the speed of conversion from bn to bp gradually increases fish adapt to the increasing current environmental stress as a result the intensity of the behavior drops sharply and switches from mode ms safe to mac acclimation under continuous environmental stress s the conversion ratio of behavior response of bn bp gradually increases fish adapt to the increasing current environmental stress this situation results in ascending phase in maj adjustment mode after a period of adaptations the conversion ratio of behavior response from bn to bp may be declined to the increasing current environmental stress this situation is the decline phase in maj adjustment mode after switching to multiple environmental stress threshold sth the behavior patterns also show maj adjustment mode until fish attain mt toxic effect mode at this stage maj the dynamic balance of bn and bp might be affected completely due to the continuous environmental stress once the dynamic balance is affected there are no possibilities of transferring from mode bp to bn therefore the behavior intensity could be relatively low and maintain a straight line thus we analyzed the competition between bn normal behavior and bp persistent behavior in different behavior response patterns and the influence of behavior response ability of fish to achieve the biological significance of bn normal behavior and bp persistent behavior in maj adjustment mode 2 4 construction of the switch model based on the relationship between sth and sm we developed a mathematical model to determine the dynamic balance between bn normal behavior and bp persistent behavior to distinguish the relationship between fish behavior response and environmental factors pollutant type concentration d and exposure periods t based on the unified scale of t at normalized d and b piecewise function combined with the fish behavior response pattern eq 1 the dynamic equilibrium between bp and bn which is the switching effect of sth and bm help in the determination of the switching mode sth bm on different t and d constructed 1 f b m m s s t h 1 m a c s t h 2 r e m a j s t h i 2 i 1 2 3 n m t s t h n 3 i refers to the number of persistent behaviours adjustment and re adjustment processed in maj adjustment mode n is the last section of the adjustment mode 2 d n d t a n b p μ n n d p d t a n b p μ p p normal n and persistent p are two modes that might be observed in the behavioral responses of an organism p persistent is the result of disturbances in n normal responder during environmental stress typically the growth mortality rate is dependent upon the type of environmental stress hence growth death are a constant variable µ consequently it s used to characterize conversion efficiency µn n p and µp p n the constant conversion rate a n p and b p n signifies the conversion percentage of the modes the precise balance between p and n enables changes in response mode and steady state to be made on a bacterial model proposed by balaban et al 2004 with reference to eq 2 assume that the b behavioral strength of the fish consists only of bp and bn eq 3 that the value decreases and that there is no separate µ constant the reduction was determined by the λ conversion constant of bp and bn under the influence of s the dynamic balance between bp and bn on the homeostasis of the behavior determines the bm behavioral response mode 3 b b n b p the s is the main factor that induces the dynamic equilibrium of the behavior eq 4 under the influence of s the behavioral adherence to bp and bn calculated and the dynamic balance of the behavioral response realized eq 4 4 d b n d l n s λ n b n λ p μ p b p d b p d l n s λ p b p λ n μ n b n where λ is the conversion constant µ is the behavior compensation coefficient δs is the change in fish behavior in response to environmental stress s in dynamic equilibrium the dynamic balance between bp and bn under the influence of s could determine the mode of behavioral response and the relationship between the dynamic balance of bp and bn and the environmental stress threshold sth plays an important role in changing the behavioral response mode bm the eq 1 and 4 on behavior response of fish combined and analyzed the effect of t exposure periods c concentration on b to find the relationship in different behavior response patterns we determined the variation range of constants a b λ in dynamic behavior balance related to changes in sth then the sth bm switch model was done 2 5 data analysis and model verification 2 5 1 normalized dose effect analysis we conducted a unified analysis for environmental stress s and behavior strength b to different stressors and concentrations c and exposure periods t to complete the switch model of environmental stress threshold sth on behavior response mode bm to execute that primarily we obtained the positions of different bm patterns and the relationship between different patterns and the biological significance to determine the normalized dose effect the relationship curve of b under s combined with t and d was studied on the sbrm and the behavior dynamics normal behavior bn and adherence behavior bp behavioral dynamics bn and bp may be influenced by known factors type of stressor pi d and t and unknown factors other physical and chemical parameters of the environment sf 5 s e d t f p i s f where e is exponent t is unit of time to express the exposure duration and d is sublethal dose or lowest value of non observed effect concentration noec of published work pi is the impact caused by stressor conjunction with the present study and sf is parameters that influence water quality temperature turbidity hardness ph and other parameters of water to simplify the analysis we considered both f pi and sf as 0 we adopted a persistence model on fish behavior response n as bn to signify normal behavior and p as bp to specify responses to environmental stress eq 4 this model could clarify the constant range of each parameter the challenging task is determining conversion efficiency µn and µp using a simple mathematical equation fitting optimization is a better option thus multinomial fitting or time series analysis is used for each constant switch model sth bm for multi level optimization training to combine the different behavior response modes and optimize the numerical range of model constants to complete the bm switch model of environmental stress threshold sth to fish behavior response mode unified analysis of the environmental stress s and fish behavior response ability b caused by different pollutant types and concentrations d and exposure periods t are essential with eq 4 every 6 min as a unit for exposure period t and fish behavior ability b average value were analyzed to achieve a unified analysis of the impact of t and then were combined with the calculation of 30 days of exposure to normalize the analysis of the pesticide concentration d we used the ratio of mass concentration of different pollutants dp to cause 48 h lc50 on fish as the toxicity unit tu the 48 h lc50 is considered as one toxic unit 1 tu eq 6 6 d d ρ i l c 50 48 i the dpi is the type of pollutant lci 50 48 is a 48 h median lethal concentration of the pesticide on zebrafish the normalization analysis of zebrafish behavior response b realized by linear function transformation eq 7 7 p n t r a m n m x p min p max p the p is before and pn is after input behavior response data min p is minimum and max p is maximum values of the correlation function after normalization analysis the dose effect characteristics of related behavior changes are as follows bs mainly combined with the size of the monitoring data after ad conversion for normalization analysis bs 0 1 sp is combined with the analysis of the movement position of aquatic animals in a certain area and determined in the form of coordinates x is the abscissa 0 1 y is the ordinate 0 1 and z is the depth coordinate 0 1 the normalized sp 0 1 0 1 0 1 is determined by max p x y z and min p x y z the value of sp provides basic data for ss combined with the position change of sp the value of ss is normalized and analyzed finally combine the changes of bs 0 1 and ss 0 1 to analyze zebrafish behavior response ability b 0 1 2 5 2 mathematical modeling and the potential of tendency prediction using arima autoregressive integrated moving average model and least square method for the sth bm switch model and to improve the each stage s function and parameter determination we use a combination of empirical function and fitting for instance the ms stage is relatively flat so it is set as a constant function and the mac stage is dropping linearly so it is set as a linear function the mac stage fluctuates greatly at different time series thus the average value in each stage of maj could represent the approximate range of maj therefore maj was represented in the form of a piecewise constant function in the mt stage as the behavior strength decline sharply and finally approaches 0 based on experience and the needs of simplified fitting we choose the natural base e and the fitting results show that the function is indeed suitable for this experiment hence the following equation was derived for the switch model 8 b m m s c s s t h 1 m a c k s b s t h 2 r e m a j s t h i 2 m t e c t s s t h i 3 the threshold of each stage is determined by applying stage filter rules and determining the fitting function parameter using the least squares method the standard method fitting equation to obtain approximate keys to unknown parameters by regression analysis the least squares calculation calculates the residual of each fitted value and the observed value thus finds the parameter that minimizes the sum of squared residuals of each equation 2 5 3 software verification on persisters model we used kalman filtering on the oms dataset to smooth the curves we edited the search algorithm to find the specific threshold points modes based on each mode once we determined the range of each mode we fit the empirical function in the sth sm model after achieving all the threshold points in the adjustment mode we determined the relationship between the threshold points and environmental stress by analyzing the regular pattern of the threshold points appearance moreover this method could be applied to determine the water quality stability in the real time water quality monitoring to consider quantified data of the past six hours as a reference value and calculate the matching results of the historical data we could calculate the slope of historical data and new data if the results show no minimal change we can state that the water quality is unchanged thus no new regulation and immediate action are required in this situation if a more significant change is observed the water condition will be considered to be an emergency and new regulation and immediate action will be needed in this situation we used recsom to verify the results and we could determine different tendency situations the oms dataset analyzed using matlab the mathworks r2014a 3 results and discussion the nature of the time series data a sequence of discrete time data which consists of points equally spaced in time increases the possibility for prediction analysis even slight variations could be determined by time series analysis hence time series analysis is widely applied in different fields science including fisheries science engineering and business studies on mathematical modeling especially on the arima model are being increased in recent years arima is an integration of autoregressive models and moving average models it can make a strong assumption on the present past and future values hence it is an effective model for prediction studies buyuksahin and ertekin 2019 studies also proved that the arima model gives good prediction results on real time data covid infection cases toga et al 2021 influenza yuan and li 2021 yao et al 2021 studied the prediction tourist data capability of rescaled range analysis r s support vector regression svr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and the authors reported that the arima model performs well in forecasting the linear trend hence it is a good prediction model for the real time dataset aladag 2021 reported that the arima model is the ideal statistical tool to assess and predict environmental pollution a study selvaraj et al 2020 adopted arima models to determine the fish landing behavior the authors noticed that the result was a good agreement concerning the observed data we adopted arima autoregressive integrated moving average model and the least square method to derive a novel mathematical model we observed its efficiency in prediction aspects different stages of fish behavior towards water quality monitoring and prediction aspects 3 1 novel mathematical model on sbrm each behavior stage has its unique characteristics hence we refine the behavioral dynamic switch model proposed earlier ren et al 2016 as equation 9 f b t b m s 0 8 s t h 1 b m a c k 1 ln s b s t h 2 b m a

presented as k 2 2 k 2 1 k 2 3 k 2 i i the definition of each parameter setting and stages are as follows mode definition m s bn does not generate bp nor does bp generate bn the behavior strength is stable about 0 8 the parameters defined as μ n 0 μ p 1 m ac select a period near the safe stage s th 1 threshold point as a reference find the point that continuously drops more than 20 at the lowest position point s th 2 the whole descending process of this stage is linear the difference between b t s th 1 and b t s th 2 is higher than 20 without 10 recovery it is decided by the c of the total toxicity with the changes in time t b t s th 1 b t s th 2 b t s th 1 20 at this time bn began to transform to bp and bp did not start to transform bn or the conversion rate was very low the parameters defined as μ n 1 μ p 1 maj when the difference between b t s th i 2 and b t s th i 3 is higher than 10 that is k 2 s i 0 then the bt is on the rise stage at that time the transformation from bn to bp and the transformation from bp to bn are all open and the transformation amount of bp to bn is larger than that of bn which makes bt show an increasing trend parameters defined as μ n 1 μ p 1 when k 2 s i 0 the intensity of behavior is in the decline stage at this time the change of bn to bp is opened the transformation of bp to bn is suppressed by the present excessive environmental coercion which is very small making bn constantly decreasing without bp supplement and the overall bt decline the parameters were defined as μ n 1 μ p 1 m t at this point all transformations stopped behavior strength will only decrease but not increase and the condition is assumed to be μ n 0 μ p 1 since the ms stage is relatively stable we assumed that b m s is constant we approximately determined the intensity of the constant as 0 8 the overall trend is declining in the mac stage so we use a straight line function for fitting the straight line s k slope value would reflect the current intensity of the behavior strength and the current environmental pressure to a certain extent at first we discuss the mt stage before discussing the behavior activity s most complicated adjustment stage at the mt stage the transfer of bp to bn is not possible so behavior strength will be lower than 0 2 and will reach zero slowly based on the toxicity since the maj stage is more complex we calculated the behavior dynamic switch model and the environmental pressure expressions 1 2 and 3 by which the solution expression obtained b n 2 a 1 λ p μ p e ξ 1 l n s 2 a 2 λ p μ p e ξ 2 l n s b p a 1 λ n λ p λ n

according to the solved equation when the two eigenvalues are lesser than 0 the overall bt decreases when one of the eigenvalues is greater than 0 the bt increases the eigenvalue equation ξ 1 is always less than 0 and ξ 2 maybe greater or less than 0 thus the positive and negative values of ξ 2 could determine the tendency change of the biological behavior strength so when ξ 2 is 0 we could consider it is the point where behavior strength changes from increase to decrease and vice versa that is the threshold switch point s th i 2 to be determined thus the solution ξ 2 0 was derived μ n μ p 1 when μ n μ p 1 ξ 2 0 the bt will increase when μ n μ p 1 ξ 2 0 the bt will decrease when μ n μ p 1 ξ 2 0 the bn and bp will attain dynamic balance so that this point is considered as the threshold point simplification of the maj stage is achieved mainly by setting the following three parameters 1 dynamic balance indicator μ n μ p considered as the dynamic balance indicator and expressed as μ i μ i 0 when μ n and μ p are reciprocal to each other it indicates that the organism is in equilibrium states in some conditions special equilibrium states the complete equilibrium states could also occur where μ n 1 and μ p 1 2 conversion base value λ n λ p is considered as the conversion base value the baseline value of behavior changes in the state of complete equilibrium μ n 1 μ p 1 regardless of transfer of bn to bp or vice versa in the maj stage and both transfer at greater strength for convenience assume that λ n λ p λ as λ n λ p 0 3 balance adjustment coefficient λ n λ p 2 4

delimitation of threshold even though the different threshold s th is attained in the sbrm the division of each threshold is not clearly derived hence it is challenging to suggest sbrm for water quality monitoring assessments in this study we explain how to distinguish different threshold switch points at each stage the first is the dividing point between ms and mac phases ms is a strong characteristic phase so we used the least squares method to find the best range that matches a certain horizontal straight line in the behavioral strength data the initial value of the behavioral strength data was chosen as the reference value of the straight line note we can adjust the reference value up and down for a certain range we calculated the residual error between the actual behavior strength value and the straight reference line from the starting point we then calculated the residual sum with the increase of points we found the point that minimizes the residual amount and the point considered as the threshold point s th 1 for ms the second is the mac phase the prime characteristic of mac phase is a drop of 20 and above the subsequent mac phase is characterized by a change of 10 and above these characteristics help in deriving a specific point for mac we determined the minimum value point where the threshold point of ms declines more than 20 note if the difference between this determined minimum value and adjacent maximum value exceeds 10 the minimum value point is the threshold point for mac in detail the first calculation was based on s th 1 and the threshold point decreased more than 20 due to the large fluctuations in the actual data and if the calculation of key data is based on a certain point large errors might occur we calculated the average value of the data for a period around s th 1 as a reference value to estimate a 20 decline trend the second calculates additional fluctuations a 10 increase in the threshold point and previous conditions of a 20 decline it is important to notice that if that point is 20 lower than the previous threshold point but the increase is lower than 10 it indicates the end of the acclimation phase and the start of the new phase acclimation phase however this point also indicates that the environmental stress is overwhelming the coping capacity of the fish after high stress on the acclimation phase there will be no adjustment phase and will then direct towards a toxic effect phase thus the 10 increase of acclimation threshold point at this stage doesn t need to be considered thirdly the threshold point is the change point of increase to decrease and vice versa the threshold point could be derived precisely for numbers so it is possible to find a 20 decline early nevertheless we need to find the extreme point to confirm the threshold point checking of the extreme point of mac we adopted the interval vector method to check the calculated threshold point the ordinary extreme point was derived commonly by using find peaks in matlab software we have tried primarily with the range extreme value method and slope method many meaningless noise jitters might be in the actual data that could select the wrong extreme point hence it is not advisable to use find peaks in matlab for selecting an extreme point for example perhaps the overall trend of a certain section of data is rising there can be a large downward jitter at extreme point to solve this issue we constructed a set of interval vector methods first the trend screening algorithm analysis is a series of trend changes to find the extreme points that meet the requirements in this interval vector method algorithm a vector is used to characterize the trend which is different from the normal trend method that selects the vector between two adjacent points we selected three points in the interval vector method the vector point between point one and point three chosen directly this method of selecting points is rather similar to the method of denoising by the average value selecting two pairs of vectors will improve the determination of the detailed data for the fluctuating data type the three point vector is an effective method in suppressing some instantaneous fluctuations a three point vector represents a trend when multiple vectors are used the overlap the next vector will be the previous vector and shift one point to the right method is adopted for proper output at least three vectors are required based on the length of the time window the number of vectors is adjusted freely we achieved the result of this study with five vectors the interval vector method is the valid method for deriving different stages of behavioral strength data we could use this method to search for threshold points in the mac phase and search for all threshold points in the later maj stage however the extreme points derived by this method are considered only as alternative extreme points not all selected points are considered as threshold points this issue the filtering of points to derive required threshold points are solved by the following steps 1 limit the interval range of threshold points the mac and maj processes of an organism under external environmental stress are typical continuous gradual and slow generally the upper and lower threshold points will frequently switch in a certain area thus these threshold points might not be accurate the interval vector method could indirectly modulate the interval length through the number of vectors however according to the monitoring data s actual length a certain degree of adaptive adjustment is still required when we have all historical data it is easier to find the threshold points of the mac and mt phases additionally the interval between each threshold point is derived according to the length of the middle area of the two threshold points 2 filter duplicate threshold points based on the interval vector method we obtained two types of results maximum point changes from increase to decrease and minimum point changes from decrease to increase as per the behavior tendency when the organism attains mac stage the behavior strength will decline sharply then the organism could adapt to the current environmental stress so that the behavior strength might increase thus the threshold points of the first maj stage immediately following the mac stage should be the maximum point increase to decrease trend similarly the threshold points that immediately follow the maximum point should be the minimum point decrease to increase trend the actual interval vector method may have several repeated extreme points consecutively for example we should obtain only one maximum point between the two minimum threshold points in the actual interval vector method however there will be two or more maximum points so we need to filter according to the situation we selected the strongest behavior point when there are different maximum points in a region likewise we selected the minimum value of the behavior strength point when there are different minimum points in a region 3 screen out threshold points that do not meet the standard the threshold point difference should be more than 10 suppose the value matching to the mac stage threshold point found earlier to the stage and the immediate maximum point does not exceed 10 in that case it indicates that the organism is at the mac stage and did not get rid of the general downward trend so the threshold point found earlier in the stage cannot be considered to be the required mac threshold point therefore we deleted this point and continued to compare the next pair of points if the difference between the minimum point and the subsequent maximum point is more than 10 then we considered this point as the required point to define the transfer of mac to the maj stage of an organism the third is the mt phase this stage indicates that the organism cannot cope with the current environmental stress thus toxic effects could occur if the behavior strength is lower than 0 2 we consider it the mt stage s start however suppose the behavior strength is lower than 0 2 for a short period in that case could be due to the influence of other factors sudden noise and other interference to avoid misjudging the stage we made a continuous period of judgment if the number n of all consecutive points are below 0 2 then consider the beginning of point 0 2 as the threshold point for the mt phase 3 3 concentration profile based on slope k there are two crucial biologically significant slopes in the dynamic behavioral model 1 the slope of the fitted straight line in the mac phase the slope of the fitted straight line will be a negative value because of the decreasing intensity trend in the mac phase therefore a smaller slope and straight line closer to the vertical x axis indicate that behavior strength decreases drastically noteworthy the decrease of the behavior strength value positively correlated with the concentration of external stress thus the slope value k 1 of the mac stage could also reflect the current concentration of external stress to a certain extent in general the mac stage could occur only once in an organism during monitoring hence the slope value k 1 of mac represents only the concentration of external stress which is not real time note it is mandatory to have more flexible slope values for the long term monitoring process 2 this issue was solved by the slope value k 2 of the maj phase the first important factor is that the duration of the maj phase is longer at this stage if the concentration of external stress does not exceed c 2tu it represents that the organism maintains maj phase for a more extended period additionally the chances for recovering the coping fully acclimatize capacity to the current environment is also higher in the organism at the current environmental stress further the organism has no chance to enter the mt phase the second is there are more threshold points in the maj phase hence we could monitor many mild maj stages the slope of each mild maj stage could characterize the concentration of the external stress certainly to an extent thus the result will be more flexible and real time the biological principle of one to one correspondence between slope and concentration we can derive an appropriate threshold point if we use many experimental data based on different kinds of stress concentrations and individuals on the kinetic model then through the segmentation of the threshold point the characteristic slope of each stage can be fitted and calculated by which we can obtain a slope concentration map thus the changing trend derivative of the behavior strength of the real time monitoring directly could help to evaluate the water quality 3 4 verification of the novel algorithm on real time fish behavior monitoring data different bioindicators fish crustaceans and mussels were employed in water quality monitoring since we can electronically monitor their behavioral responses in real time fish are considered as health indicators of aquatic ecosystem hence it is used routinely in environmental monitoring studies recently studies on fish behavior response to stressors being increased because their responses are 10 100 times more sensitive than other established ecological lines of evidence fish responses are ecologically pertinent for eco toxicology and monitoring water quality moreover fish behavior responses could occur even to a slight change in the environment including weather photoperiods biological events and water quality burnett et al 2020 scientific experts developed different non optical sensing technologies such as mechanical electrical proximity and quadrupole impedance conversion technologies to monitor the biological behavioral response in which electric based sensing non invasive measurements quantifies behavioral intensity in the form of electric signals bownik and wlodkowic 2021 we used metal sensors to quantify the swimming strength of fishes we observed a series of swimming behavior anomalies on fishes exposed to pesticides as shown in fig 1 we could visualize only the safe mode in the control group throughout the study periods in contrast we visualized different behavior stages safe stage acclimatization stage adjustment stages and toxic effect stage in the pesticide treatment groups a concentration based behavior response resulted in the pesticide treated groups the safe mode of the pesticide treatment groups is the shortest we visualized mac mode in all pesticide treatment groups however the duration is concise for 20 tu followed by 10 tu 5 tu 2 tu 1 tu and 0 1 tu in contrast maj is the predominant mode for 0 1 tu 1 tu and 2 tu behavior strength is comparatively higher with few adjustments in 0 1 tu in the case of 1 tu and 2 tu there were continuous adjustments however the behavior strength was found higher in 1 tu when compared to 2 tu mt the predominant mode for 5 tu 10 tu and 20 tu mt is the main mode of action of pesticide affecting the nervous system of an organism alteration in the nervous system could affect the behavior of an organism generally fish tries to escape from the stressors that could result in a change in behavioral intensity thus we visualized different behavioral stages in the present study a series of behavioral responses swimming behavior speed and strength locomotion respiratory anomalies and sheltering behavior of aquatic organisms danio rerio rhamdia quelen hyphessobrycon eques pandalus borealis carassius auratus to pesticide toxicity were reported in different studies bretaud et al 2002 baldissera et al 2021 poopal et al 2021 bamber et al 2021 moreira et al 2021 artificial networking is considered a productive and cost effective methodology for water quality monitoring studies shamshirband et al 2019 tiyasha et al 2020 moreover artificial networking can minimize errors zhou et al 2020 used the kalman filter post processing technique on real time data three gorges reservoir in china the authors noticed that the method could suitably extract the complex non linear dependence structure and overcome the systematic errors we adopted the kalman filter on fish behavior response real time datasets and achieved the output with minimal errors we can use mathematical models to analyze real time data including different types of factors or single factors by including different types of datasets such as hydrological limnological and meteorological data researchers ye and cai 2009 determined the chlorophyll concentration in gorges reservoirs the authors adopted recurrent artificial neural networks we focused on one factor swimming behavior we determined different threshold points for each stage safe acclimatization adjustments and toxic stage as shown in fig 2 a the safe stage of the fish exposed to environmental stress is much shorter we did the following steps to identify the safe stage s th 1 with the first value of the behavior intensity at step size 0 01 we searched for the point that minimizes the residual sum of squares between the experimental data and reference value within the range of the initial value plus or minus 0 1 the search length of this study is five units of length the acclimatization stage occurred rapidly next to the safe stage this stage indicates that fish might sense a change in the external environment hence it acclimatizes however acclimatization has also lasted for even fewer minutes we considered the following procedures to recognize the acclimatization stage on the data primarily we focused on finding the 20 decrease point generally this point is not stationary so we searched for the minimal point that decreases greater note we should know the benchmark value 20 decrease we selected the average value of the behavior intensity within the range of 5 units before the threshold point s th 1 of the safe stage as the benchmark the average value of this study is 0 86 note if the number of points between s th 1 and the starting point does not exceed 5 the average value of behavior strength of all safe phases is the reference value for calculation the point that decreases more than 20 was selected to find the minimum point that meets the conditions in all subsequent data we tentatively set the first minimum point found as the threshold point s th 2 of the acclimatization stage the environmental stress on this threshold is 19 9 tu h and the behavior strength is 0 66 however it is necessary to make further judgments on s th 2 based on the results of the adjustment stage we fitted a straight line based on the change in behavior strength from s th 1 to s th 2 we recorded the slope of the fitted straight lines as k 1 the value is 0 0006 after a shorter acclimatization stage due to the coping ability of fish we visualized serials of re adjustments on the behavior intensity fish could adapt slowly based on the strength of the current environmental stress thus the adjustment stage is comparably longer lasting than other stages to distinguish the occurrence of the adjustment stage we followed the following steps on the behavior intensity we determined the starting point that meets the conditions and the distance between each stationary point set as adaptive adjustment we used 3 3 of the length of the experimental data to screen the stationary point the length of the adjustment mode of this study is 1092 points the screening distance determined is 1092 30 36 4 further we screened the stationary point that meets the 10 conditions note it is better to compare with s th 2 if the first maximum point does not increase more than 10 when compared to s th 2 it indicates that fish did not yet experience the adjustment phase then consider the next minimum point as s th 2 and compare it again the behavior intensity value s th 2 of this study is 0 6575 so the value of the first adjustment threshold point should be higher than 0 7233 we divided the results obtained based on these procedures into two trends table 1 after a prolonged adjustment stage fish coping capacity might be declined due to the cumulative environmental stress this situation could be the end of the adjustment stage and the start of toxic effects at this stage improvement in recovery is not possible thus the behavior intensity resulted lower than 0 2 note if three consecutive points are found lower than 0 2 the first point can be selected as a threshold point s th n 3 for the toxic effect stage 3 5 additional strategies of the proposed mathematical model testing toxicity of chemicals was done in a short duration and the capacity of biological trials and chemical production was increased this led to demands of assessing early fate absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity of chemicals thus in silico models data or molecular modeling gained much attention van de waterbeemd and gifford 2003 sinha et al 2021 differences in modes of toxic action of stressors and responses between species can affect toxicity prediction and risk assessment decision making though toxicity testing is progressing risk assessment strategies remain challenging to implement environmental monitoring punt 2018 wu et al 2020 duong et al 2021 aquatic bioassay is routinely used to determine environmental stress because the organism can respond rapidly to environmental change a different threshold might occur on physiological and biochemical activities in an organism based on the toxic capacity of the stressor for the determination of environmental risk responses of bioassays classified as three p s exposure partitioning toxicokinetic and potency toxicodynamic toxicokinetic modeling helps to predict bioaccumulation dynamics and calculate the duration of bioassays response to stressors nyman et al 2014 ning et al 2019 ashauer et al 2015 geraets et al 2017 dalaijamts et al 2020 mounier et al 2020 nallani et al 2020 gingrich et al 2021 toxicity prediction based on mathematical models and physiologically based pharmacokinetics is a very important and challenging research direction in the future wang and tan 2019 in this study we also demonstrated toxicity prediction by adopting our mathematical model based on the above functions the function curve was derived in this study fig 2b we proved that mathematical toxicokinetic modeling for behavior assessment could quantify the duration and threshold point of each stage reflecting the concentration exposure period and behavior strength of fishes in addition we can compare the existing external stress data with the previous data which can predict the future status of the water ecosystem since every organism can cope with stress a series of behavioral changes can occur and we can monitor each stage of behavioral change therefore we can determine two factors bn and bp stages on the behavior changes of organisms thus the threshold points of each stage are derived by using our mathematical model further based on the toxicokinetic model of zhang et al 2019 if we consider bn as external stress concentration of pollutant sout and bp as internal stress in the organism sin we could determine the stress in the organism when the internal concentration of the pollutant is lower than the organism s tolerance internal stress might reduce as a result the transformation of bp to bn could be obtained in the dataset under the continuous or higher external pollutant concentration the organism might have certain permeability as however the organism might continuously metabolize the pollutants as detoxification fad thus the combined effect of permeability and metabolic function helps determine the internal stress of an organism by adopting the toxicokinetic model on the behavior dataset we determined the internal stress of fish fig 2c the octanol water partition coefficient kow of pesticides is higher than 3 thus the possibility of accumulation is higher on organisms rossi et al 2020 the authors also mentioned that eliminating pesticides affected under continuous or higher concentrations could enhance the accumulation of pesticides on organisms water quality prediction based on biological behavior responses is a developing strategy the recent development is method feasibility verification this study focused on the toxicokinetic model and developed a method mathematical model to improve the water quality prediction assessment since different factors affect the behavior changes of an organism and the monitoring process we assess the biological behavior responses under environmental stress conditions the method proposed in this study is convenient for calculation when developing a model for quantifying biological responses all derivations were realized under ideal conditions for example in eq 5 we simplified the environmental parameter f p i s f as 0 likewise to study the adjustment stage we use constants λ n λ p these simple derivations help in the identification of threshold points precisely 4 conclusions and outlook research on biological responses to water quality monitoring and toxicity prediction has been increasing in recognition in the last few years a great deal of biological response data has been produced through online monitoring systems however comprehensive information on biological response is missing consequently biological responses cannot be used to monitor water quality we used the persistent model on behavioral strength data and derived a mathematic model to solve these issues safe acclimatization adjustment and toxicity stages can be derived using a novel mathematic model moreover the mathematic model can also derive the threshold point for each stage safe acclimatization adjustment and toxicity stages precisely limitations however the model cannot automatically combine each stage organically through the threshold at present the judgment of the threshold is based on the empirical model future directions by comparing the current result it is possible to find the threshold of each stage through mathematical demonstration and combine the derivation results with the expression of each stage towards a complete mathematical expression model of biological behavior strength suppose the complete modeling of biological behavior strength that is find the corresponding relationship between environmental stress and biological behavior strength is derived in that case the method could be a reliable theoretical model for the online environmental monitoring and toxicity prediction studies water quality prediction is a developing strategy in eco toxicology we achieved water quality prediction toxicokinetic by adopting our mathematic model we propose that the novel mathematical model is a convenient and powerful tool to predict the biological responses towards water quality prediction and monitoring future research is desired to focus on adopting the novel mathematic model in different research areas such as food quality assessment and prediction aspects all types of

24504,research on biological responses to water quality monitoring and toxicity prediction has increased in recognition in recent years a great deal of biological response data has been produced through online monitoring systems however comprehensive information on biological response is missing consequently biological responses cannot be used to monitor water quality we can resolve this problem through mathematical models we used the persistent model on behavioral strength data and derived a mathematic model the threshold points for safe acclimatization adjustment and toxicity stages were calculated precisely we obtained normal bn and persistence bp responses on behavior data when the environmental conditions of fish changed transfer of behavior strength from safe mode ms to acclimatization mode mac and mac to adjustment stage maj resulted rapidly this indicates that fish sensed the environment changes serials of maj stages were also visualized hence we determined upwards and downwards trends for each maj the toxicity stage mt has occurred after the extended maj stage indicating that the toxic effect of the stressors overwhelmed the adaptive capability of the fish we derived the threshold point for each stage precisely on the fish behavior strength dataset thus the proposed mathematical model is an efficient model for determining the behavioral changes when toxicants enter an organism s body although the proposed mathematical model is derived using specific factors such as fishes pollutants and concentrations it can be applicable for other biological models based on the normal and persistent responses for toxicity prediction this study strengthens the available alternative environmental monitoring techniques towards water quality monitoring graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persisters alternative method mathematical modeling information pollution monitoring toxicokinetic 1 introduction we humankind are fortunate with a stunning piece of art the environment for survival we regularly scavenge the components air water and soil of the milieu which affect their nature purity the tendency provokes us to examine quantify and treat them tiyasha et al 2020 kargar et al 2020 water safety has remained a critical global issue among the environmental components since the 1960s meng et al 2017 greaves et al 2020 baines et al 2021 dolan et al 2021 hence environmentalists developed different methods to monitor aquatic inhabitants hydro morphological and physicochemical parameters towards water quality monitoring tiyasha et al 2020 among these parameters environmentalists typically focused on aquatic inhabitants the responses of aquatic inhabitants to change in water quality are widely accepted as a beneficial biomarker because they live in the aquatic ecosystem the chances of receiving and being affected by waterborne stressors are higher the health impact that occurred on aquatic inhabitants could be considered a replica for higher organisms including humans strikingly even though aquatic organisms reside in the deprived water ecosystem they can adapt and cope with environmental stress by maintaining their body homeostasis sun et al 2016 brijs et al 2019 golla et al 2020 park et al 2020 nonnis et al 2021 in this situation the primary response that we can observe from them is behavioral change behavior is the response of an organism to its internal or external environmental stimuli behavioral change is the abnormalities that occur on an organism s regular action under undesirable environmental internal or external conditions behavioral changes are primarily associated with stress internally or externally and biochemical alterations generally organisms maintain behavioral homeostasis responding to emergencies response coping with resistance and exhaustion under environmental stress a series of behavioral changes can occur to sustain body homeostasis under stress among the different behavioral activities swimming activity is the fish s natural behavior which may reveal the relationship between the body s physical condition and environmental stress under unescapable closed environmental conditions organisms exhibit different swimming behavior to stressors and we can determine different modes thresholds stepwise behavior response model sbrm such as no effect acclimation adjustments and toxic effect on fish swimming behavior sbrm can reveal fish s responses normal activity hyperactivity or hypoactivity to their current environment in response to changes in the environment fish are actively swimming hyperactivity this stage indicates a stimulation state under normal conditions fish swim against the water flow however under stressful conditions stimulation state their footprint can reach in all directions stimulation state indicates the avoidance behavior of fish no toxic effects are likely to occur during the stimulation state if the environmental conditions change critically the fish would slow down and settle on the bottom to cope with the stress this phase signifies the acclimation state of the fish concurrently the adjustment of swimming activity may indicate the alarm situation threshold 1 on the fish when behavioral responses reach an acclimation state a different state may occur 1 if the stress overwhelms the adaptive capacity of the fish the toxic effect may occur during this situation fish cease swimming fish footprints may be static or occasional death may happen 2 if coping capacity overwhelms stress fish step to adjustment state this stage might result for certain periods based on the toxicity of stress depending on the improvement of coping capacity to a stressor a series of adjustments or readjustments threshold 2 3 4 n may occur during threshold 2 and above state fish prefer to swim slowly and sometimes for short periods the footprint may be mobile at the bottom ren et al 2016 thus the swimming behavior of fish can be an ideal parameter for assessing biological and environmental stress it is not easy labor intensive expensive time consuming and so on to assess the swimming behavior of fish by traditional methods this issue accelerated research hunt for new and efficient real time swimming behavior monitoring methods appreciatively the recent development of engineering technologies quantifies the real time behavior activity of organisms including fish under different environmental conditions in recent years different types of computer based real time fish behavior monitoring methods have been developed poopal et al 2020 hu et al 2021 bownik and wlodkowic 2021 based on published literature we can understand that much data is generated using online monitoring systems oms but the information is limited moreover the limitations difficulty in managing dataset time consuming and so on in traditionally based water quality monitoring statistics delayed the decision making process these limitations paved the way for artificial intelligence models develop more effective algorithms and underlying theories for machine learning appreciably the development in engineering technologies particularly in data analysis help us to determine the in depth variations on real time datasets shamshirband et al 2019 hu et al 2021 to better understand the functioning of biological systems biologists prefer mathematical methods tahedl and hader 2001 tomlin and axelrod 2007 laguna et al 2015 simpson et al 2017 white et al 2018 ravindra et al 2019 nieves gonzalez et al 2019 flynn

cooperation and development also promotes methods that reduce animal testing and use of alternative methods algorithm mechanistic interpretation to frame regulations to improve risk assessment methods to protect human health and the health of the environment gosling 2014 lamon et al 2019 a mathematical model is essential to mine massive data towards perdition aspects environmentalists commonly use time series analysis data mining techniques growth models non linear regressing analysis epidemiological models and artificial intelligence techniques for prediction analysis a different model of time series models such as autoregressive ar seasonal autoregressive sar integrated autoregressive iar seasonal integrated autoregressive siar moving average ma seasonal moving average sma integrated moving average ima seasonal integrated moving average sima autoregressive integrated moving average arima seasonal autoregressive moving average sarma and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima are developed for real time data prediction analysis mahmoudi and baroumand 2021 among them one of the commonly used and efficient time series analyses for the prediction aspects is the autoregressive integrated moving average arima box jenkins method sun 2021 the prediction accuracy is also high hence we can obtain high relative accuracy and probability perdition results the arima model can systematically observe the prediction of individual and stationary time series consisting of observation values obtained with equal time intervals toga et al 2021 yuan and li 2021 environmentalists developed different types of artificial intelligence models artificial neural networks fuzzy based support vector machine complementary models nature inspired and others these artificial neural networks learning capability is higher for real time data tiyasha et al 2020 noteworthy artificial neural networks function on the raw datasets efficiently it can extract higher level features intricate structures concerning real time datasets by employing multiple hidden processing layers between the input and output layers we can quantify the uncertainty hidden information on real time datasets through different techniques for example pre processing techniques the fuzzy clustering method the wavelet transform and the bias correction method and post processing techniques the multiple linear regression the kalman filtering the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation the bayesian model average and the bayesian uncertainty processor researchers routinely used these methods for water quality prediction zhou 2020 the kalman filter is an ideal probabilistic post processing technique for real time monitoring studies it is a recursive state estimator hence it can reduce prediction uncertainty it provides a theoretical post processing framework the kalman filter is classified as the linear kalman filter and the non linear kalman filter we can identify the linear error estimation by linear kalman filter and quantify the non linear error estimation by non linear kalman filter zhou et al 2020 noteworthy machine learning methods are an emerging field in rapidly improving the analyses of complex datasets with minimal errors additionally the artificial neural network tends to recognize linear or non linear relationships at minimal data inputs and without a prior understanding of the underlying mechanism it can recognize complex patterns in a dataset zhou et al 2020 self organized map som or kohonen map is a computational method that provides a complete result of data compression in visual patterns park and chon 2015 yang et al 2020 clark et al 2020 time series directed acyclic graphs are efficiently managed using recursive som recsom the recsom is comparatively better at minimizing quantification errors than other methods general advantages are intuitive implementation resilience to missing and noisy data the ability to integrate online datasets a forthright visual summary of the system and inter component relationships voegtlin 2002 hammer et al 2004 li et al 2020 persistence is the protected phase of the cell under unfavorable conditions and the cell may return to normal states after removing the stressor from its environment balaban et al 2004 vandervelde et al 2016 greaves et al 2020 marangoni et al 2020 ross et al 2020 like balaban s 2004 theory it is possible to classify normal and persistence factors on fish behavior differences in behavioral activity stepwise behavior response model sbrm occur due to maintaining bodily homeostasis to sustain stress in fish maintaining normal swimming activity by balancing homeostasis when the fish did not experience stress can be referred to as normal responders bn we can denote differences in behavioral activity under stress conditions to maintain homeostasis as persistent bp noteworthy the coping capacity of fish to a stressor that is switching back bp to bn can be calculated based on different thresholds environmental stress e stressor concentration c and exposure duration t can influence both bn and bp the e and threshold of the test organisms ti will determine the behavioral response modes m thus we hypothesized that the trend of total behavioral strength bt and behavioral modulation normal recovery and intoxicating behavior could be determined using persistent models most of the available real time monitoring techniques focus on quantitative characterization and trend analysis of the dose effect relationship park et al 2005 perez escudero et al 2014 kim et al 2015 wu et al 2015 xia et al 2016 which did not consider the biological survival adaptability and tolerance ability based on homeostatic regulation moreover studies on exposure time t concentration d and behavioral capacity b to relate behavioral responses to environmental stress on organisms are lacking ren et al 2016 yin et al 2016 we believe that these factors t d b are significant in analysing dynamic behavior response modes and real time responses of organisms under environmental stress s we aimed to study the t d and b relationship using swimming strength of eco toxicological models daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish under different concentrations of pesticides as per our previous study ren et al 2016 different m such as safe mode ms acclimation mode mac adjustment mode maj and toxic effect mt can differentiate significantly each stage has its eigenvalue fitting slope of each stage and this value especially the adjustment stage only relates to the concentration of environmental stress once the relationship between concentration and eigenvalue is standardized the method will help determine the new situation of the organism under the same environmental pressure research lacuna on in depth analysis of different behavioral response modes is a barrier to using an online monitoring system in water quality assessment this issue can be solved by piece wise function analysis as a result the threshold switch mac for the stepwise behavioral responses can be determined this study adopted a theory of persistence p based on a bacterial model balaban et al 2004 on online biomonitoring study datasets we believe that the organisms daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish survival adaptability and tolerance on the resistance to s can be determined by p to achieve that we studied the switch function of the environmental stress threshold sth to different behavior modes bm using p then we constructed the sth bm switch model based on variables t and d after normalized time dose response analysis further we used recsom to validate the results 2 experimental details 2 1 analysis of

cosolvent did not exceed 0 5 in all pesticide treated groups we collected healthy fishes daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish from the fish breeding laboratory in the institute of environment and ecology at shandong normal university jinan china fish species were maintained individually in a glass aquarium with a flow through water system under fourteen light and ten dark hours we held a temperature of 26 5 1 5 ºc a water hardness of 250 20 mg l and a ph 7 8 0 03 of the water in the rearing system throughout the study periods fish were fed commercial feed twice a day morning and evening we collected daphnia magna fathead minnow japanese medaka and zebrafish from their respective rearing system and stocked them in a separate tank we maintained them similar to the rearing system feeding was withheld 24 h before the commencement of the study no mortality has occurred during study periods we developed an online behavior monitoring system oms in our laboratory to quantify the behavior responses of fish ren et al 2021 zebrafish 3 fish from the stock was introduced into the fish chamber of the oms a water tank connected to the inlet of the fish chamber functions

parameters related to sbrm we analyzed the threshold switch of sbrm precisely using a piece wise function f b m ms mac re maj mt this model is vital to complete the sth bm to understand and to resolve the scientific issues related to the sth bm on water quality monitoring model we examined the following steps dynamic behavioral response process of fish the linear function normalization analysis of the relationship between bm bn normal behavior and bp persistence behavior and t and d influencing s were combined we determined the range of different parameters of the sth bm switch model we classified the following modes after obtaining the fitting result mode 1 if the intensity of base value ranges between 0 7 0 9 it is considered constant and signifies ms states mode 2 if the intensity sharply declines it must be a drop of more than 20 it represents mac states mode 3 if the intensity is below 0 2 and constantly fluctuates by 10 it denotes maj states to indicate the process of adjustment adaptation and readjustment mode 4 if the intensity is below 0 2 for a more extended period it represents mt states 2 3 persistence model 2 3 1 dynamic balance of behavior responses the dynamic changes of normal and persistence factors under environmental stress s can determine the switching conditions of each mode sth bm under normal environmental conditions water quality remains unchanged with the result that fish behavior may not change and bn normal behavior is the dominant mode under conditions of environmental change water quality begins to decline thus changes in behavior were observed with the fish this situation may trigger behavior mode from bn to bp once the behavior mode reaches the switch the fish will begin its resisting ability thus the change from bn to bp could occur after a certain period fish might cope with the environmental stress as a result a balance may occur between the behavior bp and bn and the external environment after sensing the environmental stress fish may experience excitement stimulation behavior where the dominant mode is bn normal behavior the termination of these states is the first environmental stress threshold sth after experiencing the first sth the speed of conversion from bn to bp gradually increases fish adapt to the increasing current environmental stress as a result the intensity of the behavior drops sharply and switches from mode ms safe to mac acclimation under continuous environmental stress s the conversion ratio of behavior response of bn bp gradually increases fish adapt to the increasing current environmental stress this situation results in ascending phase in maj adjustment mode after a period of adaptations the conversion ratio of behavior response from bn to bp may be declined to the increasing current environmental stress this situation is the decline phase in maj adjustment mode after switching to multiple environmental stress threshold sth the behavior patterns also show maj adjustment mode until fish attain mt toxic effect mode at this stage maj the dynamic balance of bn and bp might be affected completely due to the continuous environmental stress once the dynamic balance is affected there are no possibilities of transferring from mode bp to bn therefore the behavior intensity could be relatively low and maintain a straight line thus we analyzed the competition between bn normal behavior and bp persistent behavior in different behavior response patterns and the influence of behavior response ability of fish to achieve the biological significance of bn normal behavior and bp persistent behavior in maj adjustment mode 2 4 construction of the switch model based on the relationship between sth and sm we developed a mathematical model to determine the dynamic balance between bn normal behavior and bp persistent behavior to distinguish the relationship between fish behavior response and environmental factors pollutant type concentration d and exposure periods t based on the unified scale of t at normalized d and b piecewise function combined with the fish behavior response pattern eq 1 the dynamic equilibrium between bp and bn which is the switching effect of sth and bm help in the determination of the switching mode sth bm on different t and d constructed 1 f b m m s s t h 1 m a c s t h 2 r e m a j s t h i 2 i 1 2 3 n m t s t h n 3 i

made on a bacterial model proposed by balaban et al 2004 with reference to eq 2 assume that the b behavioral strength of the fish consists only of bp and bn eq 3 that the value decreases and that there is no separate µ constant the reduction was determined by the λ conversion constant of bp and bn under the influence of s the dynamic balance between bp and bn on the homeostasis of the behavior

the mode of behavioral response and the relationship between the dynamic balance of bp and bn and the environmental stress threshold sth plays an important role in changing the behavioral response mode bm the eq 1 and 4 on behavior response of fish combined and analyzed the effect of t exposure periods c concentration on b to find the relationship in different behavior response patterns we determined the variation range of constants a b λ in dynamic behavior balance related to changes in sth then the sth bm switch model was done 2 5 data analysis and model verification 2 5 1 normalized dose effect analysis we conducted a unified analysis for environmental stress s and behavior strength b to different stressors and concentrations c and exposure periods t to complete the switch model of environmental stress threshold sth on behavior response mode bm to execute that primarily we obtained the positions of different bm patterns and the relationship between different patterns and the biological significance to determine the normalized dose effect the relationship curve of b under s combined with t and d was studied on the sbrm and the behavior dynamics normal behavior bn and

impact caused by stressor conjunction with the present study and sf is parameters that influence water quality temperature turbidity hardness ph and other parameters of water to simplify the analysis we considered both f pi and sf as 0 we adopted a persistence model on fish behavior response n as bn to signify normal behavior and p as bp to specify responses to environmental stress eq 4 this model could clarify the constant range of each parameter the challenging task is determining conversion efficiency µn and µp using a simple mathematical equation fitting optimization is a better option thus multinomial fitting or time series analysis is used for each constant switch model sth bm for multi level optimization training to combine the different behavior response modes and optimize the numerical range of model constants to complete the bm switch model of environmental stress threshold sth to fish behavior response mode unified analysis of the environmental stress s and fish behavior

average value were analyzed to achieve a unified analysis of the impact of t and then were combined with the calculation of 30 days of exposure to normalize the analysis of the pesticide concentration

normalization analysis the dose effect characteristics of related behavior changes are as follows bs mainly combined with the size of the monitoring data after ad conversion for normalization analysis

normalized and analyzed finally combine the changes of bs 0 1 and ss 0 1 to analyze zebrafish behavior response ability b 0 1 2 5 2 mathematical modeling and the potential of tendency prediction using arima autoregressive integrated moving average model and least square method for the sth bm switch model and to improve the each stage s function and parameter determination we use a combination of empirical function and fitting for instance the ms stage is relatively flat so it is set as a constant function and the mac stage is dropping linearly so it is set as a linear function the mac stage fluctuates greatly at different time series thus the average value in each stage of maj could represent the approximate range of maj therefore maj was represented in the form of a piecewise constant function in the mt stage as the behavior strength decline sharply and finally approaches 0 based on experience and the needs of simplified fitting we choose the natural base e and the fitting results show that the function is indeed suitable for this experiment hence the following equation was derived for the switch model 8 b m m s c s s t h 1 m a c k s b s t h 2 r e m a j s t h i 2 m t e c t s s t h i 3 the threshold of each stage is determined by applying stage filter rules and determining the fitting function parameter using the least squares method the standard method fitting equation to obtain approximate keys to unknown parameters by regression analysis the least squares calculation calculates the residual of each fitted value and the observed value thus finds the parameter that minimizes the sum of squared residuals of each equation 2 5 3 software verification on persisters model we used kalman filtering on the oms dataset to smooth the curves we edited the search algorithm to find the specific threshold points modes based on each mode once we determined the range of each mode we fit the empirical function in the sth sm model after achieving all the threshold points in the adjustment mode we determined the relationship between the threshold points and environmental stress by analyzing the regular pattern of the threshold points appearance moreover this method could be applied to determine the water quality stability in the real time water quality monitoring to consider quantified data of the past six hours as a reference value and calculate the matching results of the historical data we could calculate the slope of historical data and new data if the results show no minimal change we can state that the water quality is unchanged thus no new regulation and immediate action are required in this situation if a more significant change is observed the water condition will be considered to be an emergency and new regulation and immediate action will be needed in this situation we used recsom to verify the results and we could determine different tendency situations the oms dataset analyzed using matlab the mathworks r2014a 3 results and discussion the nature of the time series data a sequence of discrete time data which consists of points equally spaced in time increases the possibility for prediction analysis even slight variations could be determined by time series analysis hence time series analysis is widely applied in different fields science including fisheries science engineering and business studies on mathematical modeling especially on the arima model are being increased in recent years arima is an integration of autoregressive models and moving average models it can make a strong assumption on the present past and future values hence it is an effective model for prediction studies buyuksahin and ertekin 2019 studies also proved that the arima model gives good prediction results on real time data covid infection cases toga et al 2021 influenza yuan and li 2021 yao et al 2021 studied the prediction tourist data capability of rescaled range analysis r s support vector regression svr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and the authors reported that the arima model performs well in forecasting the linear trend hence it is a good prediction model for the real time dataset aladag 2021 reported that the arima model is the ideal statistical tool to assess and predict environmental pollution a study selvaraj et al 2020 adopted arima models to determine the fish landing behavior the authors noticed that the result was a good agreement concerning the observed data we adopted arima autoregressive integrated moving average model and the least square method to derive a novel mathematical model we observed its efficiency in prediction aspects different stages of fish behavior towards water quality monitoring and prediction aspects 3 1 novel mathematical model on sbrm each behavior stage has its unique characteristics hence we refine the behavioral dynamic switch model proposed earlier ren et al 2016 as equation 9 f b t b m s 0 8 s t h 1 b m a c k 1 ln s b s t h 2 b m a

presented as k 2 2 k 2 1 k 2 3 k 2 i i the definition of each parameter setting and stages are as follows mode definition m s bn does not generate bp nor does bp generate bn the behavior strength is stable about 0 8 the parameters defined as μ n 0 μ p 1 m ac select a period near the safe stage s th 1 threshold point as a reference find the point that continuously drops more than 20 at the lowest position point s th 2 the whole descending process of this stage is linear the difference between b t s th 1 and b t s th 2 is higher than 20 without 10 recovery it is decided by the c of the total toxicity with the changes in time t b t s th 1 b t s th 2 b t s th 1 20 at this time bn began to transform to bp and bp did not start to transform bn or the conversion rate was very low the parameters defined as μ n 1 μ p 1 maj when the difference between b t s th i 2 and b t s th i 3 is higher than 10 that is k 2 s i 0 then the bt is on the rise stage at that time the transformation from bn to bp and the transformation from bp to bn are all open and the transformation amount of bp to bn is larger than that of bn which makes bt show an increasing trend parameters defined as μ n 1 μ p 1 when k 2 s i 0 the intensity of behavior is in the decline stage at this time the change of bn to bp is opened the transformation of bp to bn is suppressed by the present excessive environmental coercion which is very small making bn constantly decreasing without bp supplement and the overall bt decline the parameters were defined as μ n 1 μ p 1 m t at this point all transformations stopped behavior strength will only decrease but not increase and the condition is assumed to be μ n 0 μ p 1 since the ms stage is relatively stable we assumed that b m s is constant we approximately determined the intensity of the constant as 0 8 the overall trend is declining in the mac stage so we use a straight line function for fitting the straight line s k slope value would reflect the current intensity of the behavior strength and the current environmental pressure to a certain extent at first we discuss the mt stage before discussing the behavior activity s most complicated adjustment stage at the mt stage the transfer of bp to bn is not possible so behavior strength will be lower than 0 2 and will reach zero slowly based on the toxicity since the maj stage is more complex we calculated the behavior dynamic switch model and the environmental pressure expressions 1 2 and 3 by which the solution expression obtained b n 2 a 1 λ p μ p e ξ 1 l n s 2 a 2 λ p μ p e ξ 2 l n s b p a 1 λ n λ p λ n

according to the solved equation when the two eigenvalues are lesser than 0 the overall bt decreases when one of the eigenvalues is greater than 0 the bt increases the eigenvalue equation ξ 1 is always less than 0 and ξ 2 maybe greater or less than 0 thus the positive and negative values of ξ 2 could determine the tendency change of the biological behavior strength so when ξ 2 is 0 we could consider it is the point where behavior strength changes from increase to decrease and vice versa that is the threshold switch point s th i 2 to be determined thus the solution ξ 2 0 was derived μ n μ p 1 when μ n μ p 1 ξ 2 0 the bt will increase when μ n μ p 1 ξ 2 0 the bt will decrease when μ n μ p 1 ξ 2 0 the bn and bp will attain dynamic balance so that this point is considered as the threshold point simplification of the maj stage is achieved mainly by setting the following three parameters 1 dynamic balance indicator μ n μ p considered as the dynamic balance indicator and expressed as μ i μ i 0 when μ n and μ p are reciprocal to each other it indicates that the organism is in equilibrium states in some conditions special equilibrium states the complete equilibrium states could also occur where μ n 1 and μ p 1 2 conversion base value λ n λ p is considered as the conversion base value the baseline value of behavior changes in the state of complete equilibrium μ n 1 μ p 1 regardless of transfer of bn to bp or vice versa in the maj stage and both transfer at greater strength for convenience assume that λ n λ p λ as λ n λ p 0 3 balance adjustment coefficient λ n λ p 2 4

delimitation of threshold even though the different threshold s th is attained in the sbrm the division of each threshold is not clearly derived hence it is challenging to suggest sbrm for water quality monitoring assessments in this study we explain how to distinguish different threshold switch points at each stage the first is the dividing point between ms and mac phases ms is a strong characteristic phase so we used the least squares method to find the best range that matches a certain horizontal straight line in the behavioral strength data the initial value of the behavioral strength data was chosen as the reference value of the straight line note we can adjust the reference value up and down for a certain range we calculated the residual error between the actual behavior strength value and the straight reference line from the starting point we then calculated the residual sum with the increase of points we found the point that minimizes the residual amount and the point considered as the threshold point s th 1 for ms the second is the mac phase the prime characteristic of mac phase is a drop of 20 and above the subsequent mac phase is characterized by a change of 10 and above these characteristics help in deriving a specific point for mac we determined the minimum value point where the threshold point of ms declines more than 20 note if the difference between this determined minimum value and adjacent maximum value exceeds 10 the minimum value point is the threshold point for mac in detail the first calculation was based on s th 1 and the threshold point decreased more than 20 due to the large fluctuations in the actual data and if the calculation of key data is based on a certain point large errors might occur we calculated the average value of the data for a period around s th 1 as a reference value to estimate a 20 decline trend the second calculates additional fluctuations a 10 increase in the threshold point and previous conditions of a 20 decline it is important to notice that if that point is 20 lower than the previous threshold point but the increase is lower than 10 it indicates the end of the acclimation phase and the start of the new phase acclimation phase however this point also indicates that the environmental stress is overwhelming the coping capacity of the fish after high stress on the acclimation phase there will be no adjustment phase and will then direct towards a toxic effect phase thus the 10 increase of acclimation threshold point at this stage doesn t need to be considered thirdly the threshold point is the change point of increase to decrease and vice versa the threshold point could be derived precisely for numbers so it is possible to find a 20 decline early nevertheless we need to find the extreme point to confirm the threshold point checking of the extreme point of mac we adopted the interval vector method to check the calculated threshold point the ordinary extreme point was derived commonly by using find peaks in matlab software we have tried primarily with the range extreme value method and slope method many meaningless noise jitters might be in the actual data that could select the wrong extreme point hence it is not advisable to use find peaks in matlab for selecting an extreme point for example perhaps the overall trend of a certain section of data is rising there can be a large downward jitter at extreme point to solve this issue we constructed a set of interval vector methods first the trend screening algorithm analysis is a series of trend changes to find the extreme points that meet the requirements in this interval vector method algorithm a vector is used to characterize the trend which is different from the normal trend method that selects the vector between two adjacent points we selected three points in the interval vector method the vector point between point one and point three chosen directly this method of selecting points is rather similar to the method of denoising by the average value selecting two pairs of vectors will improve the determination of the detailed data for the fluctuating data type the three point vector is an effective method in suppressing some instantaneous fluctuations a three point vector represents a trend when multiple vectors are used the overlap the next vector will be the previous vector and shift one point to the right method is adopted for proper output at least three vectors are required based on the length of the time window the number of vectors is adjusted freely we achieved the result of this study with five vectors the interval vector method is the valid method for deriving different stages of behavioral strength data we could use this method to search for threshold points in the mac phase and search for all threshold points in the later maj stage however the extreme points derived by this method are considered only as alternative extreme points not all selected points are considered as threshold points this issue the filtering of points to derive required threshold points are solved by the following steps 1 limit the interval range of threshold points the mac and maj processes of an organism under external environmental stress are typical continuous gradual and slow generally the upper and lower threshold points will frequently switch in a certain area thus these threshold points might not be accurate the interval vector method could indirectly modulate the interval length through the number of vectors however according to the monitoring data s actual length a certain degree of adaptive adjustment is still required when we have all historical data it is easier to find the threshold points of the mac and mt phases additionally the interval between each threshold point is derived according to the length of the middle area of the two threshold points 2 filter duplicate threshold points based on the interval vector method we obtained two types of results maximum point changes from increase to decrease and minimum point changes from decrease to increase as per the behavior tendency when the organism attains mac stage the behavior strength will decline sharply then the organism could adapt to the current environmental stress so that the behavior strength might increase thus the threshold points of the first maj stage immediately following the mac stage should be the maximum point increase to decrease trend similarly the threshold points that immediately follow the maximum point should be the minimum point decrease to increase trend the actual interval vector method may have several repeated extreme points consecutively for example we should obtain only one maximum point between the two minimum threshold points in the actual interval vector method however there will be two or more maximum points so we need to filter according to the situation we selected the strongest behavior point when there are different maximum points in a region likewise we selected the minimum value of the behavior strength point when there are different minimum points in a region 3 screen out threshold points that do not meet the standard the threshold point difference should be more than 10 suppose the value matching to the mac stage threshold point found earlier to the stage and the immediate maximum point does not exceed 10 in that case it indicates that the organism is at the mac stage and did not get rid of the general downward trend so the threshold point found earlier in the stage cannot be considered to be the required mac threshold point therefore we deleted this point and continued to compare the next pair of points if the difference between the minimum point and the subsequent maximum point is more than 10 then we considered this point as the required point to define the transfer of mac to the maj stage of an organism the third is the mt phase this stage indicates that the organism cannot cope with the current environmental stress thus toxic effects could occur if the behavior strength is lower than 0 2 we consider it the mt stage s start however suppose the behavior strength is lower than 0 2 for a short period in that case could be due to the influence of other factors sudden noise and other interference to avoid misjudging the stage we made a continuous period of judgment if the number n of all consecutive points are below 0 2 then consider the beginning of point 0 2 as the threshold point for the mt phase 3 3 concentration profile based on slope k there are two crucial biologically significant slopes in the dynamic behavioral model 1 the slope of the fitted straight line in the mac phase the slope of the fitted straight line will be a negative value because of the decreasing intensity trend in the mac phase therefore a smaller slope and straight line closer to the vertical x axis indicate that behavior strength decreases drastically noteworthy the decrease of the behavior strength value positively correlated with the concentration of external stress thus the slope value k 1 of the mac stage could also reflect the current concentration of external stress to a certain extent in general the mac stage could occur only once in an organism during monitoring hence the slope value k 1 of mac represents only the concentration of external stress which is not real time note it is mandatory to have more flexible slope values for the long term monitoring process 2 this issue was solved by the slope value k 2 of the maj phase the first important factor is that the duration of the maj phase is longer at this stage if the concentration of external stress does not exceed c 2tu it represents that the organism maintains maj phase for a more extended period additionally the chances for recovering the coping fully acclimatize capacity to the current environment is also higher in the organism at the current environmental stress further the organism has no chance to enter the mt phase the second is there are more threshold points in the maj phase hence we could monitor many mild maj stages the slope of each mild maj stage could characterize the concentration of the external stress certainly to an extent thus the result will be more flexible and real time the biological principle of one to one correspondence between slope and concentration we can derive an appropriate threshold point if we use many experimental data based on different kinds of stress concentrations and individuals on the kinetic model then through the segmentation of the threshold point the characteristic slope of each stage can be fitted and calculated by which we can obtain a slope concentration map thus the changing trend derivative of the behavior strength of the real time monitoring directly could help to evaluate the water quality 3 4 verification of the novel algorithm on real time fish behavior monitoring data different bioindicators fish crustaceans and mussels were employed in water quality monitoring since we can electronically monitor their behavioral responses in real time fish are considered as health indicators of aquatic ecosystem hence it is used routinely in environmental monitoring studies recently studies on fish behavior response to stressors being increased because their responses are 10 100 times more sensitive than other established ecological lines of evidence fish responses are ecologically pertinent for eco toxicology and monitoring water quality moreover fish behavior responses could occur even to a slight change in the environment including weather photoperiods biological events and water quality burnett et al 2020 scientific experts developed different non optical sensing technologies such as mechanical electrical proximity and quadrupole impedance conversion technologies to monitor the biological behavioral response in which electric based sensing non invasive measurements quantifies behavioral intensity in the form of electric signals bownik and wlodkowic 2021 we used metal sensors to quantify the swimming strength of fishes we observed a series of swimming behavior anomalies on fishes exposed to pesticides as shown in fig 1 we could visualize only the safe mode in the control group throughout the study periods in contrast we visualized different behavior stages safe stage acclimatization stage adjustment stages and toxic effect stage in the pesticide treatment groups a concentration based behavior response resulted in the pesticide treated groups the safe mode of the pesticide treatment groups is the shortest we visualized mac mode in all pesticide treatment groups however the duration is concise for 20 tu followed by 10 tu 5 tu 2 tu 1 tu and 0 1 tu in contrast maj is the predominant mode for 0 1 tu 1 tu and 2 tu behavior strength is comparatively higher with few adjustments in 0 1 tu in the case of 1 tu and 2 tu there were continuous adjustments however the behavior strength was found higher in 1 tu when compared to 2 tu mt the predominant mode for 5 tu 10 tu and 20 tu mt is the main mode of action of pesticide affecting the nervous system of an organism alteration in the nervous system could affect the behavior of an organism generally fish tries to escape from the stressors that could result in a change in behavioral intensity thus we visualized different behavioral stages in the present study a series of behavioral responses swimming behavior speed and strength locomotion respiratory anomalies and sheltering behavior of aquatic organisms danio rerio rhamdia quelen hyphessobrycon eques pandalus borealis carassius auratus to pesticide toxicity were reported in different studies bretaud et al 2002 baldissera et al 2021 poopal et al 2021 bamber et al 2021 moreira et al 2021 artificial networking is considered a productive and cost effective methodology for water quality monitoring studies shamshirband et al 2019 tiyasha et al 2020 moreover artificial networking can minimize errors zhou et al 2020 used the kalman filter post processing technique on real time data three gorges reservoir in china the authors noticed that the method could suitably extract the complex non linear dependence structure and overcome the systematic errors we adopted the kalman filter on fish behavior response real time datasets and achieved the output with minimal errors we can use mathematical models to analyze real time data including different types of factors or single factors by including different types of datasets such as hydrological limnological and meteorological data researchers ye and cai 2009 determined the chlorophyll concentration in gorges reservoirs the authors adopted recurrent artificial neural networks we focused on one factor swimming behavior we determined different threshold points for each stage safe acclimatization adjustments and toxic stage as shown in fig 2 a the safe stage of the fish exposed to environmental stress is much shorter we did the following steps to identify the safe stage s th 1 with the first value of the behavior intensity at step size 0 01 we searched for the point that minimizes the residual sum of squares between the experimental data and reference value within the range of the initial value plus or minus 0 1 the search length of this study is five units of length the acclimatization stage occurred rapidly next to the safe stage this stage indicates that fish might sense a change in the external environment hence it acclimatizes however acclimatization has also lasted for even fewer minutes we considered the following procedures to recognize the acclimatization stage on the data primarily we focused on finding the 20 decrease point generally this point is not stationary so we searched for the minimal point that decreases greater note we should know the benchmark value 20 decrease we selected the average value of the behavior intensity within the range of 5 units before the threshold point s th 1 of the safe stage as the benchmark the average value of this study is 0 86 note if the number of points between s th 1 and the starting point does not exceed 5 the average value of behavior strength of all safe phases is the reference value for calculation the point that decreases more than 20 was selected to find the minimum point that meets the conditions in all subsequent data we tentatively set the first minimum point found as the threshold point s th 2 of the acclimatization stage the environmental stress on this threshold is 19 9 tu h and the behavior strength is 0 66 however it is necessary to make further judgments on s th 2 based on the results of the adjustment stage we fitted a straight line based on the change in behavior strength from s th 1 to s th 2 we recorded the slope of the fitted straight lines as k 1 the value is 0 0006 after a shorter acclimatization stage due to the coping ability of fish we visualized serials of re adjustments on the behavior intensity fish could adapt slowly based on the strength of the current environmental stress thus the adjustment stage is comparably longer lasting than other stages to distinguish the occurrence of the adjustment stage we followed the following steps on the behavior intensity we determined the starting point that meets the conditions and the distance between each stationary point set as adaptive adjustment we used 3 3 of the length of the experimental data to screen the stationary point the length of the adjustment mode of this study is 1092 points the screening distance determined is 1092 30 36 4 further we screened the stationary point that meets the 10 conditions note it is better to compare with s th 2 if the first maximum point does not increase more than 10 when compared to s th 2 it indicates that fish did not yet experience the adjustment phase then consider the next minimum point as s th 2 and compare it again the behavior intensity value s th 2 of this study is 0 6575 so the value of the first adjustment threshold point should be higher than 0 7233 we divided the results obtained based on these procedures into two trends table 1 after a prolonged adjustment stage fish coping capacity might be declined due to the cumulative environmental stress this situation could be the end of the adjustment stage and the start of toxic effects at this stage improvement in recovery is not possible thus the behavior intensity resulted lower than 0 2 note if three consecutive points are found lower than 0 2 the first point can be selected as a threshold point s th n 3 for the toxic effect stage 3 5 additional strategies of the proposed mathematical model testing toxicity of chemicals was done in a short duration and the capacity of biological trials and chemical production was increased this led to demands of assessing early fate absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity of chemicals thus in silico models data or molecular modeling gained much attention van de waterbeemd and gifford 2003 sinha et al 2021 differences in modes of toxic action of stressors and responses between species can affect toxicity prediction and risk assessment decision making though toxicity testing is progressing risk assessment strategies remain challenging to implement environmental monitoring punt 2018 wu et al 2020 duong et al 2021 aquatic bioassay is routinely used to determine environmental stress because the organism can respond rapidly to environmental change a different threshold might occur on physiological and biochemical activities in an organism based on the toxic capacity of the stressor for the determination of environmental risk responses of bioassays classified as three p s exposure partitioning toxicokinetic and potency toxicodynamic toxicokinetic modeling helps to predict bioaccumulation dynamics and calculate the duration of bioassays response to stressors nyman et al 2014 ning et al 2019 ashauer et al 2015 geraets et al 2017 dalaijamts et al 2020 mounier et al 2020 nallani et al 2020 gingrich et al 2021 toxicity prediction based on mathematical models and physiologically based pharmacokinetics is a very important and challenging research direction in the future wang and tan 2019 in this study we also demonstrated toxicity prediction by adopting our mathematical model based on the above functions the function curve was derived in this study fig 2b we proved that mathematical toxicokinetic modeling for behavior assessment could quantify the duration and threshold point of each stage reflecting the concentration exposure period and behavior strength of fishes in addition we can compare the existing external stress data with the previous data which can predict the future status of the water ecosystem since every organism can cope with stress a series of behavioral changes can occur and we can monitor each stage of behavioral change therefore we can determine two factors bn and bp stages on the behavior changes of organisms thus the threshold points of each stage are derived by using our mathematical model further based on the toxicokinetic model of zhang et al 2019 if we consider bn as external stress concentration of pollutant sout and bp as internal stress in the organism sin we could determine the stress in the organism when the internal concentration of the pollutant is lower than the organism s tolerance internal stress might reduce as a result the transformation of bp to bn could be obtained in the dataset under the continuous or higher external pollutant concentration the organism might have certain permeability as however the organism might continuously metabolize the pollutants as detoxification fad thus the combined effect of permeability and metabolic function helps determine the internal stress of an organism by adopting the toxicokinetic model on the behavior dataset we determined the internal stress of fish fig 2c the octanol water partition coefficient kow of pesticides is higher than 3 thus the possibility of accumulation is higher on organisms rossi et al 2020 the authors also mentioned that eliminating pesticides affected under continuous or higher concentrations could enhance the accumulation of pesticides on organisms water quality prediction based on biological behavior responses is a developing strategy the recent development is method feasibility verification this study focused on the toxicokinetic model and developed a method mathematical model to improve the water quality prediction assessment since different factors affect the behavior changes of an organism and the monitoring process we assess the biological behavior responses under environmental stress conditions the method proposed in this study is convenient for calculation when developing a model for quantifying biological responses all derivations were realized under ideal conditions for example in eq 5 we simplified the environmental parameter f p i s f as 0 likewise to study the adjustment stage we use constants λ n λ p these simple derivations help in the identification of threshold points precisely 4 conclusions and outlook research on biological responses to water quality monitoring and toxicity prediction has been increasing in recognition in the last few years a great deal of biological response data has been produced through online monitoring systems however comprehensive information on biological response is missing consequently biological responses cannot be used to monitor water quality we used the persistent model on behavioral strength data and derived a mathematic model to solve these issues safe acclimatization adjustment and toxicity stages can be derived using a novel mathematic model moreover the mathematic model can also derive the threshold point for each stage safe acclimatization adjustment and toxicity stages precisely limitations however the model cannot automatically combine each stage organically through the threshold at present the judgment of the threshold is based on the empirical model future directions by comparing the current result it is possible to find the threshold of each stage through mathematical demonstration and combine the derivation results with the expression of each stage towards a complete mathematical expression model of biological behavior strength suppose the complete modeling of biological behavior strength that is find the corresponding relationship between environmental stress and biological behavior strength is derived in that case the method could be a reliable theoretical model for the online environmental monitoring and toxicity prediction studies water quality prediction is a developing strategy in eco toxicology we achieved water quality prediction toxicokinetic by adopting our mathematic model we propose that the novel mathematical model is a convenient and powerful tool to predict the biological responses towards water quality prediction and monitoring future research is desired to focus on adopting the novel mathematic model in different research areas such as food quality assessment and prediction aspects all types of
