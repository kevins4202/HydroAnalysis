14740,widespread implementation of on site water reuse is hindered by the limited availability of monitoring approaches that ensure microbial quality during operation in this study we developed a methodology for monitoring microbial water quality in on site water reuse systems using inexpensive and commercially available online sensors an extensive dataset containing sensor and microbial water quality data for six of the most critical types of disruptions in membrane bioreactors with chlorination was collected we then tested the ability of three typological machine learning algorithms logistic regression support vector machine and random forest to predict the microbial water quality as safe or unsafe for reuse the main criteria for model optimization was to ensure a low false positive rate fpr the percentage of safe predictions when the actual condition is unsafe which is essential to protect users health this resulted in enforcing a fixed fpr 2 maximizing the true positive rate tpr the percentage of safe predictions when the actual condition is safe was given second priority our results show that logistic regression based models using only two out of the six sensors free chlorine and oxidation reduction potential achieved the highest tpr including sensor slopes as engineered features allowed to reach similar tprs using only one sensor instead of two analysis of the occurrence of false predictions showed that these were mostly early alarms a characteristic that could be regarded as an asset in alarm management in conclusion the simplest algorithm in combination with only one or two sensors performed best at predicting the microbial water quality this result provides useful insights for water quality modeling or for applications where small datasets are a common challenge and a general advantage might be gained by using simpler models that reduce the risk of overfitting allow better interpretability and require less computational power

water sanitation and hygiene rodriguez et al 2020 and increase water use efficiency wilcox et al 2016 but only if the reclaimed water is safe for the intended reuse application treatment technologies for on site water reuse are increasingly becoming available membrane bioreactors mbrs produce higher effluent quality than conventional treatment processes and are considered a best available technology for the treatment of wastewater from as few as 20 people diaz elsayed et al 2019 lesjean et al 2011 mbr based treatment systems are often combined with chlorination to ensure high microbial water quality and to meet disinfection requirements set by regulatory agencies hirani et al 2014 mbr with chlorine disinfection mbr cl2 is a well tried and robust combination of technologies for water reclamation with a low probability of treatment disruptions hirani et al 2014 however even a single day of disrupted operation can pose a risk to human health schoen et al 2018 therefore monitoring systems must be established to ensure microbially safe water when hazardous events occur branch et al 2016 currently no widely applicable online monitoring exists for mbr cl2 systems which constitutes a major bottleneck for their real world application reynaert et al 2021 microbial water quality targets depend on the specific reuse context because mbr cl2 systems can treat various types of water such as mixed wastewater or source separated greywater for a range of reuse applications such as landscaping toilet flushing and showering at different scales including household and building scale quantitative microbial risk assessment can be used to calculate treatment log removal targets lrts for pathogens for combinations of wastewater qualities reuse applications and reuse scales which thus ensures that the risk to human health remains below a certain benchmark who 2016 stochastic models have been applied to determine the monitoring frequencies required to prevent a significant increase in risk as a function of the lrt these indicate that frequencies as low as 1 s are required to verify a lrt of 7 smeets 2010 manual sampling and laboratory based analytical methods at such frequencies are impractical due to high costs consequently online monitoring of the microbial water quality becomes indispensable for high risk applications soft sensors are software based models which are increasingly used to predict response variables that are difficult to measure with data that can be obtained by more easily applicable methods haimi et al 2013 soft sensors have been developed for monitoring the effluent quality of drinking water aliashrafi et al 2021 and on site wastewater treatment plants haimi et al 2013 schneider et al 2019 so far such soft sensing approaches have primarily been used to predict physicochemical water quality parameters or fecal indicator bacteria such as e coli for instance bedell et al 2022 use fluorescence measurements with an ensemble learning method to detect and quantify e coli in a drinking water supply similarly foschi et al 2021 use a range of conventional measurements including ph conductivity turbidity and uv absorbance and neural networks to predict e coli in wastewater disinfection inflow in mbr cl2 systems fecal indicator bacteria are not the most critical group of enteric pathogens because they are mostly retained by the membrane in contrast to enteric viruses which are smaller and more resistant to many treatment processes zhu et al 2020 even if enteric pathogens are removed by the treatment process bacteria including opportunistic pathogens can regrow in the treated water without a disinfection residual garner et al 2019 nocker et al 2020 the present study aims to develop a methodology that couples risk based approaches with machine learning algorithms to issue an alarm if microbial water quality targets for minimum virus removal and maximum bacterial regrowth are not met we compare the predictive power for virus removal and bacterial regrowth in mbr cl2 systems of three typological machine learning algorithms logistic regression support vector machine and random forest we used data from inexpensive and commercially available online sensors free chlorine fc oxidation reduction potential orp ph turbidity conductivity and temperature the models are trained to prioritize human health by minimizing predictions that water is safe for reuse when it is not and we also make a detailed analysis of the consequences of this conservative approach for the frequency of false alarms in a related paper reynaert et al 2023 provide sensor setpoints that allow tuning the chlorination to a certain water quality e g a certain log removal value for viruses but these sensor setpoints are valid for standard operation i e for situations during which the water reuse system are operating under non disrupted conditions only the setpoints can thus not be used to predict the water quality in real time the present study aims to fill this gap and provide a real time prediction of the microbial water quality under dynamic operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr cl2 system water wall the mbr cl2 system used in this study is referred to as the water wall reynaert et al 2020 the water wall see fig 1 consists of two main components the core treatment takes place in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 after which the water is polished and disinfected in the second component a clean water tank the bambi reactor contains a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra langgöns germany with a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration is introduced directly below the membrane module the reactor is operated in a gravity driven membrane configuration in which the pressure on the membrane is supplied only by the water head peter varbanets et al 2010 water that passes through the membrane is collected in a permeate reservoir 10 cm polyvinyl chloride pipe connected to the membrane module permeate outlet holding volume of 4 l from where it is pumped through a granular activated carbon filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston usa to the clean water tank in the clean water tank a concentrated naocl solution 1750 mg cl2 l is pumped into the tank at regular intervals 3 s on 250 s off to reach a concentration of 1 mg l of free chlorine mixing in the clean water tank is ensured through a submersed pump that operates for 30 s every 5 min water from the clean water tank is constantly recirculated through three sensor flow cells at a rate of 0 5 l min the tank volumes are 60 l water for the reactor and 25 l for the clean water tank and average hydraulic residence times are 19 h in the reactor and 5 h in the clean water tank a total of 3 75 l day of concentrated feed is pumped into the reactor in 50 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day this daily feed represents the loading that would be introduced by a total of 75 l of water of real hand washing or source separated toilet flush water equivalent to the usage of a 10 person household the same amount of water is removed from the system to maintain a constant volume 2 2 standard operation of the water wall two full scale water walls were operated in this study one mimicked the recycling of source separated toilet flush water separated from the majority of urine and feces wwtf and the other handwashing greywater wwhw the composition of the 20 concentrated feed solutions is presented in the supplementary information si 1 the water walls were operated for several days under stable conditions as described above with constant feed and 1 mg l of chlorine in the treated water before they were subject to the disruptions described in section 2 1 2 2 3 disruptions of operation failure mode and effects analysis is a systematic method for identifying the possible failures that pose the most significant overall risk to a process we used this type of analysis to estimate four human health relevant failures per year and identified the most problematic failure modes more information in si 2 the following disruptions were experimentally simulated and are ordered according to their risk priority number occurrence severity effort for remediation 1 aeration off breakdown of the aeration for example due to pump breakdown or clogging of the aeration tubes leads to ammonia in the permeate due to incomplete nitrification which consumes the free chlorine in the clean water tank the aeration pump was manually deactivated to simulate the breakdown of the aeration 2 chlorine off breakdown of the chlorination for example due to pump breakdown tube clogging or no refill of chlorine solution leads to a decrease of chlorine concentrations in the treated water the pump was manually deactivated to simulate a breakdown of the chlorine pump 3 power off a power outage can cause elevated concentrations of organics and ammonia in the permeate which consumes the free chlorine once the power is back and permeate is pumped into the clean water tank the aeration pump and the permeate pump were manually deactivated to simulate a power outage 4 high usage high usage of the systems for instance during a party can cause elevated concentrations of organics and ammonia in the permeate high usage of the system was simulated through a 15 fold increase of the concentrated feed 5 membrane damage membrane damage can lead to direct passage of contaminants into the treated water membrane damage was simulated by pumping liquid from the reactor into the clean water tank at a flow rate of 1 6 l h simulating a 0 5 mm diameter hole in the membrane 6 toxic substance a spill of a toxic substance into the biological treatment tank can be harmful to the biomass in the reactor and can result in increased concentrations of organics and ammonia in the permeate this disruption was simulated by the instantaneous addition of 1 l of a cleaning substance 0 5 sodium hypochlorite into the reactor during the disruptions frequent samples were taken to assess the microbial water quality see section 2 2 sampling started before the start of the disruption and continued until the microbial water quality was stable i e there was no further deterioration of the water quality for all disruptions it took several hours after the start of the disruption for the water quality to deteriorate due to the robustness of the water wall technology disruptions were mimicked between december 2021 and march 2022 after each disruption the water walls were given at least three days to recover before the next disruption was simulated timeline of experiments presented in si 3 3 data 3 1 online sensors we investigated established commercially available sensors with promising mechanistic relationships with microbial water quality and excluded sensors that we considered too costly for small scale applications five sensors were installed in sensor flow cells to monitor the water quality orp fc ph and temperature turbidity and conductivity table 1 promising new sensing approaches such as online atp measurements or online flow cytometry were excluded in this study focusing on on site reuse systems due to high costs and requirement for qualified operating personnel and consumables reference measurements were taken with the recommended buffer solutions for orp 220 mv and ph ph 4 and 7 the ph sensors were calibrated whenever the drift was larger than 0 2 the fc sensor was calibrated with reference free chlorine measurements hach dpd test kits 0 2 mg l free chlorine hach loveland usa at the flow cell turbidity conductivity and temperature sensors were not calibrated during the experiments sensor measurements were automatically logged at 5 min intervals 3 2 microbial water quality microbial water quality was evaluated for the removal of enteric pathogens and regrowth of pathogens in the treated water we used the bacteriophage ms2 as an indicator of the removal of enteric viruses a concentrated solution of ms2 was spiked into the feed the log removal value lrv was calculated as 1 l r v m s 2 log 10 c c w t c f e e d f c o n c where c c w t is the ms2 concentration in the clean water tank c f e e d the ms2 concentration in the concentrated feed and f c o n c is the concentration factor of the feed the double agar layer method was used to enumerate ms2 as described in detail in reynaert et al 2023 regrowth was quantified as the total concentration of bacterial cells with an intact membrane and measured using flow cytometry as described in reynaert et al 2023 the regrowth of human enteric pathogenic viruses in the treated water is not anticipated due to the absence of host cells zhu et al 2020 3 3 development of prediction models the overall goal of this study was to predict whether microbial water quality targets are met using machine learning algorithms in machine learning simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn result in a model bias the amount that the estimate of the target function will change if different training data is used is termed the variance the model bias can only be decreased at the cost of a higher variance or vice versa resulting in a bias variance tradeoff briscoe and feldman 2011 in this study we selected three commonly used algorithms with differing bias variance tradeoffs logistic regression logit has high bias and low variance it models the probability of the water quality meeting the microbial target as a logistic sigmoid function of a linear combination of one or more features logit represents the most basic regression method for binary classification and was used as a benchmark method against which the other algorithms were compared for models using only one feature as input the logicistic regression comes down to fixing a threshold for this feature support vector machine svm has intermediate bias and intermediate variance it separates the water quality into two classes unlike logit the separation does not need to be linear svm creates a hyperplane decision boundary by applying transformations to the input data if the data is not linearly separable kernel trick random forest rf has low bias and high variance it is an ensemble learning method that randomly sets up a large number of decision trees made of sequential binary decisions the final prediction is then calculated as the average from the final predictions of all trees the development of prediction models using these three algorithms is illustrated in fig 2 and described in the following subsections all models were implemented using the scikit learn 1 1 2 package pedregosa et al 2011 for python 3 van rossum and drake 2009 the code can be downloaded from https doi org 10 25678 000885 3 4 microbial water quality targets to assess the microbial quality of reclaimed water water reuse frameworks specify various lrts for the removal of enteric pathogens depending on the contamination of the wastewater and the reuse application monitoring needs to be optimized for specific water quality targets reynaert et al 2021 to demonstrate the applicability of the approach to various water quality requirements we present results for two virus lrts lrt 5 and 6 and two maximum concentrations of intact cells icc log10icc 4 and 5 from which the microbial water quality was classified into two categories safe meeting the target and unsafe not meeting the target for lrt the lower value represents a less stringent target lrt 5 can represent the virus removal required when reusing greywater from a 1000 people collection system for toilet flushing and lrt 6 can represent the removal required when reusing the same water for indoor reuse schoen et al 2017 for icc the lower value represents a stricter quality target we cannot define risk based targets here as the icc reflects the entire bacterial community and is not representative of pathogens however it is possible to define typical icc values for a specific system van nevel et al 2017 3 5 standardization of sensor data before being used as input to the machine learning algorithms the sensor measurements were standardized to zero mean and one standard deviation 3 6 training validation and testing the disruption dataset was balanced meaning that the numbers of safe and unsafe data points were similar the percentages of safe data points were 58 lrt ms2 6 60 lrt ms2 5 74 log10icc 5 and 51 log10icc 4 the data was divided into a training validation dataset and a test dataset as presented in table 2 for testing we used either the disruption data alone or an assembled test dataset representative of realistic operation disruption test data this dataset was balanced with respect to the numbers of safe or unsafe data points testing on the disruption test data provided information on the model performance during failures of the water wall and served to verify if all occurrences when the water was not safe for reuse were correctly detected user perspective realistic test data the disruption dataset is not representative of realistic operation where the water is safe over 99 of the time therefore we assembled a dataset from sensor data from standard undisrupted operation combined with four disruptions per year see section 2 1 2 from baseline measurements of the microbial water quality the water was assumed to always be safe in standard operation the 13 disruptions included in the test dataset allowed standard operation to be simulated for 3 25 years testing with the realistic dataset served to verify that the percentage of false alarms remained low in long term operation operator perspective 3 7 feature engineering and hybrid modeling principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of the sensor measurements khalid et al 2014 the optimal number of principal components was chosen using cross validation during the parameter optimization of the machine learning models see section 2 3 5 additionally to sensor measurements the rate of change of sensor measurements over time termed sensor slope was used to include mechanistic knowledge about the system dynamics the temporal dynamics of lrv ms2 and log10icc differ depending on the system state deterioration of the water quality is a relatively slow process as it takes time for ms2 to enter the clean water tank and thus for lrv ms2 to decrease and for bacterial cells to grow in the clean water tank and thus for log10icc to increase for instance it will take at least one hrt for the water in the clean water tank to be replaced and thus for the lrv ms2 to decrease to 0 in contrast the water quality can be improved almost instantly if sufficient chlorine is added to disinfect it combining this process knowledge with the machine learning approach was a first test whether hybrid modeling is promising for mbr cl2 systems hybrid modeling here means the combination of data driven and mechanistic models schneider et al 2022 3 8 model optimization model performance was evaluated using the confusion matrix presented in table 3 the true positive rate tpr and false positive rate fpr were calculated using the following equations 2 t p r t p t p f n 3 f p r f p f p t n optimal model hyperparameters confidence thresholds and number of components from pca were identified using a grid search with reasonable parameter values the assumption underlying this parameter optimization was that a low fpr is more important because these are false predictions that will put users health at risk the tpr was given second priority thus reducing the number of fns and associated false alarms the models were trained and validated with leave one out cross validation in which replicates of one disruption type for each reactor together termed a disruption set were removed from the training dataset at each iteration and used to validate the model leave one out cross validation is a resampling technique appropriate for relatively small datasets when a highly accurate estimate of model performance is required wong 2015 3 9 selection of fpr operating point we computed optimization curves representing the highest tpr achieved for a certain fpr and evaluated the gain in tpr per increase in fpr based on the optimization curves we selected an fpr that was enforced during model training and validation 3 10 model evaluation the fpr and tpr were reported on both the training and validation dataset and the test datasets comprising disruption test data and realistic test data for the best performing models the detailed analysis included 1 decision boundary maps to visualize the test datasets and for easier interpretability of model predictions and 2 time series of predictions for a closer evaluation of the occurrence of fps and fns note that the fpr on the test datasets is not suitable to compare the actual performance of the different models but rather to verify that the fpr selected as an operating point see section 2 3 6 is achievable 4 results 4 1 experimental data effect of disruptions on the microbial water quality understanding the relations of sensor measurements to water quality is critical to the success of predictive models one major outcome of this study is a large dataset consisting of 32 disruptions 500 data points with detailed information on changes in microbial water quality lrv of ms2 and log10icc and sensor measurements fig 3 shows the standard operation and typical effects of the six types of disruption simulated and the restart of chlorination on microbial water quality and on the sensor measurements the complete dataset for all 32 simulated disruptions to two reactors is available at https doi org 10 25678 000885 fig 3 shows that orp values and fc concentrations both consistently decreased with deteriorations in the microbial water quality turbidity measurements also varied during some of the disruptions e g membrane damage but not for all and not in a way that was consistent with the changes in microbial water quality conductivity only changed during the toxic substance scenario finally neither the ph nor the temperature varied more in disruptive operation than during the standard operation without disruptions the microbial water quality was stable throughout the testing with lrv ms2 6 4 and log10icc 2 7 fig 3 standard operation 4 2 selection of suitable fpr operating point fig 4 shows the optimization curves that were used to select a suitable fpr the optimization curve represents the optimized tpr for a certain fpr determined from a grid search of possible model parameters each point on an optimization curve thus represents different hyperparameters and confidence thresholds from the other points these optimization curves differ from commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc curves that are computed for one model i e one set of hyperparameters fpr and tpr results are reported on the training and validation dataset using leave one out validation models can use all possible combinations of sensor measurements as input for instance for an svm algorithm trained to predict meeting a lrt ms2 of 6 using measurements from six sensors the optimized tpr is 46 if no fp are allowed 58 if an fpr of 1 is allowed and 68 if an fpr of 2 is allowed fig 4 a for a fpr above 2 the tpr only increases slowly meaning that we have to allow a significantly higher fpr to increase the tpr the optimization curves serve two purposes 1 selection of operating points when selecting operating points the goal was to keep the fpr as low as possible fig 4 indicates that selecting a fpr of 0 is not an appropriate choice as this is associated with very low tprs allowing the fpr to increase to 1 or 2 is associated with significantly higher tprs for a fpr above 2 the gain in tpr per increase in fpr is much lower a fpr of 2 was thus selected as a sensible choice for training the monitoring algorithms 2 performance comparison of logit svm and rf fig 4 shows that logit and svm often overlap therefore they perform similarly whereas rf is associated with lower tprs consequently further model analysis was conducted for operating points at fpr 2 4 3 comparison of tprs from different models table 4 shows the fprs and tprs of models using single sensors two sensors and all sensors as features all models were trained to meet an fpr 2 the single sensor models with the highest tpr were orp and fc and two sensor combinations with the highest tpr were orp fc results are reported for the training and validation data the disruption test data and the realistic test data to be classified as performing well highlighted in green models needed to satisfy two conditions i fpr 2 in the disruption test datasets and ii classification of the standard operation data as safe in the realistic test dataset the fpr on the test datasets cannot be used to compare the performance of different models as long as the condition from i is met see section 2 3 7 four key results emerge from table 4 1 logit and svm were associated with higher tprs than rf although rf performed relatively well on the training and validation data the rf models seem to overfit the performance significantly decreased on the test datasets with the fpr frequently exceeding 2 and the standard operation data being misclassified comparing the less complex logit with the more complex svm we can observe that in this study based on an inherently small dataset the model complexity has neither a positive nor a negative effect on the tpr 2 for most models considered the tpr was 99 when calculated for the realistic test dataset this result shows that most models correctly classified the standard operation data as safe exception see point 3 below 3 the monitoring algorithm development requires correctly classifying the standard operation data as safe none of the models tested performed well for a log10 icc of 4 where the models incorrectly classified the standard operation data as unsafe resulting in a low tpr on the realistic test dataset 4 compared to single sensor models the combination of information from orp and fc improved the models predictive capacity for both aspects keeping the fpr below 2 in the test dataset and correctly classifying the standard operation data as safe however including more sensors did not generally improve the tpr we even observed a tipping point beyond which including all sensors reduced performance compared to the orp fc based models logit based models using orp fc as input perform as well as svm but are less computationally intensive therefore a detailed evaluation of logit based models using orp fc is presented in the following sections 1 1 note figure 4 in section 3 2 presents optimization curves for models using six sensors the optimization curve presented in si 5 confirms that a fpr of 2 for the training and validation stage is also a sensible choice for models based only on orp fc 4 4 decision boundary maps high performance is required not only on the training and validation dataset but also on the test dataset table 4 has already indicated that the models can achieve a low fpr and high tpr in the test datasets as well fig 5 enables more detailed evaluation from decision boundary maps the decision boundary maps show the probability of water being safe gray shaded area and the decision boundaries selected for the logit based models using orp fc as input the maps visualize how the models classify the water quality as safe area right of the decision boundary or unsafe area left of the decision boundary and allow evaluating how well the models are able to separate the two water quality classes in fig 5a1 c1 lrt ms2 6 and 5 log10 target of 5 for icc all cases where the water was unsafe in the disruption test dataset are classified correctly no fps represented as red triangles but some occurrences of water being safe are classified incorrectly these incorrect classifications illustrate the consequence of selecting conservative decision boundaries in contrast there were three fps for a log10 icc of 4 fig 5d1 the decision boundary would have had to be considerably more conservative to avoid these fps at the cost of a low tpr interestingly the best performing svm models also had linear decision boundaries which explains why both svm and logit have similar performance results shown in si 6 minimizing fpr at the cost of the tpr of the disruption dataset relies on the algorithm always classifying the water correctly as safe in standard undisrupted operation from the high tpr on the realistic dataset we can see that this is the case for all scenarios except for a log10 icc of 4 see table 4 fig 5a2 d2 provide more detail on the classification for the standard operation all points in standard operation are located far from the decision boundary in plots a2 c2 implying a low probability of misclassification in contrast plot d2 log10 icc of 4 shows that the data from the standard operation is close to the decision boundary with a few occurrences where the model misclassifies the standard operation data fns represented as orange triangles 4 5 time series of predictions table 4 indicates that we can achieve tprs between 64 and 82 in the disruption test datasets logit using orp fc as inputs while meeting the selected fpr of 2 however even low rates of fns can lead to high operation costs caused by false alarms and a loss of trust in the system by the user it is thus important to understand more precisely when fps and fns occur to determine a management strategy fig 6 a and fig 6b show examples of prediction errors for an fp and fns during training and validation of a logit based model using orp fc as input fig 6a indicates that the confidence in the water being safe is around the same for the tps as for the fp 0 75 optimizing the model meeting a ms2 lrt of 6 to have zero fps instead of one through an increase of the decision boundary dashed line would massively decrease the tpr due to an increase of fns results are reported on the training validation dataset because there are no fps in the test dataset for the two sensor models predicting ms2 lrt conversely fig 6b training validation dataset and fig 6d test dataset show that fns occur before the water quality falls below the treatment target and thus represent early alarms unlike false alarms that occur randomly an appropriate alarm management can mitigate these early alarms for instance by using them for early interventions this implies that the early alarms can become an asset when handled properly the time series of predictions for both mbr cl2 systems and all simulated disruptions can be found in si 4 4 6 hybrid models the data driven approach presented in the previous sections was combined with mechanistic knowledge in a hybrid approach by including the sensor slopes sensor slopes allow the models to distinguish between deterioration and improvement of water quality table 5 presents the tprs and changes in tpr compared to the results from the data driven model in table 4 for logit based hybrid models including orp slopes slope over 90 min and or fc slopes slope over 210 min results for all models including svm and rf are presented in si 7 the time intervals used for the slope calculation were chosen to maximize the tpr table 5 shows that the tpr can be increased by up to 25 percentage points on the training and validation dataset often even with a lower fpr see si 7 for hybrid models using orp orp slope the performance on the test dataset can almost match the performance of the orp fc based data driven models however table 5 also shows that this increase in tpr cannot always be transferred to the disruption test dataset although there is an increase in tpr for models using orp orp slope and fc fc slope the tpr of the models using both orp fc and their respective slopes has a substantially lower tpr on the test dataset than the purely data driven model one reason for this decrease in tpr may be an overfit of the model during the training and validation stage 5 discussion 5 1 selection of machine learning algorithms no tradeoff between bias and variance although the dataset generated for this study 500 data points from 32 disruption events can be considered large for microbial water quality measurements it is not comparable to typical volumes and velocities of big data zhou et al 2017 in their review on data driven modeling of drinking water treatment aliashrafi et al 2021 show that neural networks are most commonly used to model water quality followed by svm decision trees and rf logistic regression has not been widely used because most studies focus on regression rather than classification in this study we did not include neural networks because their training data requirement is substantially larger than those of svm and rf osisanwo et al 2017 our results show that more easily interpretable logit based models performed on par with the more complex black box model svm and rf based models had lower tprs than both consequently this dataset produced no tradeoff between bias and variance logit based models with low bias also had the lowest variance the similar performances of logit and svm might be due to the limited size of the dataset because overfitting issues can arise when applying more complex machine learning algorithms to small datasets small datasets are a common challenge in water quality modeling aliashrafi et al 2021 an additional challenge is the variability of water quality measurements inherent in microbial indicator measurements such as ms2 levy et al 2012 therefore a general advantage might be gained by using simpler models that reduce the risk of overfitting allow better interpretability and require less computational power this is especially true for controlled environments such as the mbr cl2 systems investigated in this study where we do not expect complex underlying patterns that can be encountered in natural systems in mbr cl2 systems the inactivation of viruses and prevention of bacterial regrowth is mostly achieved with chlorination thus we expected that orp and fc sensors which measure the disinfection capacity and the concentration of chlorine respectively would be promising predictors of the microbial water quality reynaert et al 2023 in this study we observed that models using two sensors orp fc or even only one sensor orp orp slope performed better on the test dataset than models including all sensors possible reasons for the lower performance of models using all sensors may include 1 the low enforced fpr as the first classification errors occurred very soon when using all sensors whereas higher fprs models including all sensors had tprs similar to the two sensor models and 2 the small size of the dataset which increases the risk of overfitting when using input from multiple sensors the outputs from machine learning models need to be interpretable humans need to understand the reasoning behind the model outcome if they are to trust it and the use of blackbox models in health relevant applications is linked with concerns around accountability safety and liability aliashrafi et al 2021 however increased interpretability can come at the cost of lower accuracy a tradeoff that has been observed for instance in a study aiming to predict e coli concentrations in agricultural water weller et al 2021 the present study s identification of an easily interpretable algorithm in combination with only one or two sensors in a known mechanistic relationship yielding the highest tprs is a very positive outcome it shows that we can have both high accuracy and good interpretability with the same models as an additional advantage logit is less computationally intensive and can easily be implemented in practical applications 5 2 conservative training no tradeoff between detecting all failures and false alarms detecting all failures is crucial to limiting microbial risk but avoiding false alarms is also important for operation costs storey et al 2011 and presumably user acceptance of water reuse systems while there are no studies on the effect of false alarms on user acceptance studies have reported technology failure as a cause for a detrimental effect on the public acceptance of small scale water reuse systems domènech and saurí 2010 our results show that we can reach tprs of between 70 and 80 when enforcing a conservative fpr of 2 an important question is whether this tpr is sufficiently high to keep operational costs and the deterioration of user acceptance caused by false alarms reasonably low our results indicate that this is the case for two reasons 1 fns did not occur randomly but were usually early alarms appropriate alarm management can mitigate these early alarms and even use the early alarms as an asset for instance reactive systems could increase chlorination when a deterioration of the water quality is detected either preventing a health critical deterioration or providing additional time for intervention 2 because mbr cl2 based water reuse systems such as the water wall provide robust treatment they are in standard undisrupted operation most of the time with water quality meeting the microbial quality targets schoen et al 2018 the tpr for realistic operation standard operation with four disruptions per year was thus 99 in most cases these results also highlight the importance of training and validating models on a disruption dataset and using the fpr and tpr to evaluate model performance because of the high number of cases classified as safe in the realistic operation dataset a trivial classifier that predicts every case as safe could still have achieved a very high overall accuracy but missed all the cases when the water did not meet the microbial quality targets monard and batista 2002 it is possible that model performance could be further improved through an optimized sampling strategy in this study it was not always possible to capture the exact moment of change in microbial water quality leading to a datasets that mostly consists of very good or very poor water quality but misses intermediate water qualities this is for example visible in fig 6 a where the single false positive prediction was for an intermediate water quality the prediction models developed in this study could be used to inform researchers or practicioners when changes in microbial water quality are most likely and additional samples should be taken 5 3 prediction models have to be trained for specific microbial water quality targets in this study we trained models for two virus lrts and two maximum concentrations of intact cells for actual deployment the models must be trained for system specific microbial water quality targets for virus removal the lrts will depend on the wastewater composition reuse application and scale of the water reuse system and can be taken from water reuse frameworks if the specific wastewater compositions and reuse applications are covered or calculated using quantitative microbial risk assessment who 2016 water reuse frameworks typically include no requirements for the icc as the icc is not representative of pathogens however several studies have suggested that the icc can be used to measure process performance cheswick et al 2019 van nevel et al 2017 here baseline measurements of icc during standard operation can provide information on the variability of anticipated icc levels and help select appropriate targets in the present study we observed that it is possible to train the models for a range of microbial water quality targets however the models could no longer distinguish between safe and unsafe states for the more stringent water quality target for icc log10icc 4 this result highlights one requirement for the prediction the quality target cannot be too close to the standard operation data or standard operation is classified wrongly too often monitoring models can be trained for a range of microbial water quality targets but water quality targets cannot be arbitrarily chosen for a given system for the log10icc 4 target the distinction between safe and unsafe system states would have been difficult even for humans as icc values sometimes rose above the set threshold in standard operation 6 limitations and future directions 6 1 generalizability many machine learning models can yield good results with training data but perform poorly on new or unseen samples because the ability of conventional models to extrapolate to data outside of the training range is limited in this study we tested two setups of the water wall treating different wastewater inputs our results indicate that the algorithms can be applied to different water types we divided the disruption dataset into a training and validation dataset and a test dataset consequently by including only one disruption type in the test dataset we were able to verify that the models can predict unseen experiments however the experimental setup used here does not enable us to assess the generalizability of the models to completely new reactors the best performing models rely solely on orp and fc measurements that have mechanistic relationships with the microbial water quality and we therefore expect the models to be generalizable to new mbr cl2 systems in this study including sensor slopes did not significantly increase the tpr for models using orp fc measurements as inputs we term the inclusion of sensor slopes hybrid modeling as these engineered features allowed the models to differentiate between two system states namely deterioration typically a slow process and improvement typically a fast process of the microbial water quality however we hypothesize that hybrid modeling might also increase transferability to new systems because other mbr cl2 systems may have other baseline values during standard operation especially for orp this could not be tested in the present study as both water walls had similar orp levels schneider et al 2020 showed the feasibility of monitoring the physicochemical water quality of on site wastewater treatment plants using engineered features such as inflection points of sensor measurements without plant specific retuning of the soft sensors assessing the generalizability of these models to new mbr cl2 systems and ensuring their applicability to real life contexts will require them to be validated in operational mbr cl2 water reuse systems one particular challenge will be verifying virus removal as the spiking of ms2 is not possible in such systems here using indicators such as coliphage that are naturally present could be an alternative but will likely need to be coupled with concentration methods due to low concentrations in the wastewater that do not allow the verification of high log removals 6 2 increasing the redundancy of the monitoring system our results quantify how a decrease in the number of sensors fc orp vs orp alone increases the rate of false negative predictions but they also show that these fns are effectively early alarms for the actual deployment of such monitoring approaches selecting the most suitable models and developing alarm management strategies will depend on the monitoring and maintenance scheme envisioned bedell et al 2022 this study shows that it is possible to achieve the highest tprs with only a few sensors e g orp fc or orp alone this is beneficial in terms of cost and model interpretability but predictions rely more heavily on single sensors with unclear consequences for long term implementation where sensors might drift or even fail at some point in on site water reuse systems regular checks and maintenance by humans are a challenge schneider et al 2019 but several solutions may be implemented for increased robustness in real life deployments 1 add monitoring redundancy by implementing several identical sensors this is a particularly interesting option for orp based models because orp sensors are relatively inexpensive making this a financially more viable option than fc orp based models monitoring redundancy can be helpful when reconstructing sensors where a sensor validation system detects faulty sensors the remaining measurements can be used to reconstruct the faulty sensors thus allowing more robust process monitoring yoo et al 2008 2 include plausibility checks by including anomaly detection strategies for instance by using active learning with human expert labeling russo et al 2020 or automatically evaluating credible values and their mutual compatibility isermann 2011 for instance in monitoring systems using orp and fc sensors the nernst equation which permits the calculation of the reduction potential of a reaction can be used to verify the compatibility between the two measurements 3 introduce deliberate system dynamics to test that sensors are reacting as expected for instance by registering a daily chlorine peak this strategy has been suggested by thürlimann et al 2019 they achieved long term stability of a urine nitrification process that relied on ph control by introducing regular intended changes in ph and using information about the sensor s reaction to correct for sensor drift 7 conclusion when working with microbial water quality data the inherently small size of such laboratory analysis derived datasets will constrain the selection of suitable machine learning algorithms in this study we show that simple models using logistic regression predicted the microbial water quality in mbr cl2 water reuse systems as well as did more complex black box models with the additional advantages of better interpretability and potentially transferability to other systems the main goal of the monitoring models developed here was to ensure user safety by limiting false positive predictions that water is safe when actually it is unsafe we observed that the monitoring models are well suited for early warning systems as the resulting false negative predictions that water is unsafe when actually it is were not only false alarms but also early warnings monitoring algorithms need to be trained for specific applications in this study we successfully trained and tested models for microbial water quality targets corresponding to different reuse applications however the results also illustrate the limitation of this approach with false classifications occurring when the microbial water quality targets are too close to the standard operation data for some models the tpr was improved by including sensor slopes an engineered feature selected through mechanistic understanding of the system although this study does not systematically investigate the application of engineered features the results highlight the potential of hybrid models that include system understanding to improve prediction accuracies and reduce costs by requiring fewer sensors credit authorship contribution statement eva reynaert conceptualization methodology data collection formal analysis visualization

14740,widespread implementation of on site water reuse is hindered by the limited availability of monitoring approaches that ensure microbial quality during operation in this study we developed a methodology for monitoring microbial water quality in on site water reuse systems using inexpensive and commercially available online sensors an extensive dataset containing sensor and microbial water quality data for six of the most critical types of disruptions in membrane bioreactors with chlorination was collected we then tested the ability of three typological machine learning algorithms logistic regression support vector machine and random forest to predict the microbial water quality as safe or unsafe for reuse the main criteria for model optimization was to ensure a low false positive rate fpr the percentage of safe predictions when the actual condition is unsafe which is essential to protect users health this resulted in enforcing a fixed fpr 2 maximizing the true positive rate tpr the percentage of safe predictions when the actual condition is safe was given second priority our results show that logistic regression based models using only two out of the six sensors free chlorine and oxidation reduction potential achieved the highest tpr including sensor slopes as engineered features allowed to reach similar tprs using only one sensor instead of two analysis of the occurrence of false predictions showed that these were mostly early alarms a characteristic that could be regarded as an asset in alarm management in conclusion the simplest algorithm in combination with only one or two sensors performed best at predicting the microbial water quality this result provides useful insights for water quality modeling or for applications where small datasets are a common challenge and a general advantage might be gained by using simpler models that reduce the risk of overfitting allow better interpretability and require less computational power

water sanitation and hygiene rodriguez et al 2020 and increase water use efficiency wilcox et al 2016 but only if the reclaimed water is safe for the intended reuse application treatment technologies for on site water reuse are increasingly becoming available membrane bioreactors mbrs produce higher effluent quality than conventional treatment processes and are considered a best available technology for the treatment of wastewater from as few as 20 people diaz elsayed et al 2019 lesjean et al 2011 mbr based treatment systems are often combined with chlorination to ensure high microbial water quality and to meet disinfection requirements set by regulatory agencies hirani et al 2014 mbr with chlorine disinfection mbr cl2 is a well tried and robust combination of technologies for water reclamation with a low probability of treatment disruptions hirani et al 2014 however even a single day of disrupted operation can pose a risk to human health schoen et al 2018 therefore monitoring systems must be established to ensure microbially safe water when hazardous events occur branch et al 2016 currently no widely applicable online monitoring exists for mbr cl2 systems which constitutes a major bottleneck for their real world application reynaert et al 2021 microbial water quality targets depend on the specific reuse context because mbr cl2 systems can treat various types of water such as mixed wastewater or source separated greywater for a range of reuse applications such as landscaping toilet flushing and showering at different scales including household and building scale quantitative microbial risk assessment can be used to calculate treatment log removal targets lrts for pathogens for combinations of wastewater qualities reuse applications and reuse scales which thus ensures that the risk to human health remains below a certain benchmark who 2016 stochastic models have been applied to determine the monitoring frequencies required to prevent a significant increase in risk as a function of the lrt these indicate that frequencies as low as 1 s are required to verify a lrt of 7 smeets 2010 manual sampling and laboratory based analytical methods at such frequencies are impractical due to high costs consequently online monitoring of the microbial water quality becomes indispensable for high risk applications soft sensors are software based models which are increasingly used to predict response variables that are difficult to measure with data that can be obtained by more easily applicable methods haimi et al 2013 soft sensors have been developed for monitoring the effluent quality of drinking water aliashrafi et al 2021 and on site wastewater treatment plants haimi et al 2013 schneider et al 2019 so far such soft sensing approaches have primarily been used to predict physicochemical water quality parameters or fecal indicator bacteria such as e coli for instance bedell et al 2022 use fluorescence measurements with an ensemble learning method to detect and quantify e coli in a drinking water supply similarly foschi et al 2021 use a range of conventional measurements including ph conductivity turbidity and uv absorbance and neural networks to predict e coli in wastewater disinfection inflow in mbr cl2 systems fecal indicator bacteria are not the most critical group of enteric pathogens because they are mostly retained by the membrane in contrast to enteric viruses which are smaller and more resistant to many treatment processes zhu et al 2020 even if enteric pathogens are removed by the treatment process bacteria including opportunistic pathogens can regrow in the treated water without a disinfection residual garner et al 2019 nocker et al 2020 the present study aims to develop a methodology that couples risk based approaches with machine learning algorithms to issue an alarm if microbial water quality targets for minimum virus removal and maximum bacterial regrowth are not met we compare the predictive power for virus removal and bacterial regrowth in mbr cl2 systems of three typological machine learning algorithms logistic regression support vector machine and random forest we used data from inexpensive and commercially available online sensors free chlorine fc oxidation reduction potential orp ph turbidity conductivity and temperature the models are trained to prioritize human health by minimizing predictions that water is safe for reuse when it is not and we also make a detailed analysis of the consequences of this conservative approach for the frequency of false alarms in a related paper reynaert et al 2023 provide sensor setpoints that allow tuning the chlorination to a certain water quality e g a certain log removal value for viruses but these sensor setpoints are valid for standard operation i e for situations during which the water reuse system are operating under non disrupted conditions only the setpoints can thus not be used to predict the water quality in real time the present study aims to fill this gap and provide a real time prediction of the microbial water quality under dynamic operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr cl2 system water wall the mbr cl2 system used in this study is referred to as the water wall reynaert et al 2020 the water wall see fig 1 consists of two main components the core treatment takes place in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 after which the water is polished and disinfected in the second component a clean water tank the bambi reactor contains a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra langgöns germany with a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration is introduced directly below the membrane module the reactor is operated in a gravity driven membrane configuration in which the pressure on the membrane is supplied only by the water head peter varbanets et al 2010 water that passes through the membrane is collected in a permeate reservoir 10 cm polyvinyl chloride pipe connected to the membrane module permeate outlet holding volume of 4 l from where it is pumped through a granular activated carbon filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston usa to the clean water tank in the clean water tank a concentrated naocl solution 1750 mg cl2 l is pumped into the tank at regular intervals 3 s on 250 s off to reach a concentration of 1 mg l of free chlorine mixing in the clean water tank is ensured through a submersed pump that operates for 30 s every 5 min water from the clean water tank is constantly recirculated through three sensor flow cells at a rate of 0 5 l min the tank volumes are 60 l water for the reactor and 25 l for the clean water tank and average hydraulic residence times are 19 h in the reactor and 5 h in the clean water tank a total of 3 75 l day of concentrated feed is pumped into the reactor in 50 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day this daily feed represents the loading that would be introduced by a total of 75 l of water of real hand washing or source separated toilet flush water equivalent to the usage of a 10 person household the same amount of water is removed from the system to maintain a constant volume 2 2 standard operation of the water wall two full scale water walls were operated in this study one mimicked the recycling of source separated toilet flush water separated from the majority of urine and feces wwtf and the other handwashing greywater wwhw the composition of the 20 concentrated feed solutions is presented in the supplementary information si 1 the water walls were operated for several days under stable conditions as described above with constant feed and 1 mg l of chlorine in the treated water before they were subject to the disruptions described in section 2 1 2 2 3 disruptions of operation failure mode and effects analysis is a systematic method for identifying the possible failures that pose the most significant overall risk to a process we used this type of analysis to estimate four human health relevant failures per year and identified the most problematic failure modes more information in si 2 the following disruptions were experimentally simulated and are ordered according to their risk priority number occurrence severity effort for remediation 1 aeration off breakdown of the aeration for example due to pump breakdown or clogging of the aeration tubes leads to ammonia in the permeate due to incomplete nitrification which consumes the free chlorine in the clean water tank the aeration pump was manually deactivated to simulate the breakdown of the aeration 2 chlorine off breakdown of the chlorination for example due to pump breakdown tube clogging or no refill of chlorine solution leads to a decrease of chlorine concentrations in the treated water the pump was manually deactivated to simulate a breakdown of the chlorine pump 3 power off a power outage can cause elevated concentrations of organics and ammonia in the permeate which consumes the free chlorine once the power is back and permeate is pumped into the clean water tank the aeration pump and the permeate pump were manually deactivated to simulate a power outage 4 high usage high usage of the systems for instance during a party can cause elevated concentrations of organics and ammonia in the permeate high usage of the system was simulated through a 15 fold increase of the concentrated feed 5 membrane damage membrane damage can lead to direct passage of contaminants into the treated water membrane damage was simulated by pumping liquid from the reactor into the clean water tank at a flow rate of 1 6 l h simulating a 0 5 mm diameter hole in the membrane 6 toxic substance a spill of a toxic substance into the biological treatment tank can be harmful to the biomass in the reactor and can result in increased concentrations of organics and ammonia in the permeate this disruption was simulated by the instantaneous addition of 1 l of a cleaning substance 0 5 sodium hypochlorite into the reactor during the disruptions frequent samples were taken to assess the microbial water quality see section 2 2 sampling started before the start of the disruption and continued until the microbial water quality was stable i e there was no further deterioration of the water quality for all disruptions it took several hours after the start of the disruption for the water quality to deteriorate due to the robustness of the water wall technology disruptions were mimicked between december 2021 and march 2022 after each disruption the water walls were given at least three days to recover before the next disruption was simulated timeline of experiments presented in si 3 3 data 3 1 online sensors we investigated established commercially available sensors with promising mechanistic relationships with microbial water quality and excluded sensors that we considered too costly for small scale applications five sensors were installed in sensor flow cells to monitor the water quality orp fc ph and temperature turbidity and conductivity table 1 promising new sensing approaches such as online atp measurements or online flow cytometry were excluded in this study focusing on on site reuse systems due to high costs and requirement for qualified operating personnel and consumables reference measurements were taken with the recommended buffer solutions for orp 220 mv and ph ph 4 and 7 the ph sensors were calibrated whenever the drift was larger than 0 2 the fc sensor was calibrated with reference free chlorine measurements hach dpd test kits 0 2 mg l free chlorine hach loveland usa at the flow cell turbidity conductivity and temperature sensors were not calibrated during the experiments sensor measurements were automatically logged at 5 min intervals 3 2 microbial water quality microbial water quality was evaluated for the removal of enteric pathogens and regrowth of pathogens in the treated water we used the bacteriophage ms2 as an indicator of the removal of enteric viruses a concentrated solution of ms2 was spiked into the feed the log removal value lrv was calculated as 1 l r v m s 2 log 10 c c w t c f e e d f c o n c where c c w t is the ms2 concentration in the clean water tank c f e e d the ms2 concentration in the concentrated feed and f c o n c is the concentration factor of the feed the double agar layer method was used to enumerate ms2 as described in detail in reynaert et al 2023 regrowth was quantified as the total concentration of bacterial cells with an intact membrane and measured using flow cytometry as described in reynaert et al 2023 the regrowth of human enteric pathogenic viruses in the treated water is not anticipated due to the absence of host cells zhu et al 2020 3 3 development of prediction models the overall goal of this study was to predict whether microbial water quality targets are met using machine learning algorithms in machine learning simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn result in a model bias the amount that the estimate of the target function will change if different training data is used is termed the variance the model bias can only be decreased at the cost of a higher variance or vice versa resulting in a bias variance tradeoff briscoe and feldman 2011 in this study we selected three commonly used algorithms with differing bias variance tradeoffs logistic regression logit has high bias and low variance it models the probability of the water quality meeting the microbial target as a logistic sigmoid function of a linear combination of one or more features logit represents the most basic regression method for binary classification and was used as a benchmark method against which the other algorithms were compared for models using only one feature as input the logicistic regression comes down to fixing a threshold for this feature support vector machine svm has intermediate bias and intermediate variance it separates the water quality into two classes unlike logit the separation does not need to be linear svm creates a hyperplane decision boundary by applying transformations to the input data if the data is not linearly separable kernel trick random forest rf has low bias and high variance it is an ensemble learning method that randomly sets up a large number of decision trees made of sequential binary decisions the final prediction is then calculated as the average from the final predictions of all trees the development of prediction models using these three algorithms is illustrated in fig 2 and described in the following subsections all models were implemented using the scikit learn 1 1 2 package pedregosa et al 2011 for python 3 van rossum and drake 2009 the code can be downloaded from https doi org 10 25678 000885 3 4 microbial water quality targets to assess the microbial quality of reclaimed water water reuse frameworks specify various lrts for the removal of enteric pathogens depending on the contamination of the wastewater and the reuse application monitoring needs to be optimized for specific water quality targets reynaert et al 2021 to demonstrate the applicability of the approach to various water quality requirements we present results for two virus lrts lrt 5 and 6 and two maximum concentrations of intact cells icc log10icc 4 and 5 from which the microbial water quality was classified into two categories safe meeting the target and unsafe not meeting the target for lrt the lower value represents a less stringent target lrt 5 can represent the virus removal required when reusing greywater from a 1000 people collection system for toilet flushing and lrt 6 can represent the removal required when reusing the same water for indoor reuse schoen et al 2017 for icc the lower value represents a stricter quality target we cannot define risk based targets here as the icc reflects the entire bacterial community and is not representative of pathogens however it is possible to define typical icc values for a specific system van nevel et al 2017 3 5 standardization of sensor data before being used as input to the machine learning algorithms the sensor measurements were standardized to zero mean and one standard deviation 3 6 training validation and testing the disruption dataset was balanced meaning that the numbers of safe and unsafe data points were similar the percentages of safe data points were 58 lrt ms2 6 60 lrt ms2 5 74 log10icc 5 and 51 log10icc 4 the data was divided into a training validation dataset and a test dataset as presented in table 2 for testing we used either the disruption data alone or an assembled test dataset representative of realistic operation disruption test data this dataset was balanced with respect to the numbers of safe or unsafe data points testing on the disruption test data provided information on the model performance during failures of the water wall and served to verify if all occurrences when the water was not safe for reuse were correctly detected user perspective realistic test data the disruption dataset is not representative of realistic operation where the water is safe over 99 of the time therefore we assembled a dataset from sensor data from standard undisrupted operation combined with four disruptions per year see section 2 1 2 from baseline measurements of the microbial water quality the water was assumed to always be safe in standard operation the 13 disruptions included in the test dataset allowed standard operation to be simulated for 3 25 years testing with the realistic dataset served to verify that the percentage of false alarms remained low in long term operation operator perspective 3 7 feature engineering and hybrid modeling principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of the sensor measurements khalid et al 2014 the optimal number of principal components was chosen using cross validation during the parameter optimization of the machine learning models see section 2 3 5 additionally to sensor measurements the rate of change of sensor measurements over time termed sensor slope was used to include mechanistic knowledge about the system dynamics the temporal dynamics of lrv ms2 and log10icc differ depending on the system state deterioration of the water quality is a relatively slow process as it takes time for ms2 to enter the clean water tank and thus for lrv ms2 to decrease and for bacterial cells to grow in the clean water tank and thus for log10icc to increase for instance it will take at least one hrt for the water in the clean water tank to be replaced and thus for the lrv ms2 to decrease to 0 in contrast the water quality can be improved almost instantly if sufficient chlorine is added to disinfect it combining this process knowledge with the machine learning approach was a first test whether hybrid modeling is promising for mbr cl2 systems hybrid modeling here means the combination of data driven and mechanistic models schneider et al 2022 3 8 model optimization model performance was evaluated using the confusion matrix presented in table 3 the true positive rate tpr and false positive rate fpr were calculated using the following equations 2 t p r t p t p f n 3 f p r f p f p t n optimal model hyperparameters confidence thresholds and number of components from pca were identified using a grid search with reasonable parameter values the assumption underlying this parameter optimization was that a low fpr is more important because these are false predictions that will put users health at risk the tpr was given second priority thus reducing the number of fns and associated false alarms the models were trained and validated with leave one out cross validation in which replicates of one disruption type for each reactor together termed a disruption set were removed from the training dataset at each iteration and used to validate the model leave one out cross validation is a resampling technique appropriate for relatively small datasets when a highly accurate estimate of model performance is required wong 2015 3 9 selection of fpr operating point we computed optimization curves representing the highest tpr achieved for a certain fpr and evaluated the gain in tpr per increase in fpr based on the optimization curves we selected an fpr that was enforced during model training and validation 3 10 model evaluation the fpr and tpr were reported on both the training and validation dataset and the test datasets comprising disruption test data and realistic test data for the best performing models the detailed analysis included 1 decision boundary maps to visualize the test datasets and for easier interpretability of model predictions and 2 time series of predictions for a closer evaluation of the occurrence of fps and fns note that the fpr on the test datasets is not suitable to compare the actual performance of the different models but rather to verify that the fpr selected as an operating point see section 2 3 6 is achievable 4 results 4 1 experimental data effect of disruptions on the microbial water quality understanding the relations of sensor measurements to water quality is critical to the success of predictive models one major outcome of this study is a large dataset consisting of 32 disruptions 500 data points with detailed information on changes in microbial water quality lrv of ms2 and log10icc and sensor measurements fig 3 shows the standard operation and typical effects of the six types of disruption simulated and the restart of chlorination on microbial water quality and on the sensor measurements the complete dataset for all 32 simulated disruptions to two reactors is available at https doi org 10 25678 000885 fig 3 shows that orp values and fc concentrations both consistently decreased with deteriorations in the microbial water quality turbidity measurements also varied during some of the disruptions e g membrane damage but not for all and not in a way that was consistent with the changes in microbial water quality conductivity only changed during the toxic substance scenario finally neither the ph nor the temperature varied more in disruptive operation than during the standard operation without disruptions the microbial water quality was stable throughout the testing with lrv ms2 6 4 and log10icc 2 7 fig 3 standard operation 4 2 selection of suitable fpr operating point fig 4 shows the optimization curves that were used to select a suitable fpr the optimization curve represents the optimized tpr for a certain fpr determined from a grid search of possible model parameters each point on an optimization curve thus represents different hyperparameters and confidence thresholds from the other points these optimization curves differ from commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc curves that are computed for one model i e one set of hyperparameters fpr and tpr results are reported on the training and validation dataset using leave one out validation models can use all possible combinations of sensor measurements as input for instance for an svm algorithm trained to predict meeting a lrt ms2 of 6 using measurements from six sensors the optimized tpr is 46 if no fp are allowed 58 if an fpr of 1 is allowed and 68 if an fpr of 2 is allowed fig 4 a for a fpr above 2 the tpr only increases slowly meaning that we have to allow a significantly higher fpr to increase the tpr the optimization curves serve two purposes 1 selection of operating points when selecting operating points the goal was to keep the fpr as low as possible fig 4 indicates that selecting a fpr of 0 is not an appropriate choice as this is associated with very low tprs allowing the fpr to increase to 1 or 2 is associated with significantly higher tprs for a fpr above 2 the gain in tpr per increase in fpr is much lower a fpr of 2 was thus selected as a sensible choice for training the monitoring algorithms 2 performance comparison of logit svm and rf fig 4 shows that logit and svm often overlap therefore they perform similarly whereas rf is associated with lower tprs consequently further model analysis was conducted for operating points at fpr 2 4 3 comparison of tprs from different models table 4 shows the fprs and tprs of models using single sensors two sensors and all sensors as features all models were trained to meet an fpr 2 the single sensor models with the highest tpr were orp and fc and two sensor combinations with the highest tpr were orp fc results are reported for the training and validation data the disruption test data and the realistic test data to be classified as performing well highlighted in green models needed to satisfy two conditions i fpr 2 in the disruption test datasets and ii classification of the standard operation data as safe in the realistic test dataset the fpr on the test datasets cannot be used to compare the performance of different models as long as the condition from i is met see section 2 3 7 four key results emerge from table 4 1 logit and svm were associated with higher tprs than rf although rf performed relatively well on the training and validation data the rf models seem to overfit the performance significantly decreased on the test datasets with the fpr frequently exceeding 2 and the standard operation data being misclassified comparing the less complex logit with the more complex svm we can observe that in this study based on an inherently small dataset the model complexity has neither a positive nor a negative effect on the tpr 2 for most models considered the tpr was 99 when calculated for the realistic test dataset this result shows that most models correctly classified the standard operation data as safe exception see point 3 below 3 the monitoring algorithm development requires correctly classifying the standard operation data as safe none of the models tested performed well for a log10 icc of 4 where the models incorrectly classified the standard operation data as unsafe resulting in a low tpr on the realistic test dataset 4 compared to single sensor models the combination of information from orp and fc improved the models predictive capacity for both aspects keeping the fpr below 2 in the test dataset and correctly classifying the standard operation data as safe however including more sensors did not generally improve the tpr we even observed a tipping point beyond which including all sensors reduced performance compared to the orp fc based models logit based models using orp fc as input perform as well as svm but are less computationally intensive therefore a detailed evaluation of logit based models using orp fc is presented in the following sections 1 1 note figure 4 in section 3 2 presents optimization curves for models using six sensors the optimization curve presented in si 5 confirms that a fpr of 2 for the training and validation stage is also a sensible choice for models based only on orp fc 4 4 decision boundary maps high performance is required not only on the training and validation dataset but also on the test dataset table 4 has already indicated that the models can achieve a low fpr and high tpr in the test datasets as well fig 5 enables more detailed evaluation from decision boundary maps the decision boundary maps show the probability of water being safe gray shaded area and the decision boundaries selected for the logit based models using orp fc as input the maps visualize how the models classify the water quality as safe area right of the decision boundary or unsafe area left of the decision boundary and allow evaluating how well the models are able to separate the two water quality classes in fig 5a1 c1 lrt ms2 6 and 5 log10 target of 5 for icc all cases where the water was unsafe in the disruption test dataset are classified correctly no fps represented as red triangles but some occurrences of water being safe are classified incorrectly these incorrect classifications illustrate the consequence of selecting conservative decision boundaries in contrast there were three fps for a log10 icc of 4 fig 5d1 the decision boundary would have had to be considerably more conservative to avoid these fps at the cost of a low tpr interestingly the best performing svm models also had linear decision boundaries which explains why both svm and logit have similar performance results shown in si 6 minimizing fpr at the cost of the tpr of the disruption dataset relies on the algorithm always classifying the water correctly as safe in standard undisrupted operation from the high tpr on the realistic dataset we can see that this is the case for all scenarios except for a log10 icc of 4 see table 4 fig 5a2 d2 provide more detail on the classification for the standard operation all points in standard operation are located far from the decision boundary in plots a2 c2 implying a low probability of misclassification in contrast plot d2 log10 icc of 4 shows that the data from the standard operation is close to the decision boundary with a few occurrences where the model misclassifies the standard operation data fns represented as orange triangles 4 5 time series of predictions table 4 indicates that we can achieve tprs between 64 and 82 in the disruption test datasets logit using orp fc as inputs while meeting the selected fpr of 2 however even low rates of fns can lead to high operation costs caused by false alarms and a loss of trust in the system by the user it is thus important to understand more precisely when fps and fns occur to determine a management strategy fig 6 a and fig 6b show examples of prediction errors for an fp and fns during training and validation of a logit based model using orp fc as input fig 6a indicates that the confidence in the water being safe is around the same for the tps as for the fp 0 75 optimizing the model meeting a ms2 lrt of 6 to have zero fps instead of one through an increase of the decision boundary dashed line would massively decrease the tpr due to an increase of fns results are reported on the training validation dataset because there are no fps in the test dataset for the two sensor models predicting ms2 lrt conversely fig 6b training validation dataset and fig 6d test dataset show that fns occur before the water quality falls below the treatment target and thus represent early alarms unlike false alarms that occur randomly an appropriate alarm management can mitigate these early alarms for instance by using them for early interventions this implies that the early alarms can become an asset when handled properly the time series of predictions for both mbr cl2 systems and all simulated disruptions can be found in si 4 4 6 hybrid models the data driven approach presented in the previous sections was combined with mechanistic knowledge in a hybrid approach by including the sensor slopes sensor slopes allow the models to distinguish between deterioration and improvement of water quality table 5 presents the tprs and changes in tpr compared to the results from the data driven model in table 4 for logit based hybrid models including orp slopes slope over 90 min and or fc slopes slope over 210 min results for all models including svm and rf are presented in si 7 the time intervals used for the slope calculation were chosen to maximize the tpr table 5 shows that the tpr can be increased by up to 25 percentage points on the training and validation dataset often even with a lower fpr see si 7 for hybrid models using orp orp slope the performance on the test dataset can almost match the performance of the orp fc based data driven models however table 5 also shows that this increase in tpr cannot always be transferred to the disruption test dataset although there is an increase in tpr for models using orp orp slope and fc fc slope the tpr of the models using both orp fc and their respective slopes has a substantially lower tpr on the test dataset than the purely data driven model one reason for this decrease in tpr may be an overfit of the model during the training and validation stage 5 discussion 5 1 selection of machine learning algorithms no tradeoff between bias and variance although the dataset generated for this study 500 data points from 32 disruption events can be considered large for microbial water quality measurements it is not comparable to typical volumes and velocities of big data zhou et al 2017 in their review on data driven modeling of drinking water treatment aliashrafi et al 2021 show that neural networks are most commonly used to model water quality followed by svm decision trees and rf logistic regression has not been widely used because most studies focus on regression rather than classification in this study we did not include neural networks because their training data requirement is substantially larger than those of svm and rf osisanwo et al 2017 our results show that more easily interpretable logit based models performed on par with the more complex black box model svm and rf based models had lower tprs than both consequently this dataset produced no tradeoff between bias and variance logit based models with low bias also had the lowest variance the similar performances of logit and svm might be due to the limited size of the dataset because overfitting issues can arise when applying more complex machine learning algorithms to small datasets small datasets are a common challenge in water quality modeling aliashrafi et al 2021 an additional challenge is the variability of water quality measurements inherent in microbial indicator measurements such as ms2 levy et al 2012 therefore a general advantage might be gained by using simpler models that reduce the risk of overfitting allow better interpretability and require less computational power this is especially true for controlled environments such as the mbr cl2 systems investigated in this study where we do not expect complex underlying patterns that can be encountered in natural systems in mbr cl2 systems the inactivation of viruses and prevention of bacterial regrowth is mostly achieved with chlorination thus we expected that orp and fc sensors which measure the disinfection capacity and the concentration of chlorine respectively would be promising predictors of the microbial water quality reynaert et al 2023 in this study we observed that models using two sensors orp fc or even only one sensor orp orp slope performed better on the test dataset than models including all sensors possible reasons for the lower performance of models using all sensors may include 1 the low enforced fpr as the first classification errors occurred very soon when using all sensors whereas higher fprs models including all sensors had tprs similar to the two sensor models and 2 the small size of the dataset which increases the risk of overfitting when using input from multiple sensors the outputs from machine learning models need to be interpretable humans need to understand the reasoning behind the model outcome if they are to trust it and the use of blackbox models in health relevant applications is linked with concerns around accountability safety and liability aliashrafi et al 2021 however increased interpretability can come at the cost of lower accuracy a tradeoff that has been observed for instance in a study aiming to predict e coli concentrations in agricultural water weller et al 2021 the present study s identification of an easily interpretable algorithm in combination with only one or two sensors in a known mechanistic relationship yielding the highest tprs is a very positive outcome it shows that we can have both high accuracy and good interpretability with the same models as an additional advantage logit is less computationally intensive and can easily be implemented in practical applications 5 2 conservative training no tradeoff between detecting all failures and false alarms detecting all failures is crucial to limiting microbial risk but avoiding false alarms is also important for operation costs storey et al 2011 and presumably user acceptance of water reuse systems while there are no studies on the effect of false alarms on user acceptance studies have reported technology failure as a cause for a detrimental effect on the public acceptance of small scale water reuse systems domènech and saurí 2010 our results show that we can reach tprs of between 70 and 80 when enforcing a conservative fpr of 2 an important question is whether this tpr is sufficiently high to keep operational costs and the deterioration of user acceptance caused by false alarms reasonably low our results indicate that this is the case for two reasons 1 fns did not occur randomly but were usually early alarms appropriate alarm management can mitigate these early alarms and even use the early alarms as an asset for instance reactive systems could increase chlorination when a deterioration of the water quality is detected either preventing a health critical deterioration or providing additional time for intervention 2 because mbr cl2 based water reuse systems such as the water wall provide robust treatment they are in standard undisrupted operation most of the time with water quality meeting the microbial quality targets schoen et al 2018 the tpr for realistic operation standard operation with four disruptions per year was thus 99 in most cases these results also highlight the importance of training and validating models on a disruption dataset and using the fpr and tpr to evaluate model performance because of the high number of cases classified as safe in the realistic operation dataset a trivial classifier that predicts every case as safe could still have achieved a very high overall accuracy but missed all the cases when the water did not meet the microbial quality targets monard and batista 2002 it is possible that model performance could be further improved through an optimized sampling strategy in this study it was not always possible to capture the exact moment of change in microbial water quality leading to a datasets that mostly consists of very good or very poor water quality but misses intermediate water qualities this is for example visible in fig 6 a where the single false positive prediction was for an intermediate water quality the prediction models developed in this study could be used to inform researchers or practicioners when changes in microbial water quality are most likely and additional samples should be taken 5 3 prediction models have to be trained for specific microbial water quality targets in this study we trained models for two virus lrts and two maximum concentrations of intact cells for actual deployment the models must be trained for system specific microbial water quality targets for virus removal the lrts will depend on the wastewater composition reuse application and scale of the water reuse system and can be taken from water reuse frameworks if the specific wastewater compositions and reuse applications are covered or calculated using quantitative microbial risk assessment who 2016 water reuse frameworks typically include no requirements for the icc as the icc is not representative of pathogens however several studies have suggested that the icc can be used to measure process performance cheswick et al 2019 van nevel et al 2017 here baseline measurements of icc during standard operation can provide information on the variability of anticipated icc levels and help select appropriate targets in the present study we observed that it is possible to train the models for a range of microbial water quality targets however the models could no longer distinguish between safe and unsafe states for the more stringent water quality target for icc log10icc 4 this result highlights one requirement for the prediction the quality target cannot be too close to the standard operation data or standard operation is classified wrongly too often monitoring models can be trained for a range of microbial water quality targets but water quality targets cannot be arbitrarily chosen for a given system for the log10icc 4 target the distinction between safe and unsafe system states would have been difficult even for humans as icc values sometimes rose above the set threshold in standard operation 6 limitations and future directions 6 1 generalizability many machine learning models can yield good results with training data but perform poorly on new or unseen samples because the ability of conventional models to extrapolate to data outside of the training range is limited in this study we tested two setups of the water wall treating different wastewater inputs our results indicate that the algorithms can be applied to different water types we divided the disruption dataset into a training and validation dataset and a test dataset consequently by including only one disruption type in the test dataset we were able to verify that the models can predict unseen experiments however the experimental setup used here does not enable us to assess the generalizability of the models to completely new reactors the best performing models rely solely on orp and fc measurements that have mechanistic relationships with the microbial water quality and we therefore expect the models to be generalizable to new mbr cl2 systems in this study including sensor slopes did not significantly increase the tpr for models using orp fc measurements as inputs we term the inclusion of sensor slopes hybrid modeling as these engineered features allowed the models to differentiate between two system states namely deterioration typically a slow process and improvement typically a fast process of the microbial water quality however we hypothesize that hybrid modeling might also increase transferability to new systems because other mbr cl2 systems may have other baseline values during standard operation especially for orp this could not be tested in the present study as both water walls had similar orp levels schneider et al 2020 showed the feasibility of monitoring the physicochemical water quality of on site wastewater treatment plants using engineered features such as inflection points of sensor measurements without plant specific retuning of the soft sensors assessing the generalizability of these models to new mbr cl2 systems and ensuring their applicability to real life contexts will require them to be validated in operational mbr cl2 water reuse systems one particular challenge will be verifying virus removal as the spiking of ms2 is not possible in such systems here using indicators such as coliphage that are naturally present could be an alternative but will likely need to be coupled with concentration methods due to low concentrations in the wastewater that do not allow the verification of high log removals 6 2 increasing the redundancy of the monitoring system our results quantify how a decrease in the number of sensors fc orp vs orp alone increases the rate of false negative predictions but they also show that these fns are effectively early alarms for the actual deployment of such monitoring approaches selecting the most suitable models and developing alarm management strategies will depend on the monitoring and maintenance scheme envisioned bedell et al 2022 this study shows that it is possible to achieve the highest tprs with only a few sensors e g orp fc or orp alone this is beneficial in terms of cost and model interpretability but predictions rely more heavily on single sensors with unclear consequences for long term implementation where sensors might drift or even fail at some point in on site water reuse systems regular checks and maintenance by humans are a challenge schneider et al 2019 but several solutions may be implemented for increased robustness in real life deployments 1 add monitoring redundancy by implementing several identical sensors this is a particularly interesting option for orp based models because orp sensors are relatively inexpensive making this a financially more viable option than fc orp based models monitoring redundancy can be helpful when reconstructing sensors where a sensor validation system detects faulty sensors the remaining measurements can be used to reconstruct the faulty sensors thus allowing more robust process monitoring yoo et al 2008 2 include plausibility checks by including anomaly detection strategies for instance by using active learning with human expert labeling russo et al 2020 or automatically evaluating credible values and their mutual compatibility isermann 2011 for instance in monitoring systems using orp and fc sensors the nernst equation which permits the calculation of the reduction potential of a reaction can be used to verify the compatibility between the two measurements 3 introduce deliberate system dynamics to test that sensors are reacting as expected for instance by registering a daily chlorine peak this strategy has been suggested by thürlimann et al 2019 they achieved long term stability of a urine nitrification process that relied on ph control by introducing regular intended changes in ph and using information about the sensor s reaction to correct for sensor drift 7 conclusion when working with microbial water quality data the inherently small size of such laboratory analysis derived datasets will constrain the selection of suitable machine learning algorithms in this study we show that simple models using logistic regression predicted the microbial water quality in mbr cl2 water reuse systems as well as did more complex black box models with the additional advantages of better interpretability and potentially transferability to other systems the main goal of the monitoring models developed here was to ensure user safety by limiting false positive predictions that water is safe when actually it is unsafe we observed that the monitoring models are well suited for early warning systems as the resulting false negative predictions that water is unsafe when actually it is were not only false alarms but also early warnings monitoring algorithms need to be trained for specific applications in this study we successfully trained and tested models for microbial water quality targets corresponding to different reuse applications however the results also illustrate the limitation of this approach with false classifications occurring when the microbial water quality targets are too close to the standard operation data for some models the tpr was improved by including sensor slopes an engineered feature selected through mechanistic understanding of the system although this study does not systematically investigate the application of engineered features the results highlight the potential of hybrid models that include system understanding to improve prediction accuracies and reduce costs by requiring fewer sensors credit authorship contribution statement eva reynaert conceptualization methodology data collection formal analysis visualization

14741,solar photolysis of free chlorine solar chlorine in bromide containing water occurs under various scenarios such as chlorinated reservoirs and outdoor swimming pools and the formation of chlorate and bromate is an important issue in the system we reported unexpected trends for the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system excess chlorine inhibited the formation of bromate i e increasing chlorine dosages from 50 to 100 μm reduced the bromate yield from 6 4 to 1 2 μm in solar chlorine at 50 μm bromide and ph 7 the yield of bromate in solar chlorine at 100 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromide in 240 min was 18 8 of that at 50 μm bromine only the underlying mechanism was that hocl can react with bromite bro2 to form hoclobro whose multi step transformation finally formed chlorate as the major product and bromate as the minor product this reaction overwhelmed the oxidation of bromite to form bromate by reactive species such as oh bro and ozone on the other hand the presence of bromide greatly enhanced the formation of chlorate increasing bromide concentrations from 0 to 50 μm enhanced the chlorate yields from 2 2 to 7 0 μm at 100 μm chlorine the absorbance of bromine was higher than that of chlorine thus the photolysis of bromine formed higher levels of bromite at higher bromide concentrations then bromite rapidly reacted with hocl to form hoclobro and it further transformed to chlorate additionally 1 mg l 1 nom had a negligible effect on bromate yields in solar chlorine at 50 μm bromide 100 μm chlorine and ph 7 this study demonstrated a new pathway of chlorate and bromate formation in the solar chlorine system with bromide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar chlorine bromide hypochlorous acid bromate chlorate water treatment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction exposure of chlorinated water to solar light is common under various water scenarios such as chlorinated open reservoirs outdoor swimming pools ocean ship ballast waters ocean aquaculture waters and plant irrigation with chlorine disinfected water macalady et al 1977 sun et al 2016 suh and mitch 2021 which creates a scene where chlorine is photolyzed by solar irradiation i e solar chlorine however toxic oxyhalides such as chlorate and bromate can be frequently formed particularly for bromate in bromide containing water macalady et al 1977 sánchez montes et al 2022 both bromate and chlorate are toxic to human health which are regulated to be 10 μg l 1 and 700 μg l 1 respectively by world health organization who 1993 and or worldwide european community 1998 usepa 2001 china ministry of health 2006 to inhibit the bromate formation during the solar photolysis of a chlorinated outdoor reservoir in los angeles 96 million shade balls were dumped to block the solar light zolfagharigard 2015 thus the formation of chlorate and bromate becomes an important issue in the solar chlorine system note that chlorine and bromine in this study refer to free chlorine hocl and clo and bromine hobr and bro species respectively formation of oxyhalides driven by solar light has been previously observed at high levels for example bromate in solar chlorine has been detected at a concentration of 100 μg l 1 in an open chlorinated drinking water reservoir tomerlin 2008 and up to 2 5 mg l 1 in the seawater macalady et al 1977 chlorate was detected at concentrations of 765 54 μg l 1 at most in the solar chlorine system at a chlorine dosage of 8 mg l 1 as cl2 young et al 2020 in addition the formation of oxyhalides is also a concern in the uv chlorine system von gunten 2018 yeom et al 2021 bromate formation was observed up to 36 μg l 1 in a water containing 2 mg l 1 bromide in the medium pressure mp uv chlorine system at a uv fluence of 800 mj cm 2 fang et al 2017 the conversion rates of bromide to bromate were 6 6 32 during uv chlorine treatment of raw water from yangtze river containing 0 7 μm bromide huang et al 2008 on the other hand up to 17 of chlorine 2 10 mg l 1 was converted to chlorate in the mp uv chlorine system at a full scale drinking water treatment plant wang et al 2015 thus oxyhalides especially bromate frequently exceeded the maximum contaminant levels mcls when chlorinated waters were exposed to solar or uv light irradiation however effects of chlorine dosage and bromide concentration on the chlorate and bromate formation in the solar chlorine system were rarely explored by previous studies which need comprehensive investigation to understand their formation trends the mechanisms for chlorate and bromate formation during the photolysis of chlorine only or bromine only have been studied both chlorate and bromate are formed via multiple reactions eq 1 1 hox xo x xo xo2 xo3 the photolysis of chlorine and bromine hox xo x cl or br produces hydroxyl radicals oh o and halogen radicals x as primary radicals and then oxyhalogen radicals xo are generated through the further reaction of primary radicals with hox xo fang et al 2014 xo rapidly transforms into xo and xo2 klaning and wolff 1985 xo2 is oxidized by oh xo and ozone to xo2 which is further transformed to cl2o3 and br2o4 as transient intermediates and eventually form xo3 fischbacher et al 2015 lee et al 2020 besides ozone which is formed during the photolysis of hypochlorite ions clo forsyth et al 2013 yang et al 2016 can directly oxidize hox xo to xo2 von gunten and hoigne 1994 jung et al 2014 the apparent quantum yields of chlorate and bromate are reported to be 0 12 0 23 mol einstein 1 during uv photolysis at 254 nm of chlorine or bromine lee et al 2020 previous studies just focused on the formation mechanisms of chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine only or bromine only by solar or uv light yang et al 2019 lee et al 2020 however in practical water scenarios chlorine dosages are usually higher than bromide concentrations specifically bromide concentrations in surface water and wastewater vary from a few μg l 1 to several mg l 1 greenwood and earnshaw 1997 and those in seawater range from 28 to 65 mg l 1 magazinovic 2004 borges et al 2005 the chlorine dosages for disinfection are 0 2 4 mg l 1 in drinking water zhu et al 2022 0 3 22 mg l 1 in wastewater treatment krasner et al 2009 chuang et al 2019 and those in seawater swimming pools are higher than bromide concentrations in order to achieve chlorine residuals at 0 4 1 4 mg l 1 parinet et al 2012 thus chlorine and bromine usually coexist in practical water scenarios our preliminary study found an uncommon phenomenon for the formation of bromate i e the bromate formation at 25 μm bromide and 25 μm chlorine was higher than that at 25 μm bromide and 70 μm chlorine in uv chlorine at ph 7 fang et al 2017 however the mechanism of this phenomenon was not investigated in this study fang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to investigate the pathways and mechanisms for bromate and chlorate formation during the mixture of chlorine and bromine photolysis the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of chlorine dosage and bromide concentration on the formation kinetics of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide 2 to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms for chlorate and bromate formation particularly the roles of chlorine in their formation in the solar chlorine system additionally the mechanisms for oxyhalide formation in the solar chlorine system were verified in the uv chlorine system 2 materials and methods 2 1

the ph was measured using a ph meter s210 mettler toledo 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide the initial concentrations of bromide and chlorine were 50 μm and 100 μm respectively and the ph was 7 bromide was rapidly converted into bromine by chlorine eqs 2 3 thus the concentration of bromine increased to 49 1 μm in 20 s by model figure s7 as described in a previous study guo et al 2020 these reactions enabled the rapid conversion of 100 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromide into 50 μm bromine and 50 μm chlorine resulting in the coexistence of chlorine and bromine we compared the sunlight photolysis system containing 100 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromide with that only containing 50 μm chlorine or 50 μm bromine the former was a mixed system with approximate 50 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromine system 1 while the latter two only contained chlorine system 2 or bromine system 3 at the same concentration of 50 μm interestingly the chlorate formation in system 1 was much higher than that in system 2 during 240 min of continuous solar exposure whereas the bromate formation in system 1 was much lower than that in system 3 fig 1 specifically the yield of chlorate in system 1 was 7 0 μm at 240 min while that was only 0 9 μm in system 2 fig 1a in contrast the yield of bromate was 1 2 μm in system 1 while that was 6 4 μm in system 3 fig 1b as reported chlorate was formed mainly via the photolysis of chlorine and subsequent oxidation and bromate was formed mainly via the photolysis of bromine and subsequent oxidation eq 1 lee et al 2020 however these mechanisms can not explain our results in system 1 the concentration of chlorine decayed to 6 9 μm while that of bromine just slightly decayed to 48 1 μm in 240 min in system 2 the concentration of chlorine decreased to 40 5 μm which was much slower than that in system 1 fig 1a on the contrary bromine decayed to 22 0 μm in system 3 which was much faster than that in system 1 fig 1b the decay of chlorine was also simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus v4 55 ianni 2012 which contains 220 photochemical and chemical reactions obtained from guo et al 2020 the decay of chlorine in system 2 by modeling was consistent with that by experimental results however the concentration of chlorine just decreased by 35 4 μm in system 1 by modeling figure s8 which was lower than that obtained by experiment 43 1 μm the kinetic model only considered the consumption of chlorine by solar photolysis bromide and radicals such as oh and cl indicating that bromine containing intermediates also consumed chlorine 3 2 factors affecting the formation of chlorate and bromate in solar chlorine 3 2 1 effects of chlorine dosage the initial concentration of bromide was fixed at 50 μm and that of chlorine increased from 50 to 100 μm the conversion rates of bromide to bromine reached 99 in 32 113 s at 50 100 μm chlorine figure s7 the yields of chlorate in 240 min increased from 0 0093 to 7 0 μm with increasing chlorine dosage from 50 to 100 μm however the yield of bromate decreased from 6 4 to 1 2 μm fig 2 furthermore the decrease of bromate yields with increasing chlorine dosage was also observed at lower levels of bromide i e 10 μm when the initial concentration of bromide was fixed at 10 μm as chlorine dosage increased from 20 to 50 μm the yields of bromate decreased from 0 23 to 0 13 μm at 300 min figure s13 these results suggested that excess chlorine significantly inhibited the bromate formation we extended the solar exposure time to 24 h because chlorine and bromine were almost completely consumed after 24 h solar exposure fig 3 taking the chlorine dosage of 100 μm and initial bromide concentration of 50 μm as an example there was only 8 μm chlorine left in 6 h fig 3 coincidently the formation of bromate started to accelerate after 6 h the average yield of bromate in 4 6 h was 0 3 μm h 1 while that in 6 8 h was 1 0 μm h 1 fig 3b further confirming that excess chlorine significantly inhibited the bromate formation meanwhile the average decay rate of bromine was 1 7 μm h 1 in 4 6 h while that was 5 9 μm h 1 in 6 8 h fig 3b as excess chlorine reacted with bromide and compensated the consumed bromine bromate was formed by the photolysis of bromine and a series of radical oxidation reactions during which some intermediates were formed such as bro bromite bro2 and bro2 of note bromite reacted with hocl through a series of reactions nicoson et al 2003 the reaction between bromite and hocl formed hoclobro which transformed to hobroclo and then decomposed to broclo eqs 4 and 5 broclo further combined with hocl to form the broclo hocl adduct eq 6 whose decay preferred to form chlorate as a major product 85 of bromite and bromate as a minor product 7 of bromite eqs 7 and 8 the reaction of bromite with hocl competed with that with oh bro and ozone the second order rate constants ks of bromite reacting with hocl oh bro and ozone were reported to be 160 m 1 s 1 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 4 0 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 9 104 m 1 s 1 respectively nicoson et al 2003 sedlak and von gunten 2011 fischbacher et al 2015 in system 1 the average concentration of hocl was 2 8 10 5 m fig 1 and the steady state concentration of oh was determined to be 1 0 10 14 m by using nitrobenzene as a probe compound text s5 and figure s9 therefore the pseudo first order rate constants k s of bromite reacting with hocl and oh were 4 5 10 3 s 1 and 1 9 10 5 s 1 respectively in addition bro concentration was estimated to be 10 13 m based on the concentration of clo in solar chlorine determined by hua et al 2019 because there was no method for quantifying bro concentration the concentration of ozone was determined to be 3 2 10 9 m by using cinnamic acid as a probe compound text s6 and figure s15 therefore the k of bromite with bro and ozone were 4 0 10 5 s 1 and 2 8 10 4 s 1 respectively these results indicated that the reaction of bromite with hocl overwhelmed that with radicals in the solar chlorine system with bromide the increased chlorine dosages promoted the reaction of bromite with hocl reducing the yield of bromate and simultaneously enhancing the yield of chlorate 4 hocl bro 2 hoclobr o h hobrocl o 5 hobroclo h broclo h2o 6 broclo hocl broclo hocl 7 broclo hocl h2o clo3 hobr cl 2h 8 broclo hocl h2o bro3 hocl cl 2h besides the reaction between chlorite and hobr can also form hobroclo with the k of 97 m 1 s 1 eq 9 furman and margerum 1998 which was similar with the reaction of bromite with hocl the reaction between chlorite and hobr may also accelerate the chlorate formation as hobroclo finally transformed to chlorate predominantly via eqs 5 7 9 hobr clo2 hobroclo 3 2 2 effects of bromide concentrations when the initial concentration of chlorine was fixed at 100 μm and that of bromide increased from 0 to 50 μm the yields of bromate increased from 0 to 1 2 μm at 240 min fig 4 b interestingly the yields of chlorate increased from 2 2 to 7 0 μm fig 4a the increased bromide concentrations led to the enhancement of bromine concentrations and the reduction of chlorine concentrations at a certain chlorine dosage this was expected to decrease the chlorate formation as confirmed that the decrease of chlorine dosage resulted in less chlorate formation in the chlorine only system figure s10 while the result showed that chlorate formation increased with decreasing chlorine dosages the photolysis rate of bromine in system 3 was 2 9 10 3 min 1 fig 1b while that of chlorine in system 2 was 7 3 10 4 min 1 fig 1a the higher photolysis rate of bromine compared with chlorine was due to the higher molar absorption coefficient of bromine hobr bro than that of chlorine hocl clo in the solar band lee et al 2020 the increase in bromide concentration directly led to an increase in the concentration of bromine coupled with the faster photolysis rate of bromine than chlorine facilitating the formation of bromite then the reaction between bromite and hocl was enhanced thus promoting the formation of chlorate 3 2 3 effects of ph to explore the effects of chlorine species hocl or clo on the formation of chlorate and bromate solution ph was increased to 10 at ph 7 hocl and clo existed with the proportion of 76 0 and 24 0 respectively while at ph 10 99 7 of chlorine existed as clo korshin 2011 bulman et al 2019 at ph 10 the yield of chlorate in system 1 was 4 2 μm at 240 min while that in system 2 was 1 7 μm fig 5 a the yield of bromate in system 1 was 4 8 μm while that in system 3 was 7 2 μm fig 5b thus the yield of chlorate in system 1 was higher than that in system 2 and the yield of bromate in system 1 was lower than that in system 3 which were consistent with the results at ph 7 suggesting that clo can also react with bromite to eventually produce chlorate as the major product since the conversion from clo to bro was much slower than that from hocl to hobr eqs 2 and 3 only 26 8 μm bromine was formed in system 1 at ph 10 and 1 min accordingly the concentration of chlorine was 73 2 μm then the concentration of chlorine in system 1 decayed to 17 1 μm at 240 min fig 5a the concentration of bromine increased from 0 to 42 2 μm in 60 min and then decreased to 34 3 μm at 240 min fig 5b in system 2 the concentration of chlorine decreased from 50 to 35 0 μm fig 5a which was much slower than that in system 1 the faster consumption of chlorine in system 1 compared with system 2 can also be explained by the reaction of bromite with clo at ph 10 when the initial concentration of chlorine was fixed at 100 μm and that of bromide increased from 0 to 50 μm the yields of bromate increased from 0 to 4 8 μm fig 4d notably the yields of chlorate decreased from 8 0 to 4 2 μm fig 4c which was inconsistent with the increase in the yields of chlorate with increasing bromide concentrations at ph 7 fig 4a by comparing the trends of chlorate formation at ph 10 and ph 7 the k for the reaction of bromite with clo was likely to be lower than that with hocl thus at ph 10 chlorate was formed mainly through the oxidation of chlorite by radicals eq 1 rather than the reaction of bromite with clo the increased bromide concentration consumed more chlorine thus resulting in the decrease of chlorate yield 3 2 4 effects of nom fig 6 showed the effects of 1 mg l 1 nom on the formation of oxyhalides during solar chlorine at 100 μm chlorine 50 μm bromide and ph 7 the presence of 1 mg l 1 nom in the solar chlorine system reduced the yields of chlorate from 7 0 to 5 5 μm however the yields of bromate were slightly affected by nom which were both 1 2 μm as a scavenger for reactive species nom has high reactivity with reactive chlorine species such as cl k c l nom 3 7 108 1 6 109 mc 1 s 1 cl2 k cl 2 nom 4 6 106 3 6 107 mc 1 s 1 and clo k cl o nom 5 4 108 mc 1 s 1 wu et al 2017 lei et al 2021 therefore the scavenging effects of reactive chlorine species by nom resulted in the decrease of chlorate formation in addition 1 mg l 1 nom could increase chlorine consumption by 5 1 μm which accounted for 10 2 of 50 μm chlorine figure s12 the reduction of chlorine by nom slowed down the reaction of bromite with hocl to form chlorate for bromate formation due to the reduced hocl concentration the inhibitory effect of the reaction between bromite and hocl on bromate formation was weakened on the other hand nom can scavenge br br2 and bro with the ks of 3 1 108 mc 1 s 1 3 6 106 mc 1 s 1 and 2 5 105 mc 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2020 the decrease of rbs led to less bromite formation further inhibiting the bromate formation therefore the trade off made the bromate formation almost unaffected by 1 mg l 1 nom 3 3 the formation of chlorate and bromate in the uv chlorine system the uv chlorine system has attracted great interests for oxidation and disinfection recently guo et al 2022 to explore whether the trends of bromate and chlorate formation in the solar chlorine system can happen in the uv chlorine system we also investigated the effects of chlorine dosage on the formation of chlorate and bromate in the uv chlorine system at 50 μm bromide and ph 7 fig 7 the yields of chlorate increased from 0 35 to 6 8 μm with increasing chlorine dosage from 50 to 100 μm in 60 min meanwhile the yields of bromate decreased from 4 0 to 1 9 μm the decreasing bromate yields with increasing chlorine dosages demonstrated that the reaction of bromite with hocl also significantly altered the bromate formation in the uv chlorine system the decrease of bromate yields with chlorine dosages increased from 50 to 100 μm in the uv chlorine system was less significant than that in the solar chlorine system the former decreased from 4 0 to 1 9 μm at 60 min fig 7 and the latter decreased from 6 4 to 1 2 μm at 240 min fig 2 hocl has a higher absorbance figure s6 and quantum yield sun et al 2016 at 254 nm compared with solar light leading to the rapid decomposition of hocl by uv irradiation remucal and manley 2016 thus the consumption of hocl reduced the hocl available for the reaction between hocl and bromite on the other hand due to the increased concentrations of radicals caused by enhanced hocl photolysis the oxidation of bromite by radicals became dominant which promoted the formation of bromate hence the inhibition effect of hocl on bromate formation also existed in the uv chlorine system but it was less significant than that in the solar chlorine system 3 4 formation pathways of chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine in bromide containing water based on the above results the formation pathways for chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine in bromide containing water were concluded in scheme 1 previous studies focused on the mechanism of chlorate and bromate formation during chlorine only and bromine only photolysis wang et al 2015 lee et al 2020 xo was found to be an important precursor of xo3 via the reaction of hox xo with oh and x where xo was oxidized to xo2 then xo2 and finally xo3 black boxes in scheme 1 buxton and subhani 1972 lee et al 2020 in current study the yields of chlorate and bromate were investigated during the photolysis of co existing chlorine and bromine radicals but not ozone were also proven to be important for the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide with details shown in figures s16 s17 we compared the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide with those in the solar chlorine or the solar bromine system unexpectedly the presence of bromide significantly increased the formation of chlorate in the solar chlorine system while excess chlorine remarkably decreased the formation of bromate in the solar bromine system fig 1 we proposed that the reaction of bromite with hocl led to the unexpected trends in the formation of chlorate and bromate the reaction of bromite with hocl formed chlorate as the major product and bromate as the minor product the red part of scheme 1 this reaction overwhelmed the oxidation of bromite by oh bro and ozone resulting in the inhibition of bromate formation and the promotion of chlorate formation during the photolysis of the mixture of chlorine and bromine additionally the reaction of broclo hocl with h2o produced hobr reaction 3 and the formed hobr was proposed to offset the consumed bromine by the solar photolysis hobr recycling pathway in the red dotted line scheme 1 leading to a low decay rate of bromine in the solar chlorine system with bromide fig 1 some researches evaluated that the presence of bromide in the solar chlorine system induced the formation of bromate huang et al 2008 tomerlin 2008 but they ignored the alteration of chlorate formation on the other hand fang et al 2017 observed that the bromate formation at 25 μm bromide and 25 μm chlorine was higher than that at 25 μm bromide and 70 μm chlorine in the uv chlorine system at ph 7 but this phenomenon was not explained in their study we systematically investigated the formation of chlorate and bromate at different chlorine dosages and different bromide concentrations in the solar chlorine system the inhibition of bromate formation with increasing chlorine dosage and the promotion of chlorate formation with increasing bromide concentration attached great importance of the reaction between bromite and hocl on chlorate and bromate formation in the solar chlorine system with bromide 4 conclusions and engineering implications this study reports unexpected trends for the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide the presence of bromide in solar chlorine facilitates the formation of chlorate while the excess hocl significantly inhibits the formation of bromate the underlying mechanism is that the reaction of bromite with hocl influenced the formation of chlorate and bromate resulting in the formation of chlorate as the major product and bromate as the minor product this reaction is of importance which interferes the oxidation reaction of bromite by radicals to form bromate additionally the formation mechanisms can also be applied for the uv chlorine system which is an emerging advanced oxidation system for micropollutant abatement this study demonstrates a new formation pathway of chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine in bromide containing water solar photolysis of chlorinated water containing bromide is common under various scenarios especially in the chlorinated outdoor seawater swimming pool with high bromide concentration the in depth understanding of this mechanism in solar chlorine can help to control bromate formation excess hocl is beneficial to control the bromate formation the trade off for bromate control is the increase of chlorate formation nevertheless chlorate is much less toxic than bromate and its maximum contaminant level regulated is much higher than that of bromate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

14741,solar photolysis of free chlorine solar chlorine in bromide containing water occurs under various scenarios such as chlorinated reservoirs and outdoor swimming pools and the formation of chlorate and bromate is an important issue in the system we reported unexpected trends for the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system excess chlorine inhibited the formation of bromate i e increasing chlorine dosages from 50 to 100 μm reduced the bromate yield from 6 4 to 1 2 μm in solar chlorine at 50 μm bromide and ph 7 the yield of bromate in solar chlorine at 100 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromide in 240 min was 18 8 of that at 50 μm bromine only the underlying mechanism was that hocl can react with bromite bro2 to form hoclobro whose multi step transformation finally formed chlorate as the major product and bromate as the minor product this reaction overwhelmed the oxidation of bromite to form bromate by reactive species such as oh bro and ozone on the other hand the presence of bromide greatly enhanced the formation of chlorate increasing bromide concentrations from 0 to 50 μm enhanced the chlorate yields from 2 2 to 7 0 μm at 100 μm chlorine the absorbance of bromine was higher than that of chlorine thus the photolysis of bromine formed higher levels of bromite at higher bromide concentrations then bromite rapidly reacted with hocl to form hoclobro and it further transformed to chlorate additionally 1 mg l 1 nom had a negligible effect on bromate yields in solar chlorine at 50 μm bromide 100 μm chlorine and ph 7 this study demonstrated a new pathway of chlorate and bromate formation in the solar chlorine system with bromide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar chlorine bromide hypochlorous acid bromate chlorate water treatment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction exposure of chlorinated water to solar light is common under various water scenarios such as chlorinated open reservoirs outdoor swimming pools ocean ship ballast waters ocean aquaculture waters and plant irrigation with chlorine disinfected water macalady et al 1977 sun et al 2016 suh and mitch 2021 which creates a scene where chlorine is photolyzed by solar irradiation i e solar chlorine however toxic oxyhalides such as chlorate and bromate can be frequently formed particularly for bromate in bromide containing water macalady et al 1977 sánchez montes et al 2022 both bromate and chlorate are toxic to human health which are regulated to be 10 μg l 1 and 700 μg l 1 respectively by world health organization who 1993 and or worldwide european community 1998 usepa 2001 china ministry of health 2006 to inhibit the bromate formation during the solar photolysis of a chlorinated outdoor reservoir in los angeles 96 million shade balls were dumped to block the solar light zolfagharigard 2015 thus the formation of chlorate and bromate becomes an important issue in the solar chlorine system note that chlorine and bromine in this study refer to free chlorine hocl and clo and bromine hobr and bro species respectively formation of oxyhalides driven by solar light has been previously observed at high levels for example bromate in solar chlorine has been detected at a concentration of 100 μg l 1 in an open chlorinated drinking water reservoir tomerlin 2008 and up to 2 5 mg l 1 in the seawater macalady et al 1977 chlorate was detected at concentrations of 765 54 μg l 1 at most in the solar chlorine system at a chlorine dosage of 8 mg l 1 as cl2 young et al 2020 in addition the formation of oxyhalides is also a concern in the uv chlorine system von gunten 2018 yeom et al 2021 bromate formation was observed up to 36 μg l 1 in a water containing 2 mg l 1 bromide in the medium pressure mp uv chlorine system at a uv fluence of 800 mj cm 2 fang et al 2017 the conversion rates of bromide to bromate were 6 6 32 during uv chlorine treatment of raw water from yangtze river containing 0 7 μm bromide huang et al 2008 on the other hand up to 17 of chlorine 2 10 mg l 1 was converted to chlorate in the mp uv chlorine system at a full scale drinking water treatment plant wang et al 2015 thus oxyhalides especially bromate frequently exceeded the maximum contaminant levels mcls when chlorinated waters were exposed to solar or uv light irradiation however effects of chlorine dosage and bromide concentration on the chlorate and bromate formation in the solar chlorine system were rarely explored by previous studies which need comprehensive investigation to understand their formation trends the mechanisms for chlorate and bromate formation during the photolysis of chlorine only or bromine only have been studied both chlorate and bromate are formed via multiple reactions eq 1 1 hox xo x xo xo2 xo3 the photolysis of chlorine and bromine hox xo x cl or br produces hydroxyl radicals oh o and halogen radicals x as primary radicals and then oxyhalogen radicals xo are generated through the further reaction of primary radicals with hox xo fang et al 2014 xo rapidly transforms into xo and xo2 klaning and wolff 1985 xo2 is oxidized by oh xo and ozone to xo2 which is further transformed to cl2o3 and br2o4 as transient intermediates and eventually form xo3 fischbacher et al 2015 lee et al 2020 besides ozone which is formed during the photolysis of hypochlorite ions clo forsyth et al 2013 yang et al 2016 can directly oxidize hox xo to xo2 von gunten and hoigne 1994 jung et al 2014 the apparent quantum yields of chlorate and bromate are reported to be 0 12 0 23 mol einstein 1 during uv photolysis at 254 nm of chlorine or bromine lee et al 2020 previous studies just focused on the formation mechanisms of chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine only or bromine only by solar or uv light yang et al 2019 lee et al 2020 however in practical water scenarios chlorine dosages are usually higher than bromide concentrations specifically bromide concentrations in surface water and wastewater vary from a few μg l 1 to several mg l 1 greenwood and earnshaw 1997 and those in seawater range from 28 to 65 mg l 1 magazinovic 2004 borges et al 2005 the chlorine dosages for disinfection are 0 2 4 mg l 1 in drinking water zhu et al 2022 0 3 22 mg l 1 in wastewater treatment krasner et al 2009 chuang et al 2019 and those in seawater swimming pools are higher than bromide concentrations in order to achieve chlorine residuals at 0 4 1 4 mg l 1 parinet et al 2012 thus chlorine and bromine usually coexist in practical water scenarios our preliminary study found an uncommon phenomenon for the formation of bromate i e the bromate formation at 25 μm bromide and 25 μm chlorine was higher than that at 25 μm bromide and 70 μm chlorine in uv chlorine at ph 7 fang et al 2017 however the mechanism of this phenomenon was not investigated in this study fang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to investigate the pathways and mechanisms for bromate and chlorate formation during the mixture of chlorine and bromine photolysis the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of chlorine dosage and bromide concentration on the formation kinetics of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide 2 to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms for chlorate and bromate formation particularly the roles of chlorine in their formation in the solar chlorine system additionally the mechanisms for oxyhalide formation in the solar chlorine system were verified in the uv chlorine system 2 materials and methods 2 1

6 dbp was used to react with hobr bro rapidly and produce 2 4 6 tbp with the stoichiometric relationship of 1 1 while 2 6 dbp rarely reacted with hocl clo the concentration of 2 4 6 tbp was determined by hplc to quantified the concentration hobr bro text s8 the concentration of hocl clo was calculated by subtracting the concentration of hobr bro from the total concentration of hocl clo and hobr bro the ph was measured using a ph meter s210 mettler toledo 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide the initial concentrations of bromide and chlorine were 50 μm and 100 μm respectively and the ph was 7 bromide was rapidly converted into bromine by chlorine eqs 2 3 thus the concentration of bromine increased to 49 1 μm in 20 s by model figure s7 as described in a previous study guo et al 2020 these reactions enabled the rapid conversion of 100 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromide into 50 μm bromine and 50 μm chlorine resulting in the coexistence of chlorine and bromine we compared the sunlight photolysis system containing 100 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromide with that only containing 50 μm chlorine or 50 μm bromine the former was a mixed system with approximate 50 μm chlorine and 50 μm bromine system 1 while the latter two only contained chlorine system 2 or bromine system 3 at the same concentration of 50 μm interestingly the chlorate formation in system 1 was much higher than that in system 2 during 240 min of continuous solar exposure whereas the bromate formation in system 1 was much lower than that in system 3 fig 1 specifically the yield of chlorate in system 1 was 7 0 μm at 240 min while that was only 0 9 μm in system 2 fig 1a in contrast the yield of bromate was 1 2 μm in system 1 while that was 6 4 μm in system 3 fig 1b as reported chlorate was formed mainly via the photolysis of chlorine and subsequent oxidation and bromate was formed mainly via the photolysis of bromine and subsequent oxidation eq 1 lee et al 2020 however these mechanisms can not explain our results in system 1 the concentration of chlorine decayed to 6 9 μm while that of bromine just slightly decayed to 48 1 μm in 240 min in system 2 the concentration of chlorine decreased to 40 5 μm which was much slower than that in system 1 fig 1a on the contrary bromine decayed to 22 0 μm in system 3 which was much faster than that in system 1 fig 1b the decay of chlorine was also simulated by a kinetic model using kintecus v4 55 ianni 2012 which contains 220 photochemical and chemical reactions obtained from guo et al 2020 the decay of chlorine in system 2 by modeling was consistent with that by experimental results however the concentration of chlorine just decreased by 35 4 μm in system 1 by modeling figure s8 which was lower than that obtained by experiment 43 1 μm the kinetic model only considered the consumption of chlorine by solar photolysis bromide and radicals such as oh and cl indicating that bromine containing intermediates also consumed chlorine 3 2 factors affecting the formation of chlorate and bromate in solar chlorine 3 2 1 effects of chlorine dosage the initial concentration of bromide was fixed at 50 μm and that of chlorine increased from 50 to 100 μm the conversion rates of bromide to bromine reached 99 in 32 113 s at 50 100 μm chlorine figure s7 the yields of chlorate in 240 min increased from 0 0093 to 7 0 μm with increasing chlorine dosage from 50 to 100 μm however the yield of bromate decreased from 6 4 to 1 2 μm fig 2 furthermore the decrease of bromate yields with increasing chlorine dosage was also observed at lower levels of bromide i e 10 μm when the initial concentration of bromide was fixed at 10 μm as chlorine dosage increased from 20 to 50 μm the yields of bromate decreased from 0 23 to 0 13 μm at 300 min figure s13 these results suggested that excess chlorine significantly inhibited the bromate formation we extended the solar exposure time to 24 h because chlorine and bromine were almost completely consumed after 24 h solar exposure fig 3 taking the chlorine dosage of 100 μm and initial bromide concentration of 50 μm as an example there was only 8 μm chlorine left in 6 h fig 3 coincidently the formation of bromate started to accelerate after 6 h the average yield of bromate in 4 6 h was 0 3 μm h 1 while that in 6 8 h was 1 0 μm h 1 fig 3b further confirming that excess chlorine significantly inhibited the bromate formation meanwhile the average decay rate of bromine was 1 7 μm h 1 in 4 6 h while that was 5 9 μm h 1 in 6 8 h fig 3b as excess chlorine reacted with bromide and compensated the consumed bromine bromate was formed by the photolysis of bromine and a series of radical oxidation reactions during which some intermediates were formed such as bro bromite bro2 and bro2 of note bromite reacted with hocl through a series of reactions nicoson et al 2003 the reaction between bromite and hocl formed hoclobro which transformed to hobroclo and then decomposed to broclo eqs 4 and 5 broclo further combined with hocl to form the broclo hocl adduct eq 6 whose decay preferred to form chlorate as a major product 85 of bromite and bromate as a minor product 7 of bromite eqs 7 and 8 the reaction of bromite with hocl competed with that with oh bro and ozone the second order rate constants ks of bromite reacting with hocl oh bro and ozone were reported to be 160 m 1 s 1 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 4 0 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 9 104 m 1 s 1 respectively nicoson et al 2003 sedlak and von gunten 2011 fischbacher et al 2015 in system 1 the average concentration of hocl was 2 8 10 5 m fig 1 and the steady state concentration of oh was determined to be 1 0 10 14 m by using nitrobenzene as a probe compound text s5 and figure s9 therefore the pseudo first order rate constants k s of bromite reacting with hocl and oh were 4 5 10 3 s 1 and 1 9 10 5 s 1 respectively in addition bro concentration was estimated to be 10 13 m based on the concentration of clo in solar chlorine determined by hua et al 2019 because there was no method for quantifying bro concentration the concentration of ozone was determined to be 3 2 10 9 m by using cinnamic acid as a probe compound text s6 and figure s15 therefore the k of bromite with bro and ozone were 4 0 10 5 s 1 and 2 8 10 4 s 1 respectively these results indicated that the reaction of bromite with hocl overwhelmed that with radicals in the solar chlorine system with bromide the increased chlorine dosages promoted the reaction of bromite with hocl reducing the yield of bromate and simultaneously enhancing the yield of chlorate 4 hocl bro 2 hoclobr o h hobrocl o 5 hobroclo h broclo h2o 6 broclo hocl broclo hocl 7 broclo hocl h2o clo3 hobr cl 2h 8 broclo hocl h2o bro3 hocl cl 2h besides the reaction between chlorite and hobr can also form hobroclo with the k of 97 m 1 s 1 eq 9 furman and margerum 1998 which was similar with the reaction of bromite with hocl the reaction between chlorite and hobr may also accelerate the chlorate formation as hobroclo finally transformed to chlorate predominantly via eqs 5 7 9 hobr clo2 hobroclo 3 2 2 effects of bromide concentrations when the initial concentration of chlorine was fixed at 100 μm and that of bromide increased from 0 to 50 μm the yields of bromate increased from 0 to 1 2 μm at 240 min fig 4 b interestingly the yields of chlorate increased from 2 2 to 7 0 μm fig 4a the increased bromide concentrations led to the enhancement of bromine concentrations and the reduction of chlorine concentrations at a certain chlorine dosage this was expected to decrease the chlorate formation as confirmed that the decrease of chlorine dosage resulted in less chlorate formation in the chlorine only system figure s10 while the result showed that chlorate formation increased with decreasing chlorine dosages the photolysis rate of bromine in system 3 was 2 9 10 3 min 1 fig 1b while that of chlorine in system 2 was 7 3 10 4 min 1 fig 1a the higher photolysis rate of bromine compared with chlorine was due to the higher molar absorption coefficient of bromine hobr bro than that of chlorine hocl clo in the solar band lee et al 2020 the increase in bromide concentration directly led to an increase in the concentration of bromine coupled with the faster photolysis rate of bromine than chlorine facilitating the formation of bromite then the reaction between bromite and hocl was enhanced thus promoting the formation of chlorate 3 2 3 effects of ph to explore the effects of chlorine species hocl or clo on the formation of chlorate and bromate solution ph was increased to 10 at ph 7 hocl and clo existed with the proportion of 76 0 and 24 0 respectively while at ph 10 99 7 of chlorine existed as clo korshin 2011 bulman et al 2019 at ph 10 the yield of chlorate in system 1 was 4 2 μm at 240 min while that in system 2 was 1 7 μm fig 5 a the yield of bromate in system 1 was 4 8 μm while that in system 3 was 7 2 μm fig 5b thus the yield of chlorate in system 1 was higher than that in system 2 and the yield of bromate in system 1 was lower than that in system 3 which were consistent with the results at ph 7 suggesting that clo can also react with bromite to eventually produce chlorate as the major product since the conversion from clo to bro was much slower than that from hocl to hobr eqs 2 and 3 only 26 8 μm bromine was formed in system 1 at ph 10 and 1 min accordingly the concentration of chlorine was 73 2 μm then the concentration of chlorine in system 1 decayed to 17 1 μm at 240 min fig 5a the concentration of bromine increased from 0 to 42 2 μm in 60 min and then decreased to 34 3 μm at 240 min fig 5b in system 2 the concentration of chlorine decreased from 50 to 35 0 μm fig 5a which was much slower than that in system 1 the faster consumption of chlorine in system 1 compared with system 2 can also be explained by the reaction of bromite with clo at ph 10 when the initial concentration of chlorine was fixed at 100 μm and that of bromide increased from 0 to 50 μm the yields of bromate increased from 0 to 4 8 μm fig 4d notably the yields of chlorate decreased from 8 0 to 4 2 μm fig 4c which was inconsistent with the increase in the yields of chlorate with increasing bromide concentrations at ph 7 fig 4a by comparing the trends of chlorate formation at ph 10 and ph 7 the k for the reaction of bromite with clo was likely to be lower than that with hocl thus at ph 10 chlorate was formed mainly through the oxidation of chlorite by radicals eq 1 rather than the reaction of bromite with clo the increased bromide concentration consumed more chlorine thus resulting in the decrease of chlorate yield 3 2 4 effects of nom fig 6 showed the effects of 1 mg l 1 nom on the formation of oxyhalides during solar chlorine at 100 μm chlorine 50 μm bromide and ph 7 the presence of 1 mg l 1 nom in the solar chlorine system reduced the yields of chlorate from 7 0 to 5 5 μm however the yields of bromate were slightly affected by nom which were both 1 2 μm as a scavenger for reactive species nom has high reactivity with reactive chlorine species such as cl k c l nom 3 7 108 1 6 109 mc 1 s 1 cl2 k cl 2 nom 4 6 106 3 6 107 mc 1 s 1 and clo k cl o nom 5 4 108 mc 1 s 1 wu et al 2017 lei et al 2021 therefore the scavenging effects of reactive chlorine species by nom resulted in the decrease of chlorate formation in addition 1 mg l 1 nom could increase chlorine consumption by 5 1 μm which accounted for 10 2 of 50 μm chlorine figure s12 the reduction of chlorine by nom slowed down the reaction of bromite with hocl to form chlorate for bromate formation due to the reduced hocl concentration the inhibitory effect of the reaction between bromite and hocl on bromate formation was weakened on the other hand nom can scavenge br br2 and bro with the ks of 3 1 108 mc 1 s 1 3 6 106 mc 1 s 1 and 2 5 105 mc 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2020 the decrease of rbs led to less bromite formation further inhibiting the bromate formation therefore the trade off made the bromate formation almost unaffected by 1 mg l 1 nom 3 3 the formation of chlorate and bromate in the uv chlorine system the uv chlorine system has attracted great interests for oxidation and disinfection recently guo et al 2022 to explore whether the trends of bromate and chlorate formation in the solar chlorine system can happen in the uv chlorine system we also investigated the effects of chlorine dosage on the formation of chlorate and bromate in the uv chlorine system at 50 μm bromide and ph 7 fig 7 the yields of chlorate increased from 0 35 to 6 8 μm with increasing chlorine dosage from 50 to 100 μm in 60 min meanwhile the yields of bromate decreased from 4 0 to 1 9 μm the decreasing bromate yields with increasing chlorine dosages demonstrated that the reaction of bromite with hocl also significantly altered the bromate formation in the uv chlorine system the decrease of bromate yields with chlorine dosages increased from 50 to 100 μm in the uv chlorine system was less significant than that in the solar chlorine system the former decreased from 4 0 to 1 9 μm at 60 min fig 7 and the latter decreased from 6 4 to 1 2 μm at 240 min fig 2 hocl has a higher absorbance figure s6 and quantum yield sun et al 2016 at 254 nm compared with solar light leading to the rapid decomposition of hocl by uv irradiation remucal and manley 2016 thus the consumption of hocl reduced the hocl available for the reaction between hocl and bromite on the other hand due to the increased concentrations of radicals caused by enhanced hocl photolysis the oxidation of bromite by radicals became dominant which promoted the formation of bromate hence the inhibition effect of hocl on bromate formation also existed in the uv chlorine system but it was less significant than that in the solar chlorine system 3 4 formation pathways of chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine in bromide containing water based on the above results the formation pathways for chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine in bromide containing water were concluded in scheme 1 previous studies focused on the mechanism of chlorate and bromate formation during chlorine only and bromine only photolysis wang et al 2015 lee et al 2020 xo was found to be an important precursor of xo3 via the reaction of hox xo with oh and x where xo was oxidized to xo2 then xo2 and finally xo3 black boxes in scheme 1 buxton and subhani 1972 lee et al 2020 in current study the yields of chlorate and bromate were investigated during the photolysis of co existing chlorine and bromine radicals but not ozone were also proven to be important for the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide with details shown in figures s16 s17 we compared the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide with those in the solar chlorine or the solar bromine system unexpectedly the presence of bromide significantly increased the formation of chlorate in the solar chlorine system while excess chlorine remarkably decreased the formation of bromate in the solar bromine system fig 1 we proposed that the reaction of bromite with hocl led to the unexpected trends in the formation of chlorate and bromate the reaction of bromite with hocl formed chlorate as the major product and bromate as the minor product the red part of scheme 1 this reaction overwhelmed the oxidation of bromite by oh bro and ozone resulting in the inhibition of bromate formation and the promotion of chlorate formation during the photolysis of the mixture of chlorine and bromine additionally the reaction of broclo hocl with h2o produced hobr reaction 3 and the formed hobr was proposed to offset the consumed bromine by the solar photolysis hobr recycling pathway in the red dotted line scheme 1 leading to a low decay rate of bromine in the solar chlorine system with bromide fig 1 some researches evaluated that the presence of bromide in the solar chlorine system induced the formation of bromate huang et al 2008 tomerlin 2008 but they ignored the alteration of chlorate formation on the other hand fang et al 2017 observed that the bromate formation at 25 μm bromide and 25 μm chlorine was higher than that at 25 μm bromide and 70 μm chlorine in the uv chlorine system at ph 7 but this phenomenon was not explained in their study we systematically investigated the formation of chlorate and bromate at different chlorine dosages and different bromide concentrations in the solar chlorine system the inhibition of bromate formation with increasing chlorine dosage and the promotion of chlorate formation with increasing bromide concentration attached great importance of the reaction between bromite and hocl on chlorate and bromate formation in the solar chlorine system with bromide 4 conclusions and engineering implications this study reports unexpected trends for the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar chlorine system with bromide the presence of bromide in solar chlorine facilitates the formation of chlorate while the excess hocl significantly inhibits the formation of bromate the underlying mechanism is that the reaction of bromite with hocl influenced the formation of chlorate and bromate resulting in the formation of chlorate as the major product and bromate as the minor product this reaction is of importance which interferes the oxidation reaction of bromite by radicals to form bromate additionally the formation mechanisms can also be applied for the uv chlorine system which is an emerging advanced oxidation system for micropollutant abatement this study demonstrates a new formation pathway of chlorate and bromate during the photolysis of chlorine in bromide containing water solar photolysis of chlorinated water containing bromide is common under various scenarios especially in the chlorinated outdoor seawater swimming pool with high bromide concentration the in depth understanding of this mechanism in solar chlorine can help to control bromate formation excess hocl is beneficial to control the bromate formation the trade off for bromate control is the increase of chlorate formation nevertheless chlorate is much less toxic than bromate and its maximum contaminant level regulated is much higher than that of bromate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

14742,up to date over 700 disinfection byproducts dbps have been detected and identified in drinking water it has been recognized that cytotoxicity of dbps varied significantly among groups even within the same group cytotoxicity of different dbp species was also different due to different halogen substitution types and numbers however it is still difficult to quantitatively determine the inter group cytotoxicity relationships of dbps under the effect of halogen substitution in different cell lines especially when a large number of dbp groups and multiple cytotoxicity cell lines are involved in this study a powerful dimensionless parameter scaling method was adopted to quantitatively determine the relationship of halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of various dbp groups in three cell lines i e the human breast carcinoma mvln chinese hamster ovary cho and human hepatoma hep g2 cell cytotoxicity with no need to consider their absolute values and other influences by introducing the dimensionless parameters d x or n species cell line and d x or n species cell line as well as their corresponding linear regression equation coefficients k type or number cell line and k type or number cell line the strength and trend of halogen substitution influences on the relative cytotoxic potency could be determined it was found that the effect of halogen substitution type and number on the cytotoxicity of dbps followed the same patterns in the three cell lines the cho cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution on the aliphatic dbps whereas the mvln cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution on the cyclic dbps notably seven quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models were established which could not only predict the cytotoxicity data of dbps but also help to explain and verify the patterns of halogen substitution effect on cytotoxicity of dbps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts drinking water cytotoxicity dimensionless parameter scaling qsar data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disinfection of drinking water is an important treatment process to effectively inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and prevent waterborne diseases shannon et al 2008 sedlak and von gunten 2011 however disinfection byproducts dbps are unintentionally generated when disinfectants react with natural organic matter and halides in water richardson and ternes 2018 up to now over 700 dbps have been reported in drinking water including commonly known aliphatic dbp groups e g trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles and emerging cyclic dbp groups e g halophenols halobenzoquinones halosalicylaldehydes krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 qin et al 2010 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 tang et al 2021 hu et al 2022a zhang et al 2022 toxicological and epidemiological data have shown that dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic mutagenic carcinogenic and associated with an increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes as well as liver and bladder cancers when long term exposure costet et al 2011 stayner 2014 aslani et al 2019 therefore the toxicological effects of dbps are of increasing concern to researchers and the public it has been widely recognized that cytotoxicity of dbps varied significantly among groups for instance the chinese hamster ovary cho cell cytotoxicity of a few dbp groups basically followed the rank order of haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloacetic acids halobenzoquinones halopyrroles wagner and plewa 2017 and the human hepatoma hep g2 cell cytotoxicity of aliphatic dbps was nearly eight times higher than that of the cyclic dbps wu et al 2022 even within the same dbp group that shared the same main structure cytotoxicity of different dbp species was also different due to different halogen substitution types chloro bromo iodo and numbers monohalo dihalo trihalo for example in cho cells iodoacetamide and 2 2 iodophenyl acetamide were several to hundreds of times more cytotoxic than their bromo and chloro analogues plewa et al 2008 hu et al 2022a the cho cell cytotoxicity of haloacetaldehydes followed the decreasing rank order of chloro dichloro trichloro species whereas the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity of halophenols followed an increasing rank order of bromo dibromo tribromo species jeong et al 2015 wu et al 2022 although substantial efforts have been made in previous studies to figure out the effect of halogen substitition on cytotoxicity of dbps it is still difficult to quantitatively determine their inter group relationships in different cell lines especially when a large number of dbp groups and multiple cell lines are involved a powerful mathematical method dimensionless parameter scaling could be promising to quantitatively determine the relationship between halogen substitution and cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines the dimensionless parameter scaling method is using an appropriate dimensionless parameter to represent the ratio of a variable to the control in the same dimension affected by the critical influencing factor luce et al 2008 niven 2023 by further performing a linear regression analysis on the dimensionless parameters dependent variable versus the critical influencing factor independent variable a coefficient of the linear regression equation the slope can be obtained which quantifies the relative relationship of these variables at the same dimension in a direct mathematical way with no need to consider their absolute values and other influencing factors schneider et al 2010 the high low of the absolute coefficient reflects the strength of the influence and the positive negative of the coefficient reflects the trend of the influence the dimensionless parameter scaling method has been applied in modeling the formation of dbps duirk and valentine 2006 for example the relationship between the formation efficiency of dichloroacetic acid i e dichloroacetic acid generated by per mg l as c of a type of oxidized dissolved organic matter and the specific uv absorbance suva280 of different types of dissolved organic matter could be quantified by a linear equation with no need to consider the absolute amount of oxidized nom the positive coefficient of the linear equation suggested that the formation efficiency of dichloroacetic acid was positively correlated with the specific uv absorbance accordingly with the aid of the dimensionless parameter scaling method this study was designed to quantitatively determine the relationship of halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of various dbp groups in multiple cell lines the effects of halogen substitution type chloro bromo iodo and number monohalo dihalo trihalo on the cytotoxicity of a wide spectrum of dbps in three different cell lines i e the human breast carcinoma cells mvln cytotoxicity data obtained in this study and the cho and hep g2 cell cytotoxicity data reported in previous studies were aimed to be fully examined and compared a series of optimized quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models were aimed to be established for cytotoxicity mechanism exploration and cytotoxicity prediction validation of dbps in the three cell lines 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a total of 32 aliphatic and 34 cyclic dbps were selected to test cytotoxicity to mvln cell line the tested dbps were classified into 18 groups according to their main structures as listed in table 1 and their purities and suppliers were provided in supporting information si the mvln cell line the bioluminescent mcf 7 derived cell line was provided by prof maoyong song research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of science china dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 99 9 was purchased from sigma aldrich cell counting kit 8 cck 8 was obtained from keygen biotech china phosphate buffered saline pbs and penicillin streptomycin solution were obtained from hyclone dulbecco s modified eagle s medium dmem basic 1x was purchased from thermo scientific fetal bovine serum fbs and 0 25 trypsin edta 1x were purchased from life technologies 2 2 mvln cell cytotoxicity assay the mvln cell cytotoxicity assay was conducted for the aforementioned 66 dbps and the results were compared with those obtained from the previous cho and hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assays the mvln cell line was stably transfected with the luciferase reporter gene driven by an estrogen response element containing promoter since the bioluminescent response is in agreement with the natural responses like cellular proliferation or stimulation of the progesterone receptor the mvln cell cytotoxicity assay is a well established method to evaluate the cytotoxicity and estrogenic potency of single substances and environmental samples bjerregaard olesen et al 2016 chen et al 2020 li et al 2023 to initiate the bioassay of a dbp the mvln cells were rinsed with pbs trypsinized and then transferred into 96 well plates with a cell density of about 1 5 105 cells ml which were cultured in dmem at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 with regard to the relatively lower solubility of cyclic dbps as well as the effect of dmso on cell viability a concentration of 0 5 v v dmso was used in this assay hu et al 2022a zhang et al 2022 after growing for 24 h the cells in each well were exposed to dmem containing the required concentration of the dbp and 0 5 v v dmso the negative control was 0 5 v v dmso the positive control was 200 μm iodoacetic acid and the blank control was 100 μl dmem taking the high proliferative capacity and cell confluence into consideration 24 h was set for exposure and then the cells in each well were exposed to a mixed solution of 10 μl cck 8 and 100 μl dmem in darkness after being incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 for 1 5 h the cells were measured by a microplate reader nikon eclipse ti s at 450 nm cell viability was determined by the relative absorbance six replicates were set for each concentration and the assay for each dbp was repeated by three times 2 3 statistical analysis cytotoxicity data were transferred to excel spreadsheets and analyzed with sigma plot 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca results from independent experiments were averaged and expressed as mean standard deviation sd the concentration response curves of dbps were plotted and for each curve a four parameter logistic curve regression analysis was conducted the mvln cell 50 maximal effect concentration ec50 values were calculated from the regressions a one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak multiple comparisons test was conducted to obtain the lowest observed effect concentration loec of each dbp the ec50 loec cytotoxicity index cti cti ec50 1 106 and other cytotoxicity data of each dbp were listed in table 1 2 4 comparative cytotoxicity analyses using dimensionless parameter scaling method to quantitatively determine the relationships between halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of dbps the dimensionless parameter scaling method was adopted to process the three sets of cytotoxicity data i e the mvln ec50 values obtained from this study as well as the cho 50 maximum mortality lc50 and the hep g2 ec50 values obtained from previous studies liberatore et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 hong et al 2018 hu et al 2018 lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 2019 hu et al 2020 tian et al 2020 wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 hu et al 2022a 2022b jiang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 all the cytotoxicity data used were summarized in table s1 to quantify the relationship between halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of dbps in a single cell line dbps in the same group were further assembled to form subsets according to substitution type chloro bromo iodo or number monohalo dihalo trihalo the cytotoxicity data of each subset were all from one laboratory or the same assay under the same endpoint all subsets were listed in table s2 for each subset assembled by substitution type the cytotoxicity of its chloro species the bromo species was used in case chloro species was absent in this subset was set as the control and the relative cytotoxicity of the bromo and iodo species in the subset were calculated as a dimensionless parameter d x species cell line by eq 1 for each subset assembled by substitution number the cytotoxicity of its trihalo species the dihalo species was used in case trihalo species was absent in this subset was set as the control and the relative cytotoxicity of the monohalo and dihalo species in the subset were calculated as a dimensionless parameter d n species cell line by eq 2 notably a higher d value of a dbp suggests a relatively higher cytotoxicity in the corresponding subset 1 d x species cell line cti x species cell line cti chloro species bromo species in case cell line x chloro bromo iodo 2 d n species cell line cti n species cell line cti trihalo species dihalo species in case cell line n monohalo dihalo trihalo for each subset assembled by substitution type a linear regression analysis was conducted by depicting the obtained d x species cell line values set as dependent variable d x species cell line versus the substitution type set as independent variable x and assigning 1 2 and 3 for chloro bromo and iodo species respectively the coefficient k type cell line of the resulted regression equation d x species cell line k type cell line x b b was constant represented the relationship of the relative cytotoxic potency and the halogen substitution type chloro bromo iodo species similarly in the subset with different halogen substitution numbers the coefficient k number cell line of each linear regression equation d n species cell line k number cell line n b d n species cell line n and b was dependent variable independent variable and constant respectively represented the relationship of the relative cytotoxic potency and the halogen substitution number monohalo dihalo trihalo species the high low of the k values reflected the strength of the halogen substitution influence on the relative cytotoxic potency and the positive negative of the k values reflected the trend of the influence on the relative cytotoxic potency to quantify the relationship between halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines d x species cell line and d n species cell line of all the subsets were first averaged to give d x species cell line and d n species cell line from each cell line respectively the study subsets were listed in table s3 linear regression analyses of d x species cell line and d n species cell line d x species cell line k type eell line x b and d n species cell line k number cell line n b d x species cell line or d n species cell line was dependent variable x or n was independent variable b was constant were further conducted to achieve k type eell line and k number cell line respectively the k type cell line represented the relationship between the relative cytotoxic potency of all the subsets for a specific cell line and the halogen substitution type whereas the k number cell line represented the relationship between the relative cytotoxic potency of all the subsets and the halogen substitution number for a specific cell line by comparing the high low and positive negative of the k values obtained from different cell lines the strength and trend of the halogen substitution influence on the relative cytotoxic potency could be quantified 2 5 establishment of qsar models since the establishment of each qsar model required the cytotoxicity data from the same experimental procedure 64 mvln ec50 values from cck 8 assay 142 cho lc50 values from crystal violet and cck 8 assays and 65 hep g2 ec50 values from cck 8 assay that explicitly noted in table s1 were used with a stepwise multiple regression method to develop seven qsar models herrig et al 2015 a total of 18 representative candidate descriptors including four physical chemical descriptors eight quantum chemical descriptors and six topological descriptors were selected for model development using a stepwise elimination with ibm spss statistics version 25 ibm corp armonk ny u s the widely applied leave one out validation method was selected to verify the stability and robustness of the model the notations and values corresponding to each dbp of the candidate descriptors were listed in si tables s4 and s5 detailed information about the generation of descriptors and the model validation were detailed in the si notably 60 cytotoxicity values of dbps lacking experimental cytotoxicity data in certain cell lines were predicted for the validation of findings the specific dbps and used qsar models were listed in table s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of halogen substitution on the mvln cell cytotoxicity fig 1 shows concentration response curves of the 18 groups of 32 aliphatic and 34 cyclic dbps to the mvln cells the ec50 loec cti and other statistical analysis data of each dbp were listed in table 1 the ec50 values of different dbp groups were varied vastly by four orders of magnitude from 4 5 μm for iodoacetamide to 3 8 10 4 μm for trichloroacetic acid even among the same group the mvln cell cytotoxicity of different dbp species were quite different due to different halogen substitution types chloro bromo iodo and numbers monohalo dihalo trihalo to quantitatively depict the effect of halogen substitution type and number on the mvln cell cytotoxicity dbps in each group were assembled to subsets table s2 the dimensionless parameter scaling method was adopted to process the cytotoxicity data of each subset to obtain its d x species mvln and d n species mvln values table s2 which further underwent linear regression analyses to give k type mvln and k number mvln values fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the k type mvln values were all positive in the regression equations suggesting that the mvln cell cytotoxicity of both aliphatic and cyclic dbps followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species the k type mvln values were ranging from 0 476 halosalicylic acids to 258 206 haloacetamides suggesting that the effect of halogen substitution type on haloacetamides was about 542 times stronger than that on halosalicylic acids as shown in fig 2b the k number mvln values were negative for the aliphatic dbps whereas positive for cyclic dbps in the regression equations suggesting that the mvln cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the aliphatic dbps and monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the cyclic dbps this might result from different cytotoxicity mechanisms for aliphatic and cyclic dbps the absolute k number mvln values i e k number mvln were ranging from 0 050 halonitromethanes to 14 988 haloacetic acids suggesting that the effect of halogen substitution number on halonitromethanes was about 300 times stronger than that on haloacetic acids 3 2 effect of halogen substitution on multi cell line cytotoxicity besides the mvln cell cytotoxicity data that obtained in this study the other two sets of cytotoxicity data i e the cho lc50 values of 24 groups of 73 aliphatic and 79 cyclic dbps and the hep g2 ec50 values of 20 groups of 21 aliphatic and 48 cyclic dbps were obtained from previous studies table s1 similar to the data processing procedures for the mvln cell cytotoxicity d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 values were obtained for the cho and the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity table s2 which further underwent linear regression analyses to give k type cho ranging from 0 102 to 323 020 and k type hep g 2 ranging from 0 264 to 27 303 values fig 3 a and b the k type cho and k type hep g 2 values were all positive in the regression equations suggesting that the cho and hep g2 cell cytotoxicity of both aliphatic and cyclic dbps followed the same rank order of chloro bromo iodo species and this trend was also found in the mvln cell cytotoxicity as described above to quantify the relationships between halogen substitution type and the cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines d x species mvln d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 of all the subsets from each cell line were first averaged to give d x species mvln d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 respectively table s2 linear regression analyses of d x species mvln d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 were further conducted to achieve k type mvln k type cho and k type hep g 2 respectively as shown in fig 3c the k type mvln k type cho and k type hep g 2 were all positive for the aliphatic 80 433 282 720 and 20 555 respectively and the cyclic dbps 1 938 0 989 and 0 379 respectively suggesting that the cho cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution type on the aliphatic dbps whereas the mvln cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution type on the cyclic dbps furthermore d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 values were obtained for the cho and the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity table s2 which further underwent linear regression analyses to give k number cho and k number hep g 2 values as shown in fig 4 a and b the k number cho and k number hep g 2 values were negative for the aliphatic dbps whereas positive for the cyclic dbps in the regression equations suggesting that the cho and the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the aliphatic dbps and monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the cyclic dbps this trend was also found in the mvln cell cytotoxicity as described above to quantify the relationships between halogen substitution number and the cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines d n species mvln d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 of all the subsets from each cell line were first averaged to give d n species mvln d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 respectively table s2 linear regression analyses of d n species mvln d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 were further conducted to achieve k number mvln k number cho and k number hep g 2 respectively as shown in fig 4c the k number mvln k number cho and k number hep g 2 were all negative for the aliphatic dbps with the absolute values of 5 488 35 335 and 0 244 respectively and were all positive for the cyclic dbps with the values of 0 681 0 464 and 0 386 respectively accordingly the cho cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution number on the aliphatic dbps whereas the mvln cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to examine the effect of halogen substitution number on the cyclic dbps 3 3 development of mechanism based qsar models for different cell lines to better interpret cytotoxicity mechanisms of aliphatic and cyclic dbps with different halogen substitution seven qsar models based on the three cell lines were developed and compared each qsar model was derived from cytotoxicity data obtained from the same experimental procedure as described in section 2 5 the ratios between the number of dbps and descriptors in models should be higher than 5 1 to avoid chance correlation zhang et al 2020 the resulting optimum qsar models were shown in eqs 3 9 among which eqs 3 5 were developed based on the mvln ec50 cho lc50 and hep g2 ec50 values of the aliphatic dbps respectively while eqs 6 9 were developed based on the mvln ec50 cho lc50 and hep g2 ec50 values of the cyclic dbps respectively notably eqs 7 and 8 were based on the crystal violet assay and the cck 8 assay respectively 3 log ec 50 mvln 1 3 95 10 4 e 0 051 v 0 416 4 n 30 r 2 0 837 q loo 2 0 802 rmse 0

the data similarity the criteria of r2 0 700 q l o o 2 0 600 and p 0 05 supported that all the developed qsar models were of high goodness of fit and robustness chen et al 2015 rmse is the root mean square error and measures the accuracy of predictions mae is the mean absolute error of calibration and measures how close predictions are to the eventual outcomes chen et al 2015 the smaller rmse or mae value meant the more accurate prediction of the qsar model fisher ratio f checks the significance of independent variables on dependent variable and f 15 0 indicated that the null hypothesis could be eliminated hu et al 2022 the variance inflation factors vifs were all 10 table s6 suggesting that there was no multiple correlation between the variables hou et al 2019 meanwhile the williams plot is the statistic for checking potential outliers and fig 5 a g demonstrated that the data set for all the seven models was representative furthermore it could be seen from fig 5h n that the ec50 or lc50 values predicted from the seven models were generally coincident with the experimental values the aliphatic dbps models r2 0 837 0 718 and 0 861 the cyclic dbps models r2 0 728 0 701 0 859 and 0 700 all the approaches for validation demonstrated that each developed qsar model was acceptable and had good predictivity for the cytotoxicity value of dbp with similar main structure aliphatic or cyclic structure the three models for aliphatic dbps eqs 3 5 shared two common quantum chemical descriptors i e total energy e and molecular volume v e is the sum of the electron energy of the molecule and the nuclear repulsion energy which is negatively correlated with the van der waals radius of a molecule campos et al 2020 awasthi et al 2021 nawaz et al 2021 it was found in eqs 3 5 that e was negatively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 in all the three cell lines suggesting that log ec50 or lc50 1 of a molecule was positively correlated with its van der waals radius since the van der waals radii of dbp subsets with different substitution types followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species the cytotoxicity of these dbp species followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species campos et al 2020 it was demonstrated by eqs 3 5 that v was also negatively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 in all the three cell lines suggesting that the cytotoxicity of a dbp was higher with a lower molecular volume since the molecular volumes of dbp subsets with different substitution numbers followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species the cytotoxicity of these dbp species followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species dad et al 2018 additionally wiener index windx is closely correlated with the boiling points of alkane molecules and a larger radius of gyration rad can improve inter molecular interactions and reactivities adnan et al 2021 heydari et al 2021 the two descriptors might be responsible for the difference of cytotoxicity between the cho and the other cell lines notably different descriptors mainly elumo logp and svde were involved in the four models for cyclic dbps eqs 6 9 elumo reflects the relative electrophilicity and correlates well with reduction potentials a lower elumo value means that the corresponding dbp is more receptive to electrons and more likely to react with nucleophile sites and therefore more cytotoxic morell et al 2005 yang and zhang 2013 it was found in eqs 6 8 and 9 that elumo was negatively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 in all the three cell lines which was in consistent with the previous reports for instance the elumo values of dbp subsets for hep g2 cell cytotoxicity were 0 0286 0 3654 and 0 7263 ev for monohalo dihalo and trihalo species respectively table s7 and their cho cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species logp reflects the lipophilicity hydrophobicity of dbps which is directly correlated with the ability to transport through the cell lipid bilayers plewa et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 it was demonstrated by eqs 6 8 that logp was positively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 suggesting that the cytotoxicity of a dbp was higher with a higher hydrophobicity for instance the logp values of dbp subsets for cho cell cytotoxicity with the cck 8 assay were 1 96 2 09 and 2 67 for chloro bromo and iodo species respectively table s7 and their cho cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species additionally sum of valence degrees svde encodes the information of the molecular sizes and configuration of all non hydrogen atoms and might be related to molecular volume which could affect in vitro toxicity of dbps with different halogen substitution types xu et al 2004 wei et al 2020 3 4 cytotoxicity prediction with the qsar models although hundreds of dbps have been tested for their cytotoxicity in one or more types of cells there were still many dbps lacking experimental cytotoxicity data in certain cell lines due to the absence of commercially available standard compounds or other reasons with the above seven models cytotoxicity was predicted for 8 groups of 19 dbps in mvln cells 6 groups of 11 dbps in cho cells and 11 groups of 30 dbps in hep g2 cells table s8 by complement the predicted cytotoxicity data of these dbps to their corresponding subsets d x species cell line d n species cell line k type cell line and k number cell line could be calculated for each subset using the dimensionless parameter scaling method table s9 for instance the hep g2 ec50 values were predicted to be 2 45 10 3 and 1 65 10 3 μm for dichloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid by eq 5 respectively by complementing the predicted values to the subset containing the experimental hep g2 ec50 values of diiodoacetic acid k type hep g 2 was calculated to be 2 604 the positive k type hep g 2 value of this subset demonstrated that the effect of halogen substitution type on haloacetic acids followed the same rank order of chloro bromo iodo species with the aforementioned finding in this study notably as shown in table s9 the predicted k type cell line values were positive from 0 065 to 28 362 000 for all the dbp subsets suggesting that the cytotoxicity rank order of chloro bromo iodo species was valid in all cases the predicted k number cell line values were negative from 18 556 to 0 726 for the aliphatic dbp subsets and positive from 0 141 to 2 494 for the cyclic dbp subsets which were also consistent with the aforementioned findings in this study 4 conclusions with the dimensionless parameter scaling method this study provided a multi cell line cytotoxicity data interpretation of dbps in drinking water quantitively and comprehensively by comparing the high low and positive negative of the k type cell line and k number cell line values obtained in a single cell line or the k type cell line and k number cell line values in multiple cell lines the strength and trend of the halogen substitution influence on the relative cytotoxic potency could be easily determined considering that headspace might be a possible factor that affect the toxicity analyses it is suggested to select a less volatile solvent or adopt a headspace free setup in future dbps bioassays thus when prioritizing unregulated dbps based on cytotoxicity it is suggested to take the sensitivity of different cell lines into consideration and use the most sensitive cell line for the evaluation e g using the cho cell cytotoxicity for aliphatic dbps and the mvln cell cytotoxicity for cyclic dbps notably the seven qsar models established in this study not only provided a useful tool for dbp cytotoxicity prediction in the three cell lines but also the predicted cytotoxicity data in turn help to further verify the conclusions of how halogen substitution affect the cytotoxicity of dbps theoretically the dimensionless parameter scaling method should be applicable to more complicated cytotoxicity comparisons e g mixed chloro bromo iodo species or isomers are included in subsets and be applicable to more toxicity endpoints such as genotoxicity and mutagenicity accordingly further studies are suggested to explore the potential application of the dimensionless parameter scaling method under various scenarios credit authorship contribution statement lu jiang

14742,up to date over 700 disinfection byproducts dbps have been detected and identified in drinking water it has been recognized that cytotoxicity of dbps varied significantly among groups even within the same group cytotoxicity of different dbp species was also different due to different halogen substitution types and numbers however it is still difficult to quantitatively determine the inter group cytotoxicity relationships of dbps under the effect of halogen substitution in different cell lines especially when a large number of dbp groups and multiple cytotoxicity cell lines are involved in this study a powerful dimensionless parameter scaling method was adopted to quantitatively determine the relationship of halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of various dbp groups in three cell lines i e the human breast carcinoma mvln chinese hamster ovary cho and human hepatoma hep g2 cell cytotoxicity with no need to consider their absolute values and other influences by introducing the dimensionless parameters d x or n species cell line and d x or n species cell line as well as their corresponding linear regression equation coefficients k type or number cell line and k type or number cell line the strength and trend of halogen substitution influences on the relative cytotoxic potency could be determined it was found that the effect of halogen substitution type and number on the cytotoxicity of dbps followed the same patterns in the three cell lines the cho cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution on the aliphatic dbps whereas the mvln cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution on the cyclic dbps notably seven quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models were established which could not only predict the cytotoxicity data of dbps but also help to explain and verify the patterns of halogen substitution effect on cytotoxicity of dbps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts drinking water cytotoxicity dimensionless parameter scaling qsar data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disinfection of drinking water is an important treatment process to effectively inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and prevent waterborne diseases shannon et al 2008 sedlak and von gunten 2011 however disinfection byproducts dbps are unintentionally generated when disinfectants react with natural organic matter and halides in water richardson and ternes 2018 up to now over 700 dbps have been reported in drinking water including commonly known aliphatic dbp groups e g trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles and emerging cyclic dbp groups e g halophenols halobenzoquinones halosalicylaldehydes krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 qin et al 2010 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 tang et al 2021 hu et al 2022a zhang et al 2022 toxicological and epidemiological data have shown that dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic mutagenic carcinogenic and associated with an increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes as well as liver and bladder cancers when long term exposure costet et al 2011 stayner 2014 aslani et al 2019 therefore the toxicological effects of dbps are of increasing concern to researchers and the public it has been widely recognized that cytotoxicity of dbps varied significantly among groups for instance the chinese hamster ovary cho cell cytotoxicity of a few dbp groups basically followed the rank order of haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloacetic acids halobenzoquinones halopyrroles wagner and plewa 2017 and the human hepatoma hep g2 cell cytotoxicity of aliphatic dbps was nearly eight times higher than that of the cyclic dbps wu et al 2022 even within the same dbp group that shared the same main structure cytotoxicity of different dbp species was also different due to different halogen substitution types chloro bromo iodo and numbers monohalo dihalo trihalo for example in cho cells iodoacetamide and 2 2 iodophenyl acetamide were several to hundreds of times more cytotoxic than their bromo and chloro analogues plewa et al 2008 hu et al 2022a the cho cell cytotoxicity of haloacetaldehydes followed the decreasing rank order of chloro dichloro trichloro species whereas the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity of halophenols followed an increasing rank order of bromo dibromo tribromo species jeong et al 2015 wu et al 2022 although substantial efforts have been made in previous studies to figure out the effect of halogen substitition on cytotoxicity of dbps it is still difficult to quantitatively determine their inter group relationships in different cell lines especially when a large number of dbp groups and multiple cell lines are involved a powerful mathematical method dimensionless parameter scaling could be promising to quantitatively determine the relationship between halogen substitution and cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines the dimensionless parameter scaling method is using an appropriate dimensionless parameter to represent the ratio of a variable to the control in the same dimension affected by the critical influencing factor luce et al 2008 niven 2023 by further performing a linear regression analysis on the dimensionless parameters dependent variable versus the critical influencing factor independent variable a coefficient of the linear regression equation the slope can be obtained which quantifies the relative relationship of these variables at the same dimension in a direct mathematical way with no need to consider their absolute values and other influencing factors schneider et al 2010 the high low of the absolute coefficient reflects the strength of the influence and the positive negative of the coefficient reflects the trend of the influence the dimensionless parameter scaling method has been applied in modeling the formation of dbps duirk and valentine 2006 for example the relationship between the formation efficiency of dichloroacetic acid i e dichloroacetic acid generated by per mg l as c of a type of oxidized dissolved organic matter and the specific uv absorbance suva280 of different types of dissolved organic matter could be quantified by a linear equation with no need to consider the absolute amount of oxidized nom the positive coefficient of the linear equation suggested that the formation efficiency of dichloroacetic acid was positively correlated with the specific uv absorbance accordingly with the aid of the dimensionless parameter scaling method this study was designed to quantitatively determine the relationship of halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of various dbp groups in multiple cell lines the effects of halogen substitution type chloro bromo iodo and number monohalo dihalo trihalo on the cytotoxicity of a wide spectrum of dbps in three different cell lines i e the human breast carcinoma cells mvln cytotoxicity data obtained in this study and the cho and hep g2 cell cytotoxicity data reported in previous studies were aimed to be fully examined and compared a series of optimized quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models were aimed to be established for cytotoxicity mechanism exploration and cytotoxicity prediction validation of dbps in the three cell lines 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a total of 32 aliphatic and 34 cyclic dbps were selected to test cytotoxicity to mvln cell line the tested dbps were classified into 18 groups according to their main structures as listed in table 1 and their purities and suppliers were provided in supporting information si the mvln cell line the bioluminescent mcf 7 derived cell line was provided by prof maoyong song research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of science china dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 99 9 was purchased from sigma aldrich cell counting kit 8 cck 8 was obtained from keygen biotech china phosphate buffered saline pbs and penicillin streptomycin solution were obtained from hyclone dulbecco s modified eagle s medium dmem basic 1x was purchased from thermo scientific fetal bovine serum fbs and 0 25 trypsin edta 1x were purchased from life technologies 2 2 mvln cell cytotoxicity assay the mvln cell cytotoxicity assay was conducted for the aforementioned 66 dbps and the results were compared with those obtained from the previous cho and hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assays the mvln cell line was stably transfected with the luciferase reporter gene driven by an estrogen response element containing promoter since the bioluminescent response is in agreement with the natural responses like cellular proliferation or stimulation of the progesterone receptor the mvln cell cytotoxicity assay is a well established method to evaluate the cytotoxicity and estrogenic potency of single substances and environmental samples bjerregaard olesen et al 2016 chen et al 2020 li et al 2023 to initiate the bioassay of a dbp the mvln cells were rinsed with pbs trypsinized and then transferred into 96 well plates with a cell density of about 1 5 105 cells ml which were cultured in dmem at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 with regard to the relatively lower solubility of cyclic dbps as well as the effect of dmso on cell viability a concentration of 0 5 v v dmso was used in this assay hu et al 2022a zhang et al 2022 after growing for 24 h the cells in each well were exposed to dmem containing the required concentration of the dbp and 0 5 v v dmso the negative control was 0 5 v v dmso the positive control was 200 μm iodoacetic acid and the blank control was 100 μl dmem taking the high proliferative capacity and cell confluence into consideration 24 h was set for exposure and then the cells in each well were exposed to a mixed solution of 10 μl cck 8 and 100 μl dmem in darkness after being incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 for 1 5 h the cells were measured by a microplate reader nikon eclipse ti s at 450 nm cell viability was determined by the relative absorbance six replicates were set for each concentration and the assay for each dbp was repeated by three times 2 3 statistical analysis cytotoxicity data were transferred to excel spreadsheets and analyzed with sigma plot 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca results from independent experiments were averaged and expressed as mean standard deviation sd the concentration response curves of dbps were plotted and for each curve a four parameter logistic curve regression analysis was conducted the mvln cell 50 maximal effect concentration ec50 values were calculated from the regressions a one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak multiple comparisons test was conducted to obtain the lowest observed effect concentration loec of each dbp the ec50 loec cytotoxicity index cti cti ec50 1 106 and other cytotoxicity data of each dbp were listed in table 1 2 4 comparative cytotoxicity analyses using dimensionless parameter scaling method to quantitatively determine the relationships between halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of dbps the dimensionless parameter scaling method was adopted to process the three sets of cytotoxicity data i e the mvln ec50 values obtained from this study as well as the cho 50 maximum mortality lc50 and the hep g2 ec50 values obtained from previous studies liberatore et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 hong et al 2018 hu et al 2018 lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 2019 hu et al 2020 tian et al 2020 wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 hu et al 2022a 2022b jiang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 all the cytotoxicity data used were summarized in table s1 to quantify the relationship between halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of dbps in a single cell line dbps in the same group were further assembled to form subsets according to substitution type chloro bromo iodo or number monohalo dihalo trihalo the cytotoxicity data of each subset were all from one laboratory or the same assay under the same endpoint all subsets were listed in table s2 for each subset assembled by substitution type the cytotoxicity of its chloro species the bromo species was used in case chloro species was absent in this subset was set as the control and the relative cytotoxicity of the bromo and iodo species in the subset were calculated as a dimensionless parameter d x species cell line by eq 1 for each subset assembled by substitution number the cytotoxicity of its trihalo species the dihalo species was used in case trihalo species was absent in this subset was set as the control and the relative cytotoxicity of the monohalo and dihalo species in the subset were calculated as a dimensionless parameter d n species cell line by eq 2 notably a higher d value of a dbp suggests a relatively higher cytotoxicity in the corresponding subset 1 d x species cell line cti x species cell line cti chloro species bromo species in case cell line x chloro bromo iodo 2 d n species cell line cti n species cell line cti trihalo species dihalo species in case cell line n monohalo dihalo trihalo for each subset assembled by substitution type a linear regression analysis was conducted by depicting the obtained d x species cell line values set as dependent variable d x species cell line versus the substitution type set as independent variable x and assigning 1 2 and 3 for chloro bromo and iodo species respectively the coefficient k type cell line of the resulted regression equation d x species cell line k type cell line x b b was constant represented the relationship of the relative cytotoxic potency and the halogen substitution type chloro bromo iodo species similarly in the subset with different halogen substitution numbers the coefficient k number cell line of each linear regression equation d n species cell line k number cell line n b d n species cell line n and b was dependent variable independent variable and constant respectively represented the relationship of the relative cytotoxic potency and the halogen substitution number monohalo dihalo trihalo species the high low of the k values reflected the strength of the halogen substitution influence on the relative cytotoxic potency and the positive negative of the k values reflected the trend of the influence on the relative cytotoxic potency to quantify the relationship between halogen substitution and the cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines d x species cell line and d n species cell line of all the subsets were first averaged to give d x species cell line and d n species cell line from each cell line respectively the study subsets were listed in table s3 linear regression analyses of d x species cell line and d n species cell line d x species cell line k type eell line x b and d n species cell line k number cell line n b d x species cell line or d n species cell line was dependent variable x or n was independent variable b was constant were further conducted to achieve k type eell line and k number cell line respectively the k type cell line represented the relationship between the relative cytotoxic potency of all the subsets for a specific cell line and the halogen substitution type whereas the k number cell line represented the relationship between the relative cytotoxic potency of all the subsets and the halogen substitution number for a specific cell line by comparing the high low and positive negative of the k values obtained from different cell lines the strength and trend of the halogen substitution influence on the relative cytotoxic potency could be quantified 2 5 establishment of qsar models since the establishment of each qsar model required the cytotoxicity data from the same experimental procedure 64 mvln ec50 values from cck 8 assay 142 cho lc50 values from crystal violet and cck 8 assays and 65 hep g2 ec50 values from cck 8 assay that explicitly noted in table s1 were used with a stepwise multiple regression method to develop seven qsar models herrig et al 2015 a total of 18 representative candidate descriptors including four physical chemical descriptors eight quantum chemical descriptors and six topological descriptors were selected for model development using a stepwise elimination with ibm spss statistics version 25 ibm corp armonk ny u s the widely applied leave one out validation method was selected to verify the stability and robustness of the model the notations and values corresponding to each dbp of the candidate descriptors were listed in si tables s4 and s5 detailed information about the generation of descriptors and the model validation were detailed in the si notably 60 cytotoxicity values of dbps lacking experimental cytotoxicity data in certain cell lines were predicted for the validation of findings the specific dbps and used qsar models were listed in table s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of halogen substitution on the mvln cell cytotoxicity fig 1 shows concentration response curves of the 18 groups of 32 aliphatic and 34 cyclic dbps to the mvln cells the ec50 loec cti and other statistical analysis data of each dbp were listed in table 1 the ec50 values of different dbp groups were varied vastly by four orders of magnitude from 4 5 μm for iodoacetamide to 3 8 10 4 μm for trichloroacetic acid even among the same group the mvln cell cytotoxicity of different dbp species were quite different due to different halogen substitution types chloro bromo iodo and numbers monohalo dihalo trihalo to quantitatively depict the effect of halogen substitution type and number on the mvln cell cytotoxicity dbps in each group were assembled to subsets table s2 the dimensionless parameter scaling method was adopted to process the cytotoxicity data of each subset to obtain its d x species mvln and d n species mvln values table s2 which further underwent linear regression analyses to give k type mvln and k number mvln values fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the k type mvln values were all positive in the regression equations suggesting that the mvln cell cytotoxicity of both aliphatic and cyclic dbps followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species the k type mvln values were ranging from 0 476 halosalicylic acids to 258 206 haloacetamides suggesting that the effect of halogen substitution type on haloacetamides was about 542 times stronger than that on halosalicylic acids as shown in fig 2b the k number mvln values were negative for the aliphatic dbps whereas positive for cyclic dbps in the regression equations suggesting that the mvln cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the aliphatic dbps and monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the cyclic dbps this might result from different cytotoxicity mechanisms for aliphatic and cyclic dbps the absolute k number mvln values i e k number mvln were ranging from 0 050 halonitromethanes to 14 988 haloacetic acids suggesting that the effect of halogen substitution number on halonitromethanes was about 300 times stronger than that on haloacetic acids 3 2 effect of halogen substitution on multi cell line cytotoxicity besides the mvln cell cytotoxicity data that obtained in this study the other two sets of cytotoxicity data i e the cho lc50 values of 24 groups of 73 aliphatic and 79 cyclic dbps and the hep g2 ec50 values of 20 groups of 21 aliphatic and 48 cyclic dbps were obtained from previous studies table s1 similar to the data processing procedures for the mvln cell cytotoxicity d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 values were obtained for the cho and the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity table s2 which further underwent linear regression analyses to give k type cho ranging from 0 102 to 323 020 and k type hep g 2 ranging from 0 264 to 27 303 values fig 3 a and b the k type cho and k type hep g 2 values were all positive in the regression equations suggesting that the cho and hep g2 cell cytotoxicity of both aliphatic and cyclic dbps followed the same rank order of chloro bromo iodo species and this trend was also found in the mvln cell cytotoxicity as described above to quantify the relationships between halogen substitution type and the cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines d x species mvln d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 of all the subsets from each cell line were first averaged to give d x species mvln d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 respectively table s2 linear regression analyses of d x species mvln d x species cho and d x species hep g 2 were further conducted to achieve k type mvln k type cho and k type hep g 2 respectively as shown in fig 3c the k type mvln k type cho and k type hep g 2 were all positive for the aliphatic 80 433 282 720 and 20 555 respectively and the cyclic dbps 1 938 0 989 and 0 379 respectively suggesting that the cho cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution type on the aliphatic dbps whereas the mvln cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution type on the cyclic dbps furthermore d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 values were obtained for the cho and the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity table s2 which further underwent linear regression analyses to give k number cho and k number hep g 2 values as shown in fig 4 a and b the k number cho and k number hep g 2 values were negative for the aliphatic dbps whereas positive for the cyclic dbps in the regression equations suggesting that the cho and the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the aliphatic dbps and monohalo dihalo trihalo species for the cyclic dbps this trend was also found in the mvln cell cytotoxicity as described above to quantify the relationships between halogen substitution number and the cytotoxicity of dbps in multiple cell lines d n species mvln d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 of all the subsets from each cell line were first averaged to give d n species mvln d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 respectively table s2 linear regression analyses of d n species mvln d n species cho and d n species hep g 2 were further conducted to achieve k number mvln k number cho and k number hep g 2 respectively as shown in fig 4c the k number mvln k number cho and k number hep g 2 were all negative for the aliphatic dbps with the absolute values of 5 488 35 335 and 0 244 respectively and were all positive for the cyclic dbps with the values of 0 681 0 464 and 0 386 respectively accordingly the cho cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to evaluate the effect of halogen substitution number on the aliphatic dbps whereas the mvln cell cytotoxicity was the most sensitive cell line to examine the effect of halogen substitution number on the cyclic dbps 3 3 development of mechanism based qsar models for different cell lines to better interpret cytotoxicity mechanisms of aliphatic and cyclic dbps with different halogen substitution seven qsar models based on the three cell lines were developed and compared each qsar model was derived from cytotoxicity data obtained from the same experimental procedure as described in section 2 5 the ratios between the number of dbps and descriptors in models should be higher than 5 1 to avoid chance correlation zhang et al 2020 the resulting optimum qsar models were shown in eqs 3 9 among which eqs 3 5 were developed based on the mvln ec50 cho lc50 and hep g2 ec50 values of the aliphatic dbps respectively while eqs 6 9 were developed based on the mvln ec50 cho lc50 and hep g2 ec50 values of the cyclic dbps respectively notably eqs 7 and 8 were based on the crystal violet assay and the cck 8 assay respectively 3 log ec 50 mvln 1 3 95 10 4 e 0 051 v 0 416 4 n 30 r 2 0 837 q loo 2 0 802 rmse 0

be eliminated hu et al 2022 the variance inflation factors vifs were all 10 table s6 suggesting that there was no multiple correlation between the variables hou et al 2019 meanwhile the williams plot is the statistic for checking potential outliers and fig 5 a g demonstrated that the data set for all the seven models was representative furthermore it could be seen from fig 5h n that the ec50 or lc50 values predicted from the seven models were generally coincident with the experimental values the aliphatic dbps models r2 0 837 0 718 and 0 861 the cyclic dbps models r2 0 728 0 701 0 859 and 0 700 all the approaches for validation demonstrated that each developed qsar model was acceptable and had good predictivity for the cytotoxicity value of dbp with similar main structure aliphatic or cyclic structure the three models for aliphatic dbps eqs 3 5 shared two common quantum chemical descriptors i e total energy e and molecular volume v e is the sum of the electron energy of the molecule and the nuclear repulsion energy which is negatively correlated with the van der waals radius of a molecule campos et al 2020 awasthi et al 2021 nawaz et al 2021 it was found in eqs 3 5 that e was negatively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 in all the three cell lines suggesting that log ec50 or lc50 1 of a molecule was positively correlated with its van der waals radius since the van der waals radii of dbp subsets with different substitution types followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species the cytotoxicity of these dbp species followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species campos et al 2020 it was demonstrated by eqs 3 5 that v was also negatively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 in all the three cell lines suggesting that the cytotoxicity of a dbp was higher with a lower molecular volume since the molecular volumes of dbp subsets with different substitution numbers followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species the cytotoxicity of these dbp species followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species dad et al 2018 additionally wiener index windx is closely correlated with the boiling points of alkane molecules and a larger radius of gyration rad can improve inter molecular interactions and reactivities adnan et al 2021 heydari et al 2021 the two descriptors might be responsible for the difference of cytotoxicity between the cho and the other cell lines notably different descriptors mainly elumo logp and svde were involved in the four models for cyclic dbps eqs 6 9 elumo reflects the relative electrophilicity and correlates well with reduction potentials a lower elumo value means that the corresponding dbp is more receptive to electrons and more likely to react with nucleophile sites and therefore more cytotoxic morell et al 2005 yang and zhang 2013 it was found in eqs 6 8 and 9 that elumo was negatively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 in all the three cell lines which was in consistent with the previous reports for instance the elumo values of dbp subsets for hep g2 cell cytotoxicity were 0 0286 0 3654 and 0 7263 ev for monohalo dihalo and trihalo species respectively table s7 and their cho cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of monohalo dihalo trihalo species logp reflects the lipophilicity hydrophobicity of dbps which is directly correlated with the ability to transport through the cell lipid bilayers plewa et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 it was demonstrated by eqs 6 8 that logp was positively correlated with log ec50 or lc50 1 suggesting that the cytotoxicity of a dbp was higher with a higher hydrophobicity for instance the logp values of dbp subsets for cho cell cytotoxicity with the cck 8 assay were 1 96 2 09 and 2 67 for chloro bromo and iodo species respectively table s7 and their cho cell cytotoxicity followed the rank order of chloro bromo iodo species additionally sum of valence degrees svde encodes the information of the molecular sizes and configuration of all non hydrogen atoms and might be related to molecular volume which could affect in vitro toxicity of dbps with different halogen substitution types xu et al 2004 wei et al 2020 3 4 cytotoxicity prediction with the qsar models although hundreds of dbps have been tested for their cytotoxicity in one or more types of cells there were still many dbps lacking experimental cytotoxicity data in certain cell lines due to the absence of commercially available standard compounds or other reasons with the above seven models cytotoxicity was predicted for 8 groups of 19 dbps in mvln cells 6 groups of 11 dbps in cho cells and 11 groups of 30 dbps in hep g2 cells table s8 by complement the predicted cytotoxicity data of these dbps to their corresponding subsets d x species cell line d n species cell line k type cell line and k number cell line could be calculated for each subset using the dimensionless parameter scaling method table s9 for instance the hep g2 ec50 values were predicted to be 2 45 10 3 and 1 65 10 3 μm for dichloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid by eq 5 respectively by complementing the predicted values to the subset containing the experimental hep g2 ec50 values of diiodoacetic acid k type hep g 2 was calculated to be 2 604 the positive k type hep g 2 value of this subset demonstrated that the effect of halogen substitution type on haloacetic acids followed the same rank order of chloro bromo iodo species with the aforementioned finding in this study notably as shown in table s9 the predicted k type cell line values were positive from 0 065 to 28 362 000 for all the dbp subsets suggesting that the cytotoxicity rank order of chloro bromo iodo species was valid in all cases the predicted k number cell line values were negative from 18 556 to 0 726 for the aliphatic dbp subsets and positive from 0 141 to 2 494 for the cyclic dbp subsets which were also consistent with the aforementioned findings in this study 4 conclusions with the dimensionless parameter scaling method this study provided a multi cell line cytotoxicity data interpretation of dbps in drinking water quantitively and comprehensively by comparing the high low and positive negative of the k type cell line and k number cell line values obtained in a single cell line or the k type cell line and k number cell line values in multiple cell lines the strength and trend of the halogen substitution influence on the relative cytotoxic potency could be easily determined considering that headspace might be a possible factor that affect the toxicity analyses it is suggested to select a less volatile solvent or adopt a headspace free setup in future dbps bioassays thus when prioritizing unregulated dbps based on cytotoxicity it is suggested to take the sensitivity of different cell lines into consideration and use the most sensitive cell line for the evaluation e g using the cho cell cytotoxicity for aliphatic dbps and the mvln cell cytotoxicity for cyclic dbps notably the seven qsar models established in this study not only provided a useful tool for dbp cytotoxicity prediction in the three cell lines but also the predicted cytotoxicity data in turn help to further verify the conclusions of how halogen substitution affect the cytotoxicity of dbps theoretically the dimensionless parameter scaling method should be applicable to more complicated cytotoxicity comparisons e g mixed chloro bromo iodo species or isomers are included in subsets and be applicable to more toxicity endpoints such as genotoxicity and mutagenicity accordingly further studies are suggested to explore the potential application of the dimensionless parameter scaling method under various scenarios credit authorship contribution statement lu jiang

14743,emerging contaminants can accelerate the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes args from environmental bacteria to human pathogens via plasmid conjugation posing a great challenge to the public health although the toxic effects of per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas as persistent organic pollutants have been understood it is still unclear whether and how pfas modulate the transmission of args in this study we for the first time reported that perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa and ammonium perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoate genx at relatively low concentrations 0 01 0 1 mg l promoted the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 within escherichia coli while the plasmid conjugation was inhibited by pfoa pfdoa and genx at relatively high concentrations 1 10 mg l the non unidirectional conjugation result was ascribed to the co regulation of ros overproduction enhanced cell membrane permeability shortage of energy support as well as l arginine pool depletion taking the well known pfoa as an example it significantly enhanced the conjugation frequency by 1 4 and 3 4 times at relatively low concentrations 0 01 0 1 mg l respectively exposure to pfoa resulted in enhanced cell membrane permeability and ros overproduction in donor cells at high concentrations of pfoa 1 10 mg l although enhanced oxidative stress and cell membrane permeability still occurred the atp contents in e coli decreased which contributed to the inhibited conjugation transcriptome analysis further showed that the expression levels of genes related to arginine biosynthesis arga argc argf argg argi and transport artj artm artq pathways were significantly increased intracellular l arginine concentration deficiency were observed at high concentrations of pfoa with the supplementary exogenous arginine it was demonstrated that arginine upregulated conjugation transfer related genes trfap trbbp and restores the cell number of transconjugants in pfoa treated group therefore the inhibited conjugation at high concentrations pfoa were attributed to the shortage of atp and the depletion of l arginine pool these findings provide important insights into the effect environmental concentrations of pfas on the conjugative transfer of args and update the regulation mechanism of plasmid conjugation which is critical for the management of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per polyfluoroalkyl substances plasmid conjugation oxidative stress energy support l arginine depletion

antimicrobial resistance amr have been considered to be the greatest public health threat in the coming decades allen et al 2010 the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args has led to the spread of antibiotic resistance from environmental species to clinical pathogens and vice versa as has been found in some important clinical args dos santos et al 2020 shen et al 2018 horizontal gene transfer hgt is the mainly force for the spread of args occurring through conjugation transduction and transformation abe et al 2020 thomas and nielsen 2005 among these pathways plasmid mediated conjugation is considered as a principal contributor of hgt for the dissemination of args wozniak and waldor 2010 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are regarded as ideal places for the dissemination of args which accommodate a myriad of mobile genetic elements usually encoding multiple resistance kumar et al 2021 quintela baluja et al 2021 yin et al 2021 conjugative plasmid rp4 exhibits robust interspecies mobility among wastewater indigenous microbiota huang et al 2022 furthermore wwtps concentrate emerging pollutants of domestic and industrial origins such as nanoparticles qiu et al 2012 artificial sweeteners yu et al 2021 persistent organic contaminants paliya et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 which potentially facilitate the transfer of args among the co existing pollutants per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have attracted great interest as emerging persistent organic pollutants that are resistant to chemical thermal and biodegradation dhore and murthy 2021 pfas are widely used in industrial and daily consumption uses paul et al 2009 the most frequently detected perfluoroalkyl acid compound is perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa which has been phased out beginning in the early 2000s rahman et al 2014 in spite of restrictions on pfas the concentrations detected in the environment have been increasing to be ng l μg l and in wwtps even as high as mg l have been detected in wastewater due to its properties of low volatility and water solubility chen et al 2012 naile et al 2010 it is therefore important to understand the potential effect of pfas on args transfer the environmental health risks of pfas have received much concern and in vivo and in vitro models have been used to determine the potential biological effect that may cause hepatotoxicity neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity to humans and animals corsini et al 2014 johansson et al 2008 sheng et al 2018 studies have also shown that pfas have toxic or biological amplification effects on a variety of organisms such as bacteria liu et al 2016 and invertebrates xia et al 2013 pfoa interferes with the structure of cell membranes causing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in cells and leading to cellular oxidative damage li et al 2020b although the microbial toxicity of coexisting pfas in wwtps are well understood its impact on the args transmission is limited in the aquatic environment pollutants such as heavy metals and nanoparticles li et al 2020a are known to enhance intracellular ros generation as well as activated the dna damage induced response sos which contributed to the increased args conjugative transfer beaber et al 2004 in addition pollutants can also promote conjugative transfer by increasing the cell membrane permeability and the expression level of conjugative related genes therefore we speculate that pfas also can modulate the conjugative transfer through the ros overproduction and increased cell membrane permeability however the effects and mechanisms of pfas on args transfer remains unknown in order to understand the role of pfas in the dissemination of args three typical pfas including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa and ammonium perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoate genx were selected in this study pfoa was heavily used in the 1970 s and is tested as a legacy pfas pollutants benskin et al 2012 in addition the greater the number of carbon atoms in the backbone of the perfluoroalkyl chain the higher the bioaccumulation capability such as pfdoa which has twelve carbons and exhibits higher toxicity than short chain pfas kudo et al 2001 ohmori et al 2003 genx as a safer alternative have been used to replace pfoa in fluoropolymer manufacturing however it was recently shown that genx cause similar or even worse health effects than pfoa rickard et al 2022 taken together a conjugation model consisting of e coli hb101 with plasmid rp4 and e coli mg1655 was established to investigate the transmission risk of pfas on args conjugative transfer the conjugation dynamics were evaluated by conjugation frequency and the cell number of transconjugants next the underlying mechanisms associated with args transfer were also explored cell membrane permeability ros production were investigated that may be involved in the conjugative transfer taking pfoa as an example the expression levels of plasmid conjugation genes and the relative content of atp were also examined rna sequencing is a very helpful tool for analyzing differentially expressed genes therefore this method was chosen to identify candidate genes and potential e coli biological pathways coping with pfoa stress the information obtained from this study provides new insights into understanding the mechanism of the spread of antibiotic resistance caused by pfas 2 material and methods 2 1 args transfer via plasmid conjugation the donor strain was e coli hb101 which harbors self transferable rp4 plasmids encoding resistance to ampicillin amp tetracycline tc and kanamycin km e coli mg1655 as the recipient was resistant to rifampicin rif and nalidixic acid nal before the plasmid conjugation experiments strains were grown overnight in luria bertani lb medium with appropriate antibiotics concentrations donors were cultivated in lb supplemented with 100 mg l amp 50 mg l km and 10 mg l tc 160 mg l rif and 80 mg l nal were used for the recipients since the purpose of the study was to reveal how water soluble pfas affect conjugation dynamics a liquid mating system was used for the experiment after that the medium was washed twice with pbs to remove lb medium and antibiotic residues the bacterial suspension was adjusted to an appropriate concentration od600 1 0 next the mixture of donor and recipient 1 1 ratio v v was exposed to the tested pfas pfoa pfdoa genx at various concentrations 0 0 01 0 1 1 10 mg l the concentration levels of pfas were lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration 512 mg l text s1 but related to the wastewater treatment plant scenario table s1 then the mating pair system was placed in an incubator at 37 c for 20 h finally the cell number of donors recipients and transconjugants were counted by selective plates containing the corresponding antibiotics transconjugants were obtained by plating on selective lb solid medium

pfas modulate args transfer via plasmid conjugation to understand the effect of pfas on the plasmid transfer of args an intragenera plasmid conjugation model was constructed in a liquid mating system at different concentrations of pfas interestingly the conjugative transfer frequency did not increase or decrease linearly as a function of pfas exposure concentration as shown in fig 1 a c all tested pfas pfoa pfdoa and genx significantly promoted the plasmid conjugation frequency at relatively low concentrations 0 01 and 0 1 mg l for example the natural conjugation frequency transconjugants recipients was 6 0 0 2 10 6 while pfoa at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l increased the conjugation frequency to 8 1 0 3 10 6 and 20 3 3 4 10 6 which increased by 1 4 and 3 4 fold respectively however when the pfoa concentration increased to relatively high concentrations 1 mg l and 10 mg l the conjugation frequency decreased to 0 2 0 03 10 6 and 0 4 0 09 10 6 respectively the same phenomenon occurred in the pfdoa and genx treated groups the trends were consistent regardless of whether the conjugation frequency was performed with donors or recipients it is worth noting that at the lowest tested concentration 0 01 mg l which is representative concentration of pfas in wwtps table s1 the conjugation frequency also increased by 1 4 1 7 and 1 5 fold corresponding to the dosage of pfoa pfdoa and genx respectively the cell number of transconjugants were consistent with the trend of conjugation frequency pfas at low doses 0 01 mg l and 1 mg l significantly increased the transconjugants number whereas high doses 1 mg l and 10 mg l decreased the transconjugants number fig 1d f li et al 2020c reported the low doses promoted and high doses inhibited plasmid conjugation transfer induced by single and mixed antibiotics subsequently shao et al 2022 also demonstrated that application of pyroligneous acids enhanced rp4 plasmid conjugation at low concentrations and decreased plasmid conjugation at high concentrations these studies confirmed the concentration dependence of emerging contaminants on args conjugation process random transconjugants were selected and verified by gel electrophoresis fig s1 to avoid the effects of pfas on the cell density in the conjugation system the cell number of donor and recipient were all counted pfas had no significant effect on the cell number of donor and recipient in the tested concentrations fig s2 p 0 05 therefore an increase or decrease in the frequency of plasmid conjugation was not directly related to the cell density 3 2 pfas enhanced cell membrane permeability the transmission of plasmid dna from donor to recipient requires to crossing of the membranes of the participants cell membrane may act as a barrier to hinder the conjugative transfer between bacteria and increased cell membrane permeability contribute to the passage of genetic material into and out of cells thomas and nielsen 2005 therefore pi dye was used to determine the effect of pfas on cell plasma membrane permeability the cell membrane permeability of the donor appears to play an more important role than recipients in the mating paired system yu et al 2021 therefore the donor e coli hb101 was selected the results suggested that the cell membrane permeability was enhanced significantly by pfas at the tested concentration range fig 2 a for example pfoa at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l significantly enhanced the cell membrane permeability by 1 6 and 1 5 fold respectively and pfdoa and genx at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l increased the cell membrane permeability to 1 1 1 2 and 1 1 1 1 fold respectively fig 2a no concentration dependence of cell membrane permeability was observed several studies have also proposed that increased plasmid conjugation frequency of plasmids is associated with increased cell membrane permeability wang et al 2015 yu et al 2021 rna sequencing was used to analysis the candidate genes involving cellular process the transcriptomes of donor e coli hb101 were analyzed after exposure to pfoa at 0 01 and 1 mg l rna sequencing showed that among all the up regulated expression of genes 12 9 were related to the cell envelope under exposure of pfoa 1 0 mg l which is shown in fig 2b the cell outer membrane is mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides lps and outer membrane proteins paracini et al 2022 the overexpression of the epta gene facilitate the modification of lipid a a component of lipopolysaccharide thereby increasing resistance to antibiotics cervoni et al 2021 otten et al 2021 wzzb is the regulator control the chain length of o antigen component of lps ranjith et al 2017 the up regulated expression of lps biosynthesis epta wzzb ais in e coli indicated that the cell outer membrane was stressed by pfoa and thus enhanced the biosynthesis and modification of lps to alleviate the damage of the cell membrane the expression of outer and inner membrane proteins was also significantly increased mlic yajg ycad yaji yiad cbrb cred mdta mltd pmrr ybci ycdz ydgk ydiy yoak ypdk for example yoak gene which encodes a membrane protein was upregulated by 0 5 fold at 0 01 mg l when the concentration increased to 1 mg l the gene expression increased by 2 8 fold fig 2b table s3 these changes in cell membrane related genes indicated transcriptional response to pfoa induced membrane damage in e coli previous studies have shown that pfoa had an effect on the cell membrane system interfering with membrane fluidity and changing membrane fatty acid composition which may be one of the main targets of pfoa liu et al 2008 sabovic et al 2020 yang et al 2017 the tem image showed that the untreated e coli mg1655 had a smooth surface and the cell membrane and cell wall were relatively tightly bound without plasmolysis fig 2c however the morphology of e coli mg1655 appeared to be changed with wrinkled and rough cell boundaries by 1 mg l pfoa when the concentration increased to 10 mg l the cell wall and membrane separated liu et al 2016 also showed a winked cell membrane plasmolysis and cytoplasm outflow under the treatment of pfoa 1 10 mg l the damaged cell envelope may be involved in the decreased conjugation transfer frequency at 1 and 10 mg l 3 3 pfas enhanced ros production ros are signal molecules for various cellular processes and their production may increase under environmental stress which might favor the conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 yu et al 2021 thus the effects of pfas on ros production was investigated clearly intracellular ros production of e coli hb101 was enhanced under pfas compared with pfdoa and genx ros production induced by pfoa 0 01 mg l and 0 1 mg l was higher increasing 1 7 and 1 5 fold respectively fig 3 a excessive accumulation of ros caused cell membrane disruption thus making the transfer of genetic elements across the cell membrane easier and promoting the frequency of conjugative transfer wang et al 2019 the increased cell membrane permeability was also observed in the donor fig 2a various defense mechanisms have been developed to protect cells against oxidative damage such as up regulation of antioxidant the antioxidant enzyme cat can scavenge ros as shown in fig 3b the cat enzyme activity of e coli hb101 also increased gradually under pfoa exposure to verify whether the increased ros production promoted conjugative transfer 100 μm thiourea was added to the conjugation system as a ros scavenger along with pfoa in the 0 01 and 0 1 mg l pfoa treated groups the ros scavenger reduced the cell number of transconjugants but the cell number of recipients did not change significantly fig 3c fig s3 the addition of thiourea decreased conjugation frequency compared to the group without scavenger fig 3d these results indicated that ros overproduction promoted the conjugative transfer under exposure of pfoa at low concentrations 0 01 0 1 mg l oxidative stress caused by pfoa was also observed in the changed expression gene as well as sos response related genes compared with the control genes related to ros production dsba cysz osmb rsxa rsxb rsxc were up regulated significantly after pfoa exposure at 1 mg l fig 3e table s4 ros overproduction not only target at cell membrane but also attack dna and inducing sos response which was the first dna repair system in e coli janion 2008 the expression level of the gene encoding dna repair protein reco was increased by 1 1 times under exposure of pfoa at 1 mg l in total the transcripts of the genes demonstrated that pfas exposure triggered ros production the sos response sos responses can induce conjugative transfer through dna damage to alleviate the conjugative repression waldor 2004 several studied reported that increased oxidative stress and up regulated sos response in bacterial cells were associated with the promoted conjugation lu et al 2020 yu et al 2021 however high concentrations of pfoa 1 10 mg l decreased plasmid conjugation frequency suggesting that cellular oxidative stress was not the only mechanism and that other mechanisms may also co regulate the inhibited plasmid conjugation 3 4 energy driving force for conjugative transfer atp provides the driving force for bacterial physiological activities including dna transfer chen et al 2005 the change of atp relative content with the concentration of pfoa was shown in fig 4 the relative content of atp in donor was not affected under the exposure of pfoa at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l however when pfoa concentration increased to 1 mg l and 10 mg l the atp content of the donor decreased to 70 7 5 7 and 79 9 6 6 respectively fig 4a and the atp content of the recipient decreased significantly to 75 1 5 9 and 65 0 14 5 respectively fig 4b the shortage of atp level corresponds to a sharply decrease in conjugation frequency at relatively high pfoa concentration similarly previous studies showed that low levels of nitrous acid inhibited the conjugation transfer process by reducing the energy supply process huang et al 2019 li et al 2021 also proved that the atp depletion induced by the free radical exposure affect plasmid conjugation one of the energy generation pathways is coupling of electron transfer to the atp synthesis in e coli ingledew and poole 1984 electron flow is mainly accomplished by transmembrane protein complexes i iv and the free moving electron carriers ubiquinone and cytochrome coupled with a proton gradient driven by complex v to produce atp fig 4c zhao et al 2019 complex i was composed of nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase electrons were transferred from nadh to ubiquinone through a flavin mononucleotide fmn followed by iron sulfur fes clusters in complex i inducing the protons to be pumped from the matrix to the intermembrane space nolfi donegan et al 2020 nine genes nuoe nuof nuog nuoh nuoi nuoj nuol nuom nuon related to complex i were all down regulated under pfoa exposure at 0 01 mg l and 1 mg l the expression of five genes frda frdb sdhd sdhe for complex ii were also down regulated at 1 mg l pfoa frda and frdb were fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit and fumarate reductase iron sulfur protein which were responsible for the enzyme catalysis and turnover of fumarate and succinate to provide electrons for complex ii in e coli jones and gunsalus 1987 therefore the down regulation of gene expression of complex i and ii implied decrease of electron supply complex ⅳ transfer electrons from cytochrome c to terminal electron acceptor o2 and produce h2o nolfi donegan et al 2020 the gene expression for complex ⅳ cydb was also down regulated therefore the gene downregulation of complex i complex ii and complex iv may indicates a weakened electron flow and proton transmembrane which eventually leads to reduced atp synthesis complex v uses the energy generated by the proton gradient to phosphorylate adp to atp zhao et al 2019 finally the gene expression related to atp synthase for complex ⅴ atpa atpc atpd atpe atpf atpg were also down regulated at 1 mg l pfoa table s5 indicating that pfoa treated e coli reduced atp synthesis thus decreasing the conjugation frequency 3 5 transcriptional analysis of plasmid conjugation genes args transfer by plasmid conjugation of bacteria requires a mating pair formation mpf for bridging the physical contact between the donor and recipient samuels et al 2000 the mobilization of rp4 plasmid was normally regulated by conjugative transfer related genes as shown in fig 5 a trbbp a key gene of mpf was activated and its mrna expression level was significantly increased by 1 2 times at 0 01 mg l pfoa while significantly decreased at 10 mg l which was 0 9 fold that of the blank group this indicated that the formation of the mating paired system the first step of the conjugation process was regulated by pfoa the trfap gene which is responsible for dna transfer and replication showed the same trend as trbbp fig 5b in the transcriptional sequencing data as shown in fig s4 the expression level of the global regulator gene kora and the conjugative transfer regulator gene trbj were up regulated at 0 01 mg l pfoa but the gene expression level was down regulated when the pfoa concentration increased to 1 mg l trbj gene plays an important role in the conjugative core region of the rp4 plasmid haase et al 1995 the initial contact between the donor and recipient may be connected by the pilus which is a major component belonging to the mpf system in e coli pili contribute to bacterial adhesion and colony formation the expression of pili related genes yraj ybgp yfcs yadk were down regulated after treatment with pfoa at 1 mg l which may disrupt the channel of plasmid transfer in the mating paired system overall it can be inferred that pfoa modulated the conjugative transfer by regulating genes expression related to plasmid conjugation 3 6 l arginine pool depletion induced by pfoa inhibited the plasmid conjugation transcriptomic analyses were further analyzed as shown in fig 6 a the gene expression levels of argacfgi were significantly up regulated under pfoa 1 mg l and these genes are all related to the arginine biosynthesis and catabolism pathway for example gene argc encoding n acetylglutamate semialdehyde reductase with the help of nadph n acetyl l glutamate 5 phosphate was biosynthesized into n acetyl l glutamate 5 semialdehyde meanwhile the argf gene encodes ornithine carbamoyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of carbamoyl moiety of carbamoylphosphate to 5 amino group of ornithithine and formed citrulline fig 6b table s6 cunin et al 1986 in addition to the biosynthetic pathway the intracellular arginine uptake pathway was also enhanced artj artm artq the significantly up regulated expression levels of these genes raised our curiosity about the intracellular concentration of l arginine hence the intracellular concentration of l arginine was determined by lc ms ms as shown in fig 6c d low concentration pfoa 0 01 1 mg l did not induce significant changes in intracellular concentration of l arginine p 0 05 in the donor and recipient while high concentrations of pfoa 1 10 mg l significantly decreased the l arginine concentration at 10 mg l pfoa the concentration of l arginine in the donor and recipient decreased to 55 and 65 respectively this indicates that high concentrations exposure of pfoa resulted in the depletion of intracellular arginine therefore e coli actively enhanced the biosynthesis and extracellular uptake of l arginine the decrease in intracellular concentration of l arginine may be due to the end product of l arginine metabolism is ammonia which can increase the intracellular ph value thereby protecting cells from toxic acidic conditions and maintaining the cellular ph homeostasis xiong et al 2016 in addition to l arginine the uptake systems of intracellular putrescine were also enhanced the main source of putrescine is the decomposition of intracellular l arginine or direct extracellular uptake when cells are faced with various oxidative stresses sod can protect nucleic acids from oxidative damage and polyamines also have a similar function of scavenging free radicals chattopadhyay et al 2003 under nutrient deficient conditions polyamines may be the main factors in the adaptation to acidic stimuli both potf encoding putrescine binding protein and potg encoding an atpase dependent transmembrane protein are related to the two arginine uptake systems and their gene expression levels were significantly up regulated igarashi et al 2001 this suggests that intracellular putrescine may also be insufficient to cope with pfoa stress deficiency of intracellular arginine resulted in decreased putrescine and thus enhanced extracellular uptake in order to verify the connection between the depletion of intracellular arginine and the inhibition of plasmid conjugation 1 mm arginine was added to e coli conjugation system together with 10 mg l pfoa to explore whether the expression levels of genes related to plasmid conjugation has changed as shown in fig 6e the addition of l arginine in the pfoa treated group 10 mg l significantly up regulated the gene expression levels of trfap and trbbp compared with the blank group without pfoa and l arginine only in the 10 mg l pfoa treated group fig 5 the expression levels of the two genes both decreased this suggests that l arginine deficiency regulated the expression of genes associated with plasmid conjugation meantime exogenous l arginine was also added into the conjugation system under the exposure of pfoa at 10 mg l the cell number of transconjugants was restored with the supplementary of exogenous l arginine however l arginine did not increase the cell number of transconjugants in the control group fig 6f in conclusion the depletion intracellular l arginine pool induced by pfoa inhibited the conjugative transfer 4 conclusion the effects and mechanisms of per polyfluoroalkyl substances on conjugative transfer frequency were investigated it is worth noting that the effects of sub inhibitory concentrations pfas on the plasmid conjugation showed a non unidirectional trend with low concentrations promotion and high concentrations inhibition this paper highlights that non unidirectional conjugation frequency results from co regulation of ros overproduction enhanced membrane permeability shortage of atp as well as intracellular l arginine depletion taking the well known pfoa as an example the promotion effects were mainly attributed to increased cell membrane permeability and ros overproduction under low concentrations exposure 0 01 0 1 mg l and there is no change in intracellular atp contents and l arginine concentrations however at high concentrations of pfoa 0 01 0 1 mg l reduced intracellular atp content and l arginine concentration contributed to the inhibited the conjugative transfer since the low concentrations of pfas are typical concentrations in wwtps attention should be paid to the promoting effect of pfas on plasmid conjugation in wwtps although genx considered a safer alternative to pfoa there is still a risk of spreading args however there are still some limitations in the research the study explored the effects of pfas on args conjugative transfer only in the pure culture e coli model besides only three pfas were selected to investigate the risk of args transfer in total the study broadens the understanding of the potential risks of pfas on the spread of args particular attention should be paid to the transmission risk of args induced by pfas in environmental ecosystems such as river sediment and soil furthermore the bioaccumulation of fpas in human not only directly induce health risks but also may affect the spread of args among human microbiome increasing the threat to human health more future studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of other pfas on the transmission of args at a microbial community wide level in wwtp and natural ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement congcong liu conceptualization data curation formal analysis

14743,emerging contaminants can accelerate the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes args from environmental bacteria to human pathogens via plasmid conjugation posing a great challenge to the public health although the toxic effects of per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas as persistent organic pollutants have been understood it is still unclear whether and how pfas modulate the transmission of args in this study we for the first time reported that perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa and ammonium perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoate genx at relatively low concentrations 0 01 0 1 mg l promoted the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 within escherichia coli while the plasmid conjugation was inhibited by pfoa pfdoa and genx at relatively high concentrations 1 10 mg l the non unidirectional conjugation result was ascribed to the co regulation of ros overproduction enhanced cell membrane permeability shortage of energy support as well as l arginine pool depletion taking the well known pfoa as an example it significantly enhanced the conjugation frequency by 1 4 and 3 4 times at relatively low concentrations 0 01 0 1 mg l respectively exposure to pfoa resulted in enhanced cell membrane permeability and ros overproduction in donor cells at high concentrations of pfoa 1 10 mg l although enhanced oxidative stress and cell membrane permeability still occurred the atp contents in e coli decreased which contributed to the inhibited conjugation transcriptome analysis further showed that the expression levels of genes related to arginine biosynthesis arga argc argf argg argi and transport artj artm artq pathways were significantly increased intracellular l arginine concentration deficiency were observed at high concentrations of pfoa with the supplementary exogenous arginine it was demonstrated that arginine upregulated conjugation transfer related genes trfap trbbp and restores the cell number of transconjugants in pfoa treated group therefore the inhibited conjugation at high concentrations pfoa were attributed to the shortage of atp and the depletion of l arginine pool these findings provide important insights into the effect environmental concentrations of pfas on the conjugative transfer of args and update the regulation mechanism of plasmid conjugation which is critical for the management of antibiotic

antimicrobial resistance amr have been considered to be the greatest public health threat in the coming decades allen et al 2010 the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args has led to the spread of antibiotic resistance from environmental species to clinical pathogens and vice versa as has been found in some important clinical args dos santos et al 2020 shen et al 2018 horizontal gene transfer hgt is the mainly force for the spread of args occurring through conjugation transduction and transformation abe et al 2020 thomas and nielsen 2005 among these pathways plasmid mediated conjugation is considered as a principal contributor of hgt for the dissemination of args wozniak and waldor 2010 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are regarded as ideal places for the dissemination of args which accommodate a myriad of mobile genetic elements usually encoding multiple resistance kumar et al 2021 quintela baluja et al 2021 yin et al 2021 conjugative plasmid rp4 exhibits robust interspecies mobility among wastewater indigenous microbiota huang et al 2022 furthermore wwtps concentrate emerging pollutants of domestic and industrial origins such as nanoparticles qiu et al 2012 artificial sweeteners yu et al 2021 persistent organic contaminants paliya et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 which potentially facilitate the transfer of args among the co existing pollutants per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have attracted great interest as emerging persistent organic pollutants that are resistant to chemical thermal and biodegradation dhore and murthy 2021 pfas are widely used in industrial and daily consumption uses paul et al 2009 the most frequently detected perfluoroalkyl acid compound is perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa which has been phased out beginning in the early 2000s rahman et al 2014 in spite of restrictions on pfas the concentrations detected in the environment have been increasing to be ng l μg l and in wwtps even as high as mg l have been detected in wastewater due to its properties of low volatility and water solubility chen et al 2012 naile et al 2010 it is therefore important to understand the potential effect of pfas on args transfer the environmental health risks of pfas have received much concern and in vivo and in vitro models have been used to determine the potential biological effect that may cause hepatotoxicity neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity to humans and animals corsini et al 2014 johansson et al 2008 sheng et al 2018 studies have also shown that pfas have toxic or biological amplification effects on a variety of organisms such as bacteria liu et al 2016 and invertebrates xia et al 2013 pfoa interferes with the structure of cell membranes causing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in cells and leading to cellular oxidative damage li et al 2020b although the microbial toxicity of coexisting pfas in wwtps are well understood its impact on the args transmission is limited in the aquatic environment pollutants such as heavy metals and nanoparticles li et al 2020a are known to enhance intracellular ros generation as well as activated the dna damage induced response sos which contributed to the increased args conjugative transfer beaber et al 2004 in addition pollutants can also promote conjugative transfer by increasing the cell membrane permeability and the expression level of conjugative related genes therefore we speculate that pfas also can modulate the conjugative transfer through the ros overproduction and increased cell membrane permeability however the effects and mechanisms of pfas on args transfer remains unknown in order to understand the role of pfas in the dissemination of args three typical pfas including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa and ammonium perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoate genx were selected in this study pfoa was heavily used in the 1970 s and is tested as a legacy pfas pollutants benskin et al 2012 in addition the greater the number of carbon atoms in the backbone of the perfluoroalkyl chain the higher the bioaccumulation capability such as pfdoa which has twelve carbons and exhibits higher toxicity than short chain pfas kudo et al 2001 ohmori et al 2003 genx as a safer alternative have been used to replace pfoa in fluoropolymer manufacturing however it was recently shown that genx cause similar or even worse health effects than pfoa rickard et al 2022 taken together a conjugation model consisting of e coli hb101 with plasmid rp4 and e coli mg1655 was established to investigate the transmission risk of pfas on args conjugative transfer the conjugation dynamics were evaluated by conjugation frequency and the cell number of transconjugants next the underlying mechanisms associated with args transfer were also explored cell membrane permeability ros production were investigated that may be involved in the conjugative transfer taking pfoa as an example the expression levels of plasmid conjugation genes and the relative content of atp were also examined rna sequencing is a very helpful tool for analyzing differentially expressed genes therefore this method was chosen to identify candidate genes and potential e coli biological pathways coping with pfoa stress the information obtained from this study provides new insights into understanding the mechanism of the spread of antibiotic resistance caused by pfas 2 material and methods 2 1 args transfer via plasmid conjugation the donor strain was e coli hb101 which harbors self transferable rp4 plasmids encoding resistance to ampicillin amp tetracycline tc and kanamycin km e coli mg1655 as the recipient was resistant to rifampicin rif and nalidixic acid nal before the plasmid conjugation experiments strains were grown overnight in luria bertani lb medium with appropriate antibiotics concentrations donors were cultivated in lb supplemented with 100 mg l amp 50 mg l km and 10 mg l tc 160 mg l rif and 80 mg l nal were used for the recipients since the purpose of the study was to reveal how water soluble pfas affect conjugation dynamics a liquid mating system was used for the experiment after that the medium was washed twice with pbs to remove lb medium and antibiotic residues the bacterial suspension was adjusted to an appropriate concentration od600 1 0 next the mixture of donor and recipient 1 1 ratio v v was exposed to the tested pfas pfoa pfdoa genx at various concentrations 0 0 01 0 1 1 10 mg l the concentration levels of pfas were lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration 512 mg l text s1 but related to the wastewater treatment plant scenario table s1 then the mating pair system was placed in an incubator at 37 c for 20 h finally the cell

the promotion effect of ros on plasmid conjugation frequency thiourea as a ros scavenger sigma aldrich 99 0 could alleviate oxidative stress by ros zhang et al 2017 and was added into the conjugation

electrophoresis see the details in text s2 all plasmid conjugation experiments were prepared in biological triplicates 2 2 measurement of cell membrane permeability the cell membrane permeability was determined briefly the cell membrane permeability of e coli hb101 was measured with propidium iodide dye pi life technologies usa according to the method of yu et al 2021 the overnight cultured

significant differences were analyzed by one way anova and independent sample t test p values less than 0 05 were considered to be significantly different among samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas modulate args transfer via plasmid conjugation to understand the effect of pfas on the plasmid transfer of args an intragenera plasmid conjugation model was constructed in a liquid mating system at different concentrations of pfas interestingly the conjugative transfer frequency did not increase or decrease linearly as a function of pfas exposure concentration as shown in fig 1 a c all tested pfas pfoa pfdoa and genx significantly promoted the plasmid conjugation frequency at relatively low concentrations 0 01 and 0 1 mg l for example the natural conjugation frequency transconjugants recipients was 6 0 0 2 10 6 while pfoa at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l increased the conjugation frequency to 8 1 0 3 10 6 and 20 3 3 4 10 6 which increased by 1 4 and 3 4 fold respectively however when the pfoa concentration increased to relatively high concentrations 1 mg l and 10 mg l the conjugation frequency decreased to 0 2 0 03 10 6 and 0 4 0 09 10 6 respectively the same phenomenon occurred in the pfdoa and genx treated groups the trends were consistent regardless of whether the conjugation frequency was performed with donors or recipients it is worth noting that at the lowest tested concentration 0 01 mg l which is representative concentration of pfas in wwtps table s1 the conjugation frequency also increased by 1 4 1 7 and 1 5 fold corresponding to the dosage of pfoa pfdoa and genx respectively the cell number of transconjugants were consistent with the trend of conjugation frequency pfas at low doses 0 01 mg l and 1 mg l significantly increased the transconjugants number whereas high doses 1 mg l and 10 mg l decreased the transconjugants number fig 1d f li et al 2020c reported the low doses promoted and high doses inhibited plasmid conjugation transfer induced by single and mixed antibiotics subsequently shao et al 2022 also demonstrated that application of pyroligneous acids enhanced rp4 plasmid conjugation at low concentrations and decreased plasmid conjugation at high concentrations these studies confirmed the concentration dependence of emerging contaminants on args conjugation process random transconjugants were selected and verified by gel electrophoresis fig s1 to avoid the effects of pfas on the cell density in the conjugation system the cell number of donor and recipient were all counted pfas had no significant effect on the cell number of donor and recipient in the tested concentrations fig s2 p 0 05 therefore an increase or decrease in the frequency of plasmid conjugation was not directly related to the cell density 3 2 pfas enhanced cell membrane permeability the transmission of plasmid dna from donor to recipient requires to crossing of the membranes of the participants cell membrane may act as a barrier to hinder the conjugative transfer between bacteria and increased cell membrane permeability contribute to the passage of genetic material into and out of cells thomas and nielsen 2005 therefore pi dye was used to determine the effect of pfas on cell plasma membrane permeability the cell membrane permeability of the donor appears to play an more important role than recipients in the mating paired system yu et al 2021 therefore the donor e coli hb101 was selected the results suggested that the cell membrane permeability was enhanced significantly by pfas at the tested concentration range fig 2 a for example pfoa at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l significantly enhanced the cell membrane permeability by 1 6 and 1 5 fold respectively and pfdoa and genx at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l increased the cell membrane permeability to 1 1 1 2 and 1 1 1 1 fold respectively fig 2a no concentration dependence of cell membrane permeability was observed several studies have also proposed that increased plasmid conjugation frequency of plasmids is associated with increased cell membrane permeability wang et al 2015 yu et al 2021 rna sequencing was used to analysis the candidate genes involving cellular process the transcriptomes of donor e coli hb101 were analyzed after exposure to pfoa at 0 01 and 1 mg l rna sequencing showed that among all the up regulated expression of genes 12 9 were related to the cell envelope under exposure of pfoa 1 0 mg l which is shown in fig 2b the cell outer membrane is mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides lps and outer membrane proteins paracini et al 2022 the overexpression of the epta gene facilitate the modification of lipid a a component of lipopolysaccharide thereby increasing resistance to antibiotics cervoni et al 2021 otten et al 2021 wzzb is the regulator control the chain length of o antigen component of lps ranjith et al 2017 the up regulated expression of lps biosynthesis epta wzzb ais in e coli indicated that the cell outer membrane was stressed by pfoa and thus enhanced the biosynthesis and modification of lps to alleviate the damage of the cell membrane the expression of outer and inner membrane proteins was also significantly increased mlic yajg ycad yaji yiad cbrb cred mdta mltd pmrr ybci ycdz ydgk ydiy yoak ypdk for example yoak gene which encodes a membrane protein was upregulated by 0 5 fold at 0 01 mg l when the concentration increased to 1 mg l the gene expression increased by 2 8 fold fig 2b table s3 these changes in cell membrane related genes indicated transcriptional response to pfoa induced membrane damage in e coli previous studies have shown that pfoa had an effect on the cell membrane system interfering with membrane fluidity and changing membrane fatty acid composition which may be one of the main targets of pfoa liu et al 2008 sabovic et al 2020 yang et al 2017 the tem image showed that the untreated e coli mg1655 had a smooth surface and the cell membrane and cell wall were relatively tightly bound without plasmolysis fig 2c however the morphology of e coli mg1655 appeared to be changed with wrinkled and rough cell boundaries by 1 mg l pfoa when the concentration increased to 10 mg l the cell wall and membrane separated liu et al 2016 also showed a winked cell membrane plasmolysis and cytoplasm outflow under the treatment of pfoa 1 10 mg l the damaged cell envelope may be involved in the decreased conjugation transfer frequency at 1 and 10 mg l 3 3 pfas enhanced ros production ros are signal molecules for various cellular processes and their production may increase under environmental stress which might favor the conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 yu et al 2021 thus the effects of pfas on ros production was investigated clearly intracellular ros production of e coli hb101 was enhanced under pfas compared with pfdoa and genx ros production induced by pfoa 0 01 mg l and 0 1 mg l was higher increasing 1 7 and 1 5 fold respectively fig 3 a excessive accumulation of ros caused cell membrane disruption thus making the transfer of genetic elements across the cell membrane easier and promoting the frequency of conjugative transfer wang et al 2019 the increased cell membrane permeability was also observed in the donor fig 2a various defense mechanisms have been developed to protect cells against oxidative damage such as up regulation of antioxidant the antioxidant enzyme cat can scavenge ros as shown in fig 3b the cat enzyme activity of e coli hb101 also increased gradually under pfoa exposure to verify whether the increased ros production promoted conjugative transfer 100 μm thiourea was added to the conjugation system as a ros scavenger along with pfoa in the 0 01 and 0 1 mg l pfoa treated groups the ros scavenger reduced the cell number of transconjugants but the cell number of recipients did not change significantly fig 3c fig s3 the addition of thiourea decreased conjugation frequency compared to the group without scavenger fig 3d these results indicated that ros overproduction promoted the conjugative transfer under exposure of pfoa at low concentrations 0 01 0 1 mg l oxidative stress caused by pfoa was also observed in the changed expression gene as well as sos response related genes compared with the control genes related to ros production dsba cysz osmb rsxa rsxb rsxc were up regulated significantly after pfoa exposure at 1 mg l fig 3e table s4 ros overproduction not only target at cell membrane but also attack dna and inducing sos response which was the first dna repair system in e coli janion 2008 the expression level of the gene encoding dna repair protein reco was increased by 1 1 times under exposure of pfoa at 1 mg l in total the transcripts of the genes demonstrated that pfas exposure triggered ros production the sos response sos responses can induce conjugative transfer through dna damage to alleviate the conjugative repression waldor 2004 several studied reported that increased oxidative stress and up regulated sos response in bacterial cells were associated with the promoted conjugation lu et al 2020 yu et al 2021 however high concentrations of pfoa 1 10 mg l decreased plasmid conjugation frequency suggesting that cellular oxidative stress was not the only mechanism and that other mechanisms may also co regulate the inhibited plasmid conjugation 3 4 energy driving force for conjugative transfer atp provides the driving force for bacterial physiological activities including dna transfer chen et al 2005 the change of atp relative content with the concentration of pfoa was shown in fig 4 the relative content of atp in donor was not affected under the exposure of pfoa at 0 01 and 0 1 mg l however when pfoa concentration increased to 1 mg l and 10 mg l the atp content of the donor decreased to 70 7 5 7 and 79 9 6 6 respectively fig 4a and the atp content of the recipient decreased significantly to 75 1 5 9 and 65 0 14 5 respectively fig 4b the shortage of atp level corresponds to a sharply decrease in conjugation frequency at relatively high pfoa concentration similarly previous studies showed that low levels of nitrous acid inhibited the conjugation transfer process by reducing the energy supply process huang et al 2019 li et al 2021 also proved that the atp depletion induced by the free radical exposure affect plasmid conjugation one of the energy generation pathways is coupling of electron transfer to the atp synthesis in e coli ingledew and poole 1984 electron flow is mainly accomplished by transmembrane protein complexes i iv and the free moving electron carriers ubiquinone and cytochrome coupled with a proton gradient driven by complex v to produce atp fig 4c zhao et al 2019 complex i was composed of nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase electrons were transferred from nadh to ubiquinone through a flavin mononucleotide fmn followed by iron sulfur fes clusters in complex i inducing the protons to be pumped from the matrix to the intermembrane space nolfi donegan et al 2020 nine genes nuoe nuof nuog nuoh nuoi nuoj nuol nuom nuon related to complex i were all down regulated under pfoa exposure at 0 01 mg l and 1 mg l the expression of five genes frda frdb sdhd sdhe for complex ii were also down regulated at 1 mg l pfoa frda and frdb were fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit and fumarate reductase iron sulfur protein which were responsible for the enzyme catalysis and turnover of fumarate and succinate to provide electrons for complex ii in e coli jones and gunsalus 1987 therefore the down regulation of gene expression of complex i and ii implied decrease of electron supply complex ⅳ transfer electrons from cytochrome c to terminal electron acceptor o2 and produce h2o nolfi donegan et al 2020 the gene expression for complex ⅳ cydb was also down regulated therefore the gene downregulation of complex i complex ii and complex iv may indicates a weakened electron flow and proton transmembrane which eventually leads to reduced atp synthesis complex v uses the energy generated by the proton gradient to phosphorylate adp to atp zhao et al 2019 finally the gene expression related to atp synthase for complex ⅴ atpa atpc atpd atpe atpf atpg were also down regulated at 1 mg l pfoa table s5 indicating that pfoa treated e coli reduced atp synthesis thus decreasing the conjugation frequency 3 5 transcriptional analysis of plasmid conjugation genes args transfer by plasmid conjugation of bacteria requires a mating pair formation mpf for bridging the physical contact between the donor and recipient samuels et al 2000 the mobilization of rp4 plasmid was normally regulated by conjugative transfer related genes as shown in fig 5 a trbbp a key gene of mpf was activated and its mrna expression level was significantly increased by 1 2 times at 0 01 mg l pfoa while significantly decreased at 10 mg l which was 0 9 fold that of the blank group this indicated that the formation of the mating paired system the first step of the conjugation process was regulated by pfoa the trfap gene which is responsible for dna transfer and replication showed the same trend as trbbp fig 5b in the transcriptional sequencing data as shown in fig s4 the expression level of the global regulator gene kora and the conjugative transfer regulator gene trbj were up regulated at 0 01 mg l pfoa but the gene expression level was down regulated when the pfoa concentration increased to 1 mg l trbj gene plays an important role in the conjugative core region of the rp4 plasmid haase et al 1995 the initial contact between the donor and recipient may be connected by the pilus which is a major component belonging to the mpf system in e coli pili contribute to bacterial adhesion and colony formation the expression of pili related genes yraj ybgp yfcs yadk were down regulated after treatment with pfoa at 1 mg l which may disrupt the channel of plasmid transfer in the mating paired system overall it can be inferred that pfoa modulated the conjugative transfer by regulating genes expression related to plasmid conjugation 3 6 l arginine pool depletion induced by pfoa inhibited the plasmid conjugation transcriptomic analyses were further analyzed as shown in fig 6 a the gene expression levels of argacfgi were significantly up regulated under pfoa 1 mg l and these genes are all related to the arginine biosynthesis and catabolism pathway for example gene argc encoding n acetylglutamate semialdehyde reductase with the help of nadph n acetyl l glutamate 5 phosphate was biosynthesized into n acetyl l glutamate 5 semialdehyde meanwhile the argf gene encodes ornithine carbamoyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of carbamoyl moiety of carbamoylphosphate to 5 amino group of ornithithine and formed citrulline fig 6b table s6 cunin et al 1986 in addition to the biosynthetic pathway the intracellular arginine uptake pathway was also enhanced artj artm artq the significantly up regulated expression levels of these genes raised our curiosity about the intracellular concentration of l arginine hence the intracellular concentration of l arginine was determined by lc ms ms as shown in fig 6c d low concentration pfoa 0 01 1 mg l did not induce significant changes in intracellular concentration of l arginine p 0 05 in the donor and recipient while high concentrations of pfoa 1 10 mg l significantly decreased the l arginine concentration at 10 mg l pfoa the concentration of l arginine in the donor and recipient decreased to 55 and 65 respectively this indicates that high concentrations exposure of pfoa resulted in the depletion of intracellular arginine therefore e coli actively enhanced the biosynthesis and extracellular uptake of l arginine the decrease in intracellular concentration of l arginine may be due to the end product of l arginine metabolism is ammonia which can increase the intracellular ph value thereby protecting cells from toxic acidic conditions and maintaining the cellular ph homeostasis xiong et al 2016 in addition to l arginine the uptake systems of intracellular putrescine were also enhanced the main source of putrescine is the decomposition of intracellular l arginine or direct extracellular uptake when cells are faced with various oxidative stresses sod can protect nucleic acids from oxidative damage and polyamines also have a similar function of scavenging free radicals chattopadhyay et al 2003 under nutrient deficient conditions polyamines may be the main factors in the adaptation to acidic stimuli both potf encoding putrescine binding protein and potg encoding an atpase dependent transmembrane protein are related to the two arginine uptake systems and their gene expression levels were significantly up regulated igarashi et al 2001 this suggests that intracellular putrescine may also be insufficient to cope with pfoa stress deficiency of intracellular arginine resulted in decreased putrescine and thus enhanced extracellular uptake in order to verify the connection between the depletion of intracellular arginine and the inhibition of plasmid conjugation 1 mm arginine was added to e coli conjugation system together with 10 mg l pfoa to explore whether the expression levels of genes related to plasmid conjugation has changed as shown in fig 6e the addition of l arginine in the pfoa treated group 10 mg l significantly up regulated the gene expression levels of trfap and trbbp compared with the blank group without pfoa and l arginine only in the 10 mg l pfoa treated group fig 5 the expression levels of the two genes both decreased this suggests that l arginine deficiency regulated the expression of genes associated with plasmid conjugation meantime exogenous l arginine was also added into the conjugation system under the exposure of pfoa at 10 mg l the cell number of transconjugants was restored with the supplementary of exogenous l arginine however l arginine did not increase the cell number of transconjugants in the control group fig 6f in conclusion the depletion intracellular l arginine pool induced by pfoa inhibited the conjugative transfer 4 conclusion the effects and mechanisms of per polyfluoroalkyl substances on conjugative transfer frequency were investigated it is worth noting that the effects of sub inhibitory concentrations pfas on the plasmid conjugation showed a non unidirectional trend with low concentrations promotion and high concentrations inhibition this paper highlights that non unidirectional conjugation frequency results from co regulation of ros overproduction enhanced membrane permeability shortage of atp as well as intracellular l arginine depletion taking the well known pfoa as an example the promotion effects were mainly attributed to increased cell membrane permeability and ros overproduction under low concentrations exposure 0 01 0 1 mg l and there is no change in intracellular atp contents and l arginine concentrations however at high concentrations of pfoa 0 01 0 1 mg l reduced intracellular atp content and l arginine concentration contributed to the inhibited the conjugative transfer since the low concentrations of pfas are typical concentrations in wwtps attention should be paid to the promoting effect of pfas on plasmid conjugation in wwtps although genx considered a safer alternative to pfoa there is still a risk of spreading args however there are still some limitations in the research the study explored the effects of pfas on args conjugative transfer only in the pure culture e coli model besides only three pfas were selected to investigate the risk of args transfer in total the study broadens the understanding of the potential risks of pfas on the spread of args particular attention should be paid to the transmission risk of args induced by pfas in environmental ecosystems such as river sediment and soil furthermore the bioaccumulation of fpas in human not only directly induce health risks but also may affect the spread of args among human microbiome increasing the threat to human health more future studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of other pfas on the transmission of args at a microbial community wide level in wwtp and natural ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement congcong liu conceptualization data curation formal analysis

14744,figuring out the comprehensive metabolic mechanism of sulfonamide antibiotics sa is critical to improve and optimize sa removal in the bioremediation process but relevant studies are still lacking here an approach integrating metagenomic analysis degraders isolation reverse transcriptional quantification and targeted metabolite determination was used to decipher microbial interactions and functional genes characteristics in sa degrading microbial consortia enriched from wetland sediments the sa degrading consortia could rapidly catalyze ipso hydroxylation and subsequent reactions of sa to achieve the complete mineralization of sulfadiazine and partial mineralization of the other two typical sa sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine paenarthrobacter achromobacter pseudomonas and methylobacterium were identified as the primary participants for the initial transformation of sa among them methylobacterium could metabolize the heterocyclic intermediate of sulfadiazine 2 aminopyrimidine and the owning of sadabc genes sa degradation genes made paenarthrobacter have relatively higher sa degrading activity besides the coexistence of sadabc genes and sul1 gene sa resistance gene gave paenarthrobacter a dual resistance mechanism to sa the results of reverse transcription quantification further demonstrated that the activity of sada gene was related to the biodegradation of sa additionally sadabc genes were relatively conserved in a few microbacteriaceae and micrococcaceae sa degraders but the multiple recombination events caused by densely nested transposase encoding genes resulted in the differential sequence of sadab genes in paenarthrobacter genome these new findings provide valuable information for the selection and construction of engineered microbiomes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfonamide microbial interactions metagenomic sadabc genes biodegradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics sa are a family of heavily produced antibiotics that have been widely used in human and animal disease prevention and therapy belonging to one of the most used veterinary antibiotics qiao et al 2018 a considerable proportion of the applied sa can be excreted into the receiving environment via urine and feces of humans and animals zhang et al 2015 thus sa has been detected in medical production wastewater lin and tsai 2009 livestock wastewater han et al 2020 domestic sewage chang et al 2008 surface water and sediment jiang et al 2021 even in drinking water chen and zhou 2014 residual sa can affect microbial community structure and function and also has the potential to accelerate the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance gene arg and thus poses a threat to ecosystems and global health chen et al 2022b 2022c although sa can be biodegraded under aerobic conditions incomplete removal of sa has been reported during wastewater treatment chen and xie 2018 therefore strategies that promote fast and complete sa degradation are of great importance for wastewater treatment a variety of bacterial isolates have demonstrated the capability of transforming or mineralizing sa including microbacterium sp arthrobacter sp achromobacter sp and pseudomonas sp etc deng et al 2016 jiang et al 2014 reis et al 2014 ricken et al 2013 up to date the technology of isolating sa degraders has been relatively perfect and efficient sa degrading bacteria can be isolated from different environmental samples using different sa substrates and under culture conditions which provides microbial resources for the investigation of sa metabolic mechanism and bioaugmentation chen and xie 2018 qi et al 2021 besides based on the study on pure culture of microbacterium sp br1 ricken et al proposed the initial ipso hydroxylation a widely accepted biotransformation path of sa and the corresponding catalytic function genes of sa the only known functional genes of sa biodegradation ricken et al 2017 2015 2013 the initial ipso hydroxylation of sa is catalyzed by the monooxygenase encoded by the sada gene and the sadb gene is associated with the subsequent transformation conversion of p aminophenol to 1 2 4 trihydroxyphenol while the sadc gene plays an auxiliary role electron transport in the two step reaction ricken et al 2017 at present the cluster of sadabc genes has only been retrieved from the genomes of a few sa degraders belonging to phylum acitinobacteria deng et al 2021 ricken et al 2017 yu et al 2020 the number of sadabc genes in environmental samples is relatively low chen et al 2019 and it is difficult to obtain sequences of sadabc genes directly from metagenomic data of environmental samples chen et al 2022b therefore it is difficult to explore the function and activity of sadabc genes in sa biotransformation at the community level additionally knowledge of sadabc genes phylogenetic characteristics and their distribution on the genome of sa degraders will be helpful in further understanding the mechanism of sadabc genes but relevant research is very limited deng et al 2021 the physiological and biochemical studies of a single bacterium have become unable to meet the needs of researchers so more insights are given into the intraspecific or interspecific interaction mechanisms in functional microbial communities qi et al 2021 previous works have shown that microbial communities are superior to pure culture microorganisms in reducing metabolic burden and increasing robustness to environmental disturbance and the whole metabolic process of characteristic pollutants can be accelerated or completed through the cooperation and resource exchange among microorganisms ben said and or 2017 lindemann et al 2016 mccarty and ledesma amaro 2019 a recent study unraveled the internal labor division patterns in sulfamethoxazole smx degrading community through the combination of dynamic analysis of microbial community identification of in situ degraders and degraders isolation qi et al 2021 but this study did not link the gene composition of a single strain with the overall function of the microbial community additionally although an integrated meta omics approach can provide a significant step forward in the understanding of pollutant metabolic mechanism in microbial communities wright et al 2021 yu et al 2019 this approach has found no application to the study on sa degrading microbial communities to address the current knowledge gap of sa biodegradation mechanism in microbial communities this study developed an approach integrating metagenomic analysis degraders isolation reverse transcriptional quantification rt q pcr and targeted metabolite determination to dissect the microbial interactions and functional genes characteristics in sa degrading consortia wetland sediment with sa degrading potential was selected as the inoculum and smx as a model antibiotic was used for enrichment culture and sa degraders isolation then both smx degrading enrichment culture and pure culture degraders were applied for subsequent biodegradation tests the main goals of the present study were to 1 characterize the biotransformation of three typically sa in the sa degrading consortia 2 identify sa degraders and microbial interactions in the functional microbiomes through the combination of the community metagenomics and the individual bacterial activities analysis and 3 reveal the evolutionary characteristics of sa metabolic genes and their transcriptional activities in the process of sa degradation based on the rt q pcr phylogenetic analysis and the distribution characteristics of functional genes in the genomes of sa degraders 2

and strain isolation according to our previous studies the sediment with relatively high sa degradation ability under aerobic and anaerobic conditions that was collected from a wetland in xiamen city

discussion 3 1 biotransformation of sulfonamide in enrichment cultures smx enrichment cultures could biodegrade the three typical sa and the adsorption and hydrolysis of sa were negligible fig 1 a among the three sa sulfadiazine sdz and smx had higher biodegradation rates and they could be completely dissipated within 24 h however about 17 of the initial sulfamethazine smz remained after 6 days of incubation in the smx enrichment culture the sa biodegradation followed first order decay kinetics for smx and sdz or first order kinetics for smz with high correlation coefficients r2 of 0 99 and 0 97 respectively the biodegradation rate constant k and half life time t1 2 derived from the fitting model are displayed in table s5 and they were 0 17 and 9 86 h 0 12 and 9 31 h and 0 02 and 34 04 h for the biodegradation of 50 mg l smx sdz and smz in smx enrichment culture respectively the biodegradation rate constants of smx and sdz were much higher than that of smz microbial communities capable of degrading smx had the potential to metabolize other sa but showed different biodegradation rates due to the different heterocyclic structures of sa the two methyl groups in the pyrimidine ring of smz fig 1c might restrain its biotransformation rate additionally the key microbial populations driving the biotransformation of smx and sdz might be more similar much different from that able to utilize smz in addition as shown in fig 1a toc concentration decreased with the decreasing sa content indicating that a certain portion of sa derived carbon was assimilated by microorganisms as the carbon source for growth in the meantime of sa biotransformation however only sdz could be completely mineralized by the enrichment culture and the degradation of smx was accompanied by the accumulation of 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 3a5mi the heterocyclic partial product of smx chen and xie 2018 deng et al 2018 in view of the final concentration of 3a5mi 0 19 mol l and the initial concentration of smx 0 19 mol l smx was equimolarly converted to 3a5mi moreover the sum of toc corresponding to smx and 3a5mi was equal to the observed value of toc fig 1b demonstrating that 3a5mi was the only intermediate by product during smx degradation benzene ring related intermediates were assimilated in the meantime of smx biotransformation which was in line with the degradation result of smx in activated sludge smx enrichment culture qi et al 2021 3a5mi 2 aminopyrimidine 2ap and 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine 2a46dmp as the heterocyclic partial products of smx sdz and smz respectively chen and xie 2018 were detected in this study based on the chromatograms table s1 but no benzene ring related intermediates were observed which was consistent with the results of toc concentration according to the identified products and their formation patterns the pathway of the three typical sa was initiated by ipso hydroxylation with the cleavage of the c s n bond which resulted in the release of 3a5mi 2ap or 2a46dmp respectively fig 1c the initial transformation pathways of the three typical sa were the same which accounted for the ability to degrade the three sa by smx enrichment culture qi et al 2022 ricken et al 2013 however due to the different heterocyclic structures and subsequent reactions the smx enrichment culture could only completely mineralize sdz the heterocyclic intermediate of sdz 2ap could be further converted to 2 amino 4 hydroxypyrimidine by hydroxylation and 2 amino 4 5 dihydroxypyrimidine sdz p1 c4h7n3o2 m z 130 by dihydroxylation and then 2 amino 4 hydroxypyrimidine and sdz p1 were respectively transformed into 2 hydroxylamine 4 hydroxypyrimidine sdz p3 c4h5n3o2 m z 128 and 2 hydroxyamine 4 5 dihydroxypyrimidine sdz p2 c4h7n3o3 m z 146 via the addition of an oh to the nh2 group finally sdz p2 and sdz p3 could be further assimilated and mineralized based on toc concentration the pathway of sdz could be supported by previous studies where hydroxylation was considered as a main biotransformation reaction for sdz intermediates by arthrobacter and acinetobacter spp as well deng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 additionally the degradation pathways of sa were similar to that in the original sediments used as the inoculum for enrichment culture but fewer intermediates were detected in the former chen et al 2022b which might be attributed to the decrease of microbial diversity 3 2 sa degrading microbial community proteobacteria relative abundance 44 87 and actinobacteria relative abundance 10 48 were the dominant phyla in sa degrading microbial communities fig 2 a in line with the results of culture dependent and dna sip approaches chen et al 2022b chen and xie 2018 at genus level fig 2b achromobacter paenarthrobacter sphingomonas pseudomonas and methylobacterium with average relative abundance of 33 52 22 04 14 15 4 68 and 4 45 respectively dominated in sa degrading microbial communities compared with the smx treatment the achromobacter proportion decreased in sdz and smz treatments 62 54 and 10 in smx sdz and smz treatments while the paenarthrobacter proportion increased 9 22 and 48 in smx sdz and smz treatments respectively there was no significant difference in the proportion of pseudomonas among treatments about 5 the ability of achromobacter paenarthrobacter pseudomonas and methylobacterium to degrade sa as a sole carbon source had been confirmed by culture dependent method cao et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 liang and hu 2019 mulla et al 2016 they might be the key microorganisms involved in sa biodegradation in the sa degrading communities for example paenarthrobacter sp a01 and paenarthrobacter ureafaciens yl1 isolated from activated sludge were capable of converting smz to 2a46dmp cao et al 2019 yu et al 2020 considering the remarkable increase of paenarthrobacter in smz treatment paenarthrobacter could be of great significance in smz biotransformation additionally methylobacterium sp sdz w2 sj40 could not only convert sdz to 2ap but also further metabolize 2ap mulla et al 2016 thus it was a key microorganism for the complete mineralization of sdz in microbial communities moreover shinella and hydrogenophaga fig 2b could degrade aromatic amines biala et al 2014 gan et al 2012 and sphingomonas was a common degrader of aromatic compounds roggo et al 2013 so they might have the potential to metabolize benzene ring related intermediates in the sa degrading community additionally our previous study based on dna sip had revealed that pseudomonas and methylobacterium had the potential to degrade smx and sdz in sediments respectively but their abundance in the original sediments was very low the relative abundance of the five top abundant genera in the sa degrading community in the original sediments was almost zero except pseudomonas which hindered the removal of sa chen et al 2022b 3 3 isolation and identification of sa degrading pure culture to further identify the function of the microbes in the sa degrading bacterial community sa degraders were isolated from the smx enrichment culture in total 15 strains belonging to 3 genera paenarthrobacter sp r1 achromobacter sp r3 and pseudomonas sp m2 within 2 phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria were isolated from the enriched consortia fig s1 the degradation rates of sa all three sa smx sdz and smz by r1 were higher than those by r3 and m2 fig s2 the 48 h removal efficiencies of smx sdz and smz by r1 were 100 100 and 43 respectively the removal efficiency of smz reached 95 at 144 h however the degradation of sa by m2 and r3 occurred after a lag period about 48 h the complete removal of sdz and smx was accomplished at 144 h but the dissipation of smz lasted for a longer period the removal efficiencies of smz by m2 and r3 were 8 and 84 at 144 h respectively about 65 h was necessary for paenarthrobacter sp a01 to completely remove 100 mg l smz cao et al 2019 and paenarthrobacter sp p27 could completely degrade 50 mg l smx in less than 20 h qi et al 2021 which was similar to the results obtained in this study it took 10 days for various sa degrading strains within genus pseudomonas to dissipate 57 98 of smx 10 mg l herzog et al 2013 and about 91 of smx 150 mg l was removed by achromobacter sp pr1 after 51 h nguyen et al 2017 therefore paenarthrobacter might have higher sa degradation activity in the sa degrading communities especially for smz which also explained the increase in the abundance of paenarthrobacter in the smz treatment besides due to the higher growth rate of r3 than r1 fig s3 achromobacter had a numerical advantage in the communities fig 2b and thus contributed to the biotransformation of sa as well in addition the growth and sa degradation rates of pseudomonas were relatively low so it might not have the competitive advantage of utilizing sa substrate in the community last but not least the three strains could only catalyze the initial transformation of typical sa and utilize the substances of benzene ring for growth but none of them could completely mineralize sa according to toc concentration in fig s2 jiang et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 qi et al 2021 3 4 functional genes analysis based on metagenomic and genomic data to determine the identities and functions of microbial populations in the enrichment culture functional analysis was carried out for the individual genomes of isolates and the assembled metagenomes a total of 20 assembled genomes with completeness 70 and contamination 5 belonged to 15 genera including the four previously proposed sa degraders bin16 achromobacter bin7 paenarthrobacter bin15 pseudomonas and bin3 methylobacterium fig 2c table s7 the genomes of bin16 achromobacter bin14 hydrogenophaga bin8 shinella bin6 sphingosinicella and bin15 pseudomonas etc had a large number of functional genes related to xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism suggesting that they played important roles in transforming organic pollutants in the enrichment culture fig s6 some genomes contained sadb or sadc genes with low similarity 53 table s8 but sada gene was not detected on any metagenomic assembled genomes besides all the known genes involved in sa degradation were detected in the genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 with 73 9 identity 100 and having multiple copies of sada gene in both chromosome and plasmid table s9 fig 5 however no sadabc genes were detected on the genomes of the other two sa degraders namely genera pseudomonas neither of genomes of bin15 pseudomonas and pseudomonas sp m2 and methylobacterium bin3 methylobacterium in addition although the sequences similar to sadc and sadb genes were respectively annotated in bin16 achromobacter and bin6 sphingosinicella genomes further verification was needed due to the low similarity of the blast results with about 30 similarity the sada gene had also been detected in the genomes of some other strains of paenarthrobacter cao et al 2019 qi et al 2022 yu et al 2020 table s11 but there were no relevant reports on other genera in the studied sa degrading community in our studied sa degrading consortia paenarthrobacter was the sole member that contained the currently known functional genes for catalyzing sa biotransformation which might be the reason why it had a higher sa degradation rate than other sa degraders while the metabolic mechanism of other sa degraders needed to be further explored meanwhile several args were detected on the genomes of the nine bins and the two isolates especially on the genomes of pseudomonas and achromobacter table s8 and s10 pseudomonas and achromobacter can survive in a complex environment and become common pathogenic microorganisms for containing a variety of args gabrielaite et al 2021 shi et al 2022 however only sul1 gene one of sa resistance genes was detected on the genome of paenarthrobacter and the risk of arg transmission was lower than those of the other two sa degraders according to the metabolic activity higher degradation rate and potential harboring sada gene as well as the risk of transmission of arg fewer args paenarthrobacter was a promising engineered microorganism for sa dissipation the detailed information about the distribution of sul1 gene on paenarthrobacter genome was summarized in supplemental results 3 5 transcriptional activity of sa metabolic genes to further explore the relationship between the degradation rate of sa and the transcriptional activity of sadabc genes reverse transcription quantification of sada and sadb genes was performed on rna samples at different degradation periods sadc gene was not quantified because of its low amplification efficiency fig 3 in general wilcoxon test demonstrated that sa could stimulate the transcription of sadab genes especially sada gene and the number of sadab genes transcripts in multiple phases in sa treatments were higher than those in the corresponding phases in the control without sa substrate p 0 05 for example at phase ii the number of sada gene transcripts in smx sdz and smz treatments were 2 28 1 72 and 1 66 times that in the control respectively p 0 001 besides the transcription level of sadab genes increased firstly but then decreased both sada and sadb genes with the highest activity at phase ii in smx and smz treatments or continuously mounted up during the whole process of sa degradation sada gene with the highest activity at phase iv in sdz treatment the whole process of sdz biotransformation could promote the transcription of sada gene indicating that the metabolism of sdz intermediates might also be related to sada gene additionally the number of sada gene transcripts in smz treatment was only 66 and 34 of that in sdz and smx treatments respectively suggesting that smz had a weak activation of sada gene transcription which made it more difficult to be biodegraded by the enrichment culture fig 1a moreover although the transcripts of sadb gene were higher than those of sada gene sadb and sada genes with average transcripts of 2 31 103 9 14 104 and 2 36 102 3 91 103 copies μl rna respectively the transcriptional activity of sadb gene was less affected by sa indicating that sada gene was the key functional gene that limited the rate of sa biotransformation in future studies the number of sada transcripts could be used to assess the sa metabolic potential in the environmental samples in 2017 researchers proposed the role of sadabc genes in the ipso hydroxylation of sa based on the differential expression of protein composition in smx containing and smx free treatments with microbacterium sp br1 and the inferred heterologous expression of enzymes ricken et al 2017 subsequently although sadabc genes had been annotated from the genomes of several sa degrading strains deng et al 2021 qi et al 2021 yu et al 2020 information on their transcriptional activities in the process of sa degradation was still lacking in this study we provided experimental evidence that sa could promote the transcription of sada and sadb genes during sa degradation the transcription levels of sada and sadb genes differed in three different sa treatments and the key role of sada gene in sa biotransformation was also proposed 3 6 phylogeny and recombination of sa metabolic genes sadabc gene sequences retrieved from the metagenomic data of the enrichment culture and the genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 as well as their reference sequences from the ncbi genbank database table s11 were used to construct phylogenetic trees fig 4 all the sequences of sadabc genes were obtained from microbial genomes of family micrococcaceae arthrobacter and paenarthrobacter and microbacteriaceae microbacterium and leucobacter table s11 deng et al 2016 reis et al 2019 ricken et al 2017 yu et al 2020 in general the sequences of sada gene could be assigned into three clusters which were defined as microbacteriaceae micrococcaceae type i and micrococcaceae type ii according to the taxonomy composition of each cluster fig 4a and the gene sequence similarities within the three clusters were greater than 93 100 and 97 respectively most of sada gene sequences recovered from our study fell into cluster micrococcaceae type ii and were grouped with the sequences from genus paenarthrobacter or arthrobacter the two sada gene sequences retrieved from the metagenomic data of the sa degrading consortia were both grouped with the sequences from genus paenarthrobacter further confirming that only paenarthrobacter contained the sada gene in the sa degrading community although the sada gene sequences in both cluster micrococcaceae type i and cluster micrococcaceae type ii were retrieved from micrococcaceae microorganisms the similarity between the sequences in these two clusters was only 80 and lower than that between clusters micrococcaceae type i and micrococcaceae according to the phylogenetic tree of sada gene the sada gene sequences in micrococcaceae type i might be originated from genus microbacterium in cluster micrococcaceae in addition different sada gene sequences from the same strain might be affiliated with different clusters for example sequences plasmida gene0129 and plasmida gene0139 from paenarthrobacter sp r1 belonged to clusters micrococcaceae type i and micrococcaceae type ii respectively similar phenomena were also observed in paenarthrobacter ureafaciens yl1 and arthrobacter sp d2 but not in microbacteriaceae organism only one copy of sada gene the substantial differences in the structure and content of genetic contexts encompassing of sada gene in arthrobacter microorganisms have been noted in a previous study deng et al 2021 and our results highlight the presence of such differences in other microorganisms within the micrococcaceae family additionally we also found a similar phenomenon for sadb gene but not for sadc gene fig 4b 4c supplemental results phylogeny of sadb and sadc genes to further explain the intraspecies differences of sadab genes the distribution of sadabc genes in the genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 was analyzed fig 5 in general one sada gene sequence was detected on the chromosomal genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 and five sada one sadb and one sadc sequences were observed on the plasmid a genome of r1 as well as one sadb gene sequence was annotated on the plasmid c genome of r1 table s9 as displayed in fig 5 several transposase encoding genes were closely nested near the sada and sadb genes this densely nested transposable element region was conducive to multiple recombinations of sada and sadb genes which might be responsible for the intraspecies gene difference deng et al 2021 the currently known sadabc genes only originated from a few microorganisms within families micrococcacea and microbacteriaceae indicating that sadabc genes were relatively conserved might only occur among a few micrococcacea and microbacteriaceae organisms in addition after several months of enrichment culture the sadabc genes were not transferred horizontally from paenarthrobacter to other microbial genomes in the microbial community which also demonstrated the relative conservation of sadabc genes the discovery of the relative conservation of sadabc genes in this study greatly expands our knowledge boundary about the novel sa resistance mechanism via enzyme catalyzed antibiotics inactivation and sadabc genes were suggested as a strategy for the rapid elimination of sa additionally the copy number of sada gene on paenarthrobacter sp r1 genome 6 copies was higher than that on all other previously known sa degraders indicating its advantage in sa treatment 4 conclusions paenarthrobacter achromobacter pseudomonas and methylobacterium were the key microorganisms involved in the initial ipso hydroxylation of sa in sa degrading consortia methylobacterium could further degrade the heterocyclic intermediate of sdz most of the microbes in the consortia could utilize the benzene intermediate of sa the cooperation among different microorganisms led to the complete mineralization of sdz and partial mineralization of smx and smz paenarthrobacter had the highest sa degradation rate possibly due to its owning of sadabc genes the coexistence of sadabc genes and sul1 gene made paenarthrobacter have dual resistance mechanism to sa moreover the quantitative results of reverse transcription further demonstrated that sada gene transcriptional activity significantly increased during sa degradation and smz degradation rate was relatively low because it weakly stimulated sada gene transcriptional activity multiple transposases encoding genes were closely nested with sadab genes which made sadab genes have the potential for recombination and resulting in intraspecies differences in sadab genes in many sa degrading bacteria like paenarthrobacter additionally sadabc genes were relatively conserved and only existed in a few microorganisms within families microbacteriaceae and micrococcaceae the discovery in this study greatly expands our knowledge boundary about the sulfonamide degradation

14744,figuring out the comprehensive metabolic mechanism of sulfonamide antibiotics sa is critical to improve and optimize sa removal in the bioremediation process but relevant studies are still lacking here an approach integrating metagenomic analysis degraders isolation reverse transcriptional quantification and targeted metabolite determination was used to decipher microbial interactions and functional genes characteristics in sa degrading microbial consortia enriched from wetland sediments the sa degrading consortia could rapidly catalyze ipso hydroxylation and subsequent reactions of sa to achieve the complete mineralization of sulfadiazine and partial mineralization of the other two typical sa sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine paenarthrobacter achromobacter pseudomonas and methylobacterium were identified as the primary participants for the initial transformation of sa among them methylobacterium could metabolize the heterocyclic intermediate of sulfadiazine 2 aminopyrimidine and the owning of sadabc genes sa degradation genes made paenarthrobacter have relatively higher sa degrading activity besides the coexistence of sadabc genes and sul1 gene sa resistance gene gave paenarthrobacter a dual resistance mechanism to sa the results of reverse transcription quantification further demonstrated that the activity of sada gene was related to the biodegradation of sa additionally sadabc genes were relatively conserved in a few microbacteriaceae and micrococcaceae sa degraders but the multiple recombination events caused by densely nested transposase encoding genes resulted in the differential sequence of sadab genes in paenarthrobacter genome these new findings provide valuable information for the selection and construction of engineered microbiomes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfonamide microbial interactions metagenomic sadabc genes biodegradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics sa are a family of heavily produced antibiotics that have been widely used in human and animal disease prevention and therapy belonging to one of the most used veterinary antibiotics qiao et al 2018 a considerable proportion of the applied sa can be excreted into the receiving environment via urine and feces of humans and animals zhang et al 2015 thus sa has been detected in medical production wastewater lin and tsai 2009 livestock wastewater han et al 2020 domestic sewage chang et al 2008 surface water and sediment jiang et al 2021 even in drinking water chen and zhou 2014 residual sa can affect microbial community structure and function and also has the potential to accelerate the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance gene arg and thus poses a threat to ecosystems and global health chen et al 2022b 2022c although sa can be biodegraded under aerobic conditions incomplete removal of sa has been reported during wastewater treatment chen and xie 2018 therefore strategies that promote fast and complete sa degradation are of great importance for wastewater treatment a variety of bacterial isolates have demonstrated the capability of transforming or mineralizing sa including microbacterium sp arthrobacter sp achromobacter sp and pseudomonas sp etc deng et al 2016 jiang et al 2014 reis et al 2014 ricken et al 2013 up to date the technology of isolating sa degraders has been relatively perfect and efficient sa degrading bacteria can be isolated from different environmental samples using different sa substrates and under culture conditions which provides microbial resources for the investigation of sa metabolic mechanism and bioaugmentation chen and xie 2018 qi et al 2021 besides based on the study on pure culture of microbacterium sp br1 ricken et al proposed the initial ipso hydroxylation a widely accepted biotransformation path of sa and the corresponding catalytic function genes of sa the only known functional genes of sa biodegradation ricken et al 2017 2015 2013 the initial ipso hydroxylation of sa is catalyzed by the monooxygenase encoded by the sada gene and the sadb gene is associated with the subsequent transformation conversion of p aminophenol to 1 2 4 trihydroxyphenol while the sadc gene plays an auxiliary role electron transport in the two step reaction ricken et al 2017 at present the cluster of sadabc genes has only been retrieved from the genomes of a few sa degraders belonging to phylum acitinobacteria deng et al 2021 ricken et al 2017 yu et al 2020 the number of sadabc genes in environmental samples is relatively low chen et al 2019 and it is difficult to obtain sequences of sadabc genes directly from metagenomic data of environmental samples chen et al 2022b therefore it is difficult to explore the function and activity of sadabc genes in sa biotransformation at the community level additionally knowledge of sadabc genes phylogenetic characteristics and their distribution on the genome of sa degraders will be helpful in further understanding the mechanism of sadabc genes but relevant research is very limited deng et al 2021 the physiological and biochemical studies of a single bacterium have become unable to meet the needs of researchers so more insights are given into the intraspecific or interspecific interaction mechanisms in functional microbial communities qi et al 2021 previous works have shown that microbial communities are superior to pure culture microorganisms in reducing metabolic burden and increasing robustness to environmental disturbance and the whole metabolic process of characteristic pollutants can be accelerated or completed through the cooperation and resource exchange among microorganisms ben said and or 2017 lindemann et al 2016 mccarty and ledesma amaro 2019 a recent study unraveled the internal labor division patterns in sulfamethoxazole smx degrading community through the combination of dynamic analysis of microbial community identification of in situ degraders and degraders isolation qi et al 2021 but this study did not link the gene composition of a single strain with the overall function of the microbial community additionally although an integrated meta omics approach can provide a significant step forward in the understanding of pollutant metabolic mechanism in microbial communities wright et al 2021 yu et al 2019 this approach has found no application to the study on sa degrading microbial communities to address the current knowledge gap of sa biodegradation mechanism in microbial communities this study developed an approach integrating metagenomic analysis degraders isolation reverse transcriptional quantification rt q pcr and targeted metabolite determination to dissect the microbial interactions and functional genes characteristics in sa degrading consortia wetland sediment with sa degrading potential was selected as the inoculum and smx as a model antibiotic was used for enrichment culture and sa degraders isolation then both smx degrading enrichment culture and pure culture degraders were applied for subsequent biodegradation tests the main goals of the present study were to 1 characterize the biotransformation of three typically sa in the sa degrading consortia 2 identify sa degraders and microbial interactions in the functional microbiomes through the combination of the community metagenomics and the individual bacterial activities analysis and 3 reveal the evolutionary characteristics of sa metabolic genes and their transcriptional activities in the process of sa degradation based on the rt q pcr phylogenetic analysis and the distribution characteristics of functional genes in the genomes of sa degraders 2

and strain isolation according to our previous studies the sediment with relatively high sa degradation ability under aerobic and anaerobic conditions that was collected from a wetland in xiamen city fujian province chen et al 2022b 2022c was used as the inoculum for enrichment culture and sa degraders isolation in this study sa medium table s2 was prepared based on the physicochemical properties of the wetland samples chen et al 2022b and the commonly used basal salt medium herzog et al 2013 approximately 5 g sediment wet weight was inoculated into a 250 ml flask containing 50 ml sa medium supplemented with 300 mg l sodium acetate and 10 mg l smx and then the enrichment culture 5 v v was sub cultured into a new medium every 3 days for two months when efficient smx degradation was observed 50 mg l smx was utilized as the sole organic carbon source and sub cultured for three months all cultures were incubated at 25 c and 160 rpm in the dark to isolate smx degraders the final enrichment culture was plated on smx containing agar plates comprising 20 ml either defined sa medium or r2a medium agar plates 50 mg l smx and 1 5 agar and incubated at 25 c detailed information was described in the supporting information si isolates were identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing blast on ncbi chen et al 2022d 2 3 batch biodegradation experiments the biodegradation experiments

data and materials the raw 16s rrna gene reads and the shotgun metagenomics data were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database with the accession number prjna812704 3 results and discussion 3 1 biotransformation of sulfonamide in enrichment cultures smx enrichment cultures could biodegrade the three typical sa and the adsorption and hydrolysis of sa were negligible fig 1 a among the three sa sulfadiazine sdz and smx had higher biodegradation rates and they could be completely dissipated within 24 h however about 17 of the initial sulfamethazine smz remained after 6 days of incubation in the smx enrichment culture the sa biodegradation followed first order decay kinetics for smx and sdz or first order kinetics for smz with high correlation coefficients r2 of 0 99 and 0 97 respectively the biodegradation rate constant k and half life time t1 2 derived from the fitting model are displayed in table s5 and they were 0 17 and 9 86 h 0 12 and 9 31 h and 0 02 and 34 04 h for the biodegradation of 50 mg l smx sdz and smz in smx enrichment culture respectively the biodegradation rate constants of smx and sdz were much higher than that of smz microbial communities capable of degrading smx had the potential to metabolize other sa but showed different biodegradation rates due to the different heterocyclic structures of sa the two methyl groups in the pyrimidine ring of smz fig 1c might restrain its biotransformation rate additionally the key microbial populations driving the biotransformation of smx and sdz might be more similar much different from that able to utilize smz in addition as shown in fig 1a toc concentration decreased with the decreasing sa content indicating that a certain portion of sa derived carbon was assimilated by microorganisms as the carbon source for growth in the meantime of sa biotransformation however only sdz could be completely mineralized by the enrichment culture and the degradation of smx was accompanied by the accumulation of 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole 3a5mi the heterocyclic partial product of smx chen and xie 2018 deng et al 2018 in view of the final concentration of 3a5mi 0 19 mol l and the initial concentration of smx 0 19 mol l smx was equimolarly converted to 3a5mi moreover the sum of toc corresponding to smx and 3a5mi was equal to the observed value of toc fig 1b demonstrating that 3a5mi was the only intermediate by product during smx degradation benzene ring related intermediates were assimilated in the meantime of smx biotransformation which was in line with the degradation result of smx in activated sludge smx enrichment culture qi et al 2021 3a5mi 2 aminopyrimidine 2ap and 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine 2a46dmp as the heterocyclic partial products of smx sdz and smz respectively chen and xie 2018 were detected in this study based on the chromatograms table s1 but no benzene ring related intermediates were observed which was consistent with the results of toc concentration according to the identified products and their formation patterns the pathway of the three typical sa was initiated by ipso hydroxylation with the cleavage of the c s n bond which resulted in the release of 3a5mi 2ap or 2a46dmp respectively fig 1c the initial transformation pathways of the three typical sa were the same which accounted for the ability to degrade the three sa by smx enrichment culture qi et al 2022 ricken et al 2013 however due to the different heterocyclic structures and subsequent reactions the smx enrichment culture could only completely mineralize sdz the heterocyclic intermediate of sdz 2ap could be further converted to 2 amino 4 hydroxypyrimidine by hydroxylation and 2 amino 4 5 dihydroxypyrimidine sdz p1 c4h7n3o2 m z 130 by dihydroxylation and then 2 amino 4 hydroxypyrimidine and sdz p1 were respectively transformed into 2 hydroxylamine 4 hydroxypyrimidine sdz p3 c4h5n3o2 m z 128 and 2 hydroxyamine 4 5 dihydroxypyrimidine sdz p2 c4h7n3o3 m z 146 via the addition of an oh to the nh2 group finally sdz p2 and sdz p3 could be further assimilated and mineralized based on toc concentration the pathway of sdz could be supported by previous studies where hydroxylation was considered as a main biotransformation reaction for sdz intermediates by arthrobacter and acinetobacter spp as well deng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 additionally the degradation pathways of sa were similar to that in the original sediments used as the inoculum for enrichment culture but fewer intermediates were detected in the former chen et al 2022b which might be attributed to the decrease of microbial diversity 3 2 sa degrading microbial community proteobacteria relative abundance 44 87 and actinobacteria relative abundance 10 48 were the dominant phyla in sa degrading microbial communities fig 2 a in line with the results of culture dependent and dna sip approaches chen et al 2022b chen and xie 2018 at genus level fig 2b achromobacter paenarthrobacter sphingomonas pseudomonas and methylobacterium with average relative abundance of 33 52 22 04 14 15 4 68 and 4 45 respectively dominated in sa degrading microbial communities compared with the smx treatment the achromobacter proportion decreased in sdz and smz treatments 62 54 and 10 in smx sdz and smz treatments while the paenarthrobacter proportion increased 9 22 and 48 in smx sdz and smz treatments respectively there was no significant difference in the proportion of pseudomonas among treatments about 5 the ability of achromobacter paenarthrobacter pseudomonas and methylobacterium to degrade sa as a sole carbon source had been confirmed by culture dependent method cao et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 liang and hu 2019 mulla et al 2016 they might be the key microorganisms involved in sa biodegradation in the sa degrading communities for example paenarthrobacter sp a01 and paenarthrobacter ureafaciens yl1 isolated from activated sludge were capable of converting smz to 2a46dmp cao et al 2019 yu et al 2020 considering the remarkable increase of paenarthrobacter in smz treatment paenarthrobacter could be of great significance in smz biotransformation additionally methylobacterium sp sdz w2 sj40 could not only convert sdz to 2ap but also further metabolize 2ap mulla et al 2016 thus it was a key microorganism for the complete mineralization of sdz in microbial communities moreover shinella and hydrogenophaga fig 2b could degrade aromatic amines biala et al 2014 gan et al 2012 and sphingomonas was a common degrader of aromatic compounds roggo et al 2013 so they might have the potential to metabolize benzene ring related intermediates in the sa degrading community additionally our previous study based on dna sip had revealed that pseudomonas and methylobacterium had the potential to degrade smx and sdz in sediments respectively but their abundance in the original sediments was very low the relative abundance of the five top abundant genera in the sa degrading community in the original sediments was almost zero except pseudomonas which hindered the removal of sa chen et al 2022b 3 3 isolation and identification of sa degrading pure culture to further identify the function of the microbes in the sa degrading bacterial community sa degraders were isolated from the smx enrichment culture in total 15 strains belonging to 3 genera paenarthrobacter sp r1 achromobacter sp r3 and pseudomonas sp m2 within 2 phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria were isolated from the enriched consortia fig s1 the degradation rates of sa all three sa smx sdz and smz by r1 were higher than those by r3 and m2 fig s2 the 48 h removal efficiencies of smx sdz and smz by r1 were 100 100 and 43 respectively the removal efficiency of smz reached 95 at 144 h however the degradation of sa by m2 and r3 occurred after a lag period about 48 h the complete removal of sdz and smx was accomplished at 144 h but the dissipation of smz lasted for a longer period the removal efficiencies of smz by m2 and r3 were 8 and 84 at 144 h respectively about 65 h was necessary for paenarthrobacter sp a01 to completely remove 100 mg l smz cao et al 2019 and paenarthrobacter sp p27 could completely degrade 50 mg l smx in less than 20 h qi et al 2021 which was similar to the results obtained in this study it took 10 days for various sa degrading strains within genus pseudomonas to dissipate 57 98 of smx 10 mg l herzog et al 2013 and about 91 of smx 150 mg l was removed by achromobacter sp pr1 after 51 h nguyen et al 2017 therefore paenarthrobacter might have higher sa degradation activity in the sa degrading communities especially for smz which also explained the increase in the abundance of paenarthrobacter in the smz treatment besides due to the higher growth rate of r3 than r1 fig s3 achromobacter had a numerical advantage in the communities fig 2b and thus contributed to the biotransformation of sa as well in addition the growth and sa degradation rates of pseudomonas were relatively low so it might not have the competitive advantage of utilizing sa substrate in the community last but not least the three strains could only catalyze the initial transformation of typical sa and utilize the substances of benzene ring for growth but none of them could completely mineralize sa according to toc concentration in fig s2 jiang et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 qi et al 2021 3 4 functional genes analysis based on metagenomic and genomic data to determine the identities and functions of microbial populations in the enrichment culture functional analysis was carried out for the individual genomes of isolates and the assembled metagenomes a total of 20 assembled genomes with completeness 70 and contamination 5 belonged to 15 genera including the four previously proposed sa degraders bin16 achromobacter bin7 paenarthrobacter bin15 pseudomonas and bin3 methylobacterium fig 2c table s7 the genomes of bin16 achromobacter bin14 hydrogenophaga bin8 shinella bin6 sphingosinicella and bin15 pseudomonas etc had a large number of functional genes related to xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism suggesting that they played important roles in transforming organic pollutants in the enrichment culture fig s6 some genomes contained sadb or sadc genes with low similarity 53 table s8 but sada gene was not detected on any metagenomic assembled genomes besides all the known genes involved in sa degradation were detected in the genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 with 73 9 identity 100 and having multiple copies of sada gene in both chromosome and plasmid table s9 fig 5 however no sadabc genes were detected on the genomes of the other two sa degraders namely genera pseudomonas neither of genomes of bin15 pseudomonas and pseudomonas sp m2 and methylobacterium bin3 methylobacterium in addition although the sequences similar to sadc and sadb genes were respectively annotated in bin16 achromobacter and bin6 sphingosinicella genomes further verification was needed due to the low similarity of the blast results with about 30 similarity the sada gene had also been detected in the genomes of some other strains of paenarthrobacter cao et al 2019 qi et al 2022 yu et al 2020 table s11 but there were no relevant reports on other genera in the studied sa degrading community in our studied sa degrading consortia paenarthrobacter was the sole member that contained the currently known functional genes for catalyzing sa biotransformation which might be the reason why it had a higher sa degradation rate than other sa degraders while the metabolic mechanism of other sa degraders needed to be further explored meanwhile several args were detected on the genomes of the nine bins and the two isolates especially on the genomes of pseudomonas and achromobacter table s8 and s10 pseudomonas and achromobacter can survive in a complex environment and become common pathogenic microorganisms for containing a variety of args gabrielaite et al 2021 shi et al 2022 however only sul1 gene one of sa resistance genes was detected on the genome of paenarthrobacter and the risk of arg transmission was lower than those of the other two sa degraders according to the metabolic activity higher degradation rate and potential harboring sada gene as well as the risk of transmission of arg fewer args paenarthrobacter was a promising engineered microorganism for sa dissipation the detailed information about the distribution of sul1 gene on paenarthrobacter genome was summarized in supplemental results 3 5 transcriptional activity of sa metabolic genes to further explore the relationship between the degradation rate of sa and the transcriptional activity of sadabc genes reverse transcription quantification of sada and sadb genes was performed on rna samples at different degradation periods sadc gene was not quantified because of its low amplification efficiency fig 3 in general wilcoxon test demonstrated that sa could stimulate the transcription of sadab genes especially sada gene and the number of sadab genes transcripts in multiple phases in sa treatments were higher than those in the corresponding phases in the control without sa substrate p 0 05 for example at phase ii the number of sada gene transcripts in smx sdz and smz treatments were 2 28 1 72 and 1 66 times that in the control respectively p 0 001 besides the transcription level of sadab genes increased firstly but then decreased both sada and sadb genes with the highest activity at phase ii in smx and smz treatments or continuously mounted up during the whole process of sa degradation sada gene with the highest activity at phase iv in sdz treatment the whole process of sdz biotransformation could promote the transcription of sada gene indicating that the metabolism of sdz intermediates might also be related to sada gene additionally the number of sada gene transcripts in smz treatment was only 66 and 34 of that in sdz and smx treatments respectively suggesting that smz had a weak activation of sada gene transcription which made it more difficult to be biodegraded by the enrichment culture fig 1a moreover although the transcripts of sadb gene were higher than those of sada gene sadb and sada genes with average transcripts of 2 31 103 9 14 104 and 2 36 102 3 91 103 copies μl rna respectively the transcriptional activity of sadb gene was less affected by sa indicating that sada gene was the key functional gene that limited the rate of sa biotransformation in future studies the number of sada transcripts could be used to assess the sa metabolic potential in the environmental samples in 2017 researchers proposed the role of sadabc genes in the ipso hydroxylation of sa based on the differential expression of protein composition in smx containing and smx free treatments with microbacterium sp br1 and the inferred heterologous expression of enzymes ricken et al 2017 subsequently although sadabc genes had been annotated from the genomes of several sa degrading strains deng et al 2021 qi et al 2021 yu et al 2020 information on their transcriptional activities in the process of sa degradation was still lacking in this study we provided experimental evidence that sa could promote the transcription of sada and sadb genes during sa degradation the transcription levels of sada and sadb genes differed in three different sa treatments and the key role of sada gene in sa biotransformation was also proposed 3 6 phylogeny and recombination of sa metabolic genes sadabc gene sequences retrieved from the metagenomic data of the enrichment culture and the genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 as well as their reference sequences from the ncbi genbank database table s11 were used to construct phylogenetic trees fig 4 all the sequences of sadabc genes were obtained from microbial genomes of family micrococcaceae arthrobacter and paenarthrobacter and microbacteriaceae microbacterium and leucobacter table s11 deng et al 2016 reis et al 2019 ricken et al 2017 yu et al 2020 in general the sequences of sada gene could be assigned into three clusters which were defined as microbacteriaceae micrococcaceae type i and micrococcaceae type ii according to the taxonomy composition of each cluster fig 4a and the gene sequence similarities within the three clusters were greater than 93 100 and 97 respectively most of sada gene sequences recovered from our study fell into cluster micrococcaceae type ii and were grouped with the sequences from genus paenarthrobacter or arthrobacter the two sada gene sequences retrieved from the metagenomic data of the sa degrading consortia were both grouped with the sequences from genus paenarthrobacter further confirming that only paenarthrobacter contained the sada gene in the sa degrading community although the sada gene sequences in both cluster micrococcaceae type i and cluster micrococcaceae type ii were retrieved from micrococcaceae microorganisms the similarity between the sequences in these two clusters was only 80 and lower than that between clusters micrococcaceae type i and micrococcaceae according to the phylogenetic tree of sada gene the sada gene sequences in micrococcaceae type i might be originated from genus microbacterium in cluster micrococcaceae in addition different sada gene sequences from the same strain might be affiliated with different clusters for example sequences plasmida gene0129 and plasmida gene0139 from paenarthrobacter sp r1 belonged to clusters micrococcaceae type i and micrococcaceae type ii respectively similar phenomena were also observed in paenarthrobacter ureafaciens yl1 and arthrobacter sp d2 but not in microbacteriaceae organism only one copy of sada gene the substantial differences in the structure and content of genetic contexts encompassing of sada gene in arthrobacter microorganisms have been noted in a previous study deng et al 2021 and our results highlight the presence of such differences in other microorganisms within the micrococcaceae family additionally we also found a similar phenomenon for sadb gene but not for sadc gene fig 4b 4c supplemental results phylogeny of sadb and sadc genes to further explain the intraspecies differences of sadab genes the distribution of sadabc genes in the genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 was analyzed fig 5 in general one sada gene sequence was detected on the chromosomal genome of paenarthrobacter sp r1 and five sada one sadb and one sadc sequences were observed on the plasmid a genome of r1 as well as one sadb gene sequence was annotated on the plasmid c genome of r1 table s9 as displayed in fig 5 several transposase encoding genes were closely nested near the sada and sadb genes this densely nested transposable element region was conducive to multiple recombinations of sada and sadb genes which might be responsible for the intraspecies gene difference deng et al 2021 the currently known sadabc genes only originated from a few microorganisms within families micrococcacea and microbacteriaceae indicating that sadabc genes were relatively conserved might only occur among a few micrococcacea and microbacteriaceae organisms in addition after several months of enrichment culture the sadabc genes were not transferred horizontally from paenarthrobacter to other microbial genomes in the microbial community which also demonstrated the relative conservation of sadabc genes the discovery of the relative conservation of sadabc genes in this study greatly expands our knowledge boundary about the novel sa resistance mechanism via enzyme catalyzed antibiotics inactivation and sadabc genes were suggested as a strategy for the rapid elimination of sa additionally the copy number of sada gene on paenarthrobacter sp r1 genome 6 copies was higher than that on all other previously known sa degraders indicating its advantage in sa treatment 4 conclusions paenarthrobacter achromobacter pseudomonas and methylobacterium were the key microorganisms involved in the initial ipso hydroxylation of sa in sa degrading consortia methylobacterium could further degrade the heterocyclic intermediate of sdz most of the microbes in the consortia could utilize the benzene intermediate of sa the cooperation among different microorganisms led to the complete mineralization of sdz and partial mineralization of smx and smz paenarthrobacter had the highest sa degradation rate possibly due to its owning of sadabc genes the coexistence of sadabc genes and sul1 gene made paenarthrobacter have dual resistance mechanism to sa moreover the quantitative results of reverse transcription further demonstrated that sada gene transcriptional activity significantly increased during sa degradation and smz degradation rate was relatively low because it weakly stimulated sada gene transcriptional activity multiple transposases encoding genes were closely nested with sadab genes which made sadab genes have the potential for recombination and resulting in intraspecies differences in sadab genes in many sa degrading bacteria like paenarthrobacter additionally sadabc genes were relatively conserved and only existed in a few microorganisms within families microbacteriaceae and micrococcaceae the discovery in this study greatly expands our knowledge boundary about the sulfonamide degradation
