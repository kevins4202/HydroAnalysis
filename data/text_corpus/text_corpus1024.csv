5120,to quantify the surface water groundwater sw gw exchange flux in a river basin the inclusion of sw gw interaction sgi process in the next generation earth system models is of growing concern among the hydrologic community that requires a trade off among model complexity linking streamflow and groundwater flow domains spatial heterogeneity and computational demand although semi distributed sgi models seem to be a plausible solution the question is what could be the effective way to decompose a river basin to assess the sub surface flux therefore this study intends to search for a better alternative approach for catchment decomposition between the hillslope and hydrologic response unit hru based sgi models the inherent relationship between the decomposition level and model efficiency and the appropriate spatial scale of decomposition for hillslopes and hrus the typical hydrological models chosen for this study are the hillslope based coupled variable parameter mccarthy muskingum enhanced hillslope storage boussinesq vpmm ehsb and the hru based coupled soil and water assessment tool modular three dimensional groundwater flow swat modflow these semi distributed models are field tested to model the streamflow accounting for lateral contributions along the river reach baseflow depth to water table and the sgi flux the results reveal that the vpmm ehsb model with hillslope grid based decomposition outperformed the swat modflow with the hru grid based hybrid decomposition in explaining the variance of the entire annual and low non monsoon streamflow time series by 12 and 25 respectively the vpmm ehsb approach has a faster 36 simulation time than that of the swat modflow showing the potential of the hillslope decomposition approach in the vpmm ehsb model over the hru based approach in the swat modflow for large scale application in future earth system models keywords boussinesq catchment decomposition surface water groundwater interaction swat modflow vpmm 1 introduction surface water and groundwater are no longer considered as different entities as both are interconnected to each other by a two way flux exchange process sophocleous 2002 barthel and banzhaf 2016 a wide range of contemporary issues in water resources management such as the water quality problem due to point and non point sources groundwater overdraft river linking and maintaining environmental flow necessitates for understanding the complex exchange flux dynamics through stream aquifer interaction modelling brunner et al 2017 realizing the importance of surface water groundwater interaction sgi as a major component in the land system processes incorporation of the sgi dynamics in the framework of earth system models esms is a growing concern among the hydrologic community in the recent decade clark et al 2015 some different models available in the literature for studying the sgi are catchment hydrology cathy e g bixio et al 2002 camporese et al 2010

parameter mccarthy muskingum vpmm enhanced hillslope storage boussinesq ehsb model vpmm ehsb sahoo and sahoo 2019 for modelling the sgi using any distributed or semi distributed model the first step is to discretize or decompose the basin into several constituting units in which the catchment topography and meteorological variables can be effectively assumed to be uniform the different techniques available for discretizing a river basin can be broadly classified into three classes spatial grid cell representative hillslope and sub watershed arnold et al 2012 the grid cell based sgi models may be treated as fully distributed e g kollet and maxwell 2008a 2008b maxwell et al 2015 whereas the hillslope based e g fan and bras 1998 troch et al 2003 matonse and kroll 2009 and sub watershed based models e g swat arnold et al 1998 are semi distributed in nature further according to the resolution complexity continuum such hydrologic models may be broadly classified into two classes hrachowitz and clark 2017 i distributed and physically based with increased complexity e g kollet and maxwell 2008a 2008b maxwell et al 2015 and ii lumped and usually conceptual e g garavaglia et al 2017 son and sivapalan 2007 willems 2014 however as all the models are simplifications to mimic the natural systems closely gupta et al 2012 there exist competing modelling philosophies in the hydrologic community hrachowitz and clark 2017 regarding the simple lumped models e g sivapalan et al 2003b and complex physically based models clark et al 2015 2017 each having their pros and cons however the effort to apply a more complex model is far greater than simplified models alternatively to compromise the computational demand in the sgi modeling approach increasing spatial grid size could result in aggregating the different landuse and soil classes into one class thus losing the spatial heterogeneity affecting the modelling accuracy conversely although the conceptual hydrologic models can be applied to any spatial scale to answer how much answering why is not always possible similarly lack of detailed field geo hydro meteorological observations in ungauged river basins limits the parameterization of lumped conceptual models for their wide scale application hrachowitz et al 2013 littlewood et al 2003 sivapalan et al 2003a hence for estimating the sgi flux in a river basin with the mixed scenarios of insufficient field data availability and computational burden for large river basins there is a need to develop physically based semi distributed models that accounts for the micro scale hydrological process details and macro or mesoscale computational feasibility therefore the alternate methods of spatial discretization of a river basin could be the representative hillslope or the sub basin the primary motivation of this study is to assess which of these two approaches of spatial discretization would be better suited for integration of the sgi dynamics in the esms for capturing the sgi dynamics the right level of discretization complexity could be determined by comparing any representative hillslope model with the hru based model among the different sgi models the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow are such typical coupled models that are semi distributed yet capable of handling the spatially distributed geo hydrometeorological variables through the hillslope and subwatershed based discretizations respectively in the swat modelling framework for estimating streamflow the subwatersheds are further discretized into the hydrologic response units hrus accounting for the land use soil and slope types encountered in the subwatershed swat is also popularly used for modelling the basin scale sediment and nutrient transports and land use and climate change impacts on streamflow krysanova and white 2015 dash et al 2020 swain et al 2020 similarly the grid based modflow is a widely used model by the hydrogeologists worldwide to model the groundwater flow that needs detailed grid scale information of soil type litholog aquifer depth aquifer hydraulic properties source or sinks and hydrometeorological variables some parameters in modflow such as the hydraulic conductivity can be determined by inverse modelling brunner et al 2017 however the field measured parameters still have uncertainty that affects the inverse modelling brunner et al 2012 therefore the application of both the standalone swat and modflow models and the coupled swat modflow version are preferred for data sufficient river basins in the literature conversely the recently developed process based yet simplified vpmm ehsb sgi model can be applied in ungauged or semi gauged basins sahoo and sahoo 2019 as both of its sub modules require lesser field datasets the vpmm ehsb requires only the cross sectional details at the two end sections of the river reach of interest rather than the detailed cross sections of the river network soil hydraulic conductivity of the river bed in the vertical direction only and unidirectional aquifer hydraulic properties i e saturated hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity recently there has been a growing interest among the hydrologic community towards hillslope based modelling e g clark et al 2017 fan et al 2019 as at this scale almost all the hydrological processes of water sediment and nutrient transports are completed fan et al 2019 now question is that for modelling the sgi flux under limited data availability conditions with better computational feasibility what could be the best catchment decomposition approach representative hillslopes or hrus till recently several model inter comparison projects are undertaken by the hydrologic community e g project for intercomparison of land surface parameterization schemes pilps chen et al 1997 luo et al 2003 distributed model intercomparison project dmip reed et al 2004 smith et al 2004 integrated hydrologic model intercomparison project ih mip maxwell et al 2014 and its successor ih mip2 kollet et al 2017 while in the earlier attempts different models have been assessed based on their structure euser et al 2015 hydrologic process representation e g baroni et al 2019 and numerical solution schemes e g dupont et al 2015 their intercomparison based on the decomposition of the spatial domain is rare to our knowledge hence this study is attempted to answer the research questions a what efficiency gains are achieved through the use of the simplified hillslope model versus the swat modflow model and b what is the appropriate level of decomposition to sufficiently address the catchment heterogeneity to address these research questions the typical hillslope grid based vpmm ehsb and hru grid based swat modflow coupled models were intercompared for simulating the sgi flux in a typical 24 km river reach of the brahmani river in eastern india with significant lateral flow contribution during the monsoon rainy season the vpmm ehsb model has been chosen for benchmarking against the swat modflow coupled model as the swat modflow is widely used by the surface and subsurface hydrologists some examples of recent applications are as follows the usa bailey et al 2016 europe molina navarro et al 2017 japan sith et al 2019 and canada chunn et al 2019 moreover the coupled swat modflow and the constituent swat and modflow are freely available along with their source codes for a large research community the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows a brief description on the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models are presented in section 2 section 3 details the study area sensitivity analysis is described in section 4 section 5 presents the performance evaluation of the model the obtained results are presented in section 6 following discussion in section 7 and section 8 concludes the study 2 methodology the typical models chosen for investigating the decomposition approaches are the hillslope based coupled vpmm ehsb sahoo and sahoo 2019 and hru based swat modflow park et al 2019 wherein the streamflow submodules are tightly coupled with the respective groundwater submodules for the one to one feedback between them at each simulation time step fig 1 illustrates the flow chart of the detailed methodology as followed in this study 2 1 vpmm ehsb modeling framework the vpmm ehsb model tightly couples the vpmm streamflow routing module with the enhanced hsb groundwater flow module to estimate the stream aquifer interaction in ungauged or scantily gauged catchments the coupling is bidirectional with the feedback between the streamflow and groundwater components the vpmm module estimates the surface runoff from the adjoining sub catchments which is added to each stream segment due to the continuous excess rainfall the ehsb module estimates the groundwater hydraulic head based on the hydraulic gradient available between the stream and aquifer at each computational time and space steps the sgi flux into the stream or aquifer is estimated incorporating the sgi flux at each computational grid finally the streamflow is routed to the stream outlet with the vpmm module the spatial data scarcity issue of non availability of detailed surveyed river cross sections at closer spatial intervals along the considered river stretch as encountered in many rivers worldwide is suitably accounted for in the vpmm module by considering only two end section data of the river reach to conceptualize an equivalent cross section similarly unlike the available distributed groundwater flow models the ehsb module requires the hydraulic conductivity in a single direction only both the constituent vpmm and ehsb modules are physically based in which the model parameters are derived from the flow and catchment properties the vpmm streamflow routing module accounting for the lateral flow contributions in a river reach due to continuous meteorological forcings is derived using the saint venant s continuity and momentum equations swain and sahoo 2015 swain et al 2018 similarly the original hsb troch et al 2003 groundwater routing module is derived as a simplification of the boussinesq and darcy equations which is enhanced by incorporating the land surface root zone and vadose zone dynamics in the original framework and renamed as the ehsb module sahoo et al 2018 fig 2 illustrates the conceptual flow domain considered by the vpmm ehsb coupled model wherein an unconfined aquifer receiving varied recharge fluxes from the overlying vadose zone is underlain by the impermeable strata bedrock the sw gw interaction occurs between the river and the very first layer of the mantle unconfined aquifer unless the stream is of enough depth to incise the underlying confined layer the unconfined aquifer interacts with the adjacent stream by discharging the baseflow into the stream or by the streamflow recharge flux into the aquifer in fig 2 it is conceptualized that all the fluxes in a 3d stream aquifer system occur along three directions in which x denotes the streamflow direction y denotes the lateral or transverse direction to the streamflow in which the subsurface fluxes along the hillslope take place and z is the vertical direction in which the recharge variation in the streamflow elevation considering the river bed level as the datum and fluctuation in groundwater level considering bedrock as datum take place 2 1 1 the vpmm streamflow module a given river reach may behave as both an influent and effluent stream simultaneously depending on the transient hydraulic gradient between the streamflow level and groundwater table incorporating the different inward and outward fluxes such as the lateral surface runoff qls x t and baseflow or riparian aquifer recharge qgw x t along the stream length the vpmm streamflow routing model can be extended as given by sahoo and sahoo 2019 considering insignificant momentum transfer by the lateral flows in the y direction as compared to the large quantity of streamflow in the x direction the developed vpmm streamflow routing module route the upstream concentrated transient flow and the spatiotemporally distributed lateral flows along the river reach which is generated due to continuous surface runoff from hillslope overland planes forced by rainfall and influent effluent groundwater flux similar to any hydrodynamic model corresponding to the routed flow this module estimates the streamflow depth at any river location using the known local cross section information the mass conservative vpmm module can be derived as a simplification form the full saint venant equations of continuity and momentum as 1 q s x a r t q ls q gw where qs unsteady streamflow estimated as a function of the in stream flow depth hsw and water profile gradient dhsw dx x distance along the river from the upstream boundary at which lateral flow from the hillslope overland flow transitions into streamflow ar cross section of the flow area qls lateral surface runoff contributed per unit channel length and qgw influent effluent groundwater flow contribution per unit channel length further using the manning s friction law the relationships among the unsteady and steady state streamflow hydrodynamic variables can be expressed as 2 s f s 0 1 2 q 0 q s v 0 v c 0 c where sf unsteady state energy slope s 0 river bed slope q 0 v 0 and c 0 are the steady state stream discharge velocity and celerity corresponding to their unsteady state values of qs v and c respectively since the contributed distributed lateral flows from the lateral surface runoff and groundwater get added with the main streamflow almost perpendicularly swain and sahoo 2015 yadav et al 2015 the momentum

sloping aquifers can be expressed as 13 q gw k s h gw h gw y cos α sin α where ks saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 hgw groundwater elevation above the bedrock l and α slope angle of the underlying impermeable layer bedrock similarly the continuity equation for groundwater flow can be written as 14 t f w h gw y w q gw n w where f effective porosity of aquifer material w y hillslope width function hwf l denoted by the hillslope width as a function of flow distance y from the stream network and n spatially uniform recharge rate over the study area lt 1 the boussinesq equation for

dimensional troch et al 2003 incorporating the recharge dynamics for spatially varied land use and land cover in terms of land surface processes during the rainy and non rainy periods with the soil and precipitation variability and the catchment geomorphology in terms of hillslope width function the boussinesq equation can be revised for data scarce catchments which is termed as the enhanced hillslope storage boussinesq model as sahoo et al 2018 17 f s gw y t t k s cos α f y s gw y t w y s gw y t y s gw y t w y w y y k s sin α s gw y t y f n e y t w y where ne effective rainfall recharge

width function hwf is determined from the probability distribution of flow distance from the streamlines bogaart et al 2006 that in turn is estimated from the terrain data of the digital elevation model dem sahoo and sahoo 2018 similarly the sparsely available well logs in the study area can be referred to obtain the position and slope of the bedrock although some uncertainty is involved in determining the accurate position of the bedrock this uncertainty is similar to defining the initial condition of the water table before groundwater modelling in such cases when spatially distributed information on the catchment state variables is unavailable or sparsely available model spin up is preferred over the initial guess ajami et al 2014 spin up is the process to minimize the artificial drift to model the state or prognostic variables by bringing the model to equilibrium through running the model repeatedly using a single year forcing cosgrove et al 2003 hence any uncertainty in the simulations due to the sensitivity of defining the bedrock could be addressed effectively by model spin up as carried out in this study to compute the groundwater stage hydrograph hgw y t at a distance y from the stream outlet eq 17 can be spatiotemporally discretized using the finite difference scheme to solve by the multistep ordinary differential equation ode solver the subsurface flux qgw 0 t is discharged from the adjoining catchment area to the outlet of the headwater hillslope whereas from the side slopes it gets added to the streamflow along the entire length that is further spatially distributed as described in section 2 1 3 at the hillslope scale there is negligible travel time from when the groundwater enters the stream until it reaches the hillslope outlet qgw 0 t can be estimated as the rate of change of subsurface storage sgw y t as 20 q gw y 0 t y 0 w y n e y t w y d y d d t y 0 w y f w y h gw y t d y 2 1 3 estimation of distributed lateral surface runoff and

respectively and β and γ are the fitting parameters it can be sufficiently assumed that the amplitude distribution of lateral surface runoff hydrographs contributed along any ungauged river reach is directly proportional to that of the inflow hydrograph o donnell 1985 this generated lateral flow volume is generally non uniform along the river reach due to the variation of the normalized adjoining catchment area from the upstream end p a x a cl x a c 0 to the downstream end where acl x is the variable contributing area along the m th sub reach each of length δx the total lateral flow volume generated from the adjoining hillslopes along this ungauged river reach during a storm event can be spatially distributed for each δx computational interval of the river using the normalized network

the river bed and ds regolith depth above the bedrock in the grid adjacent to the river network 2 1 5 vpmm ehsb model setup first the vpmm ehsb model was set up by decomposing the study catchment into a number of hillslope elements for this the streamlines were extracted from the processed srtm 30 m dem using a step by step method as sahoo and sahoo 2018 i estimation of d8 flow direction ii flow accumulation and iii determination of threshold area generating streamflow the threshold area mentioned herein is the minimum accumulated drainage area obtained by flow accumulation that determines the transition between the overland flow and channel flow this is very much important for streamline delineation and subsequent estimation of width function for the hillslope based framework the threshold area considered for the present study is 17 5 km2 subsequently the different hillslopes draining into the stream network were segregated to extract the hillslope width function at a typical grid size of 900 m 900 m the excess runoff was estimated using eq 21 to compute the distributed lateral surface runoff contribution by eq 23 to use it in the vpmm component module the distributed recharge flux ne y t in eq 17 was computed as a function of lulc which is the forcing component for the ehsb module the ehsb module estimates the saturated aquifer storage and baseflow contribution to stream network as the sgi component that was distributed spatially using eq 24 finally considering the hydraulic head difference in the stream and the aquifer the sw gw interaction flux was estimated by eq 25 which was then combined with the generated excess runoff to route up to the catchment outlet 2 2 swat modflow framework for studying sw gw interaction to study the sw gw interaction the most widely used model is the coupled swat modflow model that couples the hru based soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 for sw modeling with the grid based modular three dimensional finite difference groundwater flow modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 model for groundwater modeling within the framework of swat modflow the swat accounts for the land surface processes of surface runoff generation soil zone processes crop processes and in stream processes for overland flow generation conversely the modflow simulates the three dimensional groundwater flow and the sgi flux the hydrologic literature is replete with the efforts to couple the swat and modflow models for specific application purposes by different research groups conan et al 2003 kim et al 2008 sophocleous et al 1999 sophocleous and perkins 2000 out of these efforts qswatmod is a recent approach with the geographic information system gis based plugin developed by park et al 2019 that facilitates the coupling of the constituent models 2 2 1 swat hydrological module swat is a popular catchment scale semi distributed hydrologic model which can estimate runoff streamflow sediment and nutrient loads at daily time step incorporating the soil land use characteristics and land management practices if any the spatial heterogeneity is accounted for in this model by the limited lumping approach in which the entire river basin is divided into different sub basins further the sub basins are partitioned into hrus based on the topographical characteristics of slope aspect and pedological characteristics of soil and lulc hru the basic computational unit of swat is non geo located it lumps the geographically disconnected hydrological processes and makes swat computationally efficient however at the cost of spatial discretization therefore although the grid based modflow is fully distributed the structural uncertainty associated with the hru concept in the swat for runoff generation could affect the performance of the swat modflow coupling framework the hru scale water balance in swat is given by neitsch et al 2005 27 sw t sw 0 i 1 t p q sw et a r q rf i where swt final soil water content during

interface for sw gw interaction modeling qswatmod has the graphical user interface for a input data preparation b simulation and c result visualization in which the codes bailey et al 2017 are solved within the swat 2012 framework by the modflow nwt solver niswonger et al 2011 in qswatmod data pre processing involves i specifying different files of the stream networks sub basins and hrus either in the arcswat or qswat environment ii preparation of modflow database with the model setup files and grid shapefiles iii linking the grid based modflow river package with the hru based swat river network and iv linking the swat hrus with the modflow grid cells the simulation interface reads the information regarding the start and end of the simulation warm up period and time step similarly post processing involves the sub modules for exporting plotting and mapping the results the details regarding the interface and software can be found elsewhere in park et al 2019 the coupling of the individual models involves passing information between the swat hrus and modflow grid cells the hrus are not geographically explicit and thus are lumped conceptually not aligned with the measurable quantities in the field however bailey et al 2016 proposed the concept of disaggregated hrus dhrus to conserve the spatially explicit nature of hrus in gis environment the mapping subroutine performs this coupling task in this process each hru is converted into a designated polygon shapefile of dhru the dhru shapefile is overlapped with the modflow grid shapefile to locate the dhrus that are connected to a particular modflow grid the deep percolation estimated from each swat hru is mapped to the respective individual dhru and subsequently from dhru to modflow grid cell similarly channel information from each sub basin is mapped to the group of modflow river cells within the sub basin that is used by the modflow river package the spatial relationships of hrus dhrus dhrus modflow grids and swat sub basin modflow river cells are stored in the gis environment with this information modflow estimates the sgi flux as a feedback variable into swat the river cell specific groundwater discharge is summed up and added to the swat estimated runoff from each sub basin finally the contributed runoff into the main stream is routed downstream at each time step the steps being used during the simulation of the swat modflow at each time step are bailey et al 2016 1 read the input database for both swat and modflow 2 read the linking input information on modflow grid to dhru and vice versa and dhru to swat hru 3 simulate the hru or sub basin processes in swat 4 transfer the hru recharge variables to modflow 5 simulate groundwater and sw gw exchange process 6 transfer the sw gw flux to swat and 7 route the streamflow to sub basin outlet in swat for brevity more details about this are available in bailey et al 2016 2017 unlike the vpmm ehsb approach in the qswatmod the sub basins are delineated from the stream network for decomposing into unique hrus based on the soil lulc and terrain slope characteristics to estimate the surface runoff and deep percolation loss from each hru swat is run with the meteorological time series data the deep percolation flux thus simulated forms the recharge boundary to the modflow grid cells based on modflow simulated hydraulic heads and swat simulated streamflow water levels the sgi flux is simulated as the influent or effluent stream finally swat routes the summed up runoff and sgi flux to the basin outlet in this study the freely available modflow nwt code niswonger et al 2011 an inbuilt option of the model muse software harbaugh 2005 was used the forcings and boundary conditions were the recharge rch evapotranspiration evt and river network riv the chosen modflow grid size was 900 m 900 m to avoid dry cell problem the aquifer was divided into 12 layers prior to calibration the qswatmod model was run at steady state using 12 years of meteorological forcing for spin up 3 study area and database to verify the suitability of the hillslope based and hru based disaggregation approaches for estimating the sgi fluxes the concerned models were applied as a case study in the typical 48 km long bolani gomlai reach of the brahmani river in eastern india fig 5 with a contributing basin area of 2017 24 km2 this river reach is having significant lateral flow contribution from the adjoining catchment areas during the tropical monsoon rainy season the average bed slope of this reach is 0 0006 the 30 m srtm dem for the study area was downloaded from http earthexplorer usgs gov on analyzing the 35 years of 0 25 0 25 gridded precipitation data 1980 2015 obtained from the india meteorological department imd the average annual precipitation over the basin was computed to be 1460 mm year the daily meteorological data of minimum and maximum temperatures wind speed and solar radiation for the period 01 june 1986 to 31 may 1996 were collected from the climatology resource for agroclimatology nasa 2015 for estimating the evapotranspiration by the fao 24 radiation method doorenboos and pruitt 1977 the lulc map was prepared using the satellite imageries obtained from the national remote sensing centre nrsc indian space research organisation https www nrsc gov in similarly the available soil map from the food and agriculture organization fao through http www fao org was used herein the gauged data of daily river stage and discharge for the period 01 june 1986 to 31 may 1996 were procured from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar india the water table depth data and lithology information at five different locations in the basin were collected from the central ground water board cgwb bhubaneswar fig 5 illustrates the elevation map of the study area along with the soil and lulc map inputs the elevation of the study area varies from 62 to 1068 m above the mean sea level which is from the downstream alluvial formation to the drainage divide sandy clay loam and sandy loam soil classes are encountered in the study area the analysis of the lulc map of 1990 reveals that forest 53 55 agricultural land 19 04 fallow land 14 28 shrub land 12 75 and settlement 0 38 are the major land use classes in the study area 4 field application of vpmm ehsb and swat modflow coupled models prior to calibration both the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow were run for model spin up for 12 years until there is equilibrium in the model state the available five years jun 1986 may 1991 of daily streamflow time series and three monthly groundwater level data of four observation wells were used to calibrate the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models the objective functions were to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsc nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nscln q for simulation of the observed monsoon and non monsoon streamflow respectively at the downstream gomlai gauging station for surface water simulation and to minimize the root mean square error rmse for groundwater simulation subsequently the parameterized vpmm ehsb and swat modflow were used to validate the models ability in reproducing the observed streamflow time series of jun 1991 may 1996 the vpmm ehsb model was calibrated manually by fine tuning the parameters i e ks kriv f and n firstly sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most influential parameter subsequently parameters were fixed one at a time in the order of sensitivity to avoid over dependency on calibration unrealistic parameter combination and the problem of equifinality calibration was performed only within a possible typical range of values for a particular parameter for this soil core samples were collected from ten locations representing the possible combination of land use soil and lithology in the whole study area to estimate the range of soil porosity f the guelph permeameter reynolds and elrick 1985 and infiltration tests were carried out at these locations to determine the range of ks and infiltration characteristics similarly the value of the manning s roughness n was used based on a past study by swain and sahoo 2015 the ranges of parameters were decided referring to the literature swain and sahoo 2015 analyzing the aquifer formation data from the past modeling experience sahoo and sahoo 2019 and field exploration in the basin table 1 presents the sensitivity analysis and the manually calibrated parameters of the vpmm ehsb model before the calibration of the swat modflow model sensitivity analysis of model parameters was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi2 abbaspour et al 2015 that is built in with the clue software based on the past studies in the same and adjacent basins with identical hydro climatology e g uniyal et al 2015 a total of 20 parameters were chosen for sensitivity analysis the most sensitive eight parameters were selected for calibration e g khalid et al 2016 as detailed in table 1 according to their ranks note that the inclusion of more parameters for calibration might result in unrealistic parameter combination with the problem of equifinality this would cause over dependency of the model performance on parameterization rather than the true representation of the hydrologic process components thereafter automatic calibration was carried out using the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2012 swat simulates the groundwater by a relatively simple representation of shallow and deep aquifers based on the linear reservoir concept the groundwater module in swat can estimate the baseflow contribution of the aquifer to streamflow however in the coupled swat modflow the groundwater head and the head dependent sgi flux is estimated by the modflow hence during calibration to avoid double counting of the groundwater discharge part the alpha bnk model parameter in the groundwater module of swat was set to zero this fully enables the moflow model to control the groundwater component after calibrating the surface flow parameters in swat the modflow parameters were adjusted to match the water table keeping the surface water parameters unchanged 5 model performance evaluation for performance evaluation four statistical metrics were chosen as i nsc for high and medium flows or nsc lnq for low flows ii modified kling and gupta efficiency metric kgem kling et al 2012 and iii rmse 30a nsc 1 j 1 t max hv j o hv j m 2 j 1 t max hv j o hv o 2 kgem 1 r 1 2 φ 1 2 ω 1 2 30b where j computational time step tmax maximum

2012 for evaluating the low flow simulation performance by both the vpmm ehsb and qswatmod the logarithmic transformation of flow was performed to obtain the nsc lnq 6 results 6 1 model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation table 1 shows the sensitivity ranks and the calibrated parameters of the swat modflow and vpmm ehsb models among the swat parameters the cn2 mgt curve number for the antecedent soil moisture condition amc ii was found to be the most sensitive followed by the manning s n for the main channel ch n2 and overland flow ov n the cn2 sol awc and esco parameters are responsible for the accuracy of the peak flow estimation moreover the time of arrival of the peak flow is controlled by the ov n and slusubbsn parameters accounting for the overland flow velocity and average slope length respectively similarly for the vpmm ehsb ks was obtained as the most sensitive parameter followed by n kriv and f during calibration the vpmm ehsb with the hillslope based discretization reproduced the observed discharge at the gomlai station with the nsc estimate of 0 72 whereas the qswatmod with the hru based discretization reproduced with the nsc estimate of 0 63 it can be envisaged from fig 6 that almost all the peaks of the streamflow hydrograph were simulated with reasonable accuracy by both the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow approaches except in a few extreme flooding events during the monsoon period of 1987 from the validation results fig 6 it is seen that as compared to the vpmm ehsb the observed streamflow peaks were mostly over predicted by the swat modflow with the nsc estimates of 0 65 and 0 58 for the former and latter approaches respectively to test the model s ability in producing the high and low flows the annual streamflow time series was divided into tropical monsoon or high flow period june october and non monsoon or low flow period november may note that during the lean period there is insignificant rainfall contribution and the baseflow in the river is primarily fed by groundwater as detailed in table 2 vpmm ehsb reproduced the non monsoon flow with the nsc estimates of 0 65 and 0 57 during calibration and validation respectively whereas the corresponding nsc estimates for swat modflow were 0 47 and 0 46 respectively hence vpmm ehsb estimated the lean season low flow by about 38 and 24 better than that of swat modflow during calibration and validation respectively based on table 2 generally the order of the performances obtained in simulating the streamflow time series varied as annual monsoon non monsoon period fig 7 shows the reproduced three monthly depth to water table below ground level bgl at four observation well locations w2 w3 w4 and w5 during the calibration and validation of both the models the simulated water table followed the seasonality pattern of groundwater level for both the models however the swat modflow overestimated the observed monsoon water table on most occasions this could be due to the direct transfer of recharge between the dhrus and water table without consideration of the vadose zone as a result the recharge is overestimated that otherwise could have increased the vadose zone storage hence it can be seen from fig 7 that the vpmm ehsb could simulate this seasonality better than that of the swat modflow this can be confirmed from the rmse values reported for water table simulation see text inside fig 7 the rmse estimates for the vpmm ehsb were in the range 0 73 1 03 m whereas for the swat modflow the range was 1 31 2 28 m as frequency analysis of streamflow is critical in the assessment and management of floods and hydrological droughts the capability of both the hillslope and hru based approaches in reproducing the observed flow duration curve fdc in different quantile domains was tested as illustrated in fig 8 for this the entire streamflow range was divided into three regimes a low q q 90 b medium q 90 q q 10 and c high q q 10 although during calibration both the models performed almost similarly in reproducing the q 10 and q 50 flow regimes the hillslope based vpmm ehsb reproduced the fdc better during both calibration and validation moreover the performance of the vpmm ehsb was superior in reproducing the low flows in the bottom 10 quantile of the fdc during both the calibration and validation periods as it accounts for the baseflow generation process in its model framework 6 2 comparative assessment of sw gw interaction flux the simulated sgi flux time series by both the models for the study period is illustrated in fig 9 a the positive value of sgi flux in fig 9a indicates groundwater discharge to the stream depicting a case of influent or gaining stream and a negative sgi flux indicates a case of effluent or losing stream as shown in fig 9a the river contributed to groundwater recharge during the monsoon and early non monsoon seasons that is gradually released during the late non monsoon period sustaining the perennial streamflow the magnitude of sgi flux simulated by the swat modflow was usually higher than that of the vpmm ehsb approach during most of the seasons this may be attributed to the vadose zone process description in the vpmm ehsb model framework in storing soil moisture attenuating and delaying the groundwater recharge which is absent in swat modflow framework ochoa et al 2020 further unlike to the general case of an influent stream during the monsoon period and effluent stream during the non monsoon period the considered vpmm ehsb river reach behaves simultaneously as both the influent and effluent types based on the transient hydraulic gradient between the water table and stream stage during continuous rainfall events for example the cumulative seasonal sgi flux was positive and negative during the post monsoon seasons of 1994 1995 and 1995 1996 respectively fig 9b 7 discussion 7 1 identifying the appropriate catchment decomposition technique hillslope vs hru based modeling fig 10 compares the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models for their efficiency in reproducing the annual monsoon and non monsoon streamflow time series as illustrated in the radar plot fig 10 the large spread areas of the efficiency metrics i e kgem nsc nsc lnq φ and ω in case of the vpmm ehsb model indicate better performance than that of the swat modlfow in simulating the annual monsoon and non monsoon streamflow time series during validation note that the maximum axis value was set to 1 2 as per the range of φ and ω although the maximum range of kgem nsc and nsc lnq is one the comparative analysis between the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models at their optimum level of catchment decomposition reveals that the former model performed better in reproducing the streamflow by 14 nsc than the latter model considering the annual hydrographs during the calibration period similarly during the non monsoon period the vpmm ehsb simulated the lean flows with the nsc estimate of 0 57 fig 10 which is 24 higher than that of the swat modflow during the validation period this answers the first research question the variation in the performance of the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow can be attributed to their inherent approaches in partitioning the model space into drainage zones and the streamflow routing approach because of its catchment decomposition scheme the vpmm ehsb solves the flow problems by dividing the entire hydrological processes into hillslope and channel processes by default note that the ehsb module uses the concept of representative hillslopes e g ajami et al 2016 hazenberg et al 2015 in which after the extraction of drainage network in the basin hillslopes are delineated as the area connecting the stream network to the basin each delineated hillslope is assumed to be constituted by multiple soil columns of variable width and elevation fan et al 2019 and the recharge flux is transmitted from higher elevation to lower elevation soil column to feed the stream network by the lowest soil column only however the hru based swat framework lacks such a type of discretization scheme an hru lumps the specific soil lulc and management classes into a homogeneous area unit to ease computation yet to incorporate heterogeneity within the sub basin arnold et al 2012 moreover unlike the hillslopes no hydrological process interaction takes place within and among the hrus according to melsen et al 2016 the considered study area 2000 km2 can be categorized under the scale of a catchment to the river basin at this spatial scale the dominant hydrologic processes are the baseflow soil drainage groundwater and river storm drainage that includes infiltration and saturation excess overland flow blöschl and sivapalan 1995 moreover the hillslope aquifers are characterized by the presence of rugged bedrock and shallow perched water table that undergoes frequent alternate wetting and drying of groundwater as compared to the large scale aquifers cordano and rigon 2013 this hillslope hydrology is well addressed by the vpmm ehsb framework conversely in the hru based swat modflow although the infiltration excess runoff is simulated with reasonable accuracy modeling of the alternate wetting and drying phenomenon by the modflow module requires finer vertical discretization to avoid the dry cell problem that could further add to the computational demand doherty 2001 painter et al 2008 furthermore while simulating the peaks and low streamflow during the monsoon season the vpmm ehsb could simulate the time to peaks of streamflow accurately as its framework allows the linkage between the constituting hillslopes through the vpmm hydrodynamic streamflow routing module however in case of the swat modflow the runoff generated from different hrus inside a sub basin is simply summed up to produce the runoff at the sub basin outlet neglecting the flow routing phenomenon this enhanced performance of the hillslope based approach can be attributed to accounting for floodplain flows by the vpmm module since in the mid and low river reaches of a large river system the floodplain infiltration and exfiltration processes form a major part of the sw gw interaction the floodplain storage dampens the peak flood with reduced celerity and sustains the lean season flow by gradually releasing the aquifer storage miguez macho and fan 2012 moreover the sgi flux simulated by the vpmm ehsb model was mostly in accordance with the precipitation pattern and observed lean season flow that may be attributed to the use of inherent flow stratification consideration of floodplain dynamics and hill to valley water delivery concept in this model although the sgi process takes place along the exchange face or in the hyporheic zone it can control the hydrologic processes far away barthel and banzhaf 2016 for example a convergent hillslope drains at a much slower rate than a divergent hillslope of same width troch et al 2003 due to the converging flowlines near the discharge location in the former case this can influence the aquifer storage uphill as the effect of sgi process is not restricted to the immediate neighborhood of the exchange face this feedback control needs to be addressed at continuous time scale in the modeling frameworks this feedback response could be passed uphill in the hillslope discretization scheme through the valley to ridge connectivity approach however as the hrus and dhrus are scattered throughout the sub basin this feedback control makes it a one way process 7 2 identifying the optimum level of catchment decomposition to understand the effect of the choice of appropriate catchment decomposition method on modeling efficiency both the calibrated setup of hillslope based vpmm ehsb and hru based swat modflow models were intercompared in reproducing the streamflow and groundwater table at different decomposition levels for the vpmm ehsb model the degree of decomposition was varied in the range of 5 33 number of hillslope units to reproduce the observed streamflow at the gomlai gauging station outlet of the selected catchment similarly in the swat modflow model the number of generated hrus was varied from 25 105 fig 11 shows the effect of catchment decomposition levels on the efficiency of the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow in simulating the streamflow at the gomlai station it can be evidenced from fig 11 that in both the models the modelling efficiency steadily increased with the increase in the catchment decomposition level up to 25 hillslopes and 87 hrus for both the hillslope and hru based approaches respectively however beyond these threshold levels of decomposition the improvement in the modeling efficiency nsc was insignificant in case of the vpmm ehsb this characteristic could be attributed to the fact that on partitioning the catchment into a number of constituent hillslopes a threshold has reached after which the topographic features of lulc and soil and the geologic parameters do not vary significantly among the decomposed hillslopes in such a scenario multiple hillslopes would have the same model parameters thereby increasing the computational burden without any enhanced efficiency in case of the swat modflow approach the enhanced model performance with the increase in the hru based decomposition level may be attributed to better inclusion of spatial variability in the topographic parameters of the modeling framework up to the threshold level of 87 beyond which many hrus were geo hydrologically similar with uniform model parameters this partially answers the second research question on the appropriate level of decomposition to sufficiently address the catchment heterogeneity 7 3 impact of decomposition method on computational requirement apart from the modeling efficiency and data requirement the next desirable criterion for choosing a model could be its computational requirement fig 12 depicts the variation of model efficiency and simulation time concerning the chosen grid size as illustrated in fig 12 for both the models an increase in spatial grid size resulted in reduced efficiency and simulation time the rate of decline in efficiency was low until about 900 m grid size and high thereafter thus a grid size of 900 m could be effective for the study area at this optimum level of decomposition 900 m the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models consumed 45 min and 128 min for simulating eight years of streamflow time series using a 4 gb ram and 3 2 ghz cpu respectively although both the models are semi distributed in nature the reduced computational demand by the hillslope based model with better performance than the hru based approach proved the possibility of the former model for its future use in the esms clark et al 2015 this in turn could solve the high computational demand of the existing esms for its use in the global climate and land cover change effect modeling it is worth mentioning here that in most of the esm land models e g variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable kowalczyk et al 2006 and noah chen et al 1996 the groundwater component is only represented by empirical approaches that lack physical basis moreover for minimizing the biases in river basin scale water balance closure there is a need to model the soil moisture and groundwater components by physically based approaches that could increase the computational burden further in light of the above mentioned requirement of esms the coupled physically based vpmm ehsb approach is capable of simulating the hillslope aquifer storage discharge sgi flux and vadose zone soil moisture in a better way however for brevity the soil moisture results are not shown here moreover vpmm ehsb requires fewer numbers of parameters than that of swat modflow unlike swat modflow the geo hydraulic parameters of vpmm ehsb are required in single direction only as the information on directional property of geo hydraulic parameters is difficult to obtain and seldom available the vpmm ehsb approach could be more suitable for modeling the sgi flux in poorly characterized catchments in both approaches the chosen horizontal grid size of 900 m is useful for incorporating the required level of spatial heterogeneity without compromising the modeling efficiency increasing the grid size further would not make the distinction possible between different lulc classes as the built up lands are sparsely located in small patches in the study area see fig 5 considering the heterogeneity encountered at the catchment scale increasing the modflow grid size to compromise with the computational requirement could invite scale issues wherein the small scale processes are neglected that contribute to large or catchment scale hydrological response this answers the second research question fully on the appropriate level of catchment decomposition 8 conclusions this study gives an insight into the appropriate catchment decomposition method by comparing two typical models conceptualized based on different decomposition approaches i e the vpmm ehsb model based on hillslopes and the swat modflow based on hrus for both these approaches the considered study area was partitioned into constituent building blocks of 5 33 hillslopes and 25 105 hrus for appropriately incorporating the catchment heterogeneity based on the obtained results the following conclusions are drawn i the hillslope based vpmm ehsb model performed better than that of the swat modflow in predicting the average annual streamflow furthermore vpmm ehsb outperformed the latter model by 24 in terms of nsc in predicting the low streamflow ii for the considered study area to incorporate the desired level of heterogeneity 25 hillslopes and 87 hrus are the optimum level of decomposition for the hillslope and hru based approaches respectively iii the simulation time of the vpmm ehsb is almost 60 less as compared to the swat modflow this showcases the potential scope of including hillslope hydrology in the esm land models for modeling the groundwater storage discharge and sgi dynamics iv the study results reveal that hillslope based decomposition of river basin could be more appropriate than the hru based approach as the former approach accounts for catchment geomorphology and all the hydrological processes of runoff soil moisture vadose zone percolation and baseflow that evolve at the hillslope scale

5120,to quantify the surface water groundwater sw gw exchange flux in a river basin the inclusion of sw gw interaction sgi process in the next generation earth system models is of growing concern among the hydrologic community that requires a trade off among model complexity linking streamflow and groundwater flow domains spatial heterogeneity and computational demand although semi distributed sgi models seem to be a plausible solution the question is what could be the effective way to decompose a river basin to assess the sub surface flux therefore this study intends to search for a better alternative approach for catchment decomposition between the hillslope and hydrologic response unit hru based sgi models the inherent relationship between the decomposition level and model efficiency and the appropriate spatial scale of decomposition for hillslopes and hrus the typical hydrological models chosen for this study are the hillslope based coupled variable parameter mccarthy muskingum enhanced hillslope storage boussinesq vpmm ehsb and the hru based coupled soil and water assessment tool modular three dimensional groundwater flow swat modflow these semi distributed models are field tested to model the streamflow accounting for lateral contributions along the river reach baseflow depth to water table and the sgi flux the results reveal that the vpmm ehsb model with hillslope grid based decomposition outperformed the swat modflow with the hru grid based hybrid decomposition in explaining the variance of the entire annual and low non monsoon streamflow time series by 12 and 25 respectively the vpmm ehsb approach has a faster 36 simulation time than that of the swat modflow showing the potential of the hillslope decomposition approach in the vpmm ehsb model over the hru

parameter mccarthy muskingum vpmm enhanced hillslope storage boussinesq ehsb model vpmm ehsb sahoo and sahoo 2019 for modelling the sgi using any distributed or semi distributed model the first step is to discretize or decompose the basin into several constituting units in which the catchment topography and meteorological variables can be effectively assumed to be uniform the different techniques available for discretizing a river basin can be broadly classified into three classes spatial grid cell representative hillslope and sub watershed arnold et al 2012 the grid cell based sgi models may be treated as fully distributed e g kollet and maxwell 2008a 2008b maxwell et al 2015 whereas the hillslope based e g fan and bras 1998 troch et al 2003 matonse and kroll 2009 and sub watershed based models e g swat arnold et al 1998 are semi distributed in nature further according to the resolution complexity continuum such hydrologic models may be broadly classified into two classes hrachowitz and clark 2017 i distributed and physically based with increased complexity e g kollet and maxwell 2008a 2008b maxwell et al 2015 and ii lumped and usually conceptual e g garavaglia et al 2017 son and sivapalan 2007 willems 2014 however as all the models are simplifications to mimic the natural systems closely gupta et al 2012 there exist competing modelling philosophies in the hydrologic community hrachowitz and clark 2017 regarding the simple lumped models e g sivapalan et al 2003b and complex physically based models clark et al 2015 2017 each having their pros and cons however the effort to apply a more complex model is far greater than simplified models alternatively to compromise the computational demand in the sgi modeling approach increasing spatial grid size could result in aggregating the different landuse and soil classes into one class thus losing the spatial heterogeneity affecting the modelling accuracy conversely although the conceptual hydrologic models can be applied to any spatial scale to answer how much answering why is not always possible similarly lack of detailed field geo hydro meteorological observations in ungauged river basins limits the parameterization of lumped conceptual models for their wide scale application hrachowitz et al 2013 littlewood et al 2003 sivapalan et al 2003a hence for estimating the sgi flux in a river basin with the mixed scenarios of insufficient field data availability and computational burden for large river basins there is a need to develop physically based semi distributed models that accounts for the micro scale hydrological process details and macro or mesoscale computational feasibility therefore the alternate methods of spatial discretization of a river basin could be the representative hillslope or the sub basin the primary motivation of this study is to assess which of these two approaches of spatial discretization would be better suited for integration of the sgi dynamics in the esms for capturing the sgi dynamics the right level of discretization complexity could be determined by comparing any representative hillslope model with the hru based model among the different sgi models the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow are such typical coupled models that are semi distributed yet capable of handling the spatially distributed geo hydrometeorological variables through the hillslope and subwatershed based discretizations respectively in the swat modelling framework for estimating streamflow the subwatersheds are further discretized into the hydrologic response units hrus accounting for the land use soil and slope types encountered in the subwatershed swat is also popularly used for modelling the basin scale sediment and nutrient transports and land use and climate change impacts on streamflow krysanova and white 2015 dash et al 2020 swain et al 2020 similarly the grid based modflow is a widely used model by the hydrogeologists worldwide to model the groundwater flow that needs detailed grid scale information of soil type litholog aquifer depth aquifer hydraulic properties source or sinks and hydrometeorological variables some parameters in modflow such as the hydraulic conductivity can be determined by inverse modelling brunner et al 2017 however the field measured parameters still have uncertainty that affects the inverse modelling brunner et al 2012 therefore the application of both the standalone swat and modflow models and the coupled swat modflow version are preferred for data sufficient river basins in the literature conversely the recently developed process based yet simplified vpmm ehsb sgi model can be applied in ungauged or semi gauged basins sahoo and sahoo 2019 as both of its sub modules require lesser field datasets the vpmm ehsb requires only the cross sectional details at the two end sections of the river reach of interest rather than the detailed cross sections of the river network soil hydraulic conductivity of the river bed in the vertical direction only and unidirectional aquifer hydraulic properties i e saturated hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity recently there has been a growing interest among the hydrologic community towards hillslope based modelling e g clark et al 2017 fan et al 2019 as at this scale almost all the hydrological processes of water sediment and nutrient transports are completed fan et al 2019 now question is that for modelling the sgi flux under limited data availability conditions with better computational feasibility what could be the best catchment decomposition approach representative hillslopes or hrus till recently several model inter comparison projects are undertaken by the hydrologic community e g project for intercomparison of land surface parameterization schemes pilps chen et al 1997 luo et al 2003 distributed model intercomparison project dmip reed et al 2004 smith et al 2004 integrated hydrologic model intercomparison project ih mip maxwell et al 2014 and its successor ih mip2 kollet et al 2017 while in the earlier attempts different models have been assessed based on their structure euser et al 2015 hydrologic process representation e g baroni et al 2019 and numerical solution schemes e g dupont et al 2015 their intercomparison based on the decomposition of the spatial domain is rare to our knowledge hence this study is attempted to answer the research questions a what efficiency gains are achieved through the use of the simplified hillslope model versus the swat modflow model and b what is the appropriate level of decomposition to sufficiently address the catchment heterogeneity to address these research questions the typical hillslope grid based vpmm ehsb and hru grid based swat modflow coupled models were intercompared for simulating the sgi flux in a typical 24 km river reach of the brahmani river in eastern india with significant lateral flow contribution during the monsoon rainy season the vpmm ehsb model has been chosen for benchmarking against the swat modflow coupled model as the swat modflow is widely used by the surface and subsurface hydrologists some examples of recent applications are as follows the usa bailey et al 2016 europe molina navarro et al 2017 japan sith et al 2019 and canada chunn et al 2019 moreover the coupled swat modflow and the constituent swat and modflow are freely available along with their source codes for a large research community the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows a brief description on the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models are presented in section 2 section 3 details the study area sensitivity analysis is described in section 4 section 5 presents the performance evaluation of the model the obtained results are presented in section 6 following discussion in section 7 and section 8 concludes the study 2 methodology the typical models chosen for investigating the decomposition approaches are the hillslope based coupled vpmm ehsb sahoo and sahoo 2019 and hru based swat modflow park et al 2019 wherein the streamflow submodules are tightly coupled with the respective groundwater submodules for the one to one feedback between them at each simulation time step fig 1 illustrates the flow chart of the detailed methodology as followed in this study 2 1 vpmm ehsb modeling framework the vpmm ehsb model tightly couples the vpmm streamflow routing module with the enhanced hsb groundwater flow module to estimate the stream aquifer interaction in ungauged or scantily gauged catchments the coupling is bidirectional with the feedback between the streamflow and groundwater components the vpmm module estimates the surface runoff from the adjoining sub catchments which is added to each stream segment due to the continuous excess rainfall the ehsb module estimates the groundwater hydraulic head based on the hydraulic gradient available between the stream and aquifer at each computational time and space steps the sgi flux into the stream or aquifer is estimated incorporating the sgi flux at each computational grid finally the streamflow is routed to the stream outlet with the vpmm module the spatial data scarcity issue of non availability of detailed surveyed river cross sections at closer spatial intervals along the considered river stretch as encountered in many rivers worldwide is suitably accounted for in the vpmm module by considering only two end section data of the river reach to conceptualize an equivalent cross section similarly unlike the available distributed groundwater flow models the ehsb module requires the hydraulic conductivity in a single direction only both the constituent vpmm and ehsb modules are physically based in which the model parameters are derived from the flow and catchment properties the vpmm streamflow routing module accounting for the lateral flow contributions in a river reach due to continuous meteorological forcings is derived using the saint venant s continuity and momentum equations swain and sahoo 2015 swain et al 2018 similarly the original hsb troch et al 2003 groundwater routing module is derived as a simplification of the boussinesq and darcy equations which is enhanced by incorporating the land surface root zone and vadose zone dynamics in the original framework and renamed as the ehsb module sahoo et al 2018 fig 2 illustrates the conceptual flow domain considered by the vpmm ehsb coupled model wherein an unconfined aquifer receiving varied recharge fluxes from the overlying vadose zone is underlain by the impermeable strata bedrock the sw gw interaction occurs between the river and the very first layer of the mantle unconfined aquifer unless the stream is of enough depth to incise the underlying confined layer the unconfined aquifer interacts with the adjacent stream by discharging the baseflow into the stream or by the streamflow recharge flux into the aquifer in fig 2 it is conceptualized that all the fluxes in a 3d stream aquifer system occur along three directions in which x denotes the streamflow direction y denotes the lateral or transverse direction to the streamflow in which the subsurface fluxes along the hillslope take place and z is the vertical direction in which the recharge variation in the streamflow elevation considering the river bed level as the datum and fluctuation in groundwater level considering bedrock as datum take place 2 1 1 the vpmm streamflow module a given river reach may behave as both an influent and effluent stream simultaneously depending on the transient hydraulic gradient between the streamflow level and groundwater table incorporating the different inward and outward fluxes such as the lateral surface runoff qls x t and baseflow or riparian aquifer recharge qgw x t along the stream length the vpmm streamflow routing model can be extended as given by sahoo and sahoo 2019 considering insignificant momentum transfer by the lateral flows in the y direction as compared to the large quantity of streamflow in the x direction the developed vpmm streamflow routing module route the upstream concentrated transient flow and the spatiotemporally distributed lateral flows along the river reach which is generated due to continuous surface runoff from hillslope overland planes forced by rainfall and influent effluent groundwater flux similar to any hydrodynamic model corresponding to the routed flow this module estimates the streamflow depth at any river location using the known local cross section information the mass conservative vpmm module can be derived as a simplification form the full saint venant equations of continuity and momentum as 1 q s x a r t q ls q gw where qs unsteady streamflow estimated as a function of the in stream flow depth hsw and water profile gradient dhsw dx x distance along the river from the upstream boundary at which lateral flow from the hillslope overland flow transitions into streamflow ar cross section of the flow area qls lateral surface runoff contributed per unit channel length and qgw influent effluent groundwater flow contribution per unit channel length further using the manning s friction law the relationships among the unsteady and steady state streamflow hydrodynamic variables can be expressed as 2 s f s 0 1 2 q 0 q s v 0 v c 0 c where sf unsteady state energy slope s 0 river bed slope q 0 v 0 and c 0 are the steady state stream discharge velocity and celerity corresponding to their unsteady state values of qs v and c respectively since the contributed distributed lateral flows from the lateral surface runoff and groundwater get added with the main streamflow almost perpendicularly swain and sahoo 2015 yadav et al 2015 the momentum

sloping aquifers can be expressed as 13 q gw k s h gw h gw y cos α sin α where ks saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 hgw groundwater elevation above the bedrock l and α slope angle of the

width function hwf l denoted by the hillslope width as a function of flow distance y from the stream network and n spatially uniform recharge rate over the study area lt 1 the boussinesq equation for

dimensional troch et al 2003 incorporating the recharge dynamics for spatially varied land use and land cover in terms of land surface processes during the rainy and non rainy periods with the soil and precipitation variability and the catchment geomorphology in terms of hillslope width function the boussinesq equation can be revised for data scarce catchments which is termed as the enhanced

width function hwf is determined from the probability distribution of flow distance from the streamlines bogaart et al 2006 that in turn is estimated from the terrain data of the digital elevation model dem sahoo and sahoo 2018 similarly the sparsely available well logs in the study area can be referred to obtain the position and slope of the bedrock although some uncertainty is involved in determining the accurate position of the bedrock this uncertainty is similar to defining the initial condition of the water table before groundwater modelling in such cases when spatially distributed information on the catchment state variables is unavailable or sparsely available model spin up is preferred over the initial guess ajami et al 2014 spin up is the process to minimize the artificial drift to model the state or prognostic variables by bringing the model to equilibrium through running the model repeatedly using a single year forcing cosgrove et al 2003 hence any uncertainty in the simulations due to the sensitivity of defining the bedrock could be addressed effectively by model spin up as carried out in this study to compute the groundwater stage hydrograph hgw y t at a distance y from the stream outlet eq 17 can be spatiotemporally discretized using the finite difference scheme to solve by the multistep ordinary differential equation ode solver the subsurface flux qgw 0 t is discharged from the adjoining catchment area to the outlet of the headwater hillslope whereas from the side slopes it gets added to the streamflow along the entire length that is further spatially distributed as described in section 2 1 3 at the hillslope scale there is negligible travel time from when the groundwater enters the stream until it reaches the hillslope outlet qgw 0 t can be estimated as the rate of change of subsurface storage sgw y t as 20 q gw y 0 t y 0 w y n e y t w y d y d d t y 0 w y f w y h gw y t d y 2 1 3 estimation of distributed lateral surface runoff and

respectively and β and γ are the fitting parameters it can be sufficiently assumed that the amplitude distribution of lateral surface runoff hydrographs contributed along any ungauged river reach is directly proportional to that of the inflow hydrograph o donnell 1985 this generated lateral flow volume is generally non uniform along the river reach due to the variation of the normalized adjoining catchment area from the upstream end p a x a cl x a c 0 to the downstream end where acl x is the variable contributing area along the m th sub reach each of length δx the total lateral flow volume

a number of hillslope elements for this the streamlines were extracted from the processed srtm 30 m dem using a step by step method as sahoo and sahoo 2018 i estimation of d8 flow direction ii flow accumulation and iii determination of threshold area generating streamflow the threshold area mentioned herein is the minimum accumulated drainage area obtained by flow accumulation that determines the transition between the overland flow and channel flow this is very much important for streamline delineation and subsequent estimation of width function for the hillslope based framework the threshold area considered for the present study is 17 5 km2 subsequently the different hillslopes draining into the stream network were segregated to extract the hillslope width function at a typical grid size of 900 m 900 m the excess runoff was estimated using eq 21 to compute the distributed lateral surface runoff contribution by eq 23 to use it in the vpmm component module the distributed recharge flux ne y t in eq 17 was computed as a function of lulc which is the forcing component for the ehsb module the ehsb module estimates the saturated aquifer storage and baseflow contribution to stream network as the sgi component that was distributed spatially using eq 24 finally considering the hydraulic head difference in the stream and the aquifer the sw gw interaction flux was estimated by eq 25 which was then combined with the generated excess runoff to route up to the catchment outlet 2 2 swat modflow framework for studying sw gw interaction to study the sw gw interaction the most widely used model is the coupled swat modflow model that couples the hru based soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 for sw modeling with the grid based modular three dimensional finite difference groundwater flow modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 model for groundwater modeling within the framework of swat modflow the swat accounts for the land surface processes of surface runoff generation soil zone processes crop processes and in stream processes for overland flow generation conversely the modflow simulates the three dimensional groundwater flow and the sgi flux the hydrologic literature is replete with the efforts to couple the swat and modflow models for specific application purposes by different research groups conan et al 2003 kim et al 2008 sophocleous et al 1999 sophocleous and perkins 2000 out of these efforts qswatmod is a recent approach with the geographic information system gis based plugin developed by park et al 2019 that facilitates the coupling of the constituent models 2 2 1 swat hydrological module swat is a popular catchment scale semi distributed hydrologic model which can estimate runoff streamflow sediment and nutrient loads at daily time step incorporating the soil land use characteristics and land management practices if any the spatial heterogeneity is accounted for in this model by the limited lumping approach in which the entire river basin is divided into different sub basins further the sub basins are partitioned into hrus based on the topographical characteristics of slope aspect and pedological characteristics of soil and lulc hru the basic computational unit of swat is non geo located it lumps the geographically disconnected hydrological processes and makes swat computationally efficient however at the cost of spatial discretization therefore although the grid based modflow is fully distributed the structural uncertainty associated with the hru concept in the swat for runoff generation could affect the performance of the swat modflow coupling framework the hru scale water balance in swat is given by neitsch et al 2005 27 sw t sw 0 i 1 t p q sw et a r q rf i where swt final soil water content during

modflow is a popular physically based distributed three dimensional groundwater flow model developed by the united states geological survey that solves the groundwater flow equation for water table in each grid cell accounting for the recharge source and pumping sink with the initial and boundary conditions and system parameters of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity specific yield

interface for sw gw interaction modeling qswatmod has the graphical user interface for a input data preparation b simulation and c result visualization in which the codes bailey et al 2017 are solved within the swat 2012 framework by the modflow nwt solver niswonger et al 2011 in qswatmod data pre processing involves i specifying different files of the stream networks sub basins and hrus either in the arcswat or qswat environment ii preparation of modflow database with the model setup files and grid shapefiles iii linking the grid based modflow river package with the hru based swat river network and iv linking the swat hrus with the modflow grid cells the simulation interface reads the information regarding the start and end of the simulation warm up period and time step similarly post processing involves the sub modules for exporting plotting and mapping the results the details regarding the interface and software can be found elsewhere in park et al 2019 the coupling of the individual models involves passing information between the swat hrus and modflow grid cells the hrus are not geographically explicit and thus are lumped conceptually not aligned with the measurable quantities in the field however bailey et al 2016 proposed the concept of disaggregated hrus dhrus to conserve the spatially explicit nature of hrus in gis environment the mapping subroutine performs this coupling task in this process each hru is converted into a designated polygon shapefile of dhru the dhru shapefile is overlapped with the modflow grid shapefile to locate the dhrus that are connected to a particular modflow grid the deep percolation estimated from each swat hru is mapped to the respective individual dhru and subsequently from dhru to modflow grid cell similarly channel information from each sub basin is mapped to the group of modflow river cells within the sub basin that is used by the modflow river package the spatial relationships of hrus dhrus dhrus modflow grids and swat sub basin modflow river cells are stored in the gis environment with this information modflow estimates the sgi flux as a feedback variable into swat the river cell specific groundwater discharge is summed up and added to the swat estimated runoff from each sub basin finally the contributed runoff into the main stream is routed downstream at each time step the steps being used during the simulation of the swat modflow at each time step are bailey et al 2016 1 read the input database for both swat and modflow 2 read the linking input information on modflow grid to dhru and vice versa and dhru to swat hru 3 simulate the hru or sub basin processes in swat 4 transfer the hru recharge variables to modflow 5 simulate groundwater and sw gw exchange process 6 transfer the sw gw flux to swat and 7 route the streamflow to sub basin outlet in swat for brevity more details about this are available in bailey et al 2016 2017 unlike the vpmm ehsb approach in the qswatmod the sub basins are delineated from the stream network for decomposing into unique hrus based on the soil lulc and terrain slope characteristics to estimate the surface runoff and deep percolation loss from each hru swat is run with the meteorological time series data the deep percolation flux thus simulated forms the recharge boundary to the modflow grid cells based on modflow simulated hydraulic heads and swat simulated streamflow water levels the sgi flux is simulated as the influent or effluent stream finally swat routes the summed up runoff and sgi flux to the basin outlet in this study the freely available modflow nwt code niswonger et al 2011 an inbuilt option of the model muse software harbaugh 2005 was used the forcings and boundary conditions were the recharge rch evapotranspiration evt and river network riv the chosen modflow grid size was 900 m 900 m to avoid dry cell problem the aquifer was divided into 12 layers prior to calibration the qswatmod model was run at steady state using 12 years of meteorological forcing for spin up 3 study area and database to verify the suitability of the hillslope based and hru based disaggregation approaches for estimating the sgi fluxes the concerned models were applied as a case study in the typical 48 km long bolani gomlai reach of the brahmani river in eastern india fig 5 with a contributing basin area of 2017 24 km2 this river reach is having significant lateral flow contribution from the adjoining catchment areas during the tropical monsoon rainy season the average bed slope of this reach is 0 0006 the 30 m srtm dem for the study area was downloaded from http earthexplorer usgs gov on analyzing the 35 years of 0 25 0 25 gridded precipitation data 1980 2015 obtained from the india meteorological department imd the average annual precipitation over the basin was computed to be 1460 mm year the daily meteorological data of minimum and maximum temperatures wind speed and solar radiation for the period 01 june 1986 to 31 may 1996 were collected from the climatology resource for agroclimatology nasa 2015 for estimating the evapotranspiration by the fao 24 radiation method doorenboos and pruitt 1977 the lulc map was prepared using the satellite imageries obtained from the national remote sensing centre nrsc indian space research organisation https www nrsc gov in similarly the available soil map from the food and agriculture organization fao through http www fao org was used herein the gauged data of daily river stage and discharge for the period 01 june 1986 to 31 may 1996 were procured from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar india the water table depth data and lithology information at five different locations in the basin were collected from the central ground water board cgwb bhubaneswar fig 5 illustrates the elevation map of the study area along with the soil and lulc map inputs the elevation of the study area varies from 62 to 1068 m above the mean sea level which is from the downstream alluvial formation to the drainage divide sandy clay loam and sandy loam soil classes are encountered in the study area the analysis of the lulc map of 1990 reveals that forest 53 55 agricultural land 19 04 fallow land 14 28 shrub land 12 75 and settlement 0 38 are the major land use classes in the study area 4 field application of vpmm ehsb and swat modflow coupled models prior to calibration both the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow were run for model spin up for 12 years until there is equilibrium in the model state the available five years jun 1986 may 1991 of daily streamflow time series and three monthly groundwater level data of four observation wells were used to calibrate the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models the objective functions were to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsc nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nscln q for simulation of the observed monsoon and non monsoon streamflow respectively at the downstream gomlai gauging station for surface water simulation and to minimize the root mean square error rmse for groundwater simulation subsequently the parameterized vpmm ehsb and swat modflow were used to validate the models ability in reproducing the observed streamflow time series of jun 1991 may 1996 the vpmm ehsb model was calibrated manually by fine tuning the parameters i e ks kriv f and n firstly sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most influential parameter subsequently parameters were fixed one at a time in the order of sensitivity to avoid over dependency on calibration unrealistic parameter combination and the problem of equifinality calibration was performed only within a possible typical range of values for a particular parameter for this soil core samples were collected from ten locations representing the possible combination of land use soil and lithology in the whole study area to estimate the range of soil porosity f the guelph permeameter reynolds and elrick 1985 and infiltration tests were carried out at these locations to determine the range of ks and infiltration characteristics similarly the value of the manning s roughness n was used based on a past study by swain and sahoo 2015 the ranges of parameters were decided referring to the literature swain and sahoo 2015 analyzing the aquifer formation data from the past modeling experience sahoo and sahoo 2019 and field exploration in the basin table 1 presents the sensitivity analysis and the manually calibrated parameters of the vpmm ehsb model before the calibration of the swat modflow model sensitivity analysis of model parameters was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi2 abbaspour et al 2015 that is built in with the clue software based on the past studies in the same and adjacent basins with identical hydro climatology e g uniyal et al 2015 a total of 20 parameters were chosen for sensitivity analysis the most sensitive eight parameters were selected for calibration e g khalid et al 2016 as detailed in table 1 according to their ranks note that the inclusion of more parameters for calibration might result in unrealistic parameter combination with the problem of equifinality this would cause over dependency of the model performance on parameterization rather than the true representation of the hydrologic process components thereafter automatic calibration was carried out using the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2012 swat simulates the groundwater by a relatively simple representation of shallow and deep aquifers based on the linear reservoir concept the groundwater module in swat can estimate the baseflow contribution of the aquifer to streamflow however in the coupled swat modflow the groundwater head and the head dependent sgi flux is estimated by the modflow hence during calibration to avoid double counting of the groundwater discharge part the alpha bnk model parameter in the groundwater module of swat was set to zero this fully enables the moflow model to control the groundwater component after calibrating the surface flow parameters in swat the modflow parameters were adjusted to match the water table keeping the surface water parameters unchanged 5 model performance evaluation for performance evaluation four statistical metrics were chosen as i nsc for high and medium flows or nsc lnq for low flows ii modified kling and gupta efficiency metric kgem kling et al 2012 and iii rmse 30a nsc 1 j 1 t max hv j o hv j m 2 j 1 t max hv j o hv o 2 kgem 1 r 1 2 φ 1 2 ω 1 2 30b where j computational time step tmax maximum

2012 for evaluating the low flow simulation performance by both the vpmm ehsb and qswatmod the logarithmic transformation of flow was performed to obtain the nsc lnq 6 results 6 1 model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation table 1 shows the sensitivity ranks and the calibrated parameters of the swat modflow and vpmm ehsb models among the swat parameters the cn2 mgt curve number for the antecedent soil moisture condition amc ii was found to be the most sensitive followed by the manning s n for the main channel ch n2 and overland flow ov n the cn2 sol awc and esco parameters are responsible for the accuracy of the peak flow estimation moreover the time of arrival of the peak flow is controlled by the ov n and slusubbsn parameters accounting for the overland flow velocity and average slope length respectively similarly for the vpmm ehsb ks was obtained as the most sensitive parameter followed by n kriv and f during calibration the vpmm ehsb with the hillslope based discretization reproduced the observed discharge at the gomlai station with the nsc estimate of 0 72 whereas the qswatmod with the hru based discretization reproduced with the nsc estimate of 0 63 it can be envisaged from fig 6 that almost all the peaks of the streamflow hydrograph were simulated with reasonable accuracy by both the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow approaches except in a few extreme flooding events during the monsoon period of 1987 from the validation results fig 6 it is seen that as compared to the vpmm ehsb the observed streamflow peaks were mostly over predicted by the swat modflow with the nsc estimates of 0 65 and 0 58 for the former and latter approaches respectively to test the model s ability in producing the high and low flows the annual streamflow time series was divided into tropical monsoon or high flow period june october and non monsoon or low flow period november may note that during the lean period there is insignificant rainfall contribution and the baseflow in the river is primarily fed by groundwater as detailed in table 2 vpmm ehsb reproduced the non monsoon flow with the nsc estimates of 0 65 and 0 57 during calibration and validation respectively whereas the corresponding nsc estimates for swat modflow were 0 47 and 0 46 respectively hence vpmm ehsb estimated the lean season low flow by about 38 and 24 better than that of swat modflow during calibration and validation respectively based on table 2 generally the order of the performances obtained in simulating the streamflow time series varied as annual monsoon non monsoon period fig 7 shows the reproduced three monthly depth to water table below ground level bgl at four observation well locations w2 w3 w4 and w5 during the calibration and validation of both the models the simulated water table followed the seasonality pattern of groundwater level for both the models however the swat modflow overestimated the observed monsoon water table on most occasions this could be due to the direct transfer of recharge between the dhrus and water table without consideration of the vadose zone as a result the recharge is overestimated that otherwise could have increased the vadose zone storage hence it can be seen from fig 7 that the vpmm ehsb could simulate this seasonality better than that of the swat modflow this can be confirmed from the rmse values reported for water table simulation see text inside fig 7 the rmse estimates for the vpmm ehsb were in the range 0 73 1 03 m whereas for the swat modflow the range was 1 31 2 28 m as frequency analysis of streamflow is critical in the assessment and management of floods and hydrological droughts the capability of both the hillslope and hru based approaches in reproducing the observed flow duration curve fdc in different quantile domains was tested as illustrated in fig 8 for this the entire streamflow range was divided into three regimes a low q q 90 b medium q 90 q q 10 and c high q q 10 although during calibration both the models performed almost similarly in reproducing the q 10 and q 50 flow regimes the hillslope based vpmm ehsb reproduced the fdc better during both calibration and validation moreover the performance of the vpmm ehsb was superior in reproducing the low flows in the bottom 10 quantile of the fdc during both the calibration and validation periods as it accounts for the baseflow generation process in its model framework 6 2 comparative assessment of sw gw interaction flux the simulated sgi flux time series by both the models for the study period is illustrated in fig 9 a the positive value of sgi flux in fig 9a indicates groundwater discharge to the stream depicting a case of influent or gaining stream and a negative sgi flux indicates a case of effluent or losing stream as shown in fig 9a the river contributed to groundwater recharge during the monsoon and early non monsoon seasons that is gradually released during the late non monsoon period sustaining the perennial streamflow the magnitude of sgi flux simulated by the swat modflow was usually higher than that of the vpmm ehsb approach during most of the seasons this may be attributed to the vadose zone process description in the vpmm ehsb model framework in storing soil moisture attenuating and delaying the groundwater recharge which is absent in swat modflow framework ochoa et al 2020 further unlike to the general case of an influent stream during the monsoon period and effluent stream during the non monsoon period the considered vpmm ehsb river reach behaves simultaneously as both the influent and effluent types based on the transient hydraulic gradient between the water table and stream stage during continuous rainfall events for example the cumulative seasonal sgi flux was positive and negative during the post monsoon seasons of 1994 1995 and 1995 1996 respectively fig 9b 7 discussion 7 1 identifying the appropriate catchment decomposition technique hillslope vs hru based modeling fig 10 compares the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models for their efficiency in reproducing the annual monsoon and non monsoon streamflow time series as illustrated in the radar plot fig 10 the large spread areas of the efficiency metrics i e kgem nsc nsc lnq φ and ω in case of the vpmm ehsb model indicate better performance than that of the swat modlfow in simulating the annual monsoon and non monsoon streamflow time series during validation note that the maximum axis value was set to 1 2 as per the range of φ and ω although the maximum range of kgem nsc and nsc lnq is one the comparative analysis between the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models at their optimum level of catchment decomposition reveals that the former model performed better in reproducing the streamflow by 14 nsc than the latter model considering the annual hydrographs during the calibration period similarly during the non monsoon period the vpmm ehsb simulated the lean flows with the nsc estimate of 0 57 fig 10 which is 24 higher than that of the swat modflow during the validation period this answers the first research question the variation in the performance of the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow can be attributed to their inherent approaches in partitioning the model space into drainage zones and the streamflow routing approach because of its catchment decomposition scheme the vpmm ehsb solves the flow problems by dividing the entire hydrological processes into hillslope and channel processes by default note that the ehsb module uses the concept of representative hillslopes e g ajami et al 2016 hazenberg et al 2015 in which after the extraction of drainage network in the basin hillslopes are delineated as the area connecting the stream network to the basin each delineated hillslope is assumed to be constituted by multiple soil columns of variable width and elevation fan et al 2019 and the recharge flux is transmitted from higher elevation to lower elevation soil column to feed the stream network by the lowest soil column only however the hru based swat framework lacks such a type of discretization scheme an hru lumps the specific soil lulc and management classes into a homogeneous area unit to ease computation yet to incorporate heterogeneity within the sub basin arnold et al 2012 moreover unlike the hillslopes no hydrological process interaction takes place within and among the hrus according to melsen et al 2016 the considered study area 2000 km2 can be categorized under the scale of a catchment to the river basin at this spatial scale the dominant hydrologic processes are the baseflow soil drainage groundwater and river storm drainage that includes infiltration and saturation excess overland flow blöschl and sivapalan 1995 moreover the hillslope aquifers are characterized by the presence of rugged bedrock and shallow perched water table that undergoes frequent alternate wetting and drying of groundwater as compared to the large scale aquifers cordano and rigon 2013 this hillslope hydrology is well addressed by the vpmm ehsb framework conversely in the hru based swat modflow although the infiltration excess runoff is simulated with reasonable accuracy modeling of the alternate wetting and drying phenomenon by the modflow module requires finer vertical discretization to avoid the dry cell problem that could further add to the computational demand doherty 2001 painter et al 2008 furthermore while simulating the peaks and low streamflow during the monsoon season the vpmm ehsb could simulate the time to peaks of streamflow accurately as its framework allows the linkage between the constituting hillslopes through the vpmm hydrodynamic streamflow routing module however in case of the swat modflow the runoff generated from different hrus inside a sub basin is simply summed up to produce the runoff at the sub basin outlet neglecting the flow routing phenomenon this enhanced performance of the hillslope based approach can be attributed to accounting for floodplain flows by the vpmm module since in the mid and low river reaches of a large river system the floodplain infiltration and exfiltration processes form a major part of the sw gw interaction the floodplain storage dampens the peak flood with reduced celerity and sustains the lean season flow by gradually releasing the aquifer storage miguez macho and fan 2012 moreover the sgi flux simulated by the vpmm ehsb model was mostly in accordance with the precipitation pattern and observed lean season flow that may be attributed to the use of inherent flow stratification consideration of floodplain dynamics and hill to valley water delivery concept in this model although the sgi process takes place along the exchange face or in the hyporheic zone it can control the hydrologic processes far away barthel and banzhaf 2016 for example a convergent hillslope drains at a much slower rate than a divergent hillslope of same width troch et al 2003 due to the converging flowlines near the discharge location in the former case this can influence the aquifer storage uphill as the effect of sgi process is not restricted to the immediate neighborhood of the exchange face this feedback control needs to be addressed at continuous time scale in the modeling frameworks this feedback response could be passed uphill in the hillslope discretization scheme through the valley to ridge connectivity approach however as the hrus and dhrus are scattered throughout the sub basin this feedback control makes it a one way process 7 2 identifying the optimum level of catchment decomposition to understand the effect of the choice of appropriate catchment decomposition method on modeling efficiency both the calibrated setup of hillslope based vpmm ehsb and hru based swat modflow models were intercompared in reproducing the streamflow and groundwater table at different decomposition levels for the vpmm ehsb model the degree of decomposition was varied in the range of 5 33 number of hillslope units to reproduce the observed streamflow at the gomlai gauging station outlet of the selected catchment similarly in the swat modflow model the number of generated hrus was varied from 25 105 fig 11 shows the effect of catchment decomposition levels on the efficiency of the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow in simulating the streamflow at the gomlai station it can be evidenced from fig 11 that in both the models the modelling efficiency steadily increased with the increase in the catchment decomposition level up to 25 hillslopes and 87 hrus for both the hillslope and hru based approaches respectively however beyond these threshold levels of decomposition the improvement in the modeling efficiency nsc was insignificant in case of the vpmm ehsb this characteristic could be attributed to the fact that on partitioning the catchment into a number of constituent hillslopes a threshold has reached after which the topographic features of lulc and soil and the geologic parameters do not vary significantly among the decomposed hillslopes in such a scenario multiple hillslopes would have the same model parameters thereby increasing the computational burden without any enhanced efficiency in case of the swat modflow approach the enhanced model performance with the increase in the hru based decomposition level may be attributed to better inclusion of spatial variability in the topographic parameters of the modeling framework up to the threshold level of 87 beyond which many hrus were geo hydrologically similar with uniform model parameters this partially answers the second research question on the appropriate level of decomposition to sufficiently address the catchment heterogeneity 7 3 impact of decomposition method on computational requirement apart from the modeling efficiency and data requirement the next desirable criterion for choosing a model could be its computational requirement fig 12 depicts the variation of model efficiency and simulation time concerning the chosen grid size as illustrated in fig 12 for both the models an increase in spatial grid size resulted in reduced efficiency and simulation time the rate of decline in efficiency was low until about 900 m grid size and high thereafter thus a grid size of 900 m could be effective for the study area at this optimum level of decomposition 900 m the vpmm ehsb and swat modflow models consumed 45 min and 128 min for simulating eight years of streamflow time series using a 4 gb ram and 3 2 ghz cpu respectively although both the models are semi distributed in nature the reduced computational demand by the hillslope based model with better performance than the hru based approach proved the possibility of the former model for its future use in the esms clark et al 2015 this in turn could solve the high computational demand of the existing esms for its use in the global climate and land cover change effect modeling it is worth mentioning here that in most of the esm land models e g variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable kowalczyk et al 2006 and noah chen et al 1996 the groundwater component is only represented by empirical approaches that lack physical basis moreover for minimizing the biases in river basin scale water balance closure there is a need to model the soil moisture and groundwater components by physically based approaches that could increase the computational burden further in light of the above mentioned requirement of esms the coupled physically based vpmm ehsb approach is capable of simulating the hillslope aquifer storage discharge sgi flux and vadose zone soil moisture in a better way however for brevity the soil moisture results are not shown here moreover vpmm ehsb requires fewer numbers of parameters than that of swat modflow unlike swat modflow the geo hydraulic parameters of vpmm ehsb are required in single direction only as the information on directional property of geo hydraulic parameters is difficult to obtain and seldom available the vpmm ehsb approach could be more suitable for modeling the sgi flux in poorly characterized catchments in both approaches the chosen horizontal grid size of 900 m is useful for incorporating the required level of spatial heterogeneity without compromising the modeling efficiency increasing the grid size further would not make the distinction possible between different lulc classes as the built up lands are sparsely located in small patches in the study area see fig 5 considering the heterogeneity encountered at the catchment scale increasing the modflow grid size to compromise with the computational requirement could invite scale issues wherein the small scale processes are neglected that contribute to large or catchment scale hydrological response this answers the second research question fully on the appropriate level of catchment decomposition 8 conclusions this study gives an insight into the appropriate catchment decomposition method by comparing two typical models conceptualized based on different decomposition approaches i e the vpmm ehsb model based on hillslopes and the swat modflow based on hrus for both these approaches the considered study area was partitioned into constituent building blocks of 5 33 hillslopes and 25 105 hrus for appropriately incorporating the catchment heterogeneity based on the obtained results the following conclusions are drawn i the hillslope based vpmm ehsb model performed better than that of the swat modflow in predicting the average annual streamflow furthermore vpmm ehsb outperformed the latter model by 24 in terms of nsc in predicting the low streamflow ii for the considered study area to incorporate the desired level of heterogeneity 25 hillslopes and 87 hrus are the optimum level of decomposition for the hillslope and hru based approaches respectively iii the simulation time of the vpmm ehsb is almost 60 less as compared to the swat modflow this showcases the potential scope of including hillslope hydrology in the esm land models for modeling the groundwater storage discharge and sgi dynamics iv the study results reveal that hillslope based decomposition of river basin could be more appropriate than the hru based approach as the former approach accounts for catchment geomorphology and all the hydrological processes of runoff soil moisture vadose zone percolation and baseflow that evolve at the hillslope scale

lofty himalayan mountains in the north obstructing the monsoonal winds this study provides new quantitative insights about various hydrometeorological processes across the indian subcontinent some of the important inferences drawn from this study are i the estimated evaporative losses from falling raindrops for the four stations are jammu maximum 52 and minimum 8 jorhat max 15 and min 4 ahmedabad min 8 and hyderabad max 29 and min 15 ii increased availability of surface waters due to flood in brahmaputra river and high value 88 of column averaged rh results in the lowest evaporative loss from falling raindrops at jorhat in northeast iii the high cloud liquid water content clwc over a longer span of altitude facilitates the interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapor and results in isotopically depleted rain iv the observed inverse relationship between the evaporative loss from falling raindrop and the column averaged rh confirms that the post condensation

region are well known while above synoptic 1000 km processes are well understood there are several other non synoptic mesoscale 100 km and microscale 1 5 km processes which are poorly understood some of such non synoptic processes are i strong updraft of saturated or under saturated air mass due to surface convergence and resultant local recycling of vapour ii advection of vapour and mixing with residual vapour mass iii evaporation from falling raindrop and interaction with surrounding vapour mass these processes are poorly understood particularly in terms of their periodicity of occurrence

vapour evaporation from falling raindrops and cloud microphysical processes breitenbach et al 2010 deshpande gupta 2012 deshpande et al 2013 jeelani et al 2017 lekshmy et al 2015 midhun et al 2018 oza et al 2020 rahul et al 2018 saranya et al 2018 unnikrishnan warrier praveen babu 2012 one of the major microscale processes which can be studied using stable isotopes is evaporation from falling raindrops gat dansgaard 1972 the evaporation from the falling raindrops is generally associated with enrichment in 18o and lower d excess liu et al 2008 also evaporative loss from falling raindrops is expected to reduce the slope of δ18o δd regression line dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 the major parameters affecting evaporation from falling raindrops are rain rate air temperature and relative humidity rh liu et al 2008 meng liu 2010 peng et al 2007 chen et al 2015 have estimated the rate of evaporation from falling raindrops to be 8 3 during summer jun sept and 4 5 during winter oct may in northwest china worden et al 2007 have shown that around 20 to 50 of raindrops evaporate near convective clouds and significantly increase the humidity in the lower troposphere which in turn may retard the extent of evaporation and alter the local rainfall amount and periodicity in a region like indian subcontinent with varied topographical and meteorological features and agrarian economy the change in land use and land cover can alter the local rh and temperature and can significantly affect the rain re evaporation and possibly the amount of rainfall itself thus estimating evaporation from falling raindrops in different climatic zones of the indian subcontinent is very important while there are a few studies which estimate evaporation from falling raindrops in different parts of the globe chen et al 2015 froehlich et al 2008 worden et al 2007 such an estimate for the indian subcontinent is not known where it is really important for hydrological budgeting with a view to bridge this knowledge gap daily precipitation samples n 556 were collected from four stations viz jammu jorhat ahmedabad and hyderabad located in four different climatic zones under the aegis of a national programme on isotope fingerprinting of waters of india iwin deshpande and gupta 2008 deshpande gupta 2012 meteorological parameters and isotopic composition of water vapour necessary for the estimation of evaporation from the falling raindrops were obtained respectively from various satellite based observations and modelled data results from rigorous analysis of these data is presented in the following 2 study area the indian subcontinent is a vast landmass located in the south asia comprising seven nations viz india pakistan bangladesh nepal sri lanka bhutan and maldives in order of descending land area it is surrounded by the two large marine water bodies in the south arabian sea and bay of bengal and the lofty himalayas in the north fig 1 the indian subcontinent can be classified into six different climatic zones montane humid subtropical tropical wet and dry tropical wet semi arid and arid based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns kottek et al 2006 there are four seasons viz pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october december and winter january february in the region attri tyagi 2010 the water availability in the indian subcontinent is strongly influenced by the ism indian summer monsoon variability gupta deshpande 2003 wang 2006 the daily rain samples have been collected from four stations namely jammu jorhat ahmedabad and hyderabad across india fig 1 details of each of these four stations are given in the following 2 1 jammu jammu 32 73 n 74 87 e 327 m asl located in the foothills of northwestern himalayas in india experiences humid subtropical climate during summer the maximum average temperature goes up to 39 during june and the lowest average temperature of 8 is recorded in january the average annual potential evapotranspiration pet in the region is 6 3 mm day with a maximum of 9 1 mm day in june and lowest value of 3 9 mm day in january www indiawaterportal org it is to be noted that the pet value of june is one of the highest compared to the other three stations this may cause significant evaporation both from surface water and falling raindrop the long term average annual temperature and precipitation of jammu are 23 7 and 1 332 mm respectively it receives precipitation both during the wd 288 mm and ism 970 mm a total of 75 daily rain samples were collected from jammu

directions except from the west fig 1 through which nor westers bring thunderstorms and rains ghosh et al 2008 in march may most of the rainfall 1403 mm at jorhat is received during ism followed by nor wester 657 mm and post monsoon 197 mm the pet in the region is 5 2 mm day max 6 mm day in may min 4 5 mm day in jan www indiawaterportal org which is one of the lowest annual pet compared to other three stations table 1 mighty brahmaputra river flows through this region and it often gets flooded during the monsoon period causing damage to life and economy there are a total of 588 wetlands spread in and around jorhat occupying about 46 000 ha many of which are fed by brahmaputra national wetland atlas assam 2010 in order to understand the integrated effect of above geographical and hydrometeorological factors jorhat was strategically chosen and a total of 257 daily rain samples were collected during 2010 and 2011 2 3 ahmedabad ahmedabad 23 03 n 72 58 e 53 m asl is located in the western indian state of gujarat it experiences hot semi arid climate with an average annual rainfall of 751 mm and average temperature ranging between 43 in peak summers and 13 in winters summers and winters are very dry as almost all the rainfall occur in about 30 days between jun sep ism ahmedabad is close to the arabian sea and gets most of its precipitation through the moisture derived from the arabian sea though a little contribution from bob in precipitation has also been reported deshpande et al 2015 midhun et al 2018 oza et al 2020 the pet in the region is 6 8 mm day max 8 8 mm day in may min 5 4 mm day in aug www indiawaterportal org which is one of the highest annual pet compared to other three stations table 1 in view of the hot and arid climate substantial evaporation from falling raindrops can be expected a total of 101 daily rainfall samples were collected from ahmedabad during two successive years of 2010 and 2011 2 4 hyderabad hyderabad 17 39 n 78 49 e alt 542 m asl

pet in the region is 6 6 mm day min 5 7 mm day in dec max 8 4 in may www indiawaterportal org hyderabad has a tropical wet and dry climate with an annual mean temperature of 26 8 and rainfall of 855 mm table 1 summers are hot here with maximum temperature often exceeding 40 during the months of april and may hyderabad receives most 73 of its rain from ism between june september it also receives showers during the post monsoon period between oct dec a total of 127 daily rainfall samples were collected from hyderabad during 2010 and 2011 comparison of various long term meteorological parameters and isotopic compositions of rain 2010 11 for all the four stations are presented in table 1 for detailed meteorological information reference is made to india meteorology department website www mausam imd gov in 3 methodology 3 1 isotope analyses daily samples of rainfall accumulated over a period of 24 h were collected using an indigenous rainwater sampler based on iaea gnip guidelines designed i to minimize the evaporation ii to ensure the sampling of even low intensity rain events and iii to accommodate large volume of rainwater during high intensity rain events deshpande et al 2010 the amount of rainfall was measured using standard measuring flasks after thorough homogenization of accumulated rainwater and a well mixed representative sample was transferred to air tight hdpe sampling bottles at 10 am every day the isotope analyses were done at physical research laboratory ahmedabad india by standard equilibration method in which samples were equilibrated with co2 h2 gas for oxygen hydrogen isotope analysis using delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms in continuous flow mode using gas bench ii maurya et al 2009 the samples were tested against the three secondary laboratory standards and the reproducibility of measurements was found to be better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd isotopic composition is expressed in terms of per mil deviation from international standard reference material in δ notation as δ18o or δd rsample rstd 1 1000 where r 18o 16o or d h and rstd is the ratio in vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 3 2 data analyses and computation the measured isotopic composition of precipitation was interpreted in conjunction with other associated weather meteorological and isotopic parameters obtained from satellite reanalysis and modelled data products available on various open web platforms exhaustive computations were done to estimate i evaporation from falling raindrops ii condensation height and temperature and iii pristine isotopic composition of vapour generated under convective and advective systems one way of estimating the extent of actual evaporation from falling raindrop is to compare the isotopic composition of observed rain with that of modelled rain estimated using isotope enabled gcms this approach however is not feasible because the modelled rain already includes the possible effect of evaporation under certain assumptions which are known to underestimate the isotopic exchange between the falling raindrops and the surrounding vapour and the partial re evaporation lee fung 2008 for example the lmdz iso can also provide the isotopic composition of condensate in which the intensity of the kinetic processes related to evaporation and interaction with ambient air is accounted for by a tunable parameter set to a value to 0 9 which however fails to capture the large variation in atmospheric rh bony et al 2008 it was noticed in this study that the observed δ18o values of rain matched well with the lmdz iso gcm values only in places with high relative humidity and saturated atmosphere however for low rh and under saturated atmosphere the modelled values were found to be consistently depleted compared to the observed values with the highest negative bias going up to 7 4 in jammu where rh was 58 this suggests a gross underestimation of the post condensation kinetic processes fig 2 in view of the above limitations of the modelled isotopic composition of rain the modelled isotopic composition of vapour is used in this study to generate the pristine isotopic composition of condensate to compute the extent of modification necessary to obtain the observed isotopic values of rain this approach provides not only the extent of evaporation from falling raindrops but also provides a way to validate the isotope enabled gcms in terms of the isotopic composition of resultant modelled rain fig 2 in this study evaporation from falling raindrops has been estimated for two types of rain forming processes namely advective and convective in advective systems it is envisaged that the atmospheric moisture from adjoining regions is advected into the atmosphere over the study area from which rain is generated on the other hand in convective systems it is envisaged that due to surface convergence and resultant updraft moisture from below the cloud base and ground level gets uplifted and mixed with in cloud moisture from which rain is generated vertical wind velocity ω at the 500 hpa level was used as an indicator of surface convergence strength feng et al 2009 in this study under the condition of low values of outgoing longwave radiation olr 240 w m2 gadgil 2003 ω 0 1 pa s is considered to indicate strong updraft due to surface convergence and 0 025 pa s ω 0 is considered to indicate weak updraft lareau horel 2012 rose lin 2003 thus months which satisfy these conditions are classified as having convection as the dominant process or else advection the values of ω were obtained from era interim monthly data at a resolution of 0 75 x 0 75 and at 20 pressure levels ranging from 300 to 1000 hpa downloaded from http apps ecmwf int datasets the monthly olr data was obtained from http www cdc noaa gov cdc data interp olr html at the resolution of 2 5 x 2 5 it is hypothesized that the degree of saturation of the vertical air column could play a role in both the convective and the advective rain forming processes through the interaction of resultant rain with saturated or unsaturated air columns hence four scenarios fig 3 are considered namely a convection within saturated air column b convection within unsaturated air column c advection over saturated air column and d advection over unsaturated air column scientific premises and assumptions for the computation of isotopic compositions of vapour under convective and advective systems are given below a isotopic composition of vapor in the convective system in the case of convection both in the saturated and unsaturated air column the near surface level moisture is uplifted to higher altitudes due to updraft stronger the updraft lesser will be the chance for surface moisture to interact and mix with surrounding moisture at different pressure levels and hence lesser will be the modification in its isotopic composition higher the specific humidity of a particular pressure level more will be its contribution of moisture to the updraft the near surface level moisture tends to preserve its isotopic signature in the condition of strong updraft and or unsaturated air column in the above framework of possible scenarios of convective systems the estimated δ18o of rain forming vapour is computed using the modelled δ18o of vapour at different pressure levels weighed with the ratio of specific humidity to the vertical wind velocity at that pressure levels as follows 1 δ vo i p 1 pn δ i q i ω i i p 1 pn q i ω i where δ vo is the estimated value of δ18o of rain forming vapour p1 to pn represents the pressure levels between which the cloud liquid water content clwc is more than half of its maximum value δ i q i and ω i are respectively the δ18o of vapour specific humidity and upward vertical wind velocity at ith pressure levels the clwc and q i were obtained from era interim monthly data the δ i values were obtained at 19 pressure levels from lmdz iso gcm at resolution of 2 5 x 3 75 nudged by ecmwf https data giss nasa gov swing2 swing2 mirror lmdz4 nudged vl77 these pressure levels were chosen to be closest to the era interim data from where other weather parameters were obtained b isotopic composition of vapour in advective system in the case of advection both over the saturated and the unsaturated air column the isotopic composition of vapour at the pressure level where clwc is maximum was used as it is to be the isotopic composition of the rain forming vapor source δ vo in the foregoing aspects concerning the isotopic composition of vapour δ vo both in the convective and the advective systems are discussed in the following the isotopic composition of liquid δ l 0 generated from this rain forming vapour δ vo is computed for a certain value of residual vapour fraction f c when the isotopic composition of vapour changes from δ vo to δ v the residual vapour fractionation fc due to condensation from the vapour parcel was computed using a formulation given by rahul et al 2018 2 f c 1 rf pwc where rf is rainfall amount and pwc is total precipitable water content in the atmosphere monthly averaged rf was obtained from trmm http daac gsfc nasa gov precipitation trmm readme trmm 3b43 readme shtml and pwc was obtained from ncep doe amip ii reanalysis dataset http www cpc ncep noaa gov products wesley reanalysis2 at 0 25 x 0 25 resolution in the above formulation fc is computed for individual rainy day and then averaged over all the rainy days for of a given month the assumption here is that the antecedent rainout history for consequent rainy days remains is preserved however this assumption and the consequent computation may fail in case of fewer and non consecutive rainy days the isotopic composition of residual vapour δ v is computed using the rayleigh formulation gonfiantini et al 2001 3 δ v δ vo ε ln f c where ε α 1 1000 and α is temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation factor for liquid to vapour horita wesolowski 1994 the temperature at the pressure level where the clwc is maximum is used as the condensation temperature tc to compute the fractionation factor α the monthly averaged temperature data was also obtained from era interim the isotopic composition of the liquid condensate δ lo is given by 4 δ lo δ vo f c δ v 1 f c both in case of the convective and the advective systems the condensate is expected to undergo evaporation during its fall through unsaturated air column the extent of evaporation is determined by the degree of undersaturation given by the rh of the air column the initial liquid condensate δ lo thus formed would fall through the atmosphere and undergo secondary isotopic modification due to evaporation from falling drops and interaction with the surrounding moisture thus the isotopic composition of final liquid δ l that reaches the ground can be computed using formulation given by stewart 1975 in δ notation 5 δ l 10 3 1 δ lo 10 3 1 γ δ a 10 3 1 f e β γ δ a 10 3 1 where δ a is the isotopic composition water vapour in the atmosphere averaged at equal intervals between half maxima of clwc and ground level fe is residual fraction of water remaining in the raindrop after evaporation the fractional evaporative loss is 1 fe and the percentage evaporative loss is 1 fe 100 the terms γ and β in equation 5 are given by γ α p h 1 α p d d n 1 h a n d β 1 α p d d n 1 h α p d d n 1 h where αp is the equilibrium fractionation factor between the liquid drop and vapour at its surface computed for the era intrim air temperature ta averaged between the ground level and cloud liquid maxima h is the era intrim humidity rha similarly averaged between the ground level and cloud liquid maxima the d d is the ratio of diffusivity constants for h2 16o and h2 18o molecules in the atmosphere and n is an exponent dependent on the drop size values of d d and n were taken from stewart 1975 the value of fe was computed for which the modelled value of δ l matches the observed isotopic composition of rain δ obs all the weather parameters necessary to compute the extent of evaporation from falling raindrops at each of the four stations in this study were estimated over 4 x 4 boxes with the concerned station lying at the centre except for the jorhat where a 4 x 2 box was considered to restrict the latitudinal extent to exclude the orographic highs in the north and south of jorhat which would bias the computations since the lmdz iso data were available only till 2010 all the computations were done only for 2010 as discussed earlier the clwc is used for the following three purposes i the pressure levels between which the cloud liquid water content clwc is more than half of its maximum value is used to estimate isotopic composition of rain forming vapour in case of convective system ii the pressure level at which the clwc value is maximum is used to obtain the isotopic composition of rain forming vapour in case of advective system iii the temperature at an altitude at which clwc is maximum is considered for computing fractionation factor fig 4 shows the vertical distribution of clwc with respect to atmospheric pressure hpa for months with the most enriched fig 4 a b c and d and the most depleted fig 4 e f g and h amount weighted monthly average δ18o values in rain in case of the months with the most enriched monthly average δ18o values a short span of altitude having relatively high values of clwc is observed in contrast in case of months with most depleted monthly average δ18o values a comparatively longer span of altitude having high values of clwc is clearly observed at jorhat hyderabad and jammu and less clearly at ahmedabad the high clwc over a longer span of altitude increases the chance of interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapour and the high column averaged rh further retards the evaporative enrichment from falling raindrops resulting in isotopically depleted rain it must be noted here that the above mentioned computations are done at a coarser spatial and temporal resolutions because of the unavailability of various modelled and reanalysis meteorological and isotopic datasets at finer resolution also errors concerning various datasets used here is not defined because of which the error estimation in the computations done here was not possible 4 results and discussion with a view to identify signatures of major hydro meteorological processes including evaporation from falling raindrops as imprinted on the isotopic composition of rainwater samples from indian subcontinent following strategy is adopted 1 the overall interpretations are drawn based on a composite δ18o δd regression line fig 5 for all the samples for two years 2010 and 2011 and individual regression lines fig 6 for each of the four stations 2 the computations for estimating evaporation from falling raindrops is done as per the methodology described earlier for the months having the most enriched and the most depleted amount weighted average δ18o values for the year 2010 based on the 556 daily rainwater samples collected at jammu jorhat ahmedabad and hyderabad during 2010 11 a composite δ18o δd regression line is plotted in fig 5 which from this point onwards is referred to as the indian meteoric water line imwl it is noteworthy that this is the most comprehensively defined meteoric waterline for india based on the rainwater samples collected from four different hydrometeorological or climatic zones the earlier imwl kumar et al 2010 was defined based on a fewer number of daily rain samples and without representation from warm and semi arid western india where maximum evaporation from falling raindrops is expected the slope and intercept of imwl δd 7 6 0 1 δ18o 8 1 r2 0 96 p 0 05 n 556 is significantly lower than that of the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8 17 0 07 δ18o 11 27 0 65 rozanski et al 1993 and also lower than that reported earlier by kumar et al 2010 δd 7 93 0 06 δ18o 9 94 0 51 r2 0 98 n 272 the slope less than that of the gmwl suggests that the significant secondary evaporation from the falling raindrops dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 is the major process governing isotopic composition of precipitation in the indian subcontinent it is seen fig 5 that most of the enriched δ18o up to 10 rain samples are from the jammu and not from the ahmedabad although ahmedabad is located in hot semi arid region fig 1 this is because ahmedabad receives rain only in the ism months when the average rh is 72 average annual rainfall 750 mm 92 of which is occurs during jun sept rainy days 34 days whereas in jammu it rains almost in every month but the rainfall amount is scanty especially in the pre monsoon months jan jun average annual rainfall of 1332 mm rainy days 61 spread across the 12 months this enhances the secondary evaporation from the falling raindrops worden et al 2007 at jammu compared to ahmedabad resulting in significant evaporative isotopic enrichment this is also evident from the lower value of δ18o δd regression slope for jammu fig 6a the most depleted rain samples δ18o up to 15 are observed at jorhat in northeastern india this isotopic depletion seems to be caused by orographic barriers fig 1 which the ism coming from the bob has to cross resulting in the observed isotopic depletion at jorhat located on the leeward side also the wetlands of jorhat are fed by flooding of brahmaputra river bringing isotopically depleted glacial melt which might provide a depleted source of water for local recycling specific isotope signatures at each of the four stations and the inferred hydrometeorological features thereupon are discussed in the following 4 1 jammu local meteoric water line based on 75 daily rain samples collected from jammu is plotted in fig 6a the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess were found to be 4 7 and 13 respectively the slope 6 3 0 2 and intercept 5 1 of local meteoric water line at jammu fig 6a is significantly lower than that of gmwl suggesting significant evaporation from the falling raindrops it is seen in fig 7 a that both pre monsoon and monsoon samples exhibit an inverse relationship between δ18o and d excess suggesting dominant role played by evaporation in both the seasons although jammu is located at the higher latitude and altitude 327 m contrary to the expectation the peculiar isotopic signatures of wd high d excess and low δ18o jeelani and deshpande 2017 is not observed in the pre monsoon months jan may both the high and low values of δ18o are associated with both high and low d excess during monsoon suggesting varying degree of rainout low δ18o with low d excess or high δ18o with high d excess evaporation from falling raindrops high δ18o and low d excess and recycled rain low δ18o and high d excess from depleted surface water bodies fed by glacial melts singh 1990 the most enriched value of monthly average δ18o was observed in the month of june 1 6 high olr 255 w m2 and negligible upward winds at 500 hpa 0 026pa s indicates the absence of convection the cloud top height was 517 hpa and clwc maxima was sharply peaking at 600 hpa fig 4d with the condensation temperature of 275 5 k ε 11 47 the isotopic makeup of the advected vapour undergoing condensation was 19 0 the evaporative loss from the raindrops necessary to arrive at the observed isotopic composition 1 6 of rainfall is estimated to be 52 at a column averaged rh of 58 this suggests large scale post condensation modification via kinetic processes which is expected to result in a large variation in d excess it is observed that isotopically enriched depleted daily rain events were associated with low high rh and low high d excess up to 10 15 this could be explained by significant variation in daily surface rh ranging from 40 60 the most depleted average monthly δ18o value of 9 4 was observed in the month of august high olr 232 w m2 and very low upward vertical wind velocity 0 05 pa s at 500 hpa suggested no convection it is known that in the month of august the ism transports moisture from the bob jeelani et al 2017 the cloud top height in august was 443 8 hpa and clwc remained consistently high between 850 and 500 hpa with the peak at 775 hpa fig 4h the condensation temperature at 775 hpa was 290 6 k ε 10 02 the isotopic makeup of advected condensing vapour was found to be 19 8 the evaporative loss necessary to arrive at observed isotopic composition of 9 4 is estimated to be 8 under the column averaged rh of 75 the d excess for most 11 out of 13 rainy days of august ranged between 10 and 17 the relatively high d excess suggests a small degree of post condensation modification which can be explained by high surface rh values ranging between 73 and 92 4 2 jorhat a local meteoric water line based on 257 daily rain samples at jorhat is shown in fig 6b the slope 8 3 0 1 of meteoric water line is similar to gmwl but the intercept 13 1 is higher than the gmwl the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess of all the samples were found to be 6 8 and 11 respectively isotopically most enriched rain events were also observed during the pre monsoon months whereas most depleted rain events have occurred during monsoon and post monsoon the higher values of intercept and the average d excess suggest significant contribution of locally derived moisture in the precipitation throughout the year the widespread wetlands and low lying flood plains of jorhat are fed by annual floods in brahmaputra river achyuthan et al 2013 bringing isotopically depleted 12 lambs et al 2005 glacial meltwater during ism it is expected that surface water present in the wetlands and flood plains during monsoon months undergoes evaporative isotopic enrichment until next monsoon it is to be noted fig 7b that evaporative enrichment in 18o jan june is not accompanied by associated lower values of d excess this is due to the fact that relative humidity at jorhat remains high 85 throughout the year and therefore although significant evaporation occurs due to availability of water the kinetic fractionation effects are minimized it is also to be noted that there are two highly depleted 22 rain events in post monsoon months possibly due to stray meteorological events such as localized convection the most enriched 1 4 monthly amount weighted δ18o value of rain was also observed in the month of april low olr 228 w m2 and high vertical wind velocity at 500 hpa ω 0 15 pa s were observed during april indicative of strong convection this seems to be associated with strong convection of locally available enriched surface waters driven by the nor westers also locally known as kal baishakhi laskar et al 2015 the maximum clwc was found between 850 and 550 hpa peaking at 700 hpa fig 4a hence the condensation temperature of 270 7 k at clwc peak 700 hpa was used for the computation of fractionation ε 11 98 and isotopic composition of initial liquid condensate the evaporative loss from the initial liquid condensate necessary to obtain the observed isotopic value of rain is estimated to be 15 at a column averaged rh of 79 the most depleted δ18o 8 0 monthly averaged isotopic value of rain was observed in july which was associated with relatively weaker convection olr 197 w m2 and ω 0 08 pa s than that in april due to significant rainfall and flooding of brahmaputra river with isotopically depleted 12 lambs et al 2005 water the availability of isotopically depleted moisture increases in july compared to april resulting in higher column average rh 88 the isotopic dilution of surface waters due to flooding in the brahmaputra in the month of july is also evident in the isotopic composition of modelled surface vapour obtained from lmdz iso gcm which is found to be isotopically depleted 13 8 in july compared to april 10 6 the clwc was also found to be high for a wider range within pressure levels of 850 to 550 hpa with the peak in clwc at 800 hpa fig 4e the condensation temperature at this peak of clwc was found to be 273 6 k with ε 11 67 the evaporative loss from the initial liquid condensate necessary to obtain the observed isotopic value of rain is estimated to be 4 such a lower evaporative loss in july compared to that in april can be explained as due to highly saturated vapour column rh 88 in july compared to 79 in april 4 3 ahmedabad based on 101 daily rain samples a local meteoric water line for ahmedabad is plotted in fig 6c the lower slope 7 6 0 1 and intercept 7 1 compared to that of gmwl suggest significant evaporation from falling raindrops the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess were 4 8 and 9 respectively the most enriched monthly amount weighted average δ18o of 2 2 was observed in the month of june high olr 250 w m2 and downward winds at 500 hpa 0 0006 pa s indicate the absence of convection it is also known that during june most of the moisture is advected from the arabian sea owing to ism oza et al 2020 hence advection has been considered as the primary moisture transport mechanism operating in june at ahmedabad cloud top height of 498 hpa was observed along with the clwc peaking sharply at 800 hpa fig 4c with condensation temperature of 292 9 k at which the value of ε is 9 81 the δ18o of advected moisture at 800 hpa was 13 3 the evaporative loss was computed to be 8 at the observed column average rh of 46 however the low d excess 5 associated with most enriched δ18o values 5 cannot be explained by such a low estimated value of evaporation from falling raindrop the probable reason for the underestimation of evaporative loss from the falling raindrops could be due to overestimation of residual vapour fraction fc 92 33 this overestimation arises due to the fact that there are only a few rainy days during june discretely spread across the month while the pwc and rf values are averaged over the month as discussed in methodology section the most depleted average δ18o 4 8 was found in the month of august although based on long term 1998 2013 trmm data oza et al 2020 have shown that convective rain proportion increases progressively during ism the advected moisture from the arabian sea is the primary source of moisture for rain at ahmedabad during august low olr 202 w m2 along with minimal upward wind velocity 0 01 pa s at 500 hpa during august 2010 suggests negligible convective activity therefore computations are done considering the advective system for this case the cloud top height of 344 9 hpa was observed with maximum clwc ranging between 700 and 875 hpa and the peak at 825 hpa fig 4g at which the condensation temperature was 291 4 k ε 9 95 the isotopic makeup of the rain forming moisture was found to be 16 03 the evaporative loss necessary to arrive at the observed isotopic composition of rain 4 8 is estimated to be 8 at column average rh of 81 4 4 hyderabad a local meteoric water line comprising a total of 123 daily rain samples collected from hyderabad during 2010 11 is plotted in fig 6d the slope 7 1 0 1 lower than that of gmwl suggests significant evaporation from falling raindrops isotopically some of the most depleted as well as most enriched rain samples were found during pre monsoon the enriched δ18o samples are associated with low d excess fig 7d which again suggests evaporation from falling raindrops whereas the samples with depleted δ18o were associated with high d excess fig 7d suggesting recycled moisture froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 during monsoonal months δ18o of rain samples range from 8 2 to 1 5 with d excess ranging from 0 to 21 samples depleted in δ18o and associated with low d excess might suggest significant rainout history whereas samples with low δ18o and high d excess suggest the contribution of locally recycled moisture in addition there were very few samples with enriched δ18o and low d excess during monsoon indicating evaporation from falling raindrops most of the post monsoon samples were depleted in δ18o 7 9 to 1 0 and d excess ranged from 2 to 13 which suggests varying degree of rainout probably from the bob due to retreating ism the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess of all samples were 4 0 and 10 respectively the most enriched monthly amount weighted average δ18o 0 3 value was found in the month of may downward vertical wind velocity 0 022 pa s at 500 hpa and high olr value 260 w m2 indicates the absence of convection the clwc was found to peak sharply at 550 hpa fig 4b and therefore temperature of condensation at 550 hpa 272 4 k was used to compute ε 11 80 due to absence of convection the isotopic composition 18 8 of advected vapour at 550 hpa was used to estimate the δ18o of condensate for column averaged rh of 59 3 the observed isotopic composition of rain 0 3 was achieved from the rain forming cloud at an estimated the evaporative loss of 29 suggesting significant role of evaporation from falling raindrop this is further supported by low average rain amount of 6 mm day and low average d excess of 1 3 the most depleted isotopic values at hyderabad were found in august with the average δ18o of 6 1 low olr 198 w m2 along with small vertical upward velocity 0 03 pa s at 500 hpa indicated low to mid convective strength cloud top height of 345 hpa was observed with clwc ranging consistently high between 550 and 800 hpa with a peak at 750 hpa fig 4f the condensation temperature at 750 hpa was 286 9 k which was used to compute fractionation ε 10 35 the column averaged rh was found to be 84 the δ18o of rain forming vapour was computed to be 18 7 the estimated evaporative loss necessary to obtain observed isotopic composition of rain 6 1 from the rain forming vapour is 15 fig 8 compares the evaporative loss column average atmospheric rh and the observed isotopic composition of rain for the months with most enriched and most depleted amount weighted average δ18o values for all the four stations it can be seen that for each station except for ahmedabad the lower column average atmospheric rh values are associated with higher evaporative loss and vice versa fig 9 also shows high correlation r2 75 p 0 05 between column averaged rh and evaporative loss from the falling raindrops for the months with most enriched and most depleted rain δ18o values for all the four stations with an exception in case of june rainfall at ahmedabad where evaporative loss is underestimated due to the reasons discussed earlier section 4 3 fig 9 shows that the column averaged rh is a major controlling factor for evaporation from falling raindrops estimated in this study which confirms that the method of computation realistically accounts for the kinetic process during evaporation from falling raindrops 5 conclusion using the isotopic composition of daily rainwater samples in conjunction with satellite based atmospheric observations and model derived meteorological parameters evaporative loss from falling raindrops has been estimated in four different climatic zones of indian sub continent a more realistic indian meteoric water line imwl better

role of evaporation from falling rain in the indian subcontinent though it is surrounded by large marine water body and bordered by lofty himalayan mountains in the north obstructing the monsoonal winds exhaustive computations involving combination of isotope data of daily rainwater samples and various other meteorological parameters have been done for the months with most enriched and most depleted amount weighted monthly averaged isotopic composition of rain at all the four stations as these are indicative of specific hydrometeorological processes and factors such as convection advection degree of saturation and cloud liquid content important values of computed and observed parameters are given in table 2 some of the important insights derived from this study are given below 1 the estimated values of maximum and minimum evaporative loss from falling raindrops for the four stations are jammu maximum 52 and minimum 8 jorhat max 15 and min 4 hyderabad max 29 and min 15 and ahmedabad min 8 2 increased availability of surface waters due to flood in brahmaputra river and high column average rh of 88 results in the lowest evaporative loss from falling raindrops at jorhat 3 isotopically depleted rain is associated with high clwc over a longer span of altitude which facilitates the interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapour in addition high column averaged rh further retards the evaporation of falling raindrops and maintains the isotopic depletion due to long span of clwc 4 the extent of evaporative loss from falling raindrop is found to be inversely related to column average rh for all stations 1 fe 100 1 2 0 3 rh 111 24 r 2 0 75 p 0 05 this also confirms that the scheme of computation in this study accounts for the post condensation kinetic processes realistically 5 the isotopic compositions of lmdz iso modelled rain at four locations across the indian subcontinent are found to be isotopically depleted compared to the observed rain this negative isotopic bias in the modelled rain arises because it fails to incorporate evaporative isotopic enrichment under low rh condition due to significant spatial variation in the

5121,rigorous analysis of measured isotopic composition δ18o and δd of 556 daily rainwater samples collected at four indian stations viz jammu jorhat hyderabad and ahmedabad is done in conjunction with satellite and model derived meteorological and isotopic parameters to discern prominent hydrometeorological processes and factors in four different climatic zones in the indian subcontinent a new indian meteoric water line imwl better representing the different climatic zones including the semi arid western india has been defined δd 7 6 0 1 δ18o 8 1 r2 0 96 p 0 05 n 556 the lower slope of imwl compared to the global meteoric water line signifies the role of evaporation from falling rain throughout the indian subcontinent though it is surrounded by large marine water body and bordered by lofty himalayan mountains in the north obstructing the monsoonal winds this study provides new quantitative insights about various hydrometeorological processes across the indian subcontinent some of the important inferences drawn from this study are i the estimated evaporative losses from falling raindrops for the four stations are jammu maximum 52 and minimum 8 jorhat max 15 and min 4 ahmedabad min 8 and hyderabad max 29 and min 15 ii increased availability of surface waters due to flood in brahmaputra river and high value 88 of column averaged rh results in the lowest evaporative loss from falling raindrops at jorhat in northeast iii the high cloud liquid water content clwc over a longer span of altitude facilitates the interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapor and results in isotopically depleted rain iv the observed inverse relationship between the evaporative loss from falling raindrop and the column averaged rh confirms that the post condensation kinetic processes are realistically accounted in this study v validation with measured isotope data of rain shows that the lmdz iso modelled rain fails to incorporate evaporative isotopic enrichment and generates negative bias keywords hydrometeorological processes rain evaporation indian subcontinent stable isotopes indian summer monsoon 1 introduction the contemporary global hydrological cycle is experiencing a great deal of fluctuations and uncertainty in terms of amount and timings of rainfall caused by rise in global temperature and other anthropogenic factors allan soden 2008 goswami et al 2006 mirhosseini et al 2013 nageswararao et al 2016 trenberth 2011 rainfall variability in terms of extreme amounts and shift in timings is one of the significant factors adversely affecting the socio economy of various nations lanzafame 2014 olayide alabi 2018 richardson 2007 the indian subcontinent housing 23 2 of the global population surviving mainly on agrarian economy is one such region strongly governed by the rainfall derived from indian monsoon gadgil kumar 2006 gupta et al 2014 the indian monsoon is one of the most dynamic land ocean atmosphere interaction system influenced by a multitude of processes and factors the indian monsoon is predominantly driven by seasonal northward and southward movement of intertropical convergence zone itcz gadgil 2018 privé plumb 2007 as a result of northward movement of itcz the moisture laden winds from southwest fetches rain in the indian subcontinent through indian summer monsoon ism during june september on the other hand southward retreat of itcz drives northeastern winds bringing rainfall to some parts of southern india and sri lanka during october december which is known as the northeast winter monsoon or post monsoon gadgil 2003 the northwestern part of indian subcontinent receives rains also in the months of december february derived from the western disturbances wd dimri et al 2015 wd mainly originate in the mediterranean or west atlantic and travel to india rao srinivasan 1969 the above mentioned rain forming systems and their linkages with other synoptic processes such as el nino southern oscillation enso p kumar et al 2007 indian ocean dipole ashok et al 2001 north atlantic sea surface temperature and european ice cover clemens et al 1991 governing the inter annual variability of rain in the region are well known while above synoptic 1000 km processes are well understood there are several other non synoptic mesoscale 100 km and microscale 1 5 km processes which are poorly understood some of such non synoptic processes are i strong updraft of saturated or under saturated air mass due to surface convergence and resultant local recycling of vapour ii advection of vapour and mixing with residual vapour mass iii evaporation from falling raindrop and interaction with surrounding vapour mass these processes are poorly understood particularly in terms of their periodicity of occurrence spatial extent and pre disposition for certain regions if any these aspects are governed by regional and local scale geographical and hydro meteorological features land use pattern and surface water availability salvi ghosh 2019 large scale circulation models cannot provide insights into these processes due to constraint on the spatial resolution of models therefore an alternate approach is necessary stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in rainwater in conjunction with model derived isotope data of vapour and satellite derived meteorological parameters can be used as tracers to understand the above mentioned non synoptic hydrometeorological processes specific aspects which can be addressed using stable isotopes are moisture source identification rainout history recycling of vapour evaporation from falling raindrops and cloud microphysical processes breitenbach et al 2010 deshpande gupta 2012 deshpande et al 2013 jeelani et al 2017 lekshmy et al 2015 midhun et al 2018 oza et al 2020 rahul et al 2018 saranya et al 2018 unnikrishnan warrier praveen babu 2012 one of the major microscale processes which can be studied using stable isotopes is evaporation from falling raindrops gat dansgaard 1972 the evaporation from the falling raindrops is generally associated with enrichment in 18o and lower d excess liu et al 2008 also evaporative loss from falling raindrops is expected to reduce the slope of δ18o δd regression line dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 the major parameters affecting evaporation from falling raindrops are rain rate air temperature and relative humidity rh liu et al 2008 meng liu 2010 peng et al 2007 chen et al 2015 have estimated the rate of evaporation from falling raindrops to be 8 3 during summer jun sept and 4 5 during winter oct may in northwest china worden et al 2007 have shown that around 20 to 50 of raindrops evaporate near convective clouds and significantly increase the humidity in the lower troposphere which in turn may retard the extent of evaporation and alter the local rainfall amount and periodicity in a region like indian subcontinent with varied topographical and meteorological features and agrarian economy the change in land use and land cover can alter the local rh and temperature and can significantly affect the rain re evaporation and possibly the amount of rainfall itself thus estimating evaporation from falling raindrops in different climatic zones of the indian subcontinent is very important while there are a few studies which estimate evaporation from falling raindrops in different parts of the globe chen et al 2015 froehlich et al 2008 worden et al 2007 such an estimate for the indian subcontinent is not known where it is really important for hydrological budgeting with a view to bridge this knowledge gap daily precipitation samples n 556 were collected from four stations viz jammu jorhat ahmedabad and hyderabad located in four different climatic zones under the aegis of a national programme on isotope fingerprinting of waters of india iwin deshpande and gupta 2008 deshpande gupta 2012 meteorological parameters and isotopic composition of water vapour necessary for the estimation of evaporation from the falling raindrops were obtained respectively from various satellite based observations and modelled data results from rigorous analysis of these data is presented in

average annual potential evapotranspiration pet in the region is 6 3 mm day with a maximum of 9 1 mm day in june and lowest value of 3 9 mm day in january www indiawaterportal org it is to be noted that the pet value of june is one of the highest compared to the other three stations this may cause significant evaporation both from surface water and falling raindrop the long term average annual

spread in and around jorhat occupying about 46 000 ha many of which are fed by brahmaputra national wetland atlas assam 2010 in order to understand the integrated effect of above geographical and hydrometeorological factors jorhat was strategically chosen and a total of 257 daily rain samples were collected during 2010 and 2011 2 3 ahmedabad ahmedabad 23 03 n 72 58 e 53 m asl is located in the

showers during the post monsoon period between oct dec a total of 127 daily rainfall samples were collected from hyderabad during 2010 and 2011 comparison of various long term meteorological parameters and isotopic compositions of rain 2010 11 for all the four stations are presented in table 1 for detailed meteorological information reference is made to india meteorology department website www mausam imd gov in 3 methodology 3 1 isotope analyses daily samples of rainfall accumulated over a period of 24 h were collected using an indigenous rainwater sampler based on iaea gnip guidelines designed i to minimize the evaporation ii to ensure the sampling of even low intensity rain events and iii to accommodate large volume of rainwater during high intensity rain events deshpande et al 2010 the amount of rainfall was measured using standard measuring flasks after thorough homogenization of accumulated rainwater and a well mixed representative sample was transferred to air tight hdpe sampling bottles at 10 am every day the isotope analyses were done at physical research laboratory ahmedabad india by standard equilibration method in which samples were equilibrated with co2 h2 gas for oxygen hydrogen isotope analysis using delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms in continuous flow mode using gas bench ii maurya et al 2009 the samples were tested against the three secondary laboratory standards and the reproducibility of measurements was found to be better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd isotopic composition is expressed in terms of per mil deviation from international standard reference material in δ notation as δ18o or δd rsample rstd 1 1000 where r 18o 16o or d h and rstd is the ratio in vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 3 2 data analyses and computation the measured isotopic composition of precipitation was interpreted in conjunction with other associated weather meteorological and isotopic parameters obtained from satellite reanalysis and modelled data products available on various open web platforms exhaustive computations were done to estimate i evaporation from falling raindrops ii condensation height and temperature and iii pristine isotopic composition of vapour generated under convective and advective systems one way of estimating the extent of actual evaporation from falling raindrop is to compare the isotopic composition of observed rain with that of modelled rain estimated using isotope enabled gcms this approach however is not feasible because the modelled rain already includes the possible effect of evaporation under certain assumptions which are known to underestimate the isotopic exchange between the falling raindrops and the surrounding vapour and the partial re evaporation lee fung 2008 for example the lmdz iso can also provide the isotopic composition of condensate in which the intensity of the kinetic processes related to evaporation and interaction with ambient air is accounted for by a tunable parameter set to a value to 0 9 which however fails to capture the large variation in atmospheric rh bony et al 2008 it was noticed in this study that the observed δ18o values of rain matched well with the lmdz iso gcm values only in places with high relative humidity and saturated atmosphere however for low rh and under saturated atmosphere the modelled values were found to be consistently depleted compared to the observed values with the highest negative bias going up to 7 4 in jammu where rh was 58 this suggests a gross underestimation of the post condensation kinetic processes fig 2 in view of the above limitations of the modelled isotopic composition of rain the modelled isotopic composition of vapour is used in this study to generate the pristine isotopic composition of condensate to compute the extent of modification necessary to obtain the observed isotopic values of rain this approach provides not only the extent of evaporation from falling raindrops but also provides a way to validate the isotope enabled gcms in terms of the isotopic composition of resultant modelled rain fig 2 in this study evaporation from falling raindrops has been estimated for two types of rain forming processes namely advective and convective in advective systems it is envisaged that the atmospheric moisture from adjoining regions is advected into the atmosphere over the study area from which rain is generated on the other hand in convective systems it is envisaged that due to surface convergence and resultant updraft moisture from below the cloud base and ground level gets uplifted and mixed with in cloud moisture from which rain is generated vertical wind velocity ω at the 500 hpa level was used as an indicator of surface convergence strength feng et al 2009 in this study under the condition of low values of outgoing longwave radiation olr 240 w m2 gadgil 2003 ω 0 1 pa s is considered to indicate strong updraft due to surface convergence and 0 025 pa s ω 0 is considered to indicate weak updraft lareau horel 2012 rose lin 2003 thus months which satisfy these conditions are classified as having convection as the dominant process or else advection the values of ω were obtained from era interim monthly data at a resolution of 0 75 x 0 75 and at 20 pressure levels ranging from 300 to 1000 hpa downloaded from http apps ecmwf int datasets the monthly olr data was obtained from http www cdc noaa gov cdc data interp olr html at the resolution of 2 5 x 2 5 it is hypothesized that the degree of saturation of the vertical air column could play a role in both the convective and the advective rain forming processes through the interaction of resultant rain with saturated or unsaturated air columns hence four scenarios fig 3 are considered namely a convection within saturated air column b convection within unsaturated air column c advection over saturated air column and d advection over unsaturated air column scientific premises and assumptions for the computation of isotopic compositions of vapour under convective and advective systems are given below a isotopic composition of vapor in the convective system in the case of convection both in the saturated and unsaturated air column the near surface level moisture is uplifted to higher altitudes due to updraft stronger the updraft lesser will be the chance for surface moisture to interact and mix with surrounding moisture at different pressure levels and hence lesser will be the modification in its isotopic composition higher the specific humidity of a particular pressure level more will be its contribution of moisture to the updraft the near surface level moisture tends to preserve its isotopic signature in the condition of strong updraft and or unsaturated air column in the above framework of possible scenarios of convective systems the estimated δ18o of rain forming vapour is computed using the modelled δ18o of vapour at different pressure levels weighed with the ratio of specific humidity to the vertical wind velocity at that pressure levels as follows 1 δ vo i p 1 pn δ i q i ω i i p 1 pn q i ω i where δ vo is the estimated value of δ18o of rain forming vapour p1 to pn represents the pressure levels between which the cloud liquid water content clwc is more than half of its maximum value δ i q i and ω i are respectively the δ18o of vapour specific humidity and upward vertical wind velocity at ith pressure levels the clwc and q i were obtained from era interim monthly data the δ i values were obtained at 19 pressure levels from lmdz iso gcm at resolution of 2 5 x 3 75 nudged by ecmwf https data giss nasa gov swing2 swing2 mirror lmdz4 nudged vl77 these pressure levels were chosen to be closest to the era interim data from where other weather parameters were obtained b isotopic composition of vapour in advective system in the case of advection both over the saturated and the unsaturated air column the isotopic composition of vapour at the pressure level where clwc is maximum was used as it is to be the isotopic composition of the rain forming vapor source δ vo in the foregoing aspects concerning the isotopic composition of vapour δ vo both in the convective and the advective systems are discussed in the following the isotopic composition of liquid δ l 0 generated from this rain forming vapour δ vo is computed for a certain value of residual vapour fraction f c when the isotopic composition of vapour changes from δ vo to δ v the residual vapour fractionation fc due to condensation from the vapour parcel was computed using a formulation given by rahul et al 2018 2 f c 1 rf pwc where rf is rainfall amount and pwc is total precipitable water content in the atmosphere monthly averaged rf was obtained from trmm http daac gsfc nasa gov precipitation trmm readme trmm 3b43 readme shtml and pwc was obtained from ncep doe amip ii reanalysis dataset http www cpc ncep noaa gov products wesley reanalysis2 at 0 25 x 0 25 resolution in the above formulation fc is computed for individual rainy day and then averaged over all the rainy days for of a given month the assumption here is that the antecedent rainout history for consequent rainy days remains is preserved however this assumption and the consequent computation may fail in case of fewer and non consecutive rainy days the isotopic composition of residual vapour δ v is computed using the rayleigh formulation gonfiantini et al 2001 3 δ v δ vo ε ln f c where ε α 1 1000 and α is temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation factor for liquid to vapour horita wesolowski 1994 the temperature at the pressure level where the clwc is maximum is used as the condensation temperature tc to compute the fractionation factor α the monthly averaged temperature data was also obtained from era interim the isotopic composition of the liquid condensate δ lo is given by 4 δ lo δ vo f c δ v 1 f c both in case of the convective and the advective systems the condensate is expected to undergo evaporation during its fall through unsaturated air column the extent of evaporation is determined by the degree of undersaturation given by the rh of the air column the initial liquid condensate δ lo thus formed would fall through the atmosphere and undergo secondary isotopic modification due to evaporation from falling drops and interaction with the surrounding moisture thus the isotopic composition of final liquid δ l that reaches the ground can be computed using formulation given by stewart 1975 in δ notation 5 δ l 10 3 1 δ lo 10 3 1 γ δ a 10 3 1 f e β γ δ a 10 3 1 where δ a is the isotopic composition water vapour in the atmosphere averaged at equal intervals between half maxima of clwc and ground level fe is residual fraction of water remaining in the raindrop after evaporation the fractional evaporative loss is 1 fe and the percentage evaporative loss is 1 fe 100 the terms γ and β in equation 5 are given by γ α p h 1 α p d d n 1 h a n d β 1 α p d d n 1 h α p d d n 1 h where αp is the equilibrium fractionation factor between the liquid drop and vapour at its surface computed for the era intrim air temperature ta averaged between the ground level and cloud liquid maxima h is the era intrim humidity rha similarly averaged between the ground level and cloud liquid maxima the d d is the ratio of diffusivity constants for h2 16o and h2 18o molecules in the atmosphere and n is an exponent dependent on the drop size values of d d and n were taken from stewart 1975 the value of fe was computed for which the modelled value of δ l matches the observed isotopic composition of rain δ obs all the weather parameters necessary to compute the extent of evaporation from falling raindrops at each of the four stations in this study were estimated over 4 x 4 boxes with the concerned station lying at the centre except for the jorhat where a 4 x 2 box was considered to restrict the latitudinal extent to exclude the orographic highs in the north and south of jorhat which would bias the computations since the lmdz iso data were available only till 2010 all the computations were done only for 2010 as discussed earlier the clwc is used for the following three purposes i the pressure levels between which the cloud liquid water content clwc is more than half of its maximum value is used to estimate isotopic composition of rain forming vapour in case of convective system ii the pressure level at which the clwc value is maximum is used to obtain the isotopic composition of rain forming vapour in case of advective system iii the temperature at an altitude at which clwc is maximum is considered for computing fractionation factor fig 4 shows the vertical distribution of clwc with respect to atmospheric pressure hpa for months with the most enriched fig 4 a b c and d and the most depleted fig 4 e f g and h amount weighted monthly average δ18o values in rain in case of the months with the most enriched monthly average δ18o values a short span of altitude having relatively high values of clwc is observed in contrast in case of months with most depleted monthly average δ18o values a comparatively longer span of altitude having high values of clwc is clearly observed at jorhat hyderabad and jammu and less clearly at ahmedabad the high clwc over a longer span of altitude increases the chance of interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapour and the high column averaged rh further retards the evaporative enrichment from falling raindrops resulting in isotopically depleted rain it must be noted here that the above mentioned computations are done at a coarser spatial and temporal resolutions because of the unavailability of various modelled and reanalysis meteorological and isotopic datasets at finer resolution also errors concerning various datasets used here is not defined because of which the error estimation in the computations done here was not possible 4 results and discussion with a view to identify signatures of major hydro meteorological processes including evaporation from falling raindrops as imprinted on the isotopic composition of rainwater samples from indian subcontinent following strategy is adopted 1 the overall interpretations are drawn based on a composite δ18o δd regression line fig 5 for all the samples for two years 2010 and 2011 and individual regression lines fig 6 for each of the four stations 2 the computations for estimating evaporation from falling raindrops is done as per the methodology described earlier for the months having the most enriched and the most depleted amount weighted average δ18o values for the year 2010 based on the 556 daily rainwater samples collected at jammu jorhat ahmedabad and hyderabad during 2010 11 a composite δ18o δd regression line is plotted in fig 5 which from this point onwards is referred to as the indian meteoric water line imwl it is noteworthy that this is the most comprehensively defined meteoric waterline for india based on the rainwater samples collected from four different hydrometeorological or climatic zones the earlier imwl kumar et al 2010 was defined based on a fewer number of daily rain samples and without representation from warm and semi arid western india where maximum evaporation from falling raindrops is expected the slope and intercept of

earlier by kumar et al 2010 δd 7 93 0 06 δ18o 9 94 0 51 r2 0 98 n 272 the slope less than that of the gmwl suggests that the significant secondary evaporation from the falling raindrops dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 is the major process governing isotopic composition of precipitation in the indian subcontinent it is seen fig 5 that most of the enriched δ18o up to 10 rain samples are from the jammu and not from the ahmedabad although ahmedabad is located in hot semi arid region fig 1 this is because ahmedabad receives rain only in the ism months when the average rh is 72 average annual rainfall 750 mm 92 of which is occurs during jun sept rainy days 34 days whereas in jammu it rains almost in every month but the rainfall amount is scanty especially in the pre monsoon months jan jun average annual rainfall of 1332 mm rainy days 61 spread across the 12 months this enhances the secondary evaporation from the falling raindrops worden et al 2007 at jammu compared to ahmedabad resulting in significant evaporative isotopic enrichment this is also evident from the lower value of δ18o δd regression slope for jammu fig 6a the most depleted rain samples δ18o up to 15 are observed at jorhat in northeastern india this isotopic depletion seems to be caused by orographic barriers fig 1 which the ism coming from the bob has to cross resulting in the observed isotopic depletion at jorhat located on the leeward side also the wetlands of jorhat are fed by flooding of brahmaputra river bringing isotopically depleted glacial melt which might provide a depleted source of water for local recycling specific isotope signatures at each of the four stations and the inferred hydrometeorological features thereupon are discussed in the following 4 1 jammu local meteoric water line based on 75 daily rain samples collected from jammu is plotted in fig 6a the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess were found to be 4 7 and 13 respectively the slope 6 3 0 2 and intercept 5 1 of local meteoric water line at jammu fig 6a is significantly lower than that of gmwl suggesting significant evaporation from the falling raindrops it is seen in fig 7 a that both pre monsoon and monsoon samples exhibit an inverse relationship between δ18o and d excess suggesting dominant role played by evaporation in both the seasons although jammu is located at the higher latitude and altitude 327 m contrary to the expectation the peculiar isotopic signatures of wd high d excess and low δ18o jeelani and deshpande 2017 is not observed in the pre monsoon months jan may both the high and low values of δ18o are associated with both high and low d excess during monsoon suggesting varying degree of rainout low δ18o with low d excess or high δ18o with high d excess evaporation from falling raindrops high δ18o and low d excess and recycled rain low δ18o and high d excess from depleted surface water bodies fed by glacial melts singh 1990 the most enriched value of monthly average δ18o was observed in the month of june 1 6 high olr 255 w m2 and negligible upward winds at 500 hpa 0 026pa s indicates the absence of convection the cloud top height was 517 hpa and clwc maxima was sharply peaking at 600 hpa fig 4d with the condensation temperature of 275 5 k ε 11 47 the isotopic makeup of the advected vapour undergoing condensation was 19 0 the evaporative loss from the raindrops necessary to arrive at the observed isotopic composition 1 6 of rainfall is estimated to be 52 at a column averaged rh of 58 this suggests large scale post condensation modification via kinetic processes which is expected to result in a large variation in d excess it is observed that isotopically enriched depleted daily rain events were associated with low high rh and low high d excess up to 10 15 this could be explained by significant variation in daily surface rh ranging from 40 60 the most depleted average monthly δ18o value of 9 4 was observed in the month of august high olr 232 w m2 and very low upward vertical wind velocity 0 05 pa s at 500 hpa suggested no convection it is known that in the month of august the ism transports moisture from the bob jeelani et al 2017 the cloud top height in august was 443 8 hpa and clwc remained consistently high between 850 and 500 hpa with the peak at 775 hpa fig 4h the condensation temperature at 775 hpa was 290 6 k ε 10 02 the isotopic makeup of advected condensing vapour was found to be 19 8 the evaporative loss necessary to arrive at observed isotopic composition of 9 4 is estimated to be 8 under the column averaged rh of 75 the d excess for most 11 out of 13 rainy days of august ranged between 10 and 17 the relatively high d excess suggests a small degree of post condensation modification which can be explained by high surface rh values ranging between 73 and 92 4 2 jorhat a local meteoric water line based on 257 daily rain samples at jorhat is shown in fig 6b the slope 8 3 0 1 of meteoric water line is similar to gmwl but the intercept 13 1 is higher than the gmwl the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess of all the samples were found to be 6 8 and 11 respectively isotopically most enriched rain events were also observed during the pre monsoon months whereas most depleted rain events have occurred during monsoon and post monsoon the higher values of intercept and the average d excess suggest significant contribution of locally derived moisture in the precipitation throughout the year the widespread wetlands and low lying flood plains of jorhat are fed by annual floods in brahmaputra river achyuthan et al 2013 bringing isotopically depleted 12 lambs et al 2005 glacial meltwater during ism it is expected that surface water present in the wetlands and flood plains during monsoon months undergoes evaporative isotopic enrichment until next monsoon it is to be noted fig 7b that evaporative enrichment in 18o jan june is not accompanied by associated lower values of d excess this is due to the fact that relative humidity at jorhat remains high 85 throughout the year and therefore although significant evaporation occurs due to availability of water the kinetic fractionation effects are minimized it is also to be noted that there are two highly depleted 22 rain events in post monsoon months possibly due to stray meteorological events such as localized convection the most enriched 1 4 monthly amount weighted δ18o value of rain was also observed in the month of april low olr 228 w m2 and high vertical wind velocity at 500 hpa ω 0 15 pa s were observed during april indicative of strong convection this seems to be associated with strong convection of locally available enriched surface waters driven by the nor westers also locally known as kal baishakhi laskar et al 2015 the maximum clwc was found between 850 and 550 hpa peaking at 700 hpa fig 4a hence the condensation temperature of 270 7 k at clwc peak 700 hpa was used for the computation of fractionation ε 11 98 and isotopic composition of initial liquid condensate the evaporative loss from the initial liquid condensate necessary to obtain the observed isotopic value of rain is estimated to be 15 at a column averaged rh of 79 the most depleted δ18o 8 0 monthly averaged isotopic value of rain was observed in july which was associated with relatively weaker convection olr 197 w m2 and ω 0 08 pa s than that in april due to significant rainfall and flooding of brahmaputra river with isotopically depleted 12 lambs et al 2005 water the availability of isotopically depleted moisture increases in july compared to april resulting in higher column average rh 88 the isotopic dilution of surface waters due to flooding in the brahmaputra in the month of july is also evident in the isotopic composition of modelled surface vapour obtained from lmdz iso gcm which is found to be isotopically depleted 13 8 in july compared to april 10 6 the clwc was also found to be high for a wider range within pressure levels of 850 to 550 hpa with the peak in clwc at 800 hpa fig 4e the condensation temperature at this peak of clwc was found to be 273 6 k with ε 11 67 the evaporative loss from the initial liquid condensate necessary to obtain the observed isotopic value of rain is estimated to be 4 such a lower evaporative loss in july compared to that in april can be explained as due to highly saturated vapour column rh 88 in july compared to 79 in april 4 3 ahmedabad based on 101 daily rain samples a local meteoric water line for ahmedabad is plotted in fig 6c the lower slope 7 6 0 1 and intercept 7 1 compared to that of gmwl suggest significant evaporation from falling raindrops the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess were 4 8 and 9 respectively the most enriched monthly amount weighted average δ18o of 2 2 was observed in the month of june high olr 250 w m2 and downward winds at 500 hpa 0 0006 pa s indicate the absence of convection it is also known that during june most of the moisture is advected from the arabian sea owing to ism oza et al 2020 hence advection has been considered as the primary moisture transport mechanism operating in june at ahmedabad cloud top height of 498 hpa was observed along with the clwc peaking sharply at 800 hpa fig 4c with condensation temperature of 292 9 k at which the value of ε is 9 81 the δ18o of advected moisture at 800 hpa was 13 3 the evaporative loss was computed to be 8 at the observed column average rh of 46 however the low d excess 5 associated with most enriched δ18o values 5 cannot be explained by such a low estimated value of evaporation from falling raindrop the probable reason for the underestimation of evaporative loss from the falling raindrops could be due to overestimation of residual vapour fraction fc 92 33 this overestimation arises due to the fact that there are only a few rainy days during june discretely spread across the month while the pwc and rf values are averaged over the month as discussed in methodology section the most depleted average δ18o 4 8 was found in the month of august although based on long term 1998 2013 trmm data oza et al 2020 have shown that convective rain proportion increases progressively during ism the advected moisture from the arabian sea is the primary source of moisture for rain at ahmedabad during august low olr 202 w m2 along with minimal upward wind velocity 0 01 pa s at 500 hpa during august 2010 suggests negligible convective activity therefore computations are done considering the advective system for this case the cloud top height of 344 9 hpa was observed with maximum clwc ranging between 700 and 875 hpa and the peak at 825 hpa fig 4g at which the condensation temperature was 291 4 k ε 9 95 the isotopic makeup of the rain forming moisture was found to be 16 03 the evaporative loss necessary to arrive at the observed isotopic composition of rain 4 8 is estimated to be 8 at column average rh of 81 4 4 hyderabad a local meteoric water line comprising a total of 123 daily rain samples collected from hyderabad during 2010 11 is plotted in fig 6d the slope 7 1 0 1 lower than that of gmwl suggests significant evaporation from falling raindrops isotopically some of the most depleted as well as most enriched rain samples were found during pre monsoon the enriched δ18o samples are associated with low d excess fig 7d which again suggests evaporation from falling raindrops whereas the samples with depleted δ18o were associated with high d excess fig 7d suggesting recycled moisture froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 during monsoonal months δ18o of rain samples range from 8 2 to 1 5 with d excess ranging from 0 to 21 samples depleted in δ18o and associated with low d excess might suggest significant rainout history whereas samples with low δ18o and high d excess suggest the contribution of locally recycled moisture in addition there were very few samples with enriched δ18o and low d excess during monsoon indicating evaporation from falling raindrops most of the post monsoon samples were depleted in δ18o 7 9 to 1 0 and d excess ranged from 2 to 13 which suggests varying degree of rainout probably from the bob due to retreating ism the amount weighted average δ18o and d excess of all samples were 4 0 and 10 respectively the most enriched monthly amount weighted average δ18o 0 3 value was found in the month of may downward vertical wind velocity 0 022 pa s at 500 hpa and high olr value 260 w m2 indicates the absence of convection the clwc was found to peak sharply at 550 hpa fig 4b and therefore temperature of condensation at 550 hpa 272 4 k was used to compute ε 11 80 due to absence of convection the isotopic composition 18 8 of advected vapour at 550 hpa was used to estimate the δ18o of condensate for column averaged rh of 59 3 the observed isotopic composition of rain 0 3 was achieved from the rain forming cloud at an estimated the evaporative loss of 29 suggesting significant role of evaporation from falling raindrop this is further supported by low average rain amount of 6 mm day and low average d excess of 1 3 the most depleted isotopic values at hyderabad were found in august with the average δ18o of 6 1 low olr 198 w m2 along with small vertical upward velocity 0 03 pa s at 500 hpa indicated low to mid convective strength cloud top height of 345 hpa was observed with clwc ranging consistently high between 550 and 800 hpa with a peak at 750 hpa fig 4f the condensation temperature at 750 hpa was 286 9 k which was used to compute fractionation ε 10 35 the column averaged rh was found to be 84 the δ18o of rain forming vapour was computed to be 18 7 the estimated evaporative loss necessary to obtain observed isotopic composition of rain 6 1 from the rain forming vapour is 15 fig 8 compares the evaporative loss column average atmospheric rh and the observed isotopic composition of rain for the months with most enriched and most depleted amount weighted average δ18o values for all the four stations it can be seen that for each station except for ahmedabad the lower column average atmospheric rh values are associated with higher evaporative loss and vice versa fig 9 also shows high correlation r2 75 p 0 05 between column averaged rh and evaporative loss from the falling raindrops for the months with most enriched and most depleted rain δ18o values for all the four stations with an exception in case of june rainfall at ahmedabad where evaporative loss is underestimated due to the reasons discussed earlier section 4 3 fig 9 shows that the column averaged rh is a major controlling factor for evaporation from falling raindrops estimated in this study which confirms that the method of computation realistically accounts for the kinetic process during evaporation from falling raindrops 5 conclusion using the isotopic composition of daily rainwater samples in conjunction with satellite based atmospheric observations and model derived meteorological parameters evaporative loss from falling raindrops has been estimated in four different climatic zones of indian sub continent a more realistic indian meteoric water line imwl better representing the different climatic zones also including the semi arid western india has been defined δd 7 6 0 1 δ18o 8 1 r2 0 96 p 0 05 n 556 the slope 7 6 0 1 lower than that of gmwl signifies the role of evaporation from falling rain in the indian subcontinent though it is surrounded by large marine water body and bordered by lofty himalayan mountains in the north obstructing the monsoonal winds exhaustive computations involving combination of isotope data of daily rainwater samples and various other meteorological parameters have been done for the months with most enriched and most depleted amount weighted monthly averaged isotopic composition of rain at all the four stations as these are indicative of specific hydrometeorological processes and factors such as convection advection degree of saturation and cloud liquid content important values of computed and observed parameters are given in table 2 some of the important insights derived from this study are given below 1 the estimated values of maximum and minimum evaporative loss from falling raindrops for the four stations are jammu maximum 52 and minimum 8 jorhat max 15 and min 4 hyderabad max 29 and min 15 and ahmedabad min 8 2 increased availability of surface waters due to flood in brahmaputra river and high column average rh of 88 results in the lowest evaporative loss from falling raindrops at jorhat 3 isotopically depleted rain is associated with high clwc over a longer span of altitude which facilitates the interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapour in addition high column averaged rh further retards the evaporation of falling raindrops and maintains the isotopic depletion due to long span of clwc 4 the extent of evaporative loss from falling raindrop is found to be inversely related to column average rh for all stations 1 fe 100 1 2 0 3 rh 111 24 r 2 0 75 p 0 05 this also confirms that the scheme of computation in this study accounts for the post condensation kinetic processes realistically 5 the isotopic compositions of lmdz iso modelled rain at four locations across the indian subcontinent are found to be isotopically depleted compared to the observed rain this negative isotopic bias in the modelled rain arises because it fails to incorporate evaporative isotopic enrichment under low rh condition due to significant spatial variation in the

5122,long term meteorological drought can lead to hydrological drought by restricting water resources required by humans such as streamflow and reservoir storage we developed two new indices for monitoring hydrologic drought based satellite derived evapotranspiration a major factor in hydrological drought occurrence the water budget based drought index wbdi estimates potential runoff by the differences between precipitation and evapotranspiration using water budget analysis while the energy based water deficit index ewdi is an index of available water capacity through evapotranspiration and soil moisture based on solar radiation using energy budget analysis we used these along with the existing standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei based on precipitation atmospheric temperature and evapotranspiration to map the spatiotemporal patterns of drought on the korean peninsula from 2001 to 2014 for validation against actual drought conditions we compared the results with streamflow data from five gauging stations in south korea ewdi the diagnostic approach performed best when assessing current hydrological drought conditions while wbdi and spei prognostic approach best captured drought conditions after 2 3 months of lag time our results confirmed that evapotranspiration is a major factor affecting hydrological drought the new methods demonstrated here make it possible to evaluate drought through diagnostic and prognostic perspectives depending on the situation thereby improving scientific drought evaluation capacity keywords hydrological drought evapotranspiration water budget based drought index energy based water deficit index remote sensing spei 1 introduction in the last two decades prolonged droughts lasting for over a year have frequently occurred around the world keyantash and dracup 2002 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 mu et al 2013 many can be classified as hydrological droughts that cause a shortage of available water resources needed for human life such as river discharge or reservoir storage van loon 2015 zhang et al 2015 the basic concept of analyzing hydrological drought is the hydrologic cycle precipitation and evapotranspiration are essential factors to consider when evaluating hydrological drought due to their close relationship with available water resources in the hydrologic cycle zhang et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to analyze hydrological drought through changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration doesken and garen 1991 anderson et al 2007 2011 2013 leng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 liu et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010 wu et al 2018 guo et al 2020 anderson et al 2007 2011 2013 developed the evaporative stress index esi a drought index using the ratio of potential to actual evapotranspiration and produced a drought map of the united states for comparison with the existing standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi vicente serrano et al 2010 developed a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to assess drought based on the probabilistic distribution of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and compared its hydrological monitoring performance with the spi liu et al 2017 developed a new drought index the standardized wetness index swi based on the ratio of spei to actual evapotranspiration huang et al 2017 examined the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought through seasonal characteristics wu et al 2018 analyzed relationship between hydrological and meteorological drought for reservoir operation perspectives doesken and garen 1991 proposed a hydrological drought index surface water supply index swsi to identify drought conditions associated with hydrological fluctuations using streamflow reservoir storage and precipitation however these drought indices have several limitations in the case of the spei the requirement for a serially complete dataset for both temperature and precipitation may limit its use due to insufficient data being available being a monthly index rapidly developing drought situations may not be identified rapidly vicente serrano et al 2010 wmo 2016 for the swsi as data sources change or additional data are included the entire index has to undergo recalculation to account for these changes in the inputs making it difficult to construct a homogeneous time series as calculations may vary between basins it is difficult to compare basins or homogeneous regions doesken and garen 1991 wmo 2016 the conventional drought indices have been considered based on the hydrometeorological variables measured by the network of in situ data tools whereas using satellite data is robust substituted by providing decisive hydrometeorological variables for drought analysis at the enormously higher spatial scale than the capability of in situ network devices sur et al 2019 because satellite based datasets have a fixed spatio temporal resolution there may be limitations depending on the research objectives for example in a study that performs a drought analysis of a subcatchment scale if a passive microwave sensor output is used accurate analysis cannot be performed because the spatial resolution is too coarse however since the goal of this study is to analyze the monthly drought on a regional scale it is essential to use satellite data in this study in addition there is another advantage to using satellite data conventional drought indices cannot be calculated in ungauged areas while satellite data can be used to overcome these shortcomings notably the korean peninsula which is a study area includes north korea and it is challenging to obtain ground observation data for north korea due to political problems however because this study used satellite data drought analysis of the entire korean peninsula including north korea could be performed details of the satellite data utilized are given in section 2 2 other previous studies analyzing hydrological droughts have developed many drought indices a common feature of the indices developed is the application of the circulation of water and energy among them zhang et al 2019 developed a standardized moisture anomaly index szi using potential evapotranspiration and analyzed the global scale in different climatic zones particularly the szi was estimated using the water energy balance approach in the basic water budget equation the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration was assumed as runoff and the value of evapotranspiration was calculated by applying the energy balance concept the method of standardizing the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration proposed by zhang et al 2019 was used to analyze the hydrological drought in this study the drought index using the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration is termed as the water budget based drought index wbdi in this study the wbdi is advantageous in its ability to predict potentially available water content for the near future using the water balance equation details of the newly developed wbdi are given in section 3 1 1 in addition for comparison we applied the energy based water deficit index ewdi proposed by sur et al 2015a sur et al 2015b formulated by combining actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture through the energy budget algorithm the calculated wbdi and ewdi were compared by estimating these along with the spei based on precipitation and temperature fluctuations for the korean peninsula from 2001 to 2014 the results were verified by comparison with actual drought conditions drawn from observed streamflow data the year 2001 and 2014 when the most severe drought occurred on the korean peninsula were set as the testing period both wbdi and ewdi are revised indices based on the drought index developed in previous studies the main difference between the two indices is the physical concept of drought analysis for water and energy budget perspectives a study that comparatively analyzes and verifies hydrological phenomena according to two concepts has been conducted before but few studies have been conducted on the korean peninsula region which is a study area through comparison and verification in a specific area it is possible to analyze whether hydrological phenomena are interpreted according to physical concepts 2 materials 2 1 study area the korean peninsula is located in northeast asia between 33 and 43 latitude and 124 132 longitude with a total area of 219 020 km2 and altitude ranges of 0 2 744 m hwang et al 2013 the region has a monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1 100 mm that latitudinally varies from north korea 919 7 mm to south korea 1 307 7 mm land cover is categorized by the igbp classification using modis global landcover product mcd12q1 fig 1 2 2 data to estimate drought indices various satellite data set such as modis tropical rainfall measuring mission 3b42 trmm 3b42 and global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm gpm imerg were used table 1 modis products were used vegetation indices evapotranspiration and soil moisture as input data for hydrological drought indices the trmm and gpm were used to calculate precipitation data previous studies have been conducted to verify these satellite based input data on the korean peninsula kim et al 2012 2017 sur and choi 2013 sur et al 2015a 2015b 2019 2020 through these studies the reliability of the satellite input data was verified and applied in this study the modis land surface temperature lst of mod11a1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of mod13a3 leaf area index lai of mod15a2 evapotranspiration et of mod16a2 global landcover product of mcd12q1 and land surface albedo of mcd43b3 for the period 2001 2014 were used the land data mod11 mod13 mod15 mod16 and mcd43 except mcd12 provided by modis were characterized by spatial resolutions of 1 km 1 km with temporal resolutions varying between 1 8 and 16 days the mcd12q1 landcover data had a spatial resolution of 500 m 500 m and provided yearly observations the mod07l2 atmospheric data had a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km and provided 4 6 observations per day various modis products have different spatio temporal resolutions as these products were combined to calculate the drought index they must be unified using the same resolution first the spatial resolution is integrated with a spatial resolution of 1 km for coarse spatial resolutions such as mod07 each grid is split into grids of 1 km and the same value is distributed in contrast the mcd12 land cover uses the average of the surrounding four grids as the spatial resolution in the case of temporal resolution it is unified on a daily scale for the 8 day product the same value is matched for the remaining 7 days from the starting point similarly the 16 day product matches the same value for the remaining 15 days from the starting point irregularly provided data like mod07 is converted to a daily value using a sinusoidal method the sinusoidal method is described in detail in hwang et al 2013 the trmm and gpm precipitation data were used to calculate hydrological drought indices as an input variable therefore the trmm data were used for the period before the gpm data from 2001 to 2014 trmm data provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https www nasa gov were used post 2014 gpm data was used in order to calculate the hydrological drought index the spatio temporal resolution was unified the temporal resolution was set to daily value in the case of the trmm as data were collected every 3 hr eight values are averaged to calculate daily values further in the case of the gpm as precipitation data were produced every 30 min 48 values were used to calculate the daily average the spatial resolution was downscaled using the spatial correction technique to enable comparison with the modis products the spatial correction process was as follows 1 calculate the error ratio of the grid of raw data trmm and gpm corresponding to the point observation data and the point position 2 interpolate the error rate calculated at the point observation position with a 1 km grid using the idw technique 3 calculate the satellite precipitation value corrected using point data by multiplying the error rate of the 1 km grid with raw data a detailed description of the spatial correction technique for satellite precipitation data was presented in park et al 2018a park et al 2018b and jang et al 2017 in addition we used streamflow measured at five gauging stations fig 1 to verify the hydrological drought indices data acquired from http www hrfco go kr sumun waterlevellist do recently researches on changes in hydrological drought conditions due to anthropogenic impacts have been introduced sivapalan et al 2012 van loon 2015 however since this study aims to analyze the relationship between the hydrological drought condition and the streamflow according to the physical processes excluding the anthropogenic influence the streamflow data observed at the gauging station was used to verify drought indices since the streamflow measured at these five stations is a natural river hardly affected by human impacts it was used to verify the physical characteristics of hydrological drought 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological drought indices in this study hydrological droughts were compared in terms of the water and energy balance equation evapotranspiration is the most important variable to be considered when applying the water and energy balance equation yilmaz et al 2014 farhadi et al 2014 2016 both equations use evapotranspiration as an input variable wherein the concept of hydrological drought index is determined by the physical meaning of each evapotranspiration first in the case of ewdi based on the energy balance equation the evapotranspiration is calculated using solar radiation this is the process of evaluating the evapotranspiration according to the amount of inflow and outflow to the surface in the form of radiant energy solar radiation is physically considered in terms of heat as the surface heats up the amount of evapotranspiration increases farhadi et al 2014 2016 sur et al 2013 2015a 2015b in the case of water balance evapotranspiration is caused by the liquefaction and vaporization of water particles water on the surface in the form of rainfall is converted to the gaseous state because of high temperature and water stored in plant stems is released as vapor gaseous state through photosynthesis as compared to evapotranspiration in the energy balance evapotranspiration in the water balance is produced by changing the state of water by preferential temperature changes oki and kanae 2006 because of these physical differences water balance can be defined as the prognostic perspective yilmaz et al 2014 while energy balance can be defined as the diagnostic perspective farhadi et al 2016 the hydrological drought indices wbdi and ewdi were calculated according to these prognostic and diagnostic perspectives considering the prognostic perspective wbdi is an index of the amount of potential future available water while the ewdi adopts a diagnostic perspective by determining real time drought conditions based on the energy budget as reflected by the environment change fig 2 3 1 1 wbdi the wbdi is a water based hydrological drought index that defines the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration as surface runoff and subsurface runoff in a water budget equation 1 p e d s r where p is the precipitation mm e is the actual evapotranspiration mm ds is the soil moisture change mm and r is the potential runoff mm this result is treated as runoff potential in the basin and expressed as an index 2 wbdi z p e where z denotes the standardization the wbdi estimated through the water balance formula adopts a short term prognostic approach by defining hydrological droughts through potential near future runoff rather than monitoring current precipitation and drought conditions through evapotranspiration 3 1 2 ewdi the ewdi is a hydrological drought index that combines energy budget based evapotranspiration and

as a multidimensional drought index that can monitor both short term and long term drought with reference to the duration of precipitation deficit spei is calculated using the probability distribution

atmosphere into potential evaporation units the spei similar to the spi was an index calculated according to a probability distribution thus the results of various durations might be estimated because the hydrological drought appears after some time has elapsed since the onset of drought we have chosen three month time scale other related researches also have used an index on a three month time scale when analyzing hydrological drought lee et al 2017 nam et al 2017 bae et al 2018 this is because more effective monitoring can be conducted when a three month drought index was used 3 2 verification in order to verify the three hydrological drought indices we used the error matrix method with observed streamflow data from the five gauging stations which were standardized for better quantitative comparison an error matrix method is a formed array that consists of drought or wet conditions as compared to the category of drought by the in situ streamflow data the median 50 of the standardized streamflow was set as the threshold for moderate drought while the lower quantile 25 was set as the threshold for severe drought when the value of the standardized streamflow is less than the threshold it is considered a drought condition the fallouts of the matrix are represented to obtain the accuracy of drought the accuracy of drought is the ratio of all observation datasets determined as drought conditions by both the index and the observation datasets to the total number of drought conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 temporal patterns of hydrological drought indices as per the statistical analysis of past hydrometeorological records since the year 2000 severe droughts have occurred in the korean peninsula in 2001 2007 to 2008 and 2014 to 2015 kwon et al 2016 jang et al 2016 park et al 2018a 2018b jang et al 2016 selected the most severe periods of drought by analyzing outliers of monthly rainfall over the last 40 years among them severe spring droughts in the southern part of south korea were reported in 2001 kwon et al 2016 analyzed droughts in korea from 2013 to 2015 they reported that hydrological droughts occurred as the dam water level gradually decreased during the period in particular in 2014 not only did the drought occur severely but the rainfall recorded less than 50 of the normal year based on the results of the previous studies this study selects 2001 and 2014 as a testing period during the selected target period we analyzed the temporal variations of the ewdi wbdi and spei 3 fig 3 spei 3 and wbdi showed similar fluctuation in temporal patterns for most years reflecting the similarity between the two indices which both use precipitation and evapotranspiration as inputs ewdi closely tracked the streamflow data while wbdi and spei 3 followed a similar pattern with some time lag calculating the lag correlation between the hydrological drought indices and streamflow data showed that ewdi had the highest correlation with current flow data with little lag while wbdi and spei 3 showed high correlations after a lag time of 2 to 3 months fig 4 as ewdi follows a diagnostic perspective based on solar radiation its correlation with streamflow was highest when the lag time was between zero and one on the other hand as wbdi and spei 3 projected future drought conditions by indexing potential water capacity in terms of future runoff these showed the highest correlation with positive lag times 4 2 spatial distributions of hydrological drought indices to further assess the results we plotted the spatial distributions of spei 3 ewdi and wbdi for the severe drought years of 2001 and 2014 fig 5 to analyze the spatial distribution of drought a normalized drought classification should be established in particular if a new index is developed it is essential to establish a drought classification by comparing it with the existing indices for example mu et al 2013 developed dsi and compared it with pdsi to establish the drought classification eleven drought categories of the existing pdsi were applied to the dsi thus in this study the drought classification of the wbdi and ewdi has been set through the existing drought index spei various drought grade intervals were established and compared with the results of the spei when compared to the same ranges as the drought classification of spei the spatial distribution of droughts was shown highly accurate drought classification is divided into eight levels and is described in table 2 the color of each category in table 2 is the same as the color of each grade in fig 5 since most droughts on the korean peninsula begin in spring and end in fall the figure shows data from april to october according to the investigative report of drought record 2001 the 2001 drought began in the winter of 2000 and was relieved briefly from march to april 2001 before resuming from may to june severe drought occurred primarily in the northwest part of south korea during this period ewdi indicated non drought conditions in april and severe drought conditions in may and june while wbdi and spei 3 indicated drought onset from april to may followed by mild relief from june to july and re intensification in august this is consistent with ewdi focusing on current drought conditions while wbdi and spei 3 indicate a lag time of 2 3 months according to the investigative report of drought record 2015 the 2014 drought lasted a long time in 37 regions of northwestern and western south korea resulting in lowered reservoir levels and other serious impacts for example the soyang river dam in northeastern south korea suffered seriously lowered water levels from july 2014 to the following year 4 3 error analysis the drought accuracy for each index was about 60 80 at all five sites table 3 ewdi showed high accuracy for moderate drought and wbdi and spei 3 for severe drought the latter two are prognostic and represent potential runoff hence they are highly accurate for severe drought conditions in which considerable time has elapsed from drought onset while the ewdi is diagnostic and has a relatively high accuracy for moderate drought conditions because it considers current conditions more closely all three indices were suitable for determining hydrological drought conditions each index can be used separately according to the desired prognostic and or diagnostic perspective required to analyze hydrological drought accurately 5 conclusions we proposed and tested two new satellite based hydrologic drought indices based on the water budget wbdi and energy budget ewdi and applied these along with the existing spei 3 index based on precipitation atmospheric temperature and evapotranspiration to the korean peninsula for the period 2001 to 2014 we then compared the spatial results for the severe drought years of 2001 and 2014 and verified the accuracy of all three methods by comparison with streamflow data from five gauging stations the correlation between the prognostic wbdi and streamflow was highest after a lag time of 2 3 months with 80 accuracy for severe drought conditions the correlation between diagnostic ewdi and streamflow was highest with a shorter lag time showing 70 accuracy for moderate drought conditions although various drought indices that can interpret hydrological droughts the specific conditions can vary even under the same hydrological drought status therefore different drought indices can provide more nuanced information regarding drought conditions credit authorship contribution

5122,long term meteorological drought can lead to hydrological drought by restricting water resources required by humans such as streamflow and reservoir storage we developed two new indices for monitoring hydrologic drought based satellite derived evapotranspiration a major factor in hydrological drought occurrence the water budget based drought index wbdi estimates potential runoff by the differences between precipitation and evapotranspiration using water budget analysis while the energy based water deficit index ewdi is an index of available water capacity through evapotranspiration and soil moisture based on solar radiation using energy budget analysis we used these along with the existing standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei based on precipitation atmospheric temperature and evapotranspiration to map the spatiotemporal patterns of drought on the korean peninsula from 2001 to 2014 for validation against actual drought conditions we compared the results with streamflow data from five gauging stations in south korea ewdi the diagnostic approach performed best when assessing current hydrological drought conditions while wbdi and spei prognostic approach best captured drought conditions after 2 3 months of lag time our results confirmed that evapotranspiration is a major factor affecting hydrological drought the new methods demonstrated here make it possible to evaluate drought through diagnostic and prognostic perspectives depending on the situation thereby improving scientific drought evaluation capacity keywords hydrological drought evapotranspiration water budget based drought index energy based water deficit index remote sensing spei 1 introduction in the last two decades prolonged droughts lasting for over a year have frequently occurred around the world keyantash and dracup 2002 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 mu et al 2013 many can be classified as hydrological droughts that cause a shortage of available water resources needed for human life such as river discharge or reservoir storage van loon 2015 zhang et al 2015 the basic concept of analyzing hydrological drought is the hydrologic cycle precipitation and evapotranspiration are essential factors to consider when evaluating hydrological drought due to their close relationship with available water resources in the hydrologic cycle zhang et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to analyze hydrological drought through changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration doesken and garen 1991 anderson et al 2007 2011 2013 leng et al 2015 huang et al 2017 liu et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010 wu et al 2018 guo et al 2020 anderson et al 2007 2011 2013 developed the evaporative stress index esi a drought index using the ratio of potential to actual evapotranspiration and produced a drought map of the united states for comparison with the existing standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi vicente serrano et al 2010 developed a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to assess drought based on the probabilistic distribution of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and compared its hydrological monitoring performance with the spi liu et al 2017 developed a new drought index the standardized wetness index swi based on the ratio of spei to actual evapotranspiration huang et al 2017 examined the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought through seasonal characteristics wu et al 2018 analyzed relationship between hydrological and meteorological drought for reservoir operation perspectives doesken and garen 1991 proposed a hydrological drought index surface water supply index swsi to identify drought conditions associated with hydrological fluctuations using streamflow reservoir storage and precipitation however these drought indices have several limitations in the case of the spei the requirement for a serially complete dataset for both temperature and precipitation may limit its use due to insufficient data being available being a monthly index rapidly developing drought situations may not be identified rapidly vicente serrano et al 2010 wmo 2016 for the swsi as data sources change or additional data are included the entire index has to undergo recalculation to account for these changes in the inputs making it difficult to construct a homogeneous time series as calculations may vary between basins it is difficult to compare basins or homogeneous regions doesken and garen 1991 wmo 2016 the conventional drought indices have been considered based on the hydrometeorological variables measured by the network of in situ data tools whereas using satellite data is robust substituted by providing decisive hydrometeorological variables for drought analysis at the enormously higher spatial scale than the capability of in situ network devices sur et al 2019 because satellite based datasets have a fixed spatio temporal resolution there may be limitations depending on the research objectives for example in a study that performs a drought analysis of a subcatchment scale if a passive microwave sensor output is used accurate analysis cannot be performed because the spatial resolution is too coarse however since the goal of this study is to analyze the monthly drought on a regional scale it is essential to use satellite data in this study in addition there is another advantage to using satellite data conventional drought indices cannot be calculated in ungauged areas while satellite data can be used to overcome these shortcomings notably the korean peninsula which is a study area includes north korea and it is challenging to obtain ground observation data for north korea due to political problems however because this study used satellite data drought analysis of the entire korean peninsula including north korea could be performed details of the satellite data utilized are given in section 2 2 other previous studies analyzing hydrological droughts have developed many drought indices a common feature of the indices developed is the application of the circulation of water and energy among them zhang et al 2019 developed a standardized moisture anomaly index szi using potential evapotranspiration and analyzed the global scale in different climatic zones particularly the szi was estimated using the water energy balance approach in the basic water budget equation the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration was assumed as runoff and the value of evapotranspiration was calculated by applying the energy balance concept the method of standardizing the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration proposed by zhang et al 2019 was used to analyze the hydrological drought in this study the drought index using the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration is termed as the water budget based drought index wbdi in this study the wbdi is advantageous in its ability to predict potentially available water content for the near future using the water balance equation details of the newly developed wbdi are given in section 3 1 1 in addition for comparison we applied the energy based water deficit index ewdi proposed by sur et al 2015a sur et al 2015b formulated by combining actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture through the energy budget algorithm the calculated wbdi and ewdi were compared by estimating these along with the spei based on precipitation and temperature fluctuations for the korean peninsula from 2001 to 2014 the results were verified by comparison with actual drought conditions drawn from observed streamflow data the year 2001 and 2014 when the most severe drought occurred on the korean peninsula were set as the testing period both wbdi and ewdi are revised indices based on the drought index developed in previous studies the main difference between the two indices is the physical concept of drought analysis for water and energy budget perspectives a study that comparatively analyzes and verifies hydrological phenomena according to two concepts has been conducted before but few studies have been conducted on the korean peninsula region which is a study area through comparison and verification in a specific area it is possible to analyze whether hydrological phenomena are interpreted according to physical concepts 2 materials 2 1 study area the korean peninsula is located in northeast asia between 33 and 43 latitude and 124 132 longitude with a total area of 219 020 km2 and altitude ranges of 0 2 744 m hwang et al 2013 the region has a monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1 100 mm that latitudinally varies from north korea 919 7 mm to south korea 1 307 7 mm land cover is categorized by the igbp classification using modis global landcover product mcd12q1 fig 1 2 2 data to estimate drought indices various satellite data set such as modis tropical rainfall measuring mission 3b42 trmm 3b42 and global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm gpm imerg were used table 1 modis products were used vegetation indices evapotranspiration and soil moisture as input data for hydrological drought indices the trmm and gpm were used to calculate precipitation data previous studies have been conducted to verify these satellite based input data on the korean peninsula kim et al 2012 2017 sur and choi 2013 sur et al 2015a 2015b 2019 2020 through these studies the reliability of the satellite input data was verified and applied in this study the modis land surface temperature lst of mod11a1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of mod13a3 leaf area index lai of mod15a2 evapotranspiration et of mod16a2 global landcover product of mcd12q1 and land surface albedo of mcd43b3 for the period 2001 2014 were used the land data mod11 mod13 mod15 mod16 and mcd43 except mcd12 provided by modis were characterized by spatial resolutions of 1 km 1 km with temporal resolutions varying between 1 8 and 16 days the mcd12q1 landcover data had a spatial resolution of 500 m 500 m and provided yearly observations the mod07l2 atmospheric data had a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km and provided 4 6 observations per day various modis products have different spatio temporal resolutions as these products were combined to calculate the drought index they must be unified using the same resolution first the spatial resolution is integrated with a spatial resolution of 1 km for coarse spatial resolutions such as mod07 each grid is split into grids of 1 km and the same value is distributed in contrast the mcd12 land cover uses the average of the surrounding four grids as the spatial resolution in the case of temporal resolution it is unified on a daily scale for the 8 day product the same value is matched for the remaining 7 days from the starting point similarly the 16 day product matches the same value for the remaining 15 days from the starting point irregularly provided data like mod07 is converted to a daily value using a sinusoidal method the sinusoidal method is described in detail in hwang et al 2013 the trmm and gpm precipitation data were used to calculate hydrological drought indices as an input variable therefore the trmm data were used for the period before the gpm data from 2001 to 2014 trmm data provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https www nasa gov were used post 2014 gpm data was used in order to calculate the hydrological drought index the spatio temporal resolution was unified the temporal resolution was set to daily value in the case of the trmm as data were collected every 3 hr eight values are averaged to calculate daily values further in the case of the gpm as precipitation data were produced every 30 min 48 values were used to calculate the daily average the spatial resolution was downscaled using the spatial correction technique to enable comparison with the modis products the spatial correction process was as follows 1 calculate the error ratio of the grid of raw data trmm and gpm corresponding to the point observation data and the point position 2 interpolate the error rate calculated at the point observation position with a 1 km grid using the idw technique 3 calculate the satellite precipitation value corrected using point data by multiplying the error rate of the 1 km grid with raw data a detailed description of the spatial correction technique for satellite precipitation data was presented in park et al 2018a park et al 2018b and jang et al 2017 in addition we used streamflow measured at five gauging stations fig 1 to verify the hydrological drought indices data acquired from http www hrfco go kr sumun waterlevellist do recently researches on changes in hydrological drought conditions due to anthropogenic impacts have been introduced sivapalan et al 2012 van loon 2015 however since this study aims to analyze the relationship between the hydrological drought condition and the streamflow according to the physical processes excluding the anthropogenic influence the streamflow data observed at the gauging station was used to verify drought indices since the streamflow measured at these five stations is a natural river hardly affected by human impacts it was used to verify the physical characteristics of hydrological drought 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological drought indices in this study hydrological droughts were compared in terms of the water and energy balance equation evapotranspiration is the most important variable to be considered when applying the water and energy balance equation yilmaz et al 2014 farhadi et al 2014 2016 both equations use evapotranspiration as an input variable wherein the concept of hydrological drought index is determined by the physical meaning of each evapotranspiration first in the case of ewdi based on the energy balance equation the evapotranspiration is calculated using solar radiation this is the process of evaluating the evapotranspiration according to the amount of inflow and outflow to the surface in the form of radiant energy solar radiation is physically considered in terms of heat as the surface heats up the amount of evapotranspiration increases farhadi et al 2014 2016 sur et al 2013 2015a 2015b in the case of water balance evapotranspiration is caused by the liquefaction and vaporization of water particles water on the surface in the form of rainfall is converted to the gaseous state because of high temperature and water stored in plant stems is released as vapor gaseous state through photosynthesis as compared to evapotranspiration in the energy balance evapotranspiration in the water balance is produced by changing the state of water by preferential temperature changes oki and kanae 2006 because of these physical differences water balance can be defined as the prognostic perspective yilmaz et al 2014 while energy balance can be defined as the diagnostic perspective farhadi et al 2016 the hydrological drought indices wbdi and ewdi were calculated according to these prognostic and diagnostic perspectives considering the prognostic perspective wbdi is an index of the amount of potential future available water while the ewdi adopts a diagnostic perspective by determining real time drought conditions based on the energy budget as reflected by the environment change fig 2 3 1 1 wbdi the wbdi is a water based hydrological drought index that defines the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration as surface runoff and subsurface runoff in a water budget equation 1 p e d s r where p is the precipitation mm e is the actual evapotranspiration mm ds is the soil moisture change mm and r is the potential runoff mm this result is treated as runoff potential in the basin and expressed as an index 2 wbdi z p e where z denotes the standardization the wbdi estimated through the water balance formula adopts a short term prognostic approach by defining hydrological droughts through potential near future runoff rather than monitoring current precipitation and drought conditions through evapotranspiration 3 1 2 ewdi the ewdi is a hydrological drought index that combines energy budget based evapotranspiration and soil moisture to express potential water access in the basin considering changes in the natural environment such as vegetation activities changes in surface and air temperature and changes in land use

atmosphere into potential evaporation units the spei similar to the spi was an index calculated according to a probability distribution thus the results of various durations might be estimated because the hydrological drought appears after some time has elapsed since the onset of drought we have chosen three month time scale other related researches also have used an index on a three month time

5123,to bypass the problem of numerical instability in conducting the channel routing system the application of an impulse response function based on the linearization of saint venant equations has been an alternative for predicting streamflow discharge however the distribution type of the impulse response function proposed by dooge et al 1987a is restricted during a flood so this approach cannot adequately describe flow response in practical applications in considering that the flow response in a natural channel is usually influenced by the shape of the cross section the terrain of channel bed and the discharge of the moving flood this study focuses on improving the original unit impulse function by conducting two aspects of analysis 1 the distribution of unit impulse response function was changed with time by adjusting the reference parameters according to the inflow condition and the hydraulic variables 2 the outcome of this modified linear approach was thoroughly examined by comparing the simulated results with that adopting the original linear channel method and the numerical scheme based on the nonlinear saint venant equations moreover for achieving the simulation of a whole river basin a complete executing procedure was provided to explain the connection between the upstream inflows lateral flows and the linear channel response of each channel reach a series of tests showed that the proposed method can produce approximated hydrographs in comparison with numerical simulation results owing to the flexibility of the impulse response function although the linear channel routing adopts simplified mathematical operations a case study of a natural river basin also demonstrated the applicability of the modified channel response system keywords impulse response function linear channel routing saint venant equations 1 introduction computing efficiency and predicted accuracy are the two primary concerns in applying a flood warning system for real time runoff prediction in recent decades a variety of numerical schemes have been continuously proposed and refined to achieve better performance on watershed runoff simulation since the technique of high speed computer with related equipment are developed rapidly the numerical methods are usually considered to have a robust physical interpretation of model structure based on the hydrodynamic equations bates et al 2010 lee and huang 2012 huang and lee 2017 another way for flood simulation is the linearized channel flow routing which applies the convolution integral to bypass any possibility of occurring numerical oscillation dooge and harley 1967 dooge et al 1987a 1987b kirshen and bras 1983 this study intends to ameliorate the linear channel response system by introducing more considerations of geomorphologic and hydrological conditions in the unit impulse response function to implement streamflow simulation the earlier research work about linear channel routing lcr can be traced back to the literature proposed by dooge and harley 1967 they successfully derived the instantaneous hydrologic response function of a channel reach based on a wide rectangular channel by using a linearized formulation from the saint venant equations it should be noted that a certain assumption was declared in this kind of model to compose its fundamental concept the discharge hydrograph at a designated location can be described by the convolution integral of unit impulse response function based on the linear accumulation it has been denoted that the solutions generated by the lcr model were basically reliable for streamflow prediction but the physical significance and structure of the model in describing the hydrological process still need to be improved dooge and harley 1967 dooge et al 1987a 1987b kirshen and bras 1983 researchers further combined the concept of the geomorphologic iuh rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 with the channel response function proposed by dooge and harley 1967 to reflect the influence of stream network pattern on the response of overland flow contributed from the upstream watershed dooge et al 1987a revised the analytical solution of the channel impulse response proposed in 1967 to adapt to any shape of channel cross section and any type of friction law therefore the applicability of this type of linear method was significantly extended they clearly expressed the solution anywhere in the channel in terms of one convolution with a boundary condition at the upstream end and another convolution with the boundary condition at the downstream end dooge and napíorkowski 1984 proposed a diffusion analogy model from the saint venant equations by utilizing an approximation of the inertia terms to evaluate the relative effect of the downstream control on the water level at any intermediate point in the channel reach in addition to using the diffusion approximation to consider the effect of downstream control fenton 2015 developed a one and a half dimensional model of a river that can allow for horizontal curvature by adopting the governing long wave equations with very few limiting approximations this study focuses on strengthening the flexibility of the channel impulse response function that was originally developed by dooge et al 1987a and previously had only a fixed distribution shape during a flood it should be noted that since only the convolution with the upstream boundary condition is applied in this study the modified linear model proposed here is merely applicable to a situation where the downstream boundary is assumed as normal depth also called an open boundary nevertheless such a treatment for the channel is common in flood routing and its applicability can be verified by practical simulations with the discharge records it has been indicated that the solution of the full long wave equations using information only from upstream in the channel with an open downstream boundary can still provide accurate simulations even on small channel slopes fenton 2014 to reflect the influences of geomorphologic and hydrological conditions on the streamflow prediction the unit impulse response function is ameliorated by introducing time varying reference parameters that can change with the inflow condition and the hydraulic variables in this study the numerical solution of an implicit finite difference scheme based on the nonlinear saint venant equations is provided to examine the outcome of the modified linear channel model and the temporal and spatial variations of the impulse response functions are investigated as well by assigning distinct bed slopes moreover a complete routing procedure is established to link multiple upstream and lateral inputs with the linear channel response model for the streamflow prediction of the whole watershed a case study applied to the tou cian river basin is performed to evaluate the accuracy of flood prediction and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed channel response system 2 modified channel response model dooge et al 1987a derived a useful impulse response function for the linear channel routing which can apply to an irregular cross section however reference parameters adopted in their model are assumed as constant coefficients that constrains the flexibility to adjust the channel impulse response moreover in order to expand the practical application scope of this model the approach to connect with the tributary and lateral inflow along the main channel needs to be examined therefore in this study the main channel of a watershed is divided into several segments to link with their respective lateral flow areas and upstream contributing area so as to allow the spatial variability of hydraulic characteristics such as the channel bed slope cross sectional shape and the roughness coefficient the following sub sections sequentially provide four parts of explanations about the channel response system 1 the theoretical basis of the linear channel model 2 the analytical solution derived in the form of the impulse function 3 the adoption of time varying reference parameters 4 the integrated routing procedure of the modified channel response system 2 1 theoretical formula the classical solution for the flood wave movement of unsteady flow in a channel can be interpreted by the saint venant equations of one dimensional form to suit for any shape of the channel the discharge q x t and the cross sectional area a x t are appropriate to be adopted as the dependent variables to express the momentum equation as follows 1 1 f 2 g y a x 2 q a q x q t g a s o s f where f is the froude number y is the hydraulic mean water depth s o is the bottom slope and s f is the friction slope since the momentum equation shown in eq 1 is non linear no analytical solution is available one alternative was proposed to find a satisfactory approximate solution by using the linearization of the non linear equation dooge et al 1987a adopted eq 1 to derive a linearized formula as follows 2 1 f o 2 g y o 2 q x 2 2 v o 2 q x t 2 q t 2 g a o s f q q t s f a q x where q can be assumed as the flow perturbation f 0 y 0 and v 0 respectively denote the froude number mean water depth and the mean flow velocity for reference condition eq 2 is based on the assumptions that the unsteady flow is deemed as a perturbation from a steady flow condition and the higher order terms of flow are neglected so it can be expressed as 3 q x t q 0 q x t where q 0 is the reference condition of steady flow q is the first order increment of flow it has been indicated that eq 2 can adapt to the irregular channel and any friction law dooge et al 1987a 2 2 channel impulse response function for the case of a uniform channel with an impulsive input at the upstream end the laplace transform of the linear channel response is given by dooge et al 1987a 4 ψ x s exp exs c x x a s 2 b s c where a b c d e are the coefficients related to the parameters of the channel by converting eq 4 to the time domain the general linear channel response can be yielded as follows dooge et al 1987a 5 q i t ψ a l i t ψ b l i t in which li is the length of the channel reach i ψ a is expressed as a delta function given by 6 ψ a l i t δ t l i c 1 i exp p i l i where δ is a dirac delta function c 1 i is the downstream characteristic celerity of reach i 7 c 1 i v 0 i t g y 0 i t and the parameter p is given by 8 p i s 0 i y 0 i t 1 f 0 i m 1 f 0 i 1 f 0 i where m denotes the ratio of wave speed to the average velocity at the reference condition and is given by 9 m d q i d a i q 0 i a 0 i the magnitude of m depends on the channel shape and the cross sectional area in eq 5 ψ b is given by 10 ψ b l i t exp r i t o i l i h i l i c 1 i l i c 2 i i 1 2 h i t l i c 1 i t l i c 2 i 1 2 t l i c 1 i t l i c 2 i 1 2 u t l i c 1 i where c 2 i is the upstream characteristic celerity of reach i 11 c 2 i v 0 i t g y 0 i t and the other parameters are given by 12 r i s 0 i v 0 i t y 0 i t 1 f 0 i 2 m 1 f 0 i 2 13 o i s 0 i y 0 i t m 1 14 h i s 0 i v 0 i t y 0 i t 1 f 0 i 2 1 f 0 i 2 m 1 2 1 2 2 f 0 i 2 where i 1 is a first order modified bessel function u is the unit step function taking a value of 1 for positive arguments and 0 otherwise 2 3 time varying parameters in the original linear channel response function derived by dooge et al 1987a associated parameters including the discharge q 0 mean flow depth y 0 and mean flow velocity v 0 for the reference condition are assumed as constants because they are regarded as initial parameters related with steady state this assumption results in a fixed shape of the channel impulse response to a uint of upstream input while this study intends to modify the channel impulse response to be adjustable according to the present inflow condition to achieve this purpose the time varying reference discharge denoted as q t 0 was adopted and it is given by 15 q t 0 i t q ini t where q ini is the inflow discharge of channel reach i it should be noted that q t 0 i is a constant and equals to q 0 i initial reference discharge when the original assumption is adopted after updating the reference discharge the information of the channel cross section is required to re calculate the other reference parameters y 0 i and v 0 i the adoption of manning s equation is the most convenient way to derive a corresponding cross sectional area by conducting an iterative method as follows 16 q t 0 i 1 n i a 0 i r 0 i 2 3 s 0 i where a 0 i and r 0 i are the cross sectional area and the hydraulic radius of channel reach i for the reference condition n i is the manning roughness coefficient of channel reach i 2 4 integrated routing procedure the channel flow response at the watershed outlet can be simultaneously influenced by the upstream inputs from sub watersheds the lateral flow inputs from riparian areas as shown by the schematic diagram in fig 1 three types of channel responses caused by different inflow conditions are classified for explanations the first type is the channel response caused by a unit of flow entering at an upstream point and its impulse function can be obtained by 17 u upi t q i l i t where u upi t is the unit response corresponding to the inflow at the upstream point of channel reach i therefore the outflow response for an upstream input can be derived by convolution integral as follows 18 o upi t 0 l i q upi τ u upi t τ d τ where q upi is the inflow discharge from an upstream input the second type is the channel response caused by the inflow from a tributary and its impulse function is similar to eq 17 given by 19 u tri t q i l tri t where l tri is the length of the tributary contributing to the end of channel reach i the outflow response for a tributary input can be expressed as 20 o tri t 0 l i q tri τ u tri t τ d τ where q tri is the inflow discharge from a tributary input the third type is the channel response caused by the lateral flow along the channel and its impulse function from the left bank right bank is given by 21 u li t q i x j t q i δ l j 1 2 t 22 u ri t q i x j t q i δ l j 1 2 t where x j is the distance from the central point of interval j to the outlet of channel reach i δ l is the interval in a channel reach the outflow response for the lateral flow input from the left right bank can be derived by 23 o li t j 1 j 0 t q li τ δ l u li t τ d τ 24 o ri t j 1 j 0 t q ri τ δ l u ri t τ d τ where j is the total number of intervals in the channel reach i q li q ri is the average lateral flow discharge per unit width from left right bank in each interval of channel reach i as shown in fig 3 for the application in a whole river basin as long as following the three types of treatment for inflow discharges to conduct the convolution integral the sum of outflow discharge at the end of every channel reach can be derived by 25 q outi t o upi t o tri t o li t o ri t moreover as shown by the schematic diagram in fig 2 each lateral area contributing to the left right side of a channel segment is further divided into several zones which separately belong to an interval in a channel segment each zone in a lateral area is partitioned by the digital elevation model based on the topographic data and then each zone is assumed as an inclined plane with an average slope to calculate the lateral flow discharge per unit width at the end of a plane by using the kinematic wave approximation 3 model tests in the following sub sections the modified linear channel model is first examined by comparing it with the numerical model based on the full saint venant equations and the original linear model proposed by dooge et al 1987a the second part is to investigate the distribution of the impulse response function which is designed to be varied with time and space 3 1 model verification to demonstrate the accuracy in applying the proposed quasilinear channel model the simulated results of a numerical model which is implemented by the implicit four point preissmann scheme 1961 based on the nonlinear saint venant equations was provided moreover the original linear solution proposed by the dooge et al 1987a was also presented for comparative study a wide rectangular channel with a total length of 50 km and a uniform bed slope was set in the three types of models as shown in fig 3 the upstream boundary condition and the simulated hydrographs of the three kinds of solutions assigned with different bed slopes and manning roughness coefficients are plotted for the upper two cases using the same roughness value n 0 02 but distinct slopes it can be found that the proposed quasilinear solution shows a slightly higher peak discharge than the nonlinear numerical solution nevertheless in comparison with the original linear solution denoted as linear in which the constant reference discharge was set as the mean of initial and maximum discharges of inflow the proposed solution denoted as quasilinear presents obviously closer results with the numerical solution in aspects of time to peak discharge as well as the hydrograph shape for the two cases below using the same bed slope s0 0 0005 but distinct roughness values the results are similar to the findings mentioned above moreover one may want to know the effect of adjusting the roughness coefficient as shown in fig 4 the manning roughness was assigned as 0 02 in the numerical model and then the roughness values in the two linear models were tuned to generate the same time to peak discharge of hydrograph the optimal value of manning roughness is about 0 022 for the proposed quasilinear model and the proposed method can yield a satisfying hydrograph fitting with the numerical solution however the optimal value of manning roughness for the original linear model is 0 013 which is obviously smaller than the roughness adopted in the numerical model to generate the same time to peak discharge the hydrograph shape of the original linear method shows an earlier time entering the flood rising stage although the time to the flow peak can be adjusted by tuning the roughness coefficient therefore the above results manifest that the proposed quasilinear channel model can provide a better description of the flood wave movement in a channel than the original linear model to investigate the applicability of the proposed linear model in an irregular channel three example cross sections separately in rectangular trapezoidal and compound shape as shown in fig 5 were tested in the proposed model and the numerical model the manning roughness coefficient was assigned as 0 02 in the numerical model and it was set as 0 022 in the proposed quasilinear model to generate closer results the hydrographs in the discharge and cross sectional area simulated in the three example sections were plotted in fig 5 for the cases in the rectangular and trapezoid channel both the discharge and cross sectional area during a flood can be adequately described although the hydrodynamic mechanism in the quasilinear channel model is much simplified than that in the numerical model based on the nonlinear saint venant equations for the case in the compound section it can be seen that the difference of hydrographs between the numerical solution and the proposed quasilinear solution is more obvious when the channel flow reaches the range of water stage having a sudden change in cross section therefore the quasilinear channel model remains its limitation to interpret flow characteristics in a channel with abrupt expansion however as shown by the third case in fig 5 the overall shapes of hydrographs in the discharge and cross sectional area can still be described by using the proposed quasilinear model 3 2 impulse response function investigation the main contribution of this study is to modify the impulse response function to be temporally and spatially varied therefore the distribution of impulse response function affected by the upstream boundary condition and the terrain of the channel bed needs to be analyzed a rectangular channel with a total length of 50 km and a uniform bed slope of 0 0003 was set in the proposed and the original linear model to compare the difference of impulse response function as shown in fig 6 the inflow condition outflow hydrographs separately generated from the two linear models as well as the impulse responses during a flood are plotted in both models the manning roughness coefficient was assigned as 0 02 for the original linear channel model denoted as linear in fig 6 the impulse response is assigned according to the mean of initial and maximum discharges of inflow and it is fixed without changing with time however for the proposed model denoted as quasilinear the shape of the impulse response is altered by adopting the time varying reference discharge according to the present upstream boundary condition it can be seen that the peak of impulse response becomes higher accompanied with earlier time to peak during the flood rising period and then it changes back to a lower peak accompanied with later time to peak during the flood falling period to consider the influence of terrain on the impulse response function and to describe a more realistic profile of the river bed the main channel of a river basin is divided into multiple segments it has been indicated that the terrain of a natural channel bed is usually found steeper in upstream reaches and milder in downstream reaches lee and huang 2012 therefore as shown in fig 7 a longitudinal profile of an example channel bed which has a total horizontal length of 200 km and is constructed by five segments with different bed slopes gradually slowed down from 0 05 to 0 0002 was provided for a test the channel was set as rectangular with a width of 30 m the upstream inflow condition assigned in the proposed linear model has a base flow at 30 m3 s and a peak flow at 300 m3 s fig 7 shows the impulse responses calculated at four locations points a b c and d separately extracted at the initial time and peak time it can be found that the difference of channel bed slope caused by the terrain can generate distinct distributions of the impulse response among the four locations a steeper channel segment results in a more concentrated distribution accompanied with a higher peak moreover the impulse response of each location calculated at peak time has a higher peak and earlier time to peak than that calculated at the initial time the above results indicate the importance of dividing the main channel into several segments to characterize the local topography in the impulse response 4 application in a studied watershed the tou cian river basin was selected as the studied area to manifest the practicality of the proposed linear channel model the precision of flood prediction in the following sub sections the environmental conditions of the studied watershed and the model settings are first introduced and the preprocessing of rainfall infiltration is subsequently explained at last the results of several flood event simulations are provided for the overall evaluation 4 1 studied area and model settings as shown in fig 8 the tou cian river basin is located in northwestern taiwan with a drainage area of 544 km2 the channel network of this watershed consists of two upstream branches yulo river and shangping river and a downstream main channel toucian river the mainstream of this watershed having a total length of 63 km originates from the xueshan mountain range and flows westward to the taiwan strait at the nanliao harbor of hsinchu city the main species of land cover are forests bushes in upstream areas and cultivated fields in downstream flat areas alongside the mainstream during the summer and autumn periods between may and october typhoon often invades taiwan island and brings torrential rain which could result in severe flooding or associated natural disasters therefore it is an urgent task to improve the flood warning system in the aspect of reinforcing model stability and efficiency currently there are a total of 4 rain gauges and 4 flow gauges installed in the tou cian river basin according to the information released by the water resources department ministry of economic affairs taiwan the locations of rain and flow gauges are marked in fig 8 as shown in fig 9 the main channel of the tou cian river basin as shown by the bold blue line is divided into 9 segments with a total of 10 channel nodes discharge records measured by four flow gauges at no 1 2 6 and 8 nodes are available and two of them no 1 and 2 nodes are assigned with inflow conditions that are contributed from two upstream tributary areas as shown by the green regions the lateral areas alongside each channel segment were extracted by the digital elevation model based on the topographic data moreover in this case study each lateral area was further divided into six zones to respectively calculate the lateral flow discharge per unit width by using the kinematic wave approximation and distinct average slopes table 1 shows the geomorphological properties of each channel link including the channel length bed slope and lateral area table 2 shows the upstream drainage area at each channel node and the link relation between nodes fig 10 shows the profile of the cross section in each channel segment provided by the water resources department of taiwan in this case study the discharges of base flow separately measured at the upstream no 1 and no 2 flow gauges were set as the reference discharges of segments a and b at the initial time q 0 4 2 estimation of rainfall infiltration the original precipitation data needs to be preprocessed for the calculation of lateral inputs from both sides of the riparian area to conduct the channel response system the green ampt method green and ampt 1911 was adopted to estimate infiltration amounts from the observed precipitation and then to generate the excessive rainfall caused by a storm event this method assumes that a sharp wetting front can be formed when water infiltrates into a relatively dry soil layer from the land surface therefore the soil characteristics together with the physical mechanism of infiltration can be considered in this approach based on this theoretical concept the equation of infiltration rate is given by f t k s k s ψ f θ s θ i f f o r t t p f t p f o r t t p where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm h ψ f is the suction head at the wetting front cm θ s is the saturated moisture content θ i is the initial moisture content f is the cumulative amount of infiltrated water cm t p is the time of ponding p is the rainfall rate cm h for the case study applied to the tou cian river basin k s was set as 1 14 cm h ψ f was set as 9 cm and θ s was set as 0 48 according to the soil type of sandy loam 4 3 assessment of flood event simulations in this study observed discharge records and precipitation data of storm events were adopted to examine the accuracy of flood prediction by executing the proposed linear model the other two types of models separately implemented by the implicit four point preissmann scheme based on the nonlinear saint venant equations and the original linear channel method proposed by the dooge et al 1987a were also provided for comparative study the optimal manning roughness coefficients of each channel segment according to each of the three models were listed in table 3 these values were calibrated by using observed records of six events fig 11 shows the impulse response of each channel segment at the initial time with a reference discharge at 30 m3 s it can be found that the distributions of the impulse response among the 9 segments are quite different because of the significant differences in bed slope and cross sectional geometry this manifests the necessity of dividing the main channel in a watershed in order to reflect the geomorphologic characteristics on the channel impulse response to evaluate the simulated accuracy for flood predictions the mean relative error was adopted as an index defined by 28 mre 1 n t 1 n e q t o q t o q t where mre is the mean relative error eq is the estimated discharge oq is the observed discharge n is the total number of data points in a hydrograph moreover another two indicators were also adopted to quantify the deviations of peak discharge and time to flow peak as follows 29 d q p q pe q po q po 30 d t p t pe t po t po where dqp is the deviation of peak discharge qpe is the peak discharge of the estimated hydrograph qpo is the peak discharge of the observed hydrograph dtp is the deviation of time to flow peak tpe is the time to flow peak of the estimated hydrograph tpo is the time to flow peak of the observed hydrograph fig 12 shows the estimated hydrographs of four flood events together with discharge records separately at two station sites no 6 and no 8 nodes it can be found that the proposed model denoted as quasilinear can generate a more satisfactory result than the original linear model denoted as linear to fit with the observed discharge since the time varying reference parameters are flexible to adjust the impulse response and hydrograph shape the original linear model reveals its limitation to adequately describe the hydrograph shape even though the time to flow peak can be tuned by the manning roughness coefficient moreover it is obvious that the proposed quasilinear solutions are closer to numerical solutions than the original linear solutions table 4 shows the mre quantified dq and dt between the observed and estimated hydrographs for the four flood events to support the findings mentioned above these results demonstrated that the proposed quasilinear channel method can improve the original linear method to achieve better performance for flood prediction the flood event occurring in september 2008 as shown by the upper left graph in fig 12 was adopted as an example to clarify the routing process of the proposed channel response system fig 13 provides the inflow and outflow hydrographs of each channel segment together with the summation of lateral flow from left and right banks along each segment it can be seen that the proportion of lateral flow as shown by the green line in the total mass of outflow discharge as shown by the red line of each channel segment gradually decreases with the downstream direction since the downstream channel can collect a larger amount of inflow from the upstream contributing area the routing started with the most upstream channel segment and then the summation of convolution integral was repeatedly calculated by using eq 25 after updating the impulse response function the proposed channel system follows the routing sequence from upstream to downstream links therefore the outflow discharge of a channel link can systematically provide the downstream link with the inflow condition and the time varying reference discharge 5 conclusions this study aimed to modify the channel impulse response function that was originally proposed by dooge et al 1987a in order to more precisely describe flow response for flood prediction the main approach adopted in this study is to alter the distribution of the unit impulse response function during a flood by using the time varying reference discharge according to the present inflow condition and the reference hydraulic variables according to the manning s equation and section shape in this way the resultant hydrograph using convolution integral can be adjusted by considering various shapes of unit impulse responses it should be noted that the proposed quasilinear routing method is merely applicable to the channel whose downstream boundary condition is assumed as normal flow depth since the convolution and the impulse response function adopted here are simply determined by the upstream inflow condition nevertheless simulated results of a case study in the tou cian river basin have shown the adequateness being applied in a natural channel without downstream disturbances the most important founding in the case study is that the modified linear channel method can generate similar results with that applying a numerical model based on the saint venant equations additionally in comparison with the original linear channel routing the proposed method can significantly adjust the profile of the outflow hydrograph to obtain a better simulation fitting with the observed discharges experimental tests have shown that such an improvement is owing to the temporal and spatial variation of the unit impulse response with the inflow discharge and local hydraulic characteristics the applicability of the proposed quasilinear method for practical watershed routing has been manifested although the proposed

5123,to bypass the problem of numerical instability in conducting the channel routing system the application of an impulse response function based on the linearization of saint venant equations has been an alternative for predicting streamflow discharge however the distribution type of the impulse response function proposed by dooge et al 1987a is restricted during a flood so this approach cannot adequately describe flow response in practical applications in considering that the flow response in a natural channel is usually influenced by the shape of the cross section the terrain of channel bed and the discharge of the moving flood this study focuses on improving the original unit impulse function by conducting two aspects of analysis 1 the distribution of unit impulse response function was changed with time by adjusting the reference parameters according to the inflow condition and the hydraulic variables 2 the outcome of this modified linear approach was thoroughly examined by comparing the simulated results with that adopting the original linear channel method and the numerical scheme based on the nonlinear saint venant equations moreover for achieving the simulation of a whole river basin a complete executing procedure was provided to explain the connection between the upstream inflows lateral flows and the linear channel response of each channel reach a series of tests showed that the proposed method can produce approximated hydrographs in comparison with numerical simulation results owing to the flexibility of the impulse response function although the linear channel routing adopts simplified mathematical operations a case study of a natural river basin also demonstrated the applicability of the modified channel response system keywords impulse response function linear channel routing saint venant equations 1 introduction computing efficiency and predicted accuracy are the two primary concerns in applying a flood warning system for real time runoff prediction in recent decades a variety of numerical schemes have been continuously proposed and refined to achieve better performance on watershed runoff simulation since the technique of high speed computer with related equipment are developed rapidly the numerical methods are usually considered to have a robust physical interpretation of model structure based on the hydrodynamic equations bates et al 2010 lee and huang 2012 huang and lee 2017 another way for flood simulation is the linearized channel flow routing which applies the convolution integral to bypass any possibility of occurring numerical oscillation dooge and harley 1967 dooge et al 1987a 1987b kirshen and bras 1983 this study intends to ameliorate the linear channel response system by introducing more considerations of geomorphologic and hydrological conditions in the unit impulse response function to implement streamflow simulation the earlier research work about linear channel routing lcr can be traced back to the literature proposed by dooge and harley 1967 they successfully derived the instantaneous hydrologic response function of a channel reach based on a wide rectangular channel by using a linearized formulation from the saint venant equations it should be noted that a certain assumption was declared in this kind of model to compose its fundamental concept the discharge hydrograph at a designated location can be described by the convolution integral of unit impulse response function based on the linear accumulation it has been denoted that the solutions generated by the lcr model were basically reliable for streamflow prediction but the physical significance and structure of the model in describing the hydrological process still need to be improved dooge and harley 1967 dooge et al 1987a 1987b kirshen and bras 1983 researchers further combined the concept of the geomorphologic iuh rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 with the channel response function proposed by dooge and harley 1967 to reflect the influence of stream network pattern on the response of overland flow contributed from the upstream watershed dooge et al 1987a revised the analytical solution of the channel impulse response proposed in 1967 to adapt to any shape of channel cross section and any type of friction law therefore the applicability of this type of linear method was significantly extended they clearly expressed the solution anywhere in the channel in terms of one convolution with a boundary condition at the upstream end and another convolution with the boundary condition at the downstream end dooge and napíorkowski 1984 proposed a diffusion analogy model from the saint venant equations by utilizing an approximation of the inertia terms to evaluate the relative effect of the downstream control on the water level at any intermediate point in the channel reach in addition to using the diffusion approximation to consider the effect of downstream control fenton 2015 developed a one and a half dimensional model of a river that can allow for horizontal curvature by adopting the governing long wave equations with very few limiting approximations this study focuses on strengthening the flexibility of the channel impulse response function that was originally developed by dooge et al 1987a and previously had only a fixed distribution shape during a flood it should be noted that since only the convolution with the upstream boundary condition is applied in this study the modified linear model proposed here is merely applicable to a situation where the downstream boundary is assumed as normal depth also called an open boundary nevertheless such a treatment for the channel is common in flood routing and its applicability can be verified by practical simulations with the discharge records it has been indicated that the solution of the full long wave equations using information only from upstream in the channel with an open downstream boundary can still provide accurate simulations even on small channel slopes fenton 2014 to reflect the influences of geomorphologic and hydrological conditions on the streamflow prediction the unit impulse response function is ameliorated by introducing time varying reference parameters that can change with the inflow condition and the hydraulic variables in this study the numerical solution of an implicit finite difference scheme based on the nonlinear saint venant equations is provided to examine the outcome of the modified linear channel model and the temporal and spatial variations of the impulse response functions are investigated as well by assigning distinct bed slopes moreover a complete routing procedure is established to link multiple upstream and lateral inputs with the linear channel response model for the streamflow prediction of the whole watershed a case study applied to the tou cian river basin is performed to evaluate the accuracy of flood prediction and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed channel response system 2 modified channel response model dooge et al 1987a derived a useful impulse response function for the linear channel routing which can apply to an irregular cross section however reference parameters adopted in their model are assumed as constant coefficients that constrains the flexibility to adjust the channel impulse response moreover in order to expand the practical application scope of this model the approach to connect with the tributary and lateral inflow along the main channel needs to be examined therefore in this study the main channel of a watershed is divided into several segments to link with their respective lateral flow areas and upstream contributing area so as to allow the spatial variability of hydraulic characteristics such as the channel bed slope cross sectional shape and the roughness coefficient the following sub sections sequentially provide four parts of explanations about the channel response system 1 the theoretical basis of the linear channel model 2 the analytical solution derived in the form of the impulse function 3 the adoption of time varying reference parameters 4 the integrated routing procedure of the modified channel response system 2 1 theoretical formula the classical solution for the flood wave movement of unsteady flow in a channel can be interpreted by the saint venant equations of one dimensional form to suit for any shape of the channel the discharge q x t and the cross sectional area a x t are appropriate to be adopted as the dependent variables to express the momentum equation as follows 1 1 f 2 g y a x 2 q a q x q t g a s o s f where f is the froude number y is the hydraulic mean water depth s o is the bottom slope and s f is the friction slope since the momentum equation shown in eq 1 is non linear no analytical solution is available one alternative was proposed to find a satisfactory approximate solution by using the linearization of the non linear equation dooge et al 1987a adopted eq 1 to derive a linearized formula as follows 2 1 f o 2 g y o 2 q x 2 2 v o 2 q x t 2 q t 2 g a o s f q q t s f a q x where q can be assumed as the flow perturbation f 0 y 0 and v 0 respectively denote the froude number mean water depth and the mean flow velocity for reference condition eq 2 is based on the assumptions that the unsteady flow is deemed as a perturbation from a steady flow condition and the higher order terms of flow are neglected so it can be expressed as 3 q x t q 0 q x t where q 0 is the reference condition of steady flow q is the first order increment of flow it has been indicated that eq 2 can adapt to the irregular channel and any friction law dooge et al 1987a 2 2 channel impulse response function for the case of a uniform channel with an impulsive input at the upstream end the laplace transform of the linear channel response is given by dooge et al 1987a 4 ψ x s exp exs c x x a s 2 b s c where a b c d e are the coefficients related to the parameters of the channel by converting eq 4 to the time domain the general linear channel response can be yielded as follows dooge et al 1987a 5 q i t ψ a l i t ψ b l i t in which li is the length of the channel reach i ψ a is expressed as a delta function given by 6 ψ a l i t δ t l i c 1 i exp p i l i where δ is a dirac delta function c 1 i is the downstream characteristic celerity of reach i 7 c 1 i v 0 i t g y 0 i t and the parameter p is given by 8 p i s 0 i y 0 i t 1 f 0 i m 1 f 0 i 1 f 0 i where m denotes the ratio of wave speed to the average velocity at the reference condition and is given by 9 m d q i d a i q 0 i a 0 i the magnitude of m depends on the channel shape and the cross sectional area in eq 5 ψ b is given by 10 ψ b l i t exp r i t o i l i h i l i c 1 i l i c 2 i i 1 2 h i t l i c 1 i t l i c 2 i 1 2 t l i c 1 i t l i c 2 i 1 2 u t l i c 1 i where c 2 i is the upstream characteristic celerity of reach i 11 c 2 i v 0 i t g y

is a first order modified bessel function u is the unit step function taking a value of 1 for positive arguments and 0 otherwise 2 3 time varying parameters in the original linear channel response function derived by dooge et al 1987a associated parameters including the discharge q 0 mean flow depth y 0 and mean flow velocity v 0 for the reference condition are assumed as constants because they are regarded as initial parameters related with steady state this assumption results in a fixed shape of the channel impulse response to a uint of upstream input while this study intends to modify the channel impulse response to be adjustable according to the present inflow condition to achieve this purpose the time varying reference discharge denoted as q t 0 was adopted and it is given by 15 q t 0 i t q ini t where q ini is the inflow discharge of channel reach i it should be noted that q t 0 i is a constant and equals to q 0 i initial reference discharge when the original assumption is adopted after updating the reference discharge the information of the channel cross section is required to re calculate the other reference parameters y 0 i and v 0 i the adoption of manning s equation is the most convenient way to derive a corresponding cross sectional area by conducting an iterative method as follows 16 q t 0 i 1 n i a 0 i r 0 i 2 3 s 0 i where a 0 i and r 0 i are the cross sectional area and the hydraulic radius of channel reach i for the reference condition n i is the manning roughness coefficient of channel reach i 2 4 integrated routing procedure the channel flow response at the watershed outlet can be simultaneously influenced by the upstream inputs from sub watersheds the lateral flow inputs from riparian areas as shown by the schematic diagram in fig 1 three types of channel responses caused by different inflow conditions are classified for explanations the first type is the channel response caused by a unit of flow entering at an upstream point and its impulse function can be obtained by 17 u upi t q i l i t where u upi t is the unit response corresponding to the inflow at the upstream point of channel reach i therefore the outflow response for an upstream input can be derived by convolution integral as follows 18 o upi t 0 l i q upi τ u upi t τ d τ where q upi is the inflow discharge from an upstream input the second type is the channel response caused by the inflow from a tributary and its impulse function is similar to eq 17 given by 19 u tri t q i l tri t where l tri is the length of the tributary contributing to the end of channel reach i the outflow response for a tributary input can be expressed as 20 o tri t 0 l i q tri τ u tri t τ d τ where q tri is the inflow discharge from a tributary input the third type is the channel response caused by the lateral flow along the channel and its impulse function from the left bank right bank is given by 21 u li t q i x j t q i δ l j 1 2 t 22 u ri t q i x j t q i δ l j 1 2 t where x j is the distance from the central point of interval j to the outlet of channel reach i δ l is the interval in a channel reach the outflow response for the lateral flow input from the left right bank can be derived by 23 o li t j 1 j 0 t q li τ δ l u li t τ d τ 24 o ri t j 1 j 0 t q ri τ δ l u ri t τ d τ where j is the total number of intervals in the channel reach i q li q ri is the average lateral flow discharge per unit width from left right bank in each interval of channel reach i as shown in fig 3 for the application in a whole river basin as long as following the three types of treatment for inflow discharges to conduct the convolution integral the sum of outflow discharge at the end of every channel reach can be derived by 25 q outi t o upi t o tri t o li t o ri t moreover as shown by the schematic diagram in fig 2 each lateral area contributing to the left right side of a channel segment is further divided into several zones which separately belong to an interval in a channel segment each zone in a lateral area is partitioned by the digital elevation model based on the topographic data and then each zone is assumed as an inclined plane with an average slope to calculate the lateral flow discharge per unit width at the end of a plane by using the kinematic wave approximation 3 model tests in the following sub sections the modified linear channel model is first examined by comparing it with the numerical model based on the full saint venant equations and the original linear model proposed by dooge et al 1987a the second part is to investigate the distribution of the impulse response function which is designed to be varied with time and space 3 1 model verification to demonstrate the accuracy in applying the proposed quasilinear channel model the simulated results of a numerical model which is implemented by the implicit four point preissmann scheme 1961 based on the nonlinear saint venant equations was provided moreover the original linear solution proposed by the dooge et al 1987a was also presented for comparative study a wide rectangular channel with a total length of 50 km and a uniform bed slope was set in the three types of models as shown in fig 3 the upstream boundary condition and the simulated hydrographs of the three kinds of solutions assigned with different bed slopes and manning roughness coefficients are plotted for the upper two cases using the same roughness value n 0 02 but distinct slopes it can be found that the proposed quasilinear solution shows a slightly higher peak discharge than the nonlinear numerical solution nevertheless in comparison with the original linear solution denoted as linear in which the constant reference discharge was set as the mean of initial and maximum discharges of inflow the proposed solution denoted as quasilinear presents obviously closer results with the numerical solution in aspects of time to peak discharge as well as the hydrograph shape for the two cases below using the same bed slope s0 0 0005 but distinct roughness values the results are similar to the findings mentioned above moreover one may want to know the effect of adjusting the roughness coefficient as shown in fig 4 the manning roughness was assigned as 0 02 in the numerical model and then the roughness values in the two linear models were tuned to generate the same time to peak discharge of hydrograph the optimal value of manning roughness is about 0 022 for the proposed quasilinear model and the proposed method can yield a satisfying hydrograph fitting with the numerical solution however the optimal value of manning roughness for the original linear model is 0 013 which is obviously smaller than the roughness adopted in the numerical model to generate the same time to peak discharge the hydrograph shape of the original linear method shows an earlier time entering the flood rising stage although the time to the flow peak can be adjusted by tuning the roughness coefficient therefore the above results manifest that the proposed quasilinear channel model can provide a better description of the flood wave movement in a channel than the original linear model to investigate the applicability of the proposed linear model in an irregular channel three example cross sections separately in rectangular trapezoidal and compound shape as shown in fig 5 were tested in the proposed model and the numerical model the manning roughness coefficient was assigned as 0 02 in the numerical model and it was set as 0 022 in the proposed quasilinear model to generate closer results the hydrographs in the discharge and cross sectional area simulated in the three example sections were plotted in fig 5 for the cases in the rectangular and trapezoid channel both the discharge and cross sectional area during a flood can be adequately described although the hydrodynamic mechanism in the quasilinear channel model is much simplified than that in the numerical model based on the nonlinear saint venant equations for the case in the compound section it can be seen that the difference of hydrographs between the numerical solution and the proposed quasilinear solution is more obvious when the channel flow reaches the range of water stage having a sudden change in cross section therefore the quasilinear channel model remains its limitation to interpret flow characteristics in a channel with abrupt expansion however as shown by the third case in fig 5 the overall shapes of hydrographs in the discharge and cross sectional area can still be described by using the proposed quasilinear model 3 2 impulse response function investigation the main contribution of this study is to modify the impulse response function to be temporally and spatially varied therefore the distribution of impulse response function affected by the upstream boundary condition and the terrain of the channel bed needs to be analyzed a rectangular channel with a total length of 50 km and a uniform bed slope of 0 0003 was set in the proposed and the original linear model to compare the difference of impulse response function as shown in fig 6 the inflow condition outflow hydrographs separately generated from the two linear models as well as the impulse responses during a flood are plotted in both models the manning roughness coefficient was assigned as 0 02 for the original linear channel model denoted as linear in fig 6 the impulse response is assigned according to the mean of initial and maximum discharges of inflow and it is fixed without changing with time however for the proposed model denoted as quasilinear the shape of the impulse response is altered by adopting the time varying reference discharge according to the present upstream boundary condition it can be seen that the peak of impulse response becomes higher accompanied with earlier time to peak during the flood rising period and then it changes back to a lower peak accompanied with later time to peak during the flood falling period to consider the influence of terrain on the impulse response function and to describe a more realistic profile of the river bed the main channel of a river basin is divided into multiple segments it has been indicated that the terrain of a natural channel bed is usually found steeper in upstream reaches and milder in downstream reaches lee and huang 2012 therefore as shown in fig 7 a longitudinal profile of an example channel bed which has a total horizontal length of 200 km and is constructed by five segments with different bed slopes gradually slowed down from 0 05 to 0 0002 was provided for a test the channel was set as rectangular with a width of 30 m the upstream inflow condition assigned in the proposed linear model has a base flow at 30 m3 s and a peak flow at 300 m3 s fig 7 shows the impulse responses calculated at four locations points a b c and d separately extracted at the initial time and peak time it can be found that the difference of channel bed slope caused by the terrain can generate distinct distributions of the impulse response among the four locations a steeper channel segment results in a more concentrated distribution accompanied with a higher peak moreover the impulse response of each location calculated at peak time has a higher peak and earlier time to peak than that calculated at the initial time the above results indicate the importance of dividing the main channel into several segments to characterize the local topography in the impulse response 4 application in a studied watershed the tou cian river basin was selected as the studied area to manifest the practicality of the proposed linear channel model the precision of flood prediction in the following sub sections the environmental conditions of the studied watershed and the model settings are first introduced and the preprocessing of rainfall infiltration is subsequently explained at last the results of several flood event simulations are provided for the overall evaluation 4 1 studied area and model settings as shown in fig 8 the tou cian river basin is located in northwestern taiwan with a drainage area of 544 km2 the channel network of this watershed consists of two upstream branches yulo river and shangping river and a downstream main channel toucian river the mainstream of this watershed having a total length of 63 km originates from the xueshan mountain range and flows westward to the taiwan strait at the nanliao harbor of hsinchu city the main species of land cover are forests bushes in upstream areas and cultivated fields in downstream flat areas alongside the mainstream during the summer and autumn periods between may and october typhoon often invades taiwan island and brings torrential rain which could result in severe flooding or associated natural disasters therefore it is an urgent task to improve the flood warning system in the aspect of reinforcing model stability and efficiency currently there are a total of 4 rain gauges and 4 flow gauges installed in the tou cian river basin according to the information released by the water resources department ministry of economic affairs taiwan the locations of rain and flow gauges are marked in fig 8 as shown in fig 9 the main channel of the tou cian river basin as shown by the bold blue line is divided into 9 segments with a total of 10 channel nodes discharge records measured by four flow gauges at no 1 2 6 and 8 nodes are available and two of them no 1 and 2 nodes are assigned with inflow conditions that are contributed from two upstream tributary areas as shown by the green regions the lateral areas alongside each channel segment were extracted by the digital elevation model based on the topographic data moreover in this case study each lateral area was further divided into six zones to respectively calculate the lateral flow discharge per unit width by using the kinematic wave approximation and distinct average slopes table 1 shows the geomorphological properties of each channel link including the channel length bed slope and lateral area table 2 shows the upstream drainage area at each channel node and the link relation between nodes fig 10 shows the profile of the cross section in each channel segment provided by the water resources department of taiwan in this case study the discharges of base flow separately measured at the upstream no 1 and no 2 flow gauges were set as the reference discharges of segments a and b at the initial time q 0 4 2 estimation of rainfall infiltration the original precipitation data needs to be preprocessed for the calculation of lateral inputs from both sides of the riparian area to conduct the channel response system the green ampt method green and ampt 1911 was adopted to estimate infiltration amounts from the observed precipitation and then to generate the excessive rainfall caused by a storm event this method assumes that a sharp wetting front can be formed when water infiltrates into a relatively dry soil layer from the land surface therefore the soil characteristics together with the physical mechanism of infiltration can be considered in this approach based on this theoretical concept the equation of infiltration rate is given by f t k s k s ψ f θ s θ i f f o r t t p f t p f o r t t p where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm h ψ f is the suction head at the wetting front cm θ s is the saturated moisture content θ i is the initial moisture content f is the cumulative amount of infiltrated water cm t p is the time of ponding p is the rainfall rate cm h for the case study applied to the tou cian river basin k s was set as 1 14 cm h ψ f was set as 9 cm and θ s was set as 0 48 according to the soil type of sandy loam 4 3 assessment of flood event simulations in this study observed discharge records and precipitation data of storm events were adopted to examine the accuracy of flood prediction by executing the proposed linear model the other two types of models separately implemented by the implicit four point preissmann scheme based on the nonlinear saint venant equations and the original linear channel method proposed by the dooge et al 1987a were also provided for comparative study the optimal manning roughness coefficients of each channel segment according to each of the three models were listed in table 3 these values were calibrated by using observed records of six events fig 11 shows the impulse response of each channel segment at the initial time with a reference discharge at 30 m3 s it can be found that the distributions of the impulse response among the 9 segments are quite different because of the significant differences in bed slope and cross sectional geometry this manifests the necessity of dividing the main channel in a watershed in order to reflect the geomorphologic characteristics on the channel impulse response to evaluate the simulated accuracy for flood predictions the mean relative error was adopted as an index defined by 28 mre 1 n t 1 n e q t o q t o q t where mre is the mean relative error eq is the estimated discharge oq is the observed discharge n is the total number of data points in a hydrograph moreover another two indicators were also adopted to quantify the deviations of peak discharge and time to flow peak as follows 29 d q p q pe q po q po 30 d t p t pe t po t po where dqp is the deviation of peak discharge qpe is the peak discharge of the estimated hydrograph qpo is the peak discharge of the observed hydrograph dtp is the deviation of time to flow peak tpe is the time to flow peak of the estimated hydrograph tpo is the time to flow peak of the observed hydrograph fig 12 shows the estimated hydrographs of four flood events together with discharge records separately at two station sites no 6 and no 8 nodes it can be found that the proposed model denoted as quasilinear can generate a more satisfactory result than the original linear model denoted as linear to fit with the observed discharge since the time varying reference parameters are flexible to adjust the impulse response and hydrograph shape the original linear model reveals its limitation to adequately describe the hydrograph shape even though the time to flow peak can be tuned by the manning roughness coefficient moreover it is obvious that the proposed quasilinear solutions are closer to numerical solutions than the original linear solutions table 4 shows the mre quantified dq and dt between the observed and estimated hydrographs for the four flood events to support the findings mentioned above these results demonstrated that the proposed quasilinear channel method can improve the original linear method to achieve better performance for flood prediction the flood event occurring in september 2008 as shown by the upper left graph in fig 12 was adopted as an example to clarify the routing process of the proposed channel response system fig 13 provides the inflow and outflow hydrographs of each channel segment together with the summation of lateral flow from left and right banks along each segment it can be seen that the proportion of lateral flow as shown by the green line in the total mass of outflow discharge as shown by the red line of each channel segment gradually decreases with the downstream direction since the downstream channel can collect a larger amount of inflow from the upstream contributing area the routing started with the most upstream channel segment and then the summation of convolution integral was repeatedly calculated by using eq 25 after updating the impulse response function the proposed channel system follows the routing sequence from upstream to downstream links therefore the outflow discharge of a channel link can systematically provide the downstream link with the inflow condition and the time varying reference discharge 5 conclusions this study aimed to modify the channel impulse response function that was originally proposed by dooge et al 1987a in order to more precisely describe flow response for flood prediction the main approach adopted in this study is to alter the distribution of the unit impulse response function during a flood by using the time varying reference discharge according to the present inflow condition and the reference hydraulic variables according to the manning s equation and section shape in this way the resultant hydrograph using convolution integral can be adjusted by considering various shapes of unit impulse responses it should be noted that the proposed quasilinear routing method is merely applicable to the channel whose downstream boundary condition is assumed as normal flow depth since the convolution and the impulse response function adopted here are simply determined by the upstream inflow condition nevertheless simulated results of a case study in the tou cian river basin have shown the adequateness being applied in a natural channel without downstream disturbances the most important founding in the case study is that the modified linear channel method can generate similar results with that applying a numerical model based on the saint venant equations additionally in comparison with the original linear channel routing the proposed method can significantly adjust the profile of the outflow hydrograph to obtain a better simulation fitting with the observed discharges experimental tests have shown that such an improvement is owing to the temporal and spatial variation of the unit impulse response with the inflow discharge and local hydraulic characteristics the applicability of the proposed quasilinear method for practical watershed routing has been manifested although the proposed method violates the original theoretical assumptions proposed by dooge et al 1987a credit authorship contribution statement pin chun huang conceptualization methodology software validation formal

this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief bayesian model averaging bma is a well known statistical post processing approach for probabilistically merging individual forecasts in bma the posterior distribution of the predictand variable is determined by implementing the law of total probability therefore possessing an ensemble of independent members mutually exclusive with the highest information content about observation variability collectively exhaustive is the main inherent assumption of the original bma method mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive are two contradictory criteria although constructing an ensemble of members that fully satisfied these two properties is practically impossible providing a balance between them is a key requirement for enhancing the bma performance through coupling bma with shannon entropy of information theory this study proposes an entropy based selection procedure to construct an ensemble of streamflow forecasts by better addressing the aforementioned contradictory criteria prior to performing the bma we investigate the effects of using ensembles with the aforementioned properties by comparing the results of original bma with the proposed entropy based bma en bma for short to medium range daily streamflow forecasts in two different watersheds the results indicate that the en bma leads to better results particularly for high flow predictions both probabilistic and deterministic high flow forecasts are more accurate and reliable when using the en bma approach however for the average flow forecasts there are no clear differences in the general performance of both methods the improvements observed are more pronounced for shorter lead times and less pronounced but still present for longer lead

predictive forecast distributions in comparison to the other multi model combination methods the higher capability of the bma approach in producing more accurate and reliable forecasts has been shown by various studies arsenault et al 2015 viallefont et al 2001 exploring the application of the bma approach in the field of streamflow predictions simulations has led to different variants by relaxing some inherent assumptions of the original bma besides proposing some minor modifications such as implementing more representative distribution types vrugt and robinson 2007 or applying data transformation duan et al 2007 liang et al 2013 qu et al 2017 several more complicated bma based post processing methods have been developed such as combining bma and data assimilation parrish et al 2012 rings et al 2012 copulas and bma madadgar and moradkhani 2014 and copula bayesian processors with bma he et al 2018 all bma variants listed attempt to relax the gaussian assumption of the posterior distributions while there are some fundamental limitations of the original bma method which remain one of the primary principles of the standard bma formulations is the law of total probability this principle leads to the assumption of possessing mutually exclusive i e independent as well as collectively exhaustive i e capturing observation variability members of the ensemble in other words having an ensemble of members with the least shared information and higher capability of covering possible futures is a potential requirement for reliable performance of the bma approach it has been shown that selecting independent forecast members enhance the reliability of the bma results sharma et al 2019 however capturing the variability of the observation by using an ensemble is not possible except by having collectively exhaustive members madadgar and moradkhani 2014 simply constructing a large ensemble of members can provide more information about observation and relatively assure the latter requirement while it may limit the former one as the larger number of members can lead to higher redundant information within the ensemble refsgaard et al 2012 given the contradiction between the two criteria it is impossible to possess a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble simultaneously therefore constructing an esp by providing a balance between the two criteria is necessary and can positively affect the performance of the bma method the information theory also known as shannon entropy was first introduced by shannon 1948 and has become very popular in several scientific fields the definition of the entropy term in the context of information theory is a measure of uncertainty in a random variable and based on the fact that the amount of uncertainty will be reduced if more information is available entropy corresponds to the amount of information contained in a data set keum and coulibaly 2017a there are various applications of information theory in solving different water related issues mishra and coulibaly 2009 singh 1997 one common application of entropy in water resources has been to aid in the design of hydrometric monitoring networks alfonso et al 2013 2010 keum et al 2019 keum and coulibaly 2017b leach et al 2015 li et al 2012 where gathering high quality information with minimal redundancy is the main objective this study seeks to establish a new entropy based selection procedure using the proven capability of the information theory concept to provide information with minimal redundancy the new method will integrate entropy with bma in order to overcome the remaining challenge of possessing mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive mece ensemble in the proposed entropy based bma en bma framework before estimating bma parameters three entropy measures joint entropy total correlation and transinformation are utilized to narrow down the streamflow forecasts for constructing ensemble with the mece properties the applicability and efficiency of the proposed en bma approach have been assessed in two different watersheds for short to medium range up to 7 days daily streamflow predictions by providing a balance between two conflicting criteria the results show the superiority of the en bma in providing better probabilistic and deterministic high flow forecasts over the standard bma approach the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 introduces the underlying concepts of our new en bma method the experimental setup including brief explanations of the study areas hydrologic models and different verification metrics are presented in section 3 section 4 provides the comparison results between the original bma and the proposed en bma methods and finally the summary and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 definitions of entropy terms as defined in information theory entropy is a measure of the amount of information required to describe a random variable in other words it is the amount of uncertainty represented by the probability distribution of a random variable the basis of the shannon entropy is that the information gained from an event with occurrence probability p is l o g 1 p this stems from the fact that the anticipatory uncertainty from an event varies inversely with its probability also the logarithmic function is the only transition that can be used in order to make sure that the information gained by the joint occurrence of two independent events is equal to the sum of the information from each one 1 log 1 p x 1 p x 2 log 1 p x 1 log 1 p x 2 log p x 1 log p x 2 consequently in the case of a discrete variable x with k outcomes with probabilities p 1 p 2 p k the average information of x is denoted by 2 h x e log 1 p 1 p 2 p k i 1 k p i log p i where e is the expectation function and h x is the marginal entropy of a single variable x in bits because the base of the logarithm is assumed to be equal to 2 therefore marginal entropy is the amount of information gained by knowing a single variable and it varies between zero for a deterministic case and logn for the most uncertain cases uniformly distributed variables it is of note that for continuous variables such as streamflow data a finite number of discrete data intervals must be chosen a similar procedure is used for calculating the total information content in more than two variables e g n variables which is known as joint multivariate entropy h x 1 x 2 x n 3 h x 1 x 2 x n i 1 1 k 1 i 2 1 k 2 i n 1 k n p x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 x n i n log p x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 x n i n where p x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 x n i n is the joint probability of all variables and k j j 1 n is the number of values or class intervals for variable x j in the case of discrete or continuous variables respectively if there are independent variables multivariate entropy is equal to the summation of their marginal entropies and its maximum value will occur in the case of independent equally likely variables in general marginal and joint entropies are related as follows 4 h x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n h x i c x 1 x 2 x n where c x 1 x 2 x n is the total correlation which estimates the amount of duplicated information in multiple variables it is of note that increasing the number of variables could potentially lead to larger total correlation fig 1 if the number of variables is reduced to two eq 4 can be rewritten as follows 5 h x 1 x 2 h x 1 h x 2 t x 1 x 2 where t x 1 x 2 is the amount of mutual information or transinformation between variables x 1 and x 2 in other words it shows the information content of one variable that is contained in another transinformation is symmetric i e t x 1 x 2 t x 2 x 1 and will be equal to zero when two variables are statistically independent the larger value of transinformation depicts the higher dependence between the variables and the maximum value occurs in the case of functionally dependent variables therefore transinformation varies in the range of zero to min h x 1 h x 2 for more clarification fig 1 illustrates the schematic of the various aforementioned entropy terms for a case of three variables where the circle sizes indicate the amount of marginal entropy as can be seen transinformation is only meaningful for two variables or groups of variables and is not equal to total correlation when we possess three or more data sets moreover the total correlation is the sum of all order duplications in the system based on the definition of the previously mentioned entropy terms it can be concluded that these concepts can be used in order to relax some of the remaining assumptions and hypotheses of the bma method i e independent and mutually exclusive predictions 2 2 bayesian model averaging with moving window bma is a probabilistic post processor where the conditional pdfs of various forecasts are combined in order to generate more skillful predictions bma was first introduced for statistical linear regression applications hoeting et al 1999 kass and raftery 1995 raftery et al 2005 extended the application of bma to dynamic models given the detailed description of the bma approach in the literature darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 raftery et al 2005 we briefly explained the bma basic concepts for the sake of completeness consider the quantity δ to be the predictand i e forecasted variable based on the training data d and the ensemble of independent predictions f f 1 f 2 f k based on the law of total probability the bma predictive pdf of δ can be represented as 6 p δ f d i 1 k p δ f i d p f i d where p f i d is the posterior probability of the forecast f i being correct given the observational data this term can be viewed as a weight w i reflecting how well the ensemble member i fits the observations in the training period moreover p δ f i d is the pdf of the predictand δ conditional on the forecast f i and observed data d in the standard bma approach this posterior probability is assumed to follow the gaussian distribution centered at the forecast value with standard deviation σ i in order to estimate the parameters of the bma approach i e weights and variances of each individual forecast the expectation maximization em algorithm proposed by raftery et al 2005 is applied for maximizing the log likelihood function of the parameter vector θ 7 l θ l o g p δ f 1 f 2 f k d log i 1 k w i g y f i σ i 2 em is an iterative approach including expectation and maximization steps where a latent variable is used for searching the optimal values of parameters although obtaining a global optimum solution is not guaranteed it has been shown that em is as reliable and efficient as more complex global optimization techniques darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 vrugt et al 2008 for a more detailed description of the em algorithm the reader is referred to the above cited references using a fixed training set of data leads to a static estimation of the bma parameters which does not change with respect to the hydrologic regime however updating the parameters when new observations are available may provide more reliable results therefore following raftery et al 2005 the moving window approach is implemented where the shorter window of simulation observation pairs surrounding each forecast is used as the recursive training period for calculating bma parameters by capturing the time dependent relative performance of various members of the ensemble the bma with moving window leads to better probabilistic forecasts parrish et al 2012 vrugt and robinson 2007 2 3 entropy based bayesian model averaging method as previously stated establishing a balanced ensemble of forecasts with mutually exclusive independent and collectively exhaustive capturing the observation variability members can potentially lead to more reliable bma derived predictive forecasts here by using three aforementioned entropy terms we introduce an easy to implement selection procedure through which the generated ensemble can 1 possess minimum redundancy and 2 assure the highest overall information fig 2 represents the proposed entropy based selection algorithm for optimally choosing the subset of forecast members with minimum redundancy and maximum information for bma application as can be seen the method has a nested loop structure the goal of the inner loop is finding less independent forecasts when the number of selected members is fixed therefore the total correlation between selected members is considered as an objective function and its values for potentially selected subsets s are compared in order to find the optimal one s f different subsets are initialized by iteratively removing one member of the candidate forecasts and finally the subset with the lowest dependence within its members is the selected one in other words the finally omitted member in each loop possesses the most duplicate information in common with other members which leads to the highest redundancy of the ensemble in the outer loop the stopping criteria are defined in order to provide collectively exhaustive ensemble therefore we introduce two entropy based ratios the first is the ratio of joint entropy of the selected optimal members derived from the inner loop to that of all the candidate members f f 1 f 2 f k this ratio shows how much of the information contained by the whole ensemble is covered using the selected subset although it illustrates the exhaustiveness of the selected members it is not a proper term for representing the amount of information about capturing the variability in the observations therefore the second criterion is defined as transinformation between the final selected subset and observations over transinformation between all candidate members and observations this provides a better estimation of the maximum information however both ratios must be used together to assure collectively exhaustive criterion in both calibration and forecasting periods fig 3 exemplifies the application of the proposed selection procedure for one forecast by illustrating how different entropy terms change in both inner and outer loops as previously stated the inner loop of the procedure determines the best subset of the ensemble with minimum total correlation and the outer loop continues until both stopping criteria are fulfilled the steady decrease of total correlation in the outer loop shows selection of less dependent members while the imposed stopping threshold parameter β ensures possessing an ensemble with sufficient information content the integration of the proposed entropy based selection algorithm with bma using the moving window scheme is presented in fig 4 for each forecast the moving window with length n is considered as the training period for implementing the selection procedure and estimating bma parameters the results of the training phase are used during the forecasting mode where at first the ensemble of streamflow forecasts up to t days ahead are generated using the selected members and deterministic precipitation p f and temperature t f forecasts and then the bma approach with estimated parameters is utilized as a post processor for probabilistically merging the generated forecasts it is of note that in this study we used observed precipitation and temperature as perfect deterministic meteorological forecasts by allowing the selected members to vary for each forecast we hope the proposed en bma is able to provide better deterministic and probabilistic results in comparison to the original bma where the same ensemble is implemented 3 experimental setup 3 1 study area the proposed en bma approach is applied to the big east river be and black river bl basins located in northern ontario canada fig 5 be is a mostly forested area of 620 km2 while bl with a drainage area of 1522 km2 is covered with the combination of agricultural lands and natural forests both watersheds are moderately sloped with altitudes approximately changing from 290 to 560 and 220 to 420 m above sea level for be and bl respectively from the six available meteorological stations located around both watersheds the mean annual precipitation ranges between 887 and 1249 mm in addition the average temperature variations from 10 5 c in january to 18 5 c in july depict the occurrence of all four seasons in both watersheds table 1 moreover in april when the temperature rises to above the freezing point and snowmelt begins the highest amount of discharge at the outlet of both watersheds can be seen this depicts the importance of considering the snowmelt routine in the hydrological modeling of both watersheds it is noted that the low density ground based stations shows the status of data poor watersheds where the conceptual models are the most appropriate ones for rainfall runoff modeling anshuman et al 2019 tegegne et al 2017 3 2 ensemble streamflow forecasts in this study as presented in table 2 seven different lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models employed for generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts are sacsma machbv smarg gr4j and three different configurations of hec hms model these models possess unique structural complexities with varying numbers of parameters daily precipitation and temperature are the only inputs to the chosen models with different methods used for calculating potential evapotranspiration pet depending on the model table 2 moreover as stated in the previous section snowmelt is one of the most important hydrologic processes in our study areas therefore for adding more diversity three different snowmelt modules are implemented with various models table 2 in the simple degree day method ddm samuel et al 2011 which uses five parameters a linear relationship between temperature and the amount of snowmelt is considered the 10 parameter snowmelt routine of the hec hms models scharffenberg 2016 uses the antecedent temperature index for calculating the melt rate snow17 anderson 2006 1973 including 11 parameters is a more complex temperature index approach where some of the snowmelt related physical processes are considered by considering 6 years of historical data i e years 2006 2011 as the calibration period we use the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 for estimating models parameters using five different objective functions kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nash volume error samuel et al 2011 focus on medium flows in different ways while modified nash volume error m n v e darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 and peak weighted root mean square error p w r m s e cunderlik and simonovic 2004 are aimed to simulate high flows more accurate as shown in eq 8 in mnve the combination of volume error ve and nse based on squared transformed streamflow nse sqrt reflecting the accuracy of high flows is used 8 mnve nse sqrt 0 1 v e also pwrmse is formulated as follows 9 pwrmse 1 n i 1 n f i o i 2 o i o 2 o 1 2 where n is the data length and f i o i and o respectively are the simulted observed and the mean of observed flows as can be seen pwrmse gives higher weights to errors near the peak flows utilizing multiple objective functions can provide better bma predictions in different flow ranges dong et al 2013 combining the seven hydrologic models and five objective functions leads to a set of 35 calibrated models this set can then be used to generate an ensemble of streamflow forecasts 3 3 performance measures the accuracy reliability and sharpness are the most important aspects of any predictive forecast need to be evaluated in this study we used six different evaluation metrics and some visual graphical tools to cover all of the aforementioned properties in terms of the accuracy three deterministic based measures including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse volume error ve and the root mean square error rmse are employed 10 nse 1 i 1 n f i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 11 ve i 1 n f i o i i 1 n o i 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n f i o i 2 1 2 where f i and o i are respectively the forecast and observed variable o is the observation mean and n is the dataset length nse varies between and 1 with the best value of 1 while ve and rmse possess a range of 0 when lower values show better model performance moreover the mean continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 evaluates the accuracy of the results in a probabilistic way by comparing the cumulative distribution of forecasts p i f x and observations p i o x determined by using heavside function h x o i 13 crps 1 n i 1 n x x p i f x p i o x 2 d x 14 p i o x h x o i 0 x o i 1 x o i the range for crps is 0 to where smaller values indicate better performance the containing ratio c r 95 and the average bandwidth b 95 of the 95 confidence interval xiong et al 2009 are the two other performance statistics being used to assess the reliability and sharpness of the probabilistic forecasts respectively c r 95 is the ratio of the observations covered by the 95 prediction bound it ranges between 0 and 1 with an optimal value of 0 95 b 95 determines the average width of the aforementioned interval and it is negatively oriented with lower values indicating better forecasts 15 c r 95 n o in n 16 b 95 1 n t i n f u i f l i in the above equations n o in is the number of observations that have fallen within the 95 bound and the upper and lower boundaries of the corresponding bound is denoted by f u i and f l i respectively simultaneously evaluating these two criteria is vital for providing precise conclusions for instance a forecast with a good c r 95 may still be underconfident by providing high b 95 indicating an overestimation of the uncertainty bound apart from previously presented verification metrics we adopted the predictive quantile quantile plot q q plot laio and tamea 2007 as an additional visual statistical verification of the forecast reliability where the comparison is made between forecast and the cumulative uniform distributions the more the q q plot follows the bisector line the more reliable the forecast is therefore another reliability measure α can also be calculated from a q q plot which represents the discrepancy between q q plot and the bisector line renard et al 2010 17 α 1 2 1 n i 1 n p i f o i u o t p i f o i and u o t respectively determine the non exceedance probability of the observed value using forecast and uniform cumulative distributions α 1 shows the perfect reliability while its worst value is zero moreover the representative hydrographs are another tool for assessing both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts visually furthermore for more specific evaluation and comparison of different methods performance regarding high flows all aforementioned performance measures are also determined based on the high flow data 90th percentile of streamflow 4 results and discussion 4 1 rainfall runoff models calibration as previously stated for each hydrologic model five optimized parameter sets are obtained by considering different criteria i e kge nse nve mnve and pwrmse as an objective function in the optimzation process using the calibration period from 2006 to 2011 a comparison between the performances of different models calibrated using different objective functions in the three years validation period 2012 2015 in terms of nse rmse ve and their corresponding values derived from flows more than 90 percentile i e nse 90 rmse 90 and v e 90 can be found in fig 6 in the big east river watershed the results in general indicate the superiority of gr4j model in simulating daily streamflows however by focusing on high flows machbv shows the most reliable performance in the black river on the other hand machbv is the most consistent model by providing the best results based on almost all performance metrics while sacsma performs competitively regarding high flow simulation the fact that machbv was initially developed for streamflow simulation in ontarian s ungauged basins samuel et al 2012 2011 can justify the robust performance of machbv in both watersheds which are considered as data scarce regions with low density ground based measurements darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 morever comparing the use of different objective functions shows that implementing kge as an objective function consistently leads to relatively better performance for most of the hydrologic models in the big east river watershed while its application in the black river is not among the best ones nse based calibrated models compared with nve provide better results in terms of nse and rmse criteria in both watersheds however their performances are worst regarding volume error ve metric for most of the models by combining nse and ve metrics nve criterion provides a balance among volume error and difference between streamflow simulations and their corresponding observations lindström 1997 samuel et al 2011 furthermore the results show that using objective functions focusing on high flows i e pwrms and mnve does not always lead to better calibrated models regarding high flows overall the main conclusion that stands out from comparing the different objective functions is that it is practically impossible to select one criteria which gives the best optimal parameters sets for all hydrologic models based on different performance measurements in both watersheds therefore besides helping in finding the best optimal parameter sets for each hydrologic model using different objective functions provides larger number of ensemble members with higher potential capability in capturing future flow possibilities 4 2 multi model versus multi model multi objective ensemble scenarios prior to the application of the proposed en bma method we evaluate the effects of using multiple objective functions for generating ensemble members to be merged by bma with different moving window lengths considering two ensemble scenarios of multi model e 7 and multi model with multiple parameter sets generated using different objective functions e 35 fig 7 illustrates the performance statistics of the 1 day ahead bma forecasts as a function of the number of days of the moving window for both big east river and black river watersheds the most influenced properties of the forecasts changing based on the window length are the reliability c r 95 and sharpness b 95 of the results although the shorter training period leads to smaller uncertainty bounds it highly reduces the reliability of the forecasts in both watersheds and both ensemble scenarios these results are qualitatively in line with previous studies e g raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 showing that increasing moving window length enhances the reliability of the forecasts while it reduces the sharpness other performance measures focusing on the accuracy of the results show negligible changes regarding the moving window length therefore given that a similar trend has been seen for other forecast horizons up to 7 days we select a length of 100 days where the reliability of the results appears to reach stability beyond which the sharpness of the results deteriorates without significant improvement of the containing ratio moreover although the superiority of scenario e 35 over e 7 can be seen from fig 7 a comprehensive comparison of both ensemble scenarios has been made using bma with a 100 day moving window for 1 3 5 and 7 day ahead forecasts it is of note that n day ahead forecasts mean the times series of forecasts for lead time n independently and not as aggregated of 1 to n day ahead therefore all criteria being calculated based on n day ahead time series of forecasts only indicate the performance at that particular lead time the results as shown in fig 8 indicate that using multiple models with multiple objective functions consistently enhance the probabilistic performance of the bma method for different lead times in both watersheds these improvements are also apparent in the deterministic performance statistics regarding high flows especially in the black river watershed consequently it can be concluded that constructing an ensemble using multiple models with multiple parameter sets based on different objective functions leads to better bma results accordingly for the en bma application the multi model multi objective ensemble scenario including 35 members of streamflow predictions was implemented for both watersheds 4 3 the effects of the stopping threshold value on en bma the main parameter of the proposed en bma approach is the stopping threshold value β which needs to be determined beforehand therefore the sensitivity analysis was carried out for different β values i e 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 and 0 99 to assess how selecting this threshold can affect the streamflow forecasts the first noticeable effect of the stopping threshold is on the number of selected members fig 9 by increasing β a higher numbers of members are selected for bma application larger stopping threshold value focuses more on increasing information content of the whole ensemble rather than independence of its members while choosing smaller β leads to lower redundant information without paying that much attention to the ensemble exhaustiveness in addition different performance measurements for the 1 day lead time forecasts are presented in table 3 what stands out in this table is that in general a higher threshold leads to sharper forecasts for both watersheds while the deterministic performance slightly deteriorates especially in high flows therefore in this study the threshold value of 0 95 was chosen for both watersheds which provides a balance between the different performance statistics these results indicate the same value of having mutually exclusive as well as collectively exhaustive ensemble refsgaard et al 2012 and indicate the importance of selecting a proper threshold value prior to the en bma application besides assessing the effects of the stopping threshold the contribution of each member into the forecasts is illustrated in fig 10 a simple comparison between the performance of each individual model during the independent validation period i e years 2012 2015 and the frequency of their selection for forecasting application shows that the selection ratios are not completely in accordance with models performance and even some relatively lower performing members have been frequently selected based on the proposed procedure this is justifiable by the fact the entropy terms used in the proposed selection procedure evaluate the information content of the whole ensemble rather than focusing on individual members this expresses that besides high performance models considering some members with unique information is necessary for possessing mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 4 4 en bma versus bma bma and the proposed en bma method with a stopping threshold of 0 95 are employed to forecast the streamflow up to seven days ahead within the validation period in both big east river and black river watersheds figs 11 and 12 compare the accuracy reliability and sharpness of the bma and en bma methods using six different performance statistics presented in section 3 it can be recognized that in general when all flows are considered there is a small loss of deterministic performance in the big east river watershed by applying the proposed entropy based approach while in the black river all deterministic measures i e nse rmse and ve show marginal advantage of en bma compared to bma for all lead times however by focusing on high flows fig 12 the superiority of the en bma over bma in both watersheds is shown based on all performance statistics these improvements exist in all forecasting horizons but more so during shorter lead times e g the 1 day ahead nse improvement of 8 and 65 in comparison to 4 and 32 for 7 day ahead forecasts in big east river and black river watersheds respectively in terms of probabilistic forecasts almost the same conclusions can be derived the general performance statistics based on all data i e fig 11 show that applying en bma may slightly deteriorate the probabilistic performance of the results however improvements are notable in both watersheds for the high flows fig 12 especially for shorter forecast horizons for instance the containing ratios regarding high flows cr95 90 at 1 day ahead forecasts improve more than 10 in both watersheds with the same or less corresponding bandwidth this improvement extended to the longer lead times in black river watersheds however in the big east river although the high flow forecasts reliability of the en bma approach is better sharpness was deteriorated as stated previously the quantile quantile plot and its corresponding reliability measure α are also used for comparing the performance of en bma and bma methods when looking at the results derived from all streamflow data fig 13 there is a negligible difference between the performances of both approaches in both watersheds although en bma leads to better results in the big east river watershed it slightly deteriorates in the black river watershed however in term of high flow forecasting fig 14 the higher reliability of the en bma results as compared with bma is noticeable the percent improvement shown for the α values when using the en bma approach for 1 day ahead forecasts was approximately 13 and 18 in the big east river and the black river watersheds respectively this superiority was shown to decrease with increasing lead times however a positive percent improvement was still found for all lead times it is worthy of note that in both the q q plot and the volume error values figs 12 and 14 respectively both bma and en bma methods underestimate high flows in the black river watershed these underestimations were seen for all calibrated hydrologic models used in this study this may be due to the limitation of the precipitation data in the study area darbandsari and coulibaly 2020 the mean areal forcing precipitation data may not be representative of the actual precipitation patterns therefore affecting both the en bma and bma results however it does not affect the comparing process finally in order to complete the comparison fig 15 illustrates a representative portion of hydrographs including observed bma and en bma derived mean and 95 prediction uncertainty for different forecasting horizons i e 1 3 5 and 7 days in line with previous conclusions the plots of different lead times show that in both watersheds en bma outperforms bma in terms of both probabilistic and deterministic performance regarding high flow predictions these outperforming results are more noticeable for shorter lead times 1 day and 3 day ahead forecasts it is worth mentioning that in general both en bma and bma results have almost the same accuracy and reliability regarding low flows in both watersheds this is due to the fact that the temporal variability of streamflow forecasts based on different ensemble members is marginal in low flows and narrowing down the ensemble member using en bma method does not significantly affects the results on the other hand however it can be seen that implementing en bma leads to less sharp low flow forecasts in comparison to the original bma especially in base flows after a rainfall event fig 15 this is justifiable by the fact that the moving windows sorounding these days used in the selection procedure include high flow events which leads to the selected ensemble with larger variability 5 summary and conclusion the multi model ensemble prediction system is a well known approach to quantify and reduce model structural uncertainty among various post processing methods bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most reliable statistical tools for generating predictive forecasts by relatively merging individual ones in bma the law of total probability is used for estimating the predictive distribution of the forecast variable as a weighted average of the pdfs of individual forecasts therefore having mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive members of the ensemble is a fundamental need in order to reach more reliable results however these two requirements are in conflict with each other so providing a balance between them seems necessary for possessing better bma based predictive forecasts given the mentioned challenge in order to narrow down the streamflow forecasts for meeting the two contrasting criteria this study developed a novel entropy based selection method to be employed prior to the bma since information theory measures have shown success in different hydrometric network design applications where the same competing objectives are considered we utilized three entropy terms i e total correlation joint entropy and transinformation for generating an independent and exhaustive ensemble in the proposed structure minimizing total correlation assures the minimum redundancy between selected members while joint entropy of members and transinformation between members and observation lead to an ensemble with higher information we compared the application of the bma and the proposed en bma methods for generating probabilistic streamflow forecasts at short to medium range lead times 1 to 7 day ahead forecasts in two data poor watersheds located in ontario canada seven conceptual lumped hydrologic models with different structures and five different objective functions were used to create an ensemble of 35 streamflow forecasts for each watershed we used six different evaluation metrics the q q plot and representative hydrographs for comprehensively comparing bma and en bma results regarding the whole time series and the high flows separately the summary of the most important obtained results in both watersheds is as follows the simulation results comparing the calibrated models using different objective functions as well as the comparison of bma with two different ensemble scenarios indicate that using multiplie objective functions for calibrating various hydrologic models leads to an ensemble of members with higher diversity and can enhance the bma performance this conclusion is in line with previous studies suggesting the use of diverse ensemble members in conjunction with bma dong et al 2013 parrish et al 2012 sharma et al 2019 evaluating the proposed entropy based selection procedure illustrates the same importance of having collectively exhaustive ensemble as mutually exclusive members besides independency the number of ensemble members should be large enough in order to have enough information about all future possibilities otherwise the bma application may be unreliable and leads to overestimation of predicitive uncertainties madadgar and moradkhani 2014 refsgaard et al 2012 comparing the application of bma and the proposed en bma methods in both watersheds shows no significant difference between bma and en bma methods when the whole forecast time series is considered however in term of high flow forecasts en bma provided better deterministic and probabilistic results based on nse and rmse scores for high flows the accuracy of the forecasts enhanced significantly after implementing en bma in both study watersheds also the q q plots and the containing ratio measurements indicate higher reliability of the en bma derived probabilistic forecasts for high flows as compared to bma without losing its sharpness this is more apparent at the shorter lead times in general besides confirming the merits of using multiple models with multiple objectives over only considering multi models for generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts the results suggest that the proposed en bma method outperforms the traditional bma in both deterministic and probabilistic ways through constructing a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble of streamflow forecasts especially for high flows which are of particular interest in operational hydrology the findings of this study call for further studies on employing other entropy measures for generating proper streamflow ensemble for bma applications in addition as the proposed entropy based selection procedure is not restricted to specific types of variables apart from streamflow forecasts further studies could employ the proposed method for other variables such as precipitation and temperature with different time intervals e g hourly although both basins used in this study have similar climatologic conditions their hydrologic responses are quite different and yield two distinct probability distributions of streamflow data which is the most effective characteristic in the calculation of entropy terms and the bma application this difference suggests that the findings of this research can be easily generalized to other future studies such future applications of the proposed en bma method should cover diverse watersheds with different climatology land cover and topography furthermore it is noteworthy that the bma approach and therefore the en bma estimates predictive distribution by using the information derived from an ensemble of multi model streamflow forecasts while there are some other valuable information such as the known initial and boundary conditions that can be used for reducing hydrologic uncertainty this study evaluates the positive direct effects of possessing mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble on bma results however for operational purposes such as flood forecasting explicitly deciphering the initial condition uncertainty by implementing an updating procedure e g data assimilation methods in conjunction with the proposed en bma approach is recommended credit authorship

this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief bayesian model averaging bma is a well known statistical post processing approach for probabilistically merging individual forecasts in bma the posterior distribution of the predictand variable is determined by implementing the law of total probability therefore possessing an ensemble of independent members mutually exclusive with the highest information content about observation variability collectively exhaustive is the main inherent assumption of the original bma method mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive are two contradictory criteria although constructing an ensemble of members that fully satisfied these two properties is practically impossible providing a balance between them is a key requirement for enhancing the bma performance through coupling bma with shannon entropy of information theory this study proposes an entropy based selection procedure to construct an ensemble of streamflow forecasts by better addressing the aforementioned contradictory criteria prior to performing the bma we investigate the effects of using ensembles with the aforementioned properties by comparing the results of original bma with the proposed entropy based bma en bma for short to medium range daily streamflow forecasts in two different watersheds the results indicate that the en bma leads to better results particularly for high flow predictions both probabilistic and deterministic high flow forecasts are more accurate and reliable when using the en bma approach however for the average flow forecasts there are no clear differences in the general performance of both methods the improvements observed are more pronounced for shorter lead times and less pronounced but still present for longer lead times keywords bayesian model averaging streamflow forecasting uncertainty entropy information theory 1 introduction reliable streamflow prediction is an essential task for various water management issues from flood forecasting and reservoir operation to recreational activities various sources of uncertainties associated with forcing inputs initial conditions model parameters and model structures affect the reliability of hydrological forecasts moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 shrestha 2009 xu et al 2019 generating an ensemble streamflow prediction esp is one of the most common approaches for quantifying different uncertainties madadgar and moradkhani 2014 michaels 2015 seo et al 2006 it is shown that an esp is more skillful and functional than deterministic systems for operational purposes boucher et al 2011 xu et al 2019 besides using various meteorological forcing inputs and perturbing initial states of the model esp can be created by utilizing multiple hydrologic models in order to quantify the model structural uncertainty and prevent statistical bias of the prediction darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 parrish et al 2012 various statistical and post processing tools have been developed for optimally merging the individual members of the esp simple averaging delsole 2007 and granger ramanathan averaging granger and ramanathan 1984 are the simplest ones providing one point deterministic results however some more complex methods such as bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 raftery 1993 raftery et al 2005 1997 generate probabilistic forecasts by quantifying predictive uncertainty bma is a statistical procedure using the weighted average of the probability distribution functions pdf of different individual forecasts for generating predictive forecast distributions in comparison to the other multi model combination methods the higher capability of the bma approach in producing more accurate and reliable forecasts has been shown by various studies arsenault et al 2015 viallefont et al 2001 exploring the application of the bma approach in the field of streamflow predictions simulations has led to different variants by relaxing some inherent assumptions of the original bma besides proposing some minor modifications such as implementing more representative distribution types vrugt and robinson 2007 or applying data transformation duan et al 2007 liang et al 2013 qu et al 2017 several more complicated bma based post processing methods have been developed such as combining bma and data assimilation parrish et al 2012 rings et al 2012 copulas and bma madadgar and moradkhani 2014 and copula bayesian processors with bma he et al 2018 all bma variants listed attempt to relax the gaussian assumption of the posterior distributions while there are some fundamental limitations of the original bma method which remain one of the primary principles of the standard bma formulations is the law of total probability this principle leads to the assumption of possessing mutually exclusive i e independent as well as collectively exhaustive i e capturing observation variability members of the ensemble in other words having an ensemble of members with the least shared information and higher capability of covering possible futures is a potential requirement for reliable performance of the bma approach it has been shown that selecting independent forecast members enhance the reliability of the bma results sharma et al 2019 however capturing the variability of the observation by using an ensemble is not possible except by having collectively exhaustive members madadgar and moradkhani 2014 simply constructing a large ensemble of members can provide more information about observation and relatively assure the latter requirement while it may limit the former one as the larger number of members can lead to higher redundant information within the ensemble refsgaard et al 2012 given the contradiction between the two criteria it is impossible to possess a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble simultaneously therefore constructing an esp by providing a balance between the two criteria is necessary and can positively affect the performance of the bma method the information theory also known as shannon entropy was first introduced by shannon 1948 and has become very popular in several scientific fields the definition of the entropy term in the context of information theory is a measure of uncertainty in a random variable and based on the fact that the amount of uncertainty will be reduced if more information is available entropy corresponds to the amount of information contained in a data set keum and coulibaly 2017a there are various applications of information theory in solving different water related issues mishra and coulibaly 2009 singh 1997 one common application of entropy in water resources has been to aid in the design of hydrometric monitoring networks alfonso et al 2013 2010 keum et al 2019 keum and coulibaly 2017b leach et al 2015 li et al 2012 where gathering high quality information with minimal redundancy is the main objective this study seeks to establish a new entropy based selection procedure using the proven capability of the information theory concept to provide information with minimal redundancy the new method will integrate entropy with bma in order to overcome the remaining challenge of possessing mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive mece ensemble in the proposed entropy based bma en bma framework before estimating bma parameters three entropy measures joint entropy total correlation and transinformation are utilized to narrow down the streamflow forecasts for constructing ensemble with the mece properties the applicability and efficiency of the proposed en bma approach have been assessed in two different watersheds for short to medium range up to 7 days daily streamflow predictions by providing a balance between two conflicting criteria the results show the superiority of the en bma in providing better probabilistic and deterministic high flow forecasts over the standard bma approach the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 introduces the underlying concepts of our new en bma method the experimental setup including brief explanations of the study areas hydrologic models and different verification metrics are presented in section 3 section 4 provides the comparison results between the original bma and the proposed en bma methods and finally the summary and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 definitions of entropy terms as defined in information theory entropy is a measure of the amount of information required to describe a random variable in other words it is the amount of uncertainty represented by the probability distribution of a random variable the basis of the shannon entropy is that the information gained from an event with occurrence probability p is l o g 1 p this stems from the fact that the anticipatory uncertainty from an event varies inversely with its probability also the logarithmic function is the only transition that can be used in order to make sure that the information gained by the joint occurrence of two independent events is equal to the sum of the information from each one 1 log 1 p x 1 p x 2 log 1 p x 1 log 1 p x 2 log p x 1 log p x 2 consequently in the case of a discrete variable x with k outcomes with probabilities p 1 p 2 p k the average information of x is denoted by 2 h x e log 1 p 1 p 2 p k i 1 k p i log p i where e is the expectation function and h x is the marginal entropy of a single variable x in bits because the base of the logarithm is assumed to be equal to 2 therefore marginal entropy is the amount of information gained by knowing a single variable and it varies between zero for a deterministic case and logn for the most uncertain cases uniformly distributed variables it is of note that for continuous variables such as streamflow data a finite number of discrete data intervals must be chosen a similar procedure is used for calculating the total information content in more than two variables e g n variables which is known as joint multivariate entropy h x 1 x 2 x n 3 h x 1 x 2 x n i 1 1 k 1 i 2 1 k 2 i n 1 k n p x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 x n i n log p x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 x n i n where p x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 x n i n is the joint probability of all variables and k j j 1 n is the number of values or class intervals for variable x j in the case of discrete or continuous variables respectively if there are independent variables multivariate entropy is equal to the summation of their marginal entropies and its maximum value will occur in the case of independent equally likely variables in general marginal and joint entropies are related as follows 4 h x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n h x i c x 1 x 2 x n where c x 1 x 2 x n is the total correlation which estimates the amount of duplicated information in multiple variables it is of note that increasing the number of variables could potentially lead to larger total correlation fig 1 if the number of variables is reduced to two eq 4 can be rewritten as follows 5 h x 1 x 2 h x 1 h x 2 t x 1 x 2 where t x 1 x 2 is the amount of mutual information or transinformation between variables x 1 and x 2 in other words it shows the information content of one variable that is contained in another transinformation is symmetric i e t x 1 x 2 t x 2 x 1 and will be equal to zero when two variables are statistically independent the larger value of transinformation depicts the higher dependence between the variables and the maximum value occurs in the case of functionally dependent variables therefore transinformation varies in the range of zero to min h x 1 h x 2 for more clarification fig 1 illustrates the schematic of the various aforementioned entropy terms for a case of three variables where the circle sizes indicate the amount of marginal entropy as can be seen transinformation is only meaningful for two variables or groups of variables and is not equal to total correlation when we possess three or more data sets moreover the total correlation is the sum of all order duplications in the system based on the definition of the previously mentioned entropy terms it can be concluded that these concepts can be used in order to relax some of the remaining assumptions and hypotheses of the bma method i e independent and mutually exclusive predictions 2 2 bayesian model averaging with moving window bma is a probabilistic post processor where the conditional pdfs of various forecasts are combined in order to generate more skillful predictions bma was first introduced for statistical linear regression applications hoeting et al 1999 kass and raftery 1995 raftery et al 2005 extended the application of bma to dynamic models given the detailed description of the bma approach in the literature darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 raftery et al 2005 we briefly explained the bma basic concepts for the sake of completeness consider the quantity δ to be the predictand i e forecasted variable based on the training data d and the ensemble of independent predictions f f 1 f 2 f k based on the law of total probability the bma predictive pdf of δ can be represented as 6 p δ f d i 1 k p δ f i d p f i d where p f i d is the posterior probability of the forecast f i being correct given the observational data this term can be viewed as a weight w i reflecting how well the ensemble member i fits the observations in the training period moreover p δ f i d is the pdf of the predictand δ conditional on the forecast f i and observed data d in the standard bma approach this posterior probability is assumed to follow the gaussian distribution centered at the forecast value with standard deviation σ i in order to estimate the parameters of the bma approach i e weights and variances of each individual forecast the expectation maximization em algorithm proposed by raftery et al 2005 is applied for maximizing the log likelihood function of the parameter vector θ 7 l θ l o g p δ f 1 f 2 f k d log i 1 k w i g y f i σ i 2 em is an iterative approach including expectation and maximization steps where a latent variable is used for searching the optimal values of parameters although obtaining a global optimum solution is not guaranteed it has been shown that em is as reliable and efficient as more complex global optimization techniques darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 vrugt et al 2008 for a more detailed description of the em algorithm the reader is referred to the above cited references using a fixed training set of data leads to a static estimation of the bma parameters which does not change with respect to the hydrologic regime however updating the parameters when new observations are available may provide more reliable results therefore following raftery et al 2005 the moving window approach is implemented where the shorter window of simulation observation pairs surrounding each forecast is used as the recursive training period for calculating bma parameters by capturing the time dependent relative performance of various members of the ensemble the bma with moving window leads to better probabilistic forecasts parrish et al 2012 vrugt and robinson 2007 2 3 entropy based bayesian model averaging method as previously stated establishing a balanced ensemble of forecasts with mutually exclusive independent and collectively exhaustive capturing the observation variability members can potentially lead to more reliable bma derived predictive forecasts here by using three aforementioned entropy terms we introduce an easy to implement selection procedure through which the generated ensemble can 1 possess minimum redundancy and 2 assure the highest overall information fig 2 represents the proposed entropy based selection algorithm for optimally choosing the subset of forecast members with minimum redundancy and maximum information for bma application as can be seen the method has a nested loop structure the goal of the inner loop is finding less independent forecasts when the number of selected members is fixed therefore the total correlation between selected members is considered as an objective function and its values for potentially selected subsets s are compared in order to find the optimal one s f different subsets are initialized by iteratively removing one member of the candidate forecasts and finally the subset with the lowest dependence within its members is the selected one in other words the finally omitted member in each loop possesses the most duplicate information in common with other members which leads to the highest redundancy of the ensemble in the outer loop the stopping criteria are defined in order to provide collectively exhaustive ensemble therefore we introduce two entropy based ratios the first is the ratio of joint entropy of the selected optimal members derived from the inner loop to that of all the candidate members f f 1 f 2 f k this ratio shows how much of the information contained by the whole ensemble is covered using the selected subset although it illustrates the exhaustiveness of the selected members it is not a proper term for representing the amount of information about capturing the variability in the observations therefore the second criterion is defined as transinformation between the final selected subset and observations over transinformation between all candidate members and observations this provides a better estimation of the maximum information however both ratios must be used together to assure collectively exhaustive criterion in both calibration and forecasting periods fig 3 exemplifies the application of the proposed selection procedure for one forecast by illustrating how different entropy terms change in both inner and outer loops as previously stated the inner loop of the procedure determines the best subset of the ensemble with minimum total correlation and the outer loop continues until both stopping criteria are fulfilled the steady decrease of total correlation in the outer loop shows selection of less dependent members while the imposed stopping threshold parameter β ensures possessing an ensemble with sufficient information content the integration of the proposed entropy based selection algorithm with bma using the moving window scheme is presented in fig 4 for each forecast the moving window with length n is considered as the training period for implementing the selection procedure and estimating bma parameters the results of the training phase are used during the forecasting mode where at first the ensemble of streamflow forecasts up to t days ahead are generated using the selected members and deterministic precipitation p f and temperature t f forecasts and then the bma approach with estimated parameters is utilized as a post processor for probabilistically merging the generated forecasts it is of note that in this study we used observed precipitation and temperature as perfect deterministic meteorological forecasts by allowing the selected members to vary for each forecast we hope the proposed en bma is able to provide better deterministic and probabilistic results in comparison to the original bma where the same ensemble is implemented 3 experimental setup 3 1 study area the proposed en bma approach is applied to the big east river be and black river bl basins located in northern ontario canada fig 5 be is a mostly forested area of 620 km2 while bl with a drainage area of 1522 km2 is covered with the combination of agricultural lands and natural forests both watersheds are moderately sloped with altitudes approximately changing from 290 to 560 and 220 to 420 m above sea level for be and bl respectively from the six available meteorological stations located around both watersheds the mean annual precipitation ranges between 887 and 1249 mm in addition the average temperature variations from 10 5 c in january to 18 5 c in july depict the occurrence of all four seasons in both watersheds table 1 moreover in april when the temperature rises to above the freezing point and snowmelt begins the highest amount of discharge at the outlet of both watersheds can be seen this depicts the importance of considering the snowmelt routine in the hydrological modeling of both watersheds it is noted that the low density ground based stations shows the status of data poor watersheds where the conceptual models are the most appropriate ones for rainfall runoff modeling anshuman et al 2019 tegegne et al 2017 3 2 ensemble streamflow forecasts in this study as presented in table 2 seven different lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models employed for generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts are sacsma machbv smarg gr4j and three different configurations of hec hms model these models possess unique structural complexities with varying numbers of parameters daily precipitation and temperature are the only inputs to the chosen models with different methods used for calculating potential evapotranspiration pet depending on the model table 2 moreover as stated in the previous section snowmelt is one of the most important hydrologic processes in our study areas therefore for adding more diversity three different snowmelt modules are implemented with various models table 2 in the simple degree day method ddm samuel et al 2011 which uses five parameters a linear relationship between temperature and the amount of snowmelt is considered the 10 parameter snowmelt routine of the hec hms models scharffenberg 2016 uses the antecedent temperature index for calculating the melt rate snow17 anderson 2006 1973 including 11 parameters is a more complex temperature index approach where some of the snowmelt related physical processes are considered by considering 6 years of historical data i e years 2006 2011 as the calibration period we use the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 for estimating models parameters using five different objective functions kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nash volume error samuel et al 2011 focus on medium flows in different ways while modified nash volume error m n v e darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 and peak weighted root mean square error p w r m s e cunderlik and simonovic 2004 are aimed to simulate high flows more accurate as shown in eq 8 in mnve the combination of volume error ve and nse based on squared transformed streamflow nse sqrt reflecting the accuracy of high flows is used 8 mnve nse sqrt 0 1 v e also pwrmse is formulated as follows 9 pwrmse 1 n i 1 n f i o i 2 o i o 2 o 1 2 where n is the data length and f i o i and o respectively are the simulted observed and the mean of observed flows as can be seen pwrmse gives higher weights to errors near the peak flows utilizing multiple objective functions can provide better bma predictions in different flow ranges dong et al 2013 combining the seven hydrologic models and five objective functions leads to a set of 35 calibrated models this set can then be used to generate an ensemble of streamflow forecasts 3 3 performance measures the accuracy reliability and sharpness are the most important aspects of any predictive forecast need to be evaluated in this study we used six different evaluation metrics and some visual graphical tools to cover all of the aforementioned properties in terms of the accuracy three deterministic based measures including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse volume error ve and the root mean square error rmse are employed 10 nse 1 i 1 n f i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 11 ve i 1 n f i o i i 1 n o i 12 rmse 1 n i 1 n f i o i 2 1 2 where f i and o i are respectively the forecast and observed variable o is the observation mean and n is the dataset length nse varies between and 1 with the best value of 1 while ve and rmse possess a range of 0 when lower values show better model performance moreover the mean continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 evaluates the accuracy of the results in a probabilistic way by comparing the cumulative distribution of forecasts p i f x and observations p i o x determined by using heavside function h x o i 13 crps 1 n i 1 n x x p i f x p i o x 2 d x 14 p i o x h x o i 0 x o i 1 x o i the range for crps is 0 to where smaller values indicate better performance the containing ratio c r 95 and the average bandwidth b 95 of the 95 confidence interval xiong et al 2009 are the two other performance statistics being used to assess the reliability and sharpness of the probabilistic forecasts respectively c r 95 is the ratio of the observations covered by the 95 prediction bound it ranges between 0 and 1 with an optimal value of 0 95 b 95 determines the average width of the aforementioned interval and it is negatively oriented with lower values indicating better forecasts 15 c r

is denoted by f u i and f l i respectively simultaneously evaluating these two criteria is vital for providing precise conclusions for instance a forecast with a good c r 95 may still be underconfident by providing high b 95 indicating an overestimation of the uncertainty bound apart from previously presented verification metrics we adopted the predictive quantile quantile plot q q plot laio and tamea 2007 as an additional visual statistical verification of the forecast reliability where the comparison is made between forecast and the cumulative uniform distributions the more the q q plot follows the bisector line the more reliable the forecast is therefore another reliability measure α can also be calculated from a q q plot which represents the discrepancy between q q plot and the bisector line renard et al 2010 17 α 1 2 1 n i 1 n p i f o i u o t p i f o i and u o t respectively determine the non exceedance probability of the observed value using forecast and uniform cumulative distributions α 1 shows the perfect reliability while its worst value is zero moreover the representative hydrographs are another tool for assessing both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts visually furthermore for more specific evaluation and comparison of different methods performance regarding high flows all aforementioned performance measures are also determined based on the high flow data 90th percentile of streamflow 4 results and discussion 4 1 rainfall runoff models calibration as previously stated for each hydrologic model five optimized parameter sets are obtained by considering different criteria i e kge nse nve mnve and pwrmse as an objective function in the optimzation process using the calibration period from 2006 to 2011 a comparison between the performances of different models calibrated using different objective functions in the three years validation period 2012 2015 in terms of nse rmse ve and their corresponding values derived from flows more than 90 percentile i e nse 90 rmse 90 and v e 90 can be found in fig 6 in the big east river watershed the results in general indicate the superiority of gr4j model in simulating daily streamflows however by focusing on high flows machbv shows the most reliable performance in the black river on the other hand machbv is the most consistent model by providing the best results based on almost all performance metrics while sacsma performs competitively regarding high flow simulation the fact that machbv was initially developed for streamflow simulation in ontarian s ungauged basins samuel et al 2012 2011 can justify the robust performance of machbv in both watersheds which are considered as data scarce regions with low density ground based measurements darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 morever comparing the use of different objective functions shows that implementing kge as an objective function consistently leads to relatively better performance for most of the hydrologic models in the big east river watershed while its application in the black river is not among the best ones nse based calibrated models compared with nve provide better results in terms of nse and rmse criteria in both watersheds however their performances are worst regarding volume error ve metric for most of the models by combining nse and ve metrics nve criterion provides a balance among volume error and difference between streamflow simulations and their corresponding observations lindström 1997 samuel et al 2011 furthermore the results show that using objective functions focusing on high flows i e pwrms and mnve does not always lead to better calibrated models regarding high flows overall the main conclusion that stands out from comparing the different objective functions is that it is practically impossible to select one criteria which gives the best optimal parameters sets for all hydrologic models based on different performance measurements in both watersheds therefore besides helping in finding the best optimal parameter sets for each hydrologic model using different objective functions provides larger number of ensemble members with higher potential capability in capturing future flow possibilities 4 2 multi model versus multi model multi objective ensemble scenarios prior to the application of the proposed en bma method we evaluate the effects of using multiple objective functions for generating ensemble members to be merged by bma with different moving window lengths considering two ensemble scenarios of multi model e 7 and multi model with multiple parameter sets generated using different objective functions e 35 fig 7 illustrates the performance statistics of the 1 day ahead bma forecasts as a function of the number of days of the moving window for both big east river and black river watersheds the most influenced properties of the forecasts changing based on the window length are the reliability c r 95 and sharpness b 95 of the results although the shorter training period leads to smaller uncertainty bounds it highly reduces the reliability of the forecasts in both watersheds and both ensemble scenarios these results are qualitatively in line with previous studies e g raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 showing that increasing moving window length enhances the reliability of the forecasts while it reduces the sharpness other performance measures focusing on the accuracy of the results show negligible changes regarding the moving window length therefore given that a similar trend has been seen for other forecast horizons up to 7 days we select a length of 100 days where the reliability of the results appears to reach stability beyond which the sharpness of the results deteriorates without significant improvement of the containing ratio moreover although the superiority of scenario e 35 over e 7 can be seen from fig 7 a comprehensive comparison of both ensemble scenarios has been made using bma with a 100 day moving window for 1 3 5 and 7 day ahead forecasts it is of note that n day ahead forecasts mean the times series of forecasts for lead time n independently and not as aggregated of 1 to n day ahead therefore all criteria being calculated based on n day ahead time series of forecasts only indicate the performance at that particular lead time the results as shown in fig 8 indicate that using multiple models with multiple objective functions consistently enhance the probabilistic performance of the bma method for different lead times in both watersheds these improvements are also apparent in the deterministic performance statistics regarding high flows especially in the black river watershed consequently it can be concluded that constructing an ensemble using multiple models with multiple parameter sets based on different objective functions leads to better bma results accordingly for the en bma application the multi model multi objective ensemble scenario including 35 members of streamflow predictions was implemented for both watersheds 4 3 the effects of the stopping threshold value on en bma the main parameter of the proposed en bma approach is the stopping threshold value β which needs to be determined beforehand therefore the sensitivity analysis was carried out for different β values i e 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 and 0 99 to assess how selecting this threshold can affect the streamflow forecasts the first noticeable effect of the stopping threshold is on the number of selected members fig 9 by increasing β a higher numbers of members are selected for bma application larger stopping threshold value focuses more on increasing information content of the whole ensemble rather than independence of its members while choosing smaller β leads to lower redundant information without paying that much attention to the ensemble exhaustiveness in addition different performance measurements for the 1 day lead time forecasts are presented in table 3 what stands out in this table is that in general a higher threshold leads to sharper forecasts for both watersheds while the deterministic performance slightly deteriorates especially in high flows therefore in this study the threshold value of 0 95 was chosen for both watersheds which provides a balance between the different performance statistics these results indicate the same value of having mutually exclusive as well as collectively exhaustive ensemble refsgaard et al 2012 and indicate the importance of selecting a proper threshold value prior to the en bma application besides assessing the effects of the stopping threshold the contribution of each member into the forecasts is illustrated in fig 10 a simple comparison between the performance of each individual model during the independent validation period i e years 2012 2015 and the frequency of their selection for forecasting application shows that the selection ratios are not completely in accordance with models performance and even some relatively lower performing members have been frequently selected based on the proposed procedure this is justifiable by the fact the entropy terms used in the proposed selection procedure evaluate the information content of the whole ensemble rather than focusing on individual members this expresses that besides high performance models considering some members with unique information is necessary for possessing mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 4 4 en bma versus bma bma and the proposed en bma method with a stopping threshold of 0 95 are employed to forecast the streamflow up to seven days ahead within the validation period in both big east river and black river watersheds figs 11 and 12 compare the accuracy reliability and sharpness of the bma and en bma methods using six different performance statistics presented in section 3 it can be recognized that in general when all flows are considered there is a small loss of deterministic performance in the big east river watershed by applying the proposed entropy based approach while in the black river all deterministic measures i e nse rmse and ve show marginal advantage of en bma compared to bma for all lead times however by focusing on high flows fig 12 the superiority of the en bma over bma in both watersheds is shown based on all performance statistics these improvements exist in all forecasting horizons but more so during shorter lead times e g the 1 day ahead nse improvement of 8 and 65 in comparison to 4 and 32 for 7 day ahead forecasts in big east river and black river watersheds respectively in terms of probabilistic forecasts almost the same conclusions can be derived the general performance statistics based on all data i e fig 11 show that applying en bma may slightly deteriorate the probabilistic performance of the results however improvements are notable in both watersheds for the high flows fig 12 especially for shorter forecast horizons for instance the containing ratios regarding high flows cr95 90 at 1 day ahead forecasts improve more than 10 in both watersheds with the same or less corresponding bandwidth this improvement extended to the longer lead times in black river watersheds however in the big east river although the high flow forecasts reliability of the en bma approach is better sharpness was deteriorated as stated previously the quantile quantile plot and its corresponding reliability measure α are also used for comparing the performance of en bma and bma methods when looking at the results derived from all streamflow data fig 13 there is a negligible difference between the performances of both approaches in both watersheds although en bma leads to better results in the big east river watershed it slightly deteriorates in the black river watershed however in term of high flow forecasting fig 14 the higher reliability of the en bma results as compared with bma is noticeable the percent improvement shown for the α values when using the en bma approach for 1 day ahead forecasts was approximately 13 and 18 in the big east river and the black river watersheds respectively this superiority was shown to decrease with increasing lead times however a positive percent improvement was still found for all lead times it is worthy of note that in both the q q plot and the volume error values figs 12 and 14 respectively both bma and en bma methods underestimate high flows in the black river watershed these underestimations were seen for all calibrated hydrologic models used in this study this may be due to the limitation of the precipitation data in the study area darbandsari and coulibaly 2020 the mean areal forcing precipitation data may not be representative of the actual precipitation patterns therefore affecting both the en bma and bma results however it does not affect the comparing process finally in order to complete the comparison fig 15 illustrates a representative portion of hydrographs including observed bma and en bma derived mean and 95 prediction uncertainty for different forecasting horizons i e 1 3 5 and 7 days in line with previous conclusions the plots of different lead times show that in both watersheds en bma outperforms bma in terms of both probabilistic and deterministic performance regarding high flow predictions these outperforming results are more noticeable for shorter lead times 1 day and 3 day ahead forecasts it is worth mentioning that in general both en bma and bma results have almost the same accuracy and reliability regarding low flows in both watersheds this is due to the fact that the temporal variability of streamflow forecasts based on different ensemble members is marginal in low flows and narrowing down the ensemble member using en bma method does not significantly affects the results on the other hand however it can be seen that implementing en bma leads to less sharp low flow forecasts in comparison to the original bma especially in base flows after a rainfall event fig 15 this is justifiable by the fact that the moving windows sorounding these days used in the selection procedure include high flow events which leads to the selected ensemble with larger variability 5 summary and conclusion the multi model ensemble prediction system is a well known approach to quantify and reduce model structural uncertainty among various post processing methods bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most reliable statistical tools for generating predictive forecasts by relatively merging individual ones in bma the law of total probability is used for estimating the predictive distribution of the forecast variable as a weighted average of the pdfs of individual forecasts therefore having mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive members of the ensemble is a fundamental need in order to reach more reliable results however these two requirements are in conflict with each other so providing a balance between them seems necessary for possessing better bma based predictive forecasts given the mentioned challenge in order to narrow down the streamflow forecasts for meeting the two contrasting criteria this study developed a novel entropy based selection method to be employed prior to the bma since information theory measures have shown success in different hydrometric network design applications where the same competing objectives are considered we utilized three entropy terms i e total correlation joint entropy and transinformation for generating an independent and exhaustive ensemble in the proposed structure minimizing total correlation assures the minimum redundancy between selected members while joint entropy of members and transinformation between members and observation lead to an ensemble with higher information we compared the application of the bma and the proposed en bma methods for generating probabilistic streamflow forecasts at short to medium range lead times 1 to 7 day ahead forecasts in two data poor watersheds located in ontario canada seven conceptual lumped hydrologic models with different structures and five different objective functions were used to create an ensemble of 35 streamflow forecasts for each watershed we used six different evaluation metrics the q q plot and representative hydrographs for comprehensively comparing bma and en bma results regarding the whole time series and the high flows separately the summary of the most important obtained results in both watersheds is as follows the simulation results comparing the calibrated models using different objective functions as well as the comparison of bma with two different ensemble scenarios indicate that using multiplie objective functions for calibrating various hydrologic models leads to an ensemble of members with higher diversity and can enhance the bma performance this conclusion is in line with previous studies suggesting the use of diverse ensemble members in conjunction with bma dong et al 2013 parrish et al 2012 sharma et al 2019 evaluating the proposed entropy based selection procedure illustrates the same importance of having collectively exhaustive ensemble as mutually exclusive members besides independency the number of ensemble members should be large enough in order to have enough information about all future possibilities otherwise the bma application may be unreliable and leads to overestimation of predicitive uncertainties madadgar and moradkhani 2014 refsgaard et al 2012 comparing the application of bma and the proposed en bma methods in both watersheds shows no significant difference between bma and en bma methods when the whole forecast time series is considered however in term of high flow forecasts en bma provided better deterministic and probabilistic results based on nse and rmse scores for high flows the accuracy of the forecasts enhanced significantly after implementing en bma in both study watersheds also the q q plots and the containing ratio measurements indicate higher reliability of the en bma derived probabilistic forecasts for high flows as compared to bma without losing its sharpness this is more apparent at the shorter lead times in general besides confirming the merits of using multiple models with multiple objectives over only considering multi models for generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts the results suggest that the proposed en bma method outperforms the traditional bma in both deterministic and probabilistic ways through constructing a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble of streamflow forecasts especially for high flows which are of particular interest in operational hydrology the findings of this study call for further studies on employing other entropy measures for generating proper streamflow ensemble for bma applications in addition as the proposed entropy based selection procedure is not restricted to specific types of variables apart from streamflow forecasts further studies could employ the proposed method for other variables such as precipitation and temperature with different time intervals e g hourly although both basins used in this study have similar climatologic conditions their hydrologic responses are quite different and yield two distinct probability distributions of streamflow data which is the most effective characteristic in the calculation of entropy terms and the bma application this difference suggests that the findings of this research can be easily generalized to other future studies such future applications of the proposed en bma method should cover diverse watersheds with different climatology land cover and topography furthermore it is noteworthy that the bma approach and therefore the en bma estimates predictive distribution by using the information derived from an ensemble of multi model streamflow forecasts while there are some other valuable information such as the known initial and boundary conditions that can be used for reducing hydrologic uncertainty this study evaluates the positive direct effects of possessing mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ensemble on bma results however for operational purposes such as flood forecasting explicitly deciphering the initial condition uncertainty by implementing an updating procedure e g data assimilation methods in conjunction with the proposed en bma approach is recommended credit authorship
