12630,the treatment of the highly contaminated process water produced during the hydrothermal carbonization htc of waste activated sludge is of major concern for the full scale implementation of the htc process so far no satisfying treatment strategies have been elaborated and the biodegradability under aerobic conditions has hardly been studied to fill these gaps aerobic tests were first carried out in batches with htc process waters produced at 190 c 218 c and 249 c and two parallel sequencing batch reactors sbr were operated to treat process waters produced at 190 c and 217 c both experiments show that the htc temperature has only a little effect on the elimination of dissolved organic carbon doc in the aerobic batch tests doc removal were 80 5 81 9 in the sbr 28 of the initial doc was found to be recalcitrant and 25 28 of the initial nitrogen in the sbr experiments the nitrification was also monitored and nitrification inhibition test were conducted on both process waters obtained at 190 c and 217 c nitrification the initial sbr reactors was only possible after dilution of the process waters which indicates the presence of inhibiting substances the inhibition tests validated those observations and showed that process waters derived at 217 c had a higher inhibition potential this study demonstrates that aerobically treated htc process waters are still too polluted to be discharged in a wastewater treatment plant model calculations showed an increase in effluent doc of 8 3 mg c l graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic biodegradation hydrothermal carbonization nitrification inhibition htc process water recalcitrant compounds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrothermal carbonization htc is an alternative technology for recovering resources from waste materials such as sewage sludge it has gained increasing attention in recent years to produce hydrochars a coal like solid with high carbon density and high dewatering properties during htc temperatures up to 300 c break down the sewage sludge structure by mechanisms like dehydration and decarboxylation 1 2 the higher the reaction temperatures the higher the coalification of the generated hydrochars one formation pathway of hydrochars is the polymerization of dissolved reaction by products 3 however a substantial amount of slowly or non polymerizing organic matter remains dissolved and form a high strength wastewater with high amounts of refractory compounds aragón briceño et al 4 reported total organic carbon toc concentrations up to 29 778 mg c l and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentrations of 8064 mg n l also others studies showed the high loading of htc process waters 5 6 such high concentrations result from various components like volatile fatty acids vfa humic like substances n heterocycle compounds phenols ketones or aldehydes 7 9 readily biodegradable substances such as acetic acid suggest the use of anaerobic digestion for process water treatment and has been studied intensively 8 10 12 weide et al 13 investigated two stage anaerobic digestion to treat process waters from the hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge using a continuous stirred tank reactor and an expanded granular sludge bed reactor with aerobic downstream treatment this removed 55 58 of the chemical oxygen demand cod and the subsequent aerobic digestion led to an overall cod removal of 71 78 in general increasing hydrothermal reaction temperature lead to a drop in biogas yield during anaerobic digestion 14 15 indicating the formation of slow biodegradable or inhibiting substances 16 unlike anaerobic digestion the use of aerobic processes for htc process water treatment has not gained much attention yet nevertheless aerobic treatment could be advantageous regarding the removal of refractory compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah phenols n heterocyclic compounds or melanoidins 17 melanoidins which are the brownish reaction products from the maillard reaction are of particular concern as they are formed during thermal sewage sludge treatment and have antimicrobial properties and limited biodegradability 18 as a result lag phases were prolonged and growth rates were lower 19 however the role of melanoidins and recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen rdon and their evaluation needs further research 20 the few studies focusing on aerobic treatment used different htc feedstock and reported cod removal rates of 58 89 and the inhibition of nitrification inhibition could be reduced by anaerobic pretreatment and dilution 21 23 at high dilution no toxicity of htc process water to heterotrophic biomass of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp was observed and the readily biodegradable compounds could serve as an external carbon supplement 24 25 to the best of our knowledge the aerobic biodegradation and the inhibition of nitrification associated with htc process water from sewage sludge has not been given much attention in international literature and systematic studies on biodegradation and quantification of refractory compounds are lacking however the process water is of major concern for the full scale implementation of the htc process but no satisfying treatment strategies have been elaborated so far discharge into municipal wwtp must be well evaluated considering the loading and the amount of refractory compounds in the process water in order to find solutions for the treatment of htc process water established strategies for the treatment of high strength wastewaters e g for industrial wastewater or landfill leachate must also be considered against this background this study aims to assess the effect of the htc temperature on the aerobic biodegradability of process waters the total biodegradability of doc was determined in batch tests continuous sequencing batch reactors sbr were used to evaluate the recalcitrant doc rdoc and rdon and the nitrification performance subsequent nitrification tests revealed the inhibition potential of process water and aerobically pre treated process water 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of htc process water waste activated sludge was was obtained from a nitrifying municipal wwtp in germany which serves 50 000 people after sampling the sludge was frozen in portions at 20 c to obtain similar feedstock before use the samples were thawed overnight at ambient temperature total solids were 9 1 0 1 and volatile solids 6 8 0 1 n 7 to produce process water hydrothermal runs were performed using an electrically heated and water cooled 0 5 l batch reactor midiclave typ 3e 0 5lt büchi ag switzerland the stirrer was set to 2000 rpm hydrothermal temperatures were set to 189 0 6 c 218 0 1 c and 249 0 3 c for 30 min zw190 zw218 and zw249 and average pressures were 16 0 31 6 and 54 5 bar setting cover low medium and upper temperature range of htc processes after hydrothermal treatment a folded filter whatman 520 b 1 2240 mm ge healthcare uk was used to separate the process water from the coal slurry as suggested in literature for continuous tests technical more relevant htc conditions of 190 1 c and 217 3 c for 60 min feed sbr190 feed sbr217 at average pressures of 16 3 bar and 32 2 bar were chosen 9 26 at each temperature 12 hydrothermal runs were carried out and the process waters were mixed after filtration with folded filters the process waters were stored refrigerated at 4 c these process waters were also used for nitrification inhibition tests table 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of the process waters 2 2 zahn wellens tests zahn wellens tests were performed according to en iso 9888 1999 27 one day before the experiments aerobic inoculum from a nitrifying municipal wwtp in germany was rinsed three times with tap water and sieved 400 μm to remove coarse particulate substances in addition one test zw218 was inoculated with pre exposed biomass from a previous zahn wellens test following the same procedure the inoculum activity was checked using ethylene glycol and also inoculum blanks were set up the test vessels 2 l were filled with inoculum to a total mixed liquid suspended solids concentration mlss of 0 88 g l the process waters were diluted to achieve an initial doc of 350 mg c l the vessels were mixed with magnetic stirrers and aerated with a diaphragm pump via a wash bottle containing deionized water at 22 2 0 4 c to ensure sufficient dissolved oxygen do in the reactors 2 mg o2 l do was measured using a multi 3620 ids and an fdo 925 xylem analytics germany sales gmbh co kg and aeration was regulated if necessary the ph was adjusted several times a day to 6 7 7 8 using h2so4 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m before each sampling water losses due to evaporation were measured gravimetrically and replaced with deionized water all tests with process waters were carried out in triplicates with blanks in duplicates and with references in singles the doc removal of the reference compound was almost 100 after 15 days of incubation which proves a sufficient activity of the inoculum to calculate the doc removal rate the initial doc in the suspensions was used this differs from en iso 9888 1999 which recommends using the doc 2 5 to 3 5 h after starting the experiments to account for adsorption processes at the beginning during the first 3 h the doc removal was already 15 26 indicating as expected a high concentration of readily biodegradable substances such high organics removal was considered unlikely for adsorption only and was therefore attributed to biological degradation 2 3 sbr setup two continuous activated sludge reactors sbr190 and sbr217 were operated in parallel each vessel had a reaction volume of 300 ml and was aerated and mixed in the same way as the zahn wellens tests the sbrs were inoculated with nitrifying biomass from a lab scale reactor which was fed with htc process water temperature conductivity redox potential and ph were measured continuously using condumax cls21d and memosens cps16d sensors endress hauser conducta gmbh co kg germany a ph controlled peristaltic pump ismatec ismb833c cole parmer gmbh germany dispensed h2so4 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m to ensure a ph between 6 8 and 7 5 the temperature was 19 7 20 5 c the do was controlled manually several times a day to assure sufficient do in the reactors 2 mg o2 l the sbrs had one cycle per day i the reactor was filled manually with a volumetric pipette with 30 ml or 60 ml which depended on the operation phase see table 2 ii aeration and mixing started for 23 h iii settling for 30 min and iv effluent was removed manually with a volumetric pipette again losses due to evaporation were recorded gravimetrically and replaced with deionized water before step iv the effluent was analyzed 2 3 times a week and the influent once every two weeks samples for mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were taken from the fully mixed suspension once a week beyond that no additional sludge was removed from the systems and the sludge retention time srt should be sufficiently high for nitrification due to strong foaming 10 μl silicon free defoaming agent based on fatty alcohols was added daily ecso 8361 envirochemie gmbh germany the test reactors were operated in 3 phases with different process water

was taken from the same wwtp and prepared the same way as described in section 2 2 mixing aeration and temperature were also similar the do was checked regularly and ensured to be above 3 mg l and the ph was checked at the beginning and the end of the tests all tests ran for 3 5 h starting with the addition of inoculum mlss was adjusted to 2 3 3 3 g l and the initial nh4 n concentration was 50 mg n l to avoid ammonia inhibition nh4 2so4 was added to set the different shares of process water to 50 mg n l in each batch however the high nh4 n concentrations in the process waters only allowed a process water share of 4 therefore a second series was conducted with an initial nh4 n concentration of 250 mg n l allowing a share of up to 22 in addition to feed sbr190 and feed sbr217 the treated effluents of the sbrs during phase 1 were tested on nitrification inhibition again the tests needed to be performed with a defoaming agent as described in section 2 3 after each test the samples were filtered 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c before being analyzed for oxidized nitrogen nitrite and nitrate the inhibition rates in in and maximum nitrification rate rn in mg n g mlss h were calculated

color of samples which is mostly caused by melanoidins was evaluated by measuring specific uv absorbance at 475 nm as proposed by arimi et al 29 2 6 assessing the effect of htc on the effluent of a wwtp for this estimation sbr treatment of the htc process water was considered as a pretreatment step before discharge into an exemplary full scale wwtp from this wwtp we obtained the was for htc experiments the inflow qwwtp was 5400 m3 d and the was flow qwas was 11 1 m3 d with 9 2 total solids on average in 2020 and 2021 doc and don after sbr treatment were expected to be refractory for biodegradation in the wwtp and therefore increase the effluent concentrations of the wwtp assuming constant mass during htc and 65 total solids after dewatering the htc coal slurry 30 the mass balance

suva for zw218 and zw218 with pre exposed inoculum are depicted in fig 1a both batches show that the htc process waters contain a large fraction of readily biodegradable organics which resulted in a doc removal of 67 1 1 5 and 74 9 0 7 within 3 days of incubation between days 3 and 10 the doc removal was lower which indicates the presence of a slowly biodegradable fraction from day 10 on doc was only marginally reduced implying that biodegradable doc had been almost completely removed pre exposed inoculum in zw218 showed a slightly faster and further reduction of doc this indicates that adaption of aerobic microorganisms enables a faster removal of readily biodegradable compounds and additional removal of some of the slowly biodegradable compounds on day 28 the regular test duration to identify non biodegradable compounds according to en iso 9888 1999 doc was removed by 78 5 0 3 and 81 9 0 2 for zw218 and zw218 respectively extending the test period to 50 days had no significant effect on doc removal the suva increased from 1 4 l mg m to 3 2 and 3 3 l mg m for zw218 and zw218 on day 28 it followed the overall trend of doc removal by already reaching values above 3 l mg m after 8 days and by showing only a minor raise in the further course of tests increasing suvas indicate the removal of compounds that do not absorb uv light and the enrichment of hydrophobic humic like compounds 31 which are not available for biological treatment this could be caused by heterocyclic and aromatic structure of melanoidins which show a high uv quenching and therefore a high suva 32 accordingly the suva curve shows that a majority of readily biodegradable substances were degraded in the first days gupta et al 33 obtained similar results by investigating the removal of organic matter from return liquors from dewatering thermal hydrolysis digestate after 28 days of aerated incubation they observed a humic substances uv254 removal of 15 20 and a doc removal of 35 40 with this an increase in suva from 1 5 to 2 1 l mg m can be calculated all batches using non pre exposed biomass zw190 zw218 zw249 lead to very similar maximum doc removal fig 1c so the increasing htc reaction temperatures had only little impact on aerobic biodegradation this is quite surprising as lower biodegradability with increasing htc temperature was shown for anaerobic digestion of htc process waters 34 aerobic microorganisms are able to degrade the compounds that can form at elevated htc temperature to the same extent for example yeom et al 35 and pradeep et al 36 showed the adaption of biomass and biodegradation of phenols which are present in htc process water 9 also pahs were shown to be aerobically degraded 37 the degradation of n containing compounds was also shown in the evolution of ammonium fig 1b which was similar for all tests with non pre exposed biomass the increase in ammonium concentration with increasing htc temperature results from deamination which is the breakdown of dissolved nitrogen into lower molecular products releasing nh4 n 38 the evolution of nh4 n resulted from two simultaneous processes which cannot clearly be distinguished from each other the ammonification which releases ammonium due to the degradation of nitrogenous compounds and the nitrification which consumes ammonium the increase of nh4 n in the beginning of the tests shows that the rate of ammonification was higher than the rate of nitrification after 16 to 22 days ammonification slowed down and nitrification led to the decrease of nh4 n ammonia stripping could not be quantified in the tests but the ph and temperature see section 2 2 suggest that it is of minor importance comparing zw190 zw218 and zw249 higher htc temperatures seem to produce either nitrogenous compounds harder to degrade or more nitrification inhibition substances or both the evolution of nh4 n in zw218 shows the positive effect of biomass pre exposition nh4 n in zw218 increased until day 3 and was not detectable any longer after day 9 for zw218 with non pre exposed biomass the removal of nh4 n lasted beyond day 30 overall the tests show that nitrification can be achieved once microorganisms are adapted to htc process water 3 2 biodegradability in sbrs similar to the zahn wellens test the htc temperature had only a small effect on the doc removal and the suva in sbr190 and sbr217 but a slight dependence on the f mc ratio was observed fig 2 for f mc ratios from 31 to 76 mg c g mlss d the doc removal varied between 70 and 74 and the suva between 2 9 and 3 1 l mg m these f mc ratios were set during phases 2 and 3 with a 1 10 dilution of feed for higher f mc ratios of 185 263 mg c g mlss d which resulted from the undiluted process water in phase 1 doc removal was 68 74 and suva was 2 5 2 7 l mg m the lower suvas for higher f mc ratios imply that despite comparable doc removal fewer non aromatic compounds were removed in phase 1 32 since the cod doc ratio of the feed and the sbr effluent was 2 9 mg o2 mg c during every phase the cod removal can also be calculated from the doc fettig et al 23 reported a cod removal of about 80 at a sludge loading of 0 08 0 2 g o2 g mlss d during the aerobic treatment of htc process water at a similar sludge loading of 0 09 to 0 23 g o2 g mlss d in sbr190 and sbr217 the doc removal was roughly 72 this lower doc removal may be attributed to the use of different feedstock for htc and consequently differences in the process water composition the average doc removal of 72 equals rdoc of 28 3 3 nitrification performance and rdon in sbrs the type and concentration of nitrogen species during the different phases are summarized in fig 3a and b during phase 1 and for both sbrs nitrogen was present as ammonium and don no nitrification was observed in phase 1 probably due to inhibiting compounds but also due to nh3 which inhibits nitrosomonas in the range of 10 150 mg n l 39 the don concentration was 770 830 mg l and 470 830 mg l for sbr190 and sbr217 nh4 n was higher than in feed sbr190 and feed sbr217 suggesting that ammonification took place but was not complete with 69 75 nh4 n and 25 27 don for sbr190 and 75 85 nh4 n and 15 26 for sbr217 the degree of mineralization was almost similar similar mineralization rates have been observed in anaerobic batch tests 26 the observation of limited mineralization was also reported in literature as some melanoidins like pyridines and pyrazines were shown to mineralize to ammonium 40 42 whereas no complete biological removal of coloring melanoidins was reported 43 the don was removed to an almost similar extent despite the proportion of nh4 n in feed sbr217 35 compared to feed sbr190 26 see table 2 being higher this differences are due to the increased decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds into ammonium at higher hydrothermal temperatures 44 still don in feed sbr190 could be degraded to the same extent as feed sbr217 at higher hydrothermal reaction temperatures in addition htc temperature didn t affect the overall biodegradability of don however higher reaction temperatures than in our study 270 c to 345 c were reported to cause a lower biodegradability of don and higher rdon 44 compared to the tn in feed sbr190 4400 mg n l and feed sbr217 4800 mg n l concentrations in both sbrs were noticeable lower around 3000 mg n l and 3350 mg n l respectively this gap in tn of approx 1500 mg l can partly be attributed to biomass growth with the given feed cod and tn and at 20 c the estimated nitrogen for cell growth would be somewhere between 950 and 1 700 mg n l depending on the assumed biomass growth rates 45 in addition stripping of nh3 could explain some of the differences in tn although nh4 dominates at a ph of 7 5 according to the ammonium ammonia equilibrium nh3 was also present for both sbrs nh3 was calculated to be 41 45 mg l 39 ammonia stripping could not be quantified but probably contributed to the nitrogen loss in the zahn wellens tests it could not be clarified whether nitrification or ammonification is the limiting step however the comparison with the sbr test suggests that nitrification was the limiting step and not ammonification in phases 2 and 3 ratio don tn of sbr190 ranged between 23 and 39 69 103 mg n l for sbr217 don was 24 32 87 113 mg n l as the don was very similar for sbr190 and sbr217 at different operation settings the remaining don seems to be non biodegradable coloring substances such as maillard products were not or only slightly removed as the uv475 see table 3 remained constant during biodegradation a decolorization due to the biological removal of melanoidins as summarized by chandra et al 43 could not be observed on average the recalcitrant don tn was 28 for sbr190 and 25 for sbr217 the tn sludge loading significantly decreased due to the dilution of process water to 1 10 in phase 2 and nitrification set in no notable concentrations of ammonium and nitrite were measured in sbr217 indicating a high level of nitrification raob and rn were almost identical with 2 05 mg n g mlss h and 1 98 mg n g mlss h respectively although the tn loading rate was lower than in sbr217 a lower level of nitrification could be achieved in sbr190 both ammonium and nitrite were not completely oxidized and raob and rn were lower at 1 4 and 1 5 mg n g mlss h respectively in phase 3 tn loading was increased to 16 19 mg tn g mlss d which led to partial nitrification in both sbrs shares of nitrogen species were present on a similar scale in sbr190 and sbr217 of 4 13 18 27 and 37 48 for ammonium nitrite and nitrate respectively raob of both sbrs in phase 3 was only slightly higher than in phase 2 consequently nitrification was unlikely to be limited by ammonium shortage but the maximum aob activity seems to have been reached lower rn in phase 3 suggest a greater inhibition of nobs with increasing sludge loading calculated according to anthonisen et al 39 free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna reached 0 15 mg l and 0 18 mg l during phase 2 as well as 0 02 mg l and 0 05 mg l during phase 3 sbr190 for sbr217 fa reached 0 03 mg l and 0 13 mg l and fna 0 01 mg l and 0 06 mg l during phases 2 and 3 respectively accordingly fa and fna should have no significant effect on nitrification even though sbr217 showed a slightly better nitrification performance the inhibition of nitrification could not be further differentiated in sbr tests therefore subsequent inhibition tests were initiated to clarify whether lower nitrogen conversion in sbr190 was due to increased inhibition of nitrification 3 4 nitrification inhibition the inhibition of nitrification by feed sbr190 starts at low don sludge loadings and rapidly increases with raising don sludge loading fig 4a 50 inhibition ic50 was reached at around 28 mg don g mlss for effluent sbr190 the ic50 dropped 10 mg don g mlss this is equivalent to volumetric shares of 2 3 for feed sbr190 and about 5 for effluent sbr190 for feed sbr217 and effluent sbr217 fig 4b inhibition followed a similar trend but was more pronounced the ic50 was at 16 mg don g mlss and at 7 mg don g mlss respectively the volumetric shares were 1 2 for feed sbr217 and 4 for effluent sbr217 indicating that higher htc temperatures lead to the increased formation of nitrification inhibiting substances accordingly low htc temperatures are favorable for lower inhibition of nitrification however even at lower temperatures the process water has a strong inhibitory effect looking at the volumetric shares the inhibitory effect has been halved by the biological treatment but was still strong the specific inhibition in mg don g mlss on the other hand shows a different result the sbr effluents inhibited nitrification more than the htc process waters themselves this indicates that the inhibiting substances were still present after biodegradation and that these refractory compounds were primarily responsible for nitrification inhibition pagga et al 46 reported similar findings as nitrification inhibition caused by poorly degradable compounds was more severe compared to biodegradable ones nitrification inhibition of htc process waters could also not be reduced by ultrafiltration pretreatment as shown by kühni et al 21 in addition the authors recommend a 100 fold dilution of process water before discharging into nitrifying wastewater treatment plans to avoid inhibition in contrast to the aerobic pretreatment in this study the anaerobic pretreatment of brewer s grain htc process water could reduce the inhibition from 90 to 35 at a dilution of 1 50 23 beyond that no further studies dealing with nitrification inhibition of htc process waters are available the obtained results indicate that even biologically pre treated process water is of major concern for wwtps as htc process water not only contains recalcitrant doc and don but also disturbs nitrification as illustrated in fig 4 c and d rn reached 3 8 mg n g mlss h at low don sludge loadings with increasing don sludge loadings nitrification rates declined and dropped to zero at 240 mg don g mlss feed sbr190 and 145 mg don g mlss feed sbr217 standard deviations were quite high for the tests which is due to the use of new inoculum with different nitrification rates for each series of tests however each inoculum was within the required range between 2 and 6 5 mg n g mlss h batch inhibition tests do not directly relate to continuous tests since no long term effects can be deducted still they give an idea of the extent of inhibition even though feed sbr190 was less inhibiting than feed sbr217 the nitrification rate in sbr190 was lower than in sbr217 table 3 a possible explanation for those differences may be amount of nitrifying biomass present in the tests or the degree of adaption 3 5 effect of htc on wwtp effluent rdoc and rdon were used to calculate the effect of htc on the effluent of a full scale wwtp since there were no major differences the refractory concentrations across all phases 1 3 were used concentrations were lower in phases 2 and 3 due to the dilution the results of these calculations indicate that the effluent concentrations of the wwtp could be increased to a considerable extent especially for phase 1 effluent table 4 in particular the increase in effluent doc by up to 8 3 mg l and effluent cod by up to 24 1 mg o2 l may cause serious problems with regard to legal discharge limits for example the discharge limit of the model wastewater treatment plant is 40 mg o2 l which would be difficult to meet if the htc process water was recirculated higher effluent don is of minor importance as the concentrations were lower and dilution would be high enough to avoid inhibition of nitrification in general this approximation is not transferable to other wwtps as boundary conditions such as inflow conditions treatment steps or effluent regulations vary yet the results suggest that an aerobic biological treatment step alone is not sufficient for the treatment of htc process water additional treatment steps such as advanced oxidation processes are necessary similar results were found by toutian et al 47 who calculated an increase in effluent cod for thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion reactions resemble those of htc but the lower temperatures lead to less refractory compounds they found a sharp increase in effluent cod at 170 c of 12 21 mg o2 l compared to lower temperatures which is within the range of our predicted increase in effluent cod elevating the temperature from 170 c to 190 c does not seem to increase refractory compounds significantly 4 conclusions to make htc a proper alternative for the treatment of sewage sludge solutions to deal with the produced htc process water must be developed in summary this study showed that aerobic treatment cannot achieve satisfactory purification of the process water and further post treatment steps are required the following findings were obtained increasing htc temperature had basically no effect on the doc removal but increased the potential inhibition of nitrification doc removal in continuously operated sbrs was around 72 resulting in an effluent rdoc of 28 the effluent rdon tn ratio was 25 28 nitrification was inhibited to a large extent by substances that could not be effectively biodegraded discharging the undiluted pretreated htc process water in a wwtp plant could increase the effluent doc by 8 3 mg l and the effluent cod by 24 1 mg l credit authorship

12630,the treatment of the highly contaminated process water produced during the hydrothermal carbonization htc of waste activated sludge is of major concern for the full scale implementation of the htc process so far no satisfying treatment strategies have been elaborated and the biodegradability under aerobic conditions has hardly been studied to fill these gaps aerobic tests were first carried out in batches with htc process waters produced at 190 c 218 c and 249 c and two parallel sequencing batch reactors sbr were operated to treat process waters produced at 190 c and 217 c both experiments show that the htc temperature has only a little effect on the elimination of dissolved organic carbon doc in the aerobic batch tests doc removal were 80 5 81 9 in the sbr 28 of the initial doc was found to be recalcitrant and 25 28 of the initial nitrogen in the sbr experiments the nitrification was also monitored and nitrification inhibition test were conducted on both process waters obtained at 190 c and 217 c nitrification the initial sbr reactors was only possible after dilution of the process waters which indicates the presence of inhibiting substances the inhibition tests validated those observations and showed that process waters derived at 217 c had a higher inhibition potential this study demonstrates that aerobically treated htc process waters are still too polluted to be discharged in a wastewater treatment plant model calculations showed an increase in effluent doc of 8 3 mg c l graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic biodegradation hydrothermal carbonization nitrification inhibition htc process water recalcitrant compounds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrothermal carbonization htc is an alternative technology for recovering resources from waste materials such as sewage sludge it has gained increasing attention in recent years to produce hydrochars a coal like solid with high carbon density and high dewatering properties during htc temperatures up to 300 c break down the sewage sludge structure by mechanisms like dehydration and decarboxylation 1 2 the higher the reaction temperatures the higher the coalification of the generated hydrochars one formation pathway of hydrochars is the polymerization of dissolved reaction by products 3 however a substantial amount of slowly or non polymerizing organic matter remains dissolved and form a high strength wastewater with high amounts of refractory compounds aragón briceño et al 4 reported total organic carbon toc concentrations up to 29 778 mg c l and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentrations of 8064 mg n l also others studies showed the high loading of htc process waters 5 6 such high concentrations result from various components like volatile fatty acids vfa humic like substances n heterocycle compounds phenols ketones or aldehydes 7 9 readily biodegradable substances such as acetic acid suggest the use of anaerobic digestion for process water treatment and has been studied intensively 8 10 12 weide et al 13 investigated two stage anaerobic digestion to treat process waters from the hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge using a continuous stirred tank reactor and an expanded granular sludge bed reactor with aerobic downstream treatment this removed 55 58 of the chemical oxygen demand cod and the subsequent aerobic digestion led to an overall cod removal of 71 78 in general increasing hydrothermal reaction temperature lead to a drop in biogas yield during anaerobic digestion 14 15 indicating the formation of slow biodegradable or inhibiting substances 16 unlike anaerobic digestion the use of aerobic processes for htc process water treatment has not gained much attention yet nevertheless aerobic treatment could be advantageous regarding the removal of refractory compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah phenols n heterocyclic compounds or melanoidins 17 melanoidins which are the brownish reaction products from the maillard reaction are of particular concern as they are formed during thermal sewage sludge treatment and have antimicrobial properties and limited biodegradability 18 as a result lag phases were prolonged and growth rates were lower 19 however the role of melanoidins and recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen rdon and their evaluation needs further research 20 the few studies focusing on aerobic treatment used different htc feedstock and reported cod removal rates of 58 89 and the inhibition of nitrification inhibition could be reduced by anaerobic pretreatment and dilution 21 23 at high dilution no toxicity of htc process water to heterotrophic biomass of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp was observed and the readily biodegradable compounds could serve as an external carbon supplement 24 25 to the best of our knowledge the aerobic biodegradation and the inhibition of nitrification associated with htc process water from sewage sludge has not been given much attention in international literature and systematic studies on biodegradation and quantification of refractory compounds are lacking however the process water is of major concern for the full scale implementation of the htc process but no satisfying treatment strategies have been elaborated so far discharge into municipal wwtp must be well evaluated considering the loading and the amount of refractory compounds in the process water in order to find solutions for the treatment of htc process water established strategies for the treatment of high strength wastewaters e g for industrial wastewater or landfill leachate must also be considered against this background this study aims to assess the effect of the htc temperature on the aerobic biodegradability of process waters the total biodegradability of doc was determined in batch tests continuous sequencing batch reactors sbr were used to evaluate the recalcitrant doc rdoc and rdon and the nitrification performance subsequent nitrification tests revealed the inhibition potential of process water and aerobically pre treated process water 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of htc process water waste activated sludge was was obtained from a nitrifying municipal wwtp in germany which serves 50 000 people after sampling the sludge was frozen in portions at 20 c to obtain similar feedstock before use the samples were thawed overnight at ambient temperature total solids were 9 1 0 1 and volatile solids 6 8 0 1 n 7 to produce process water hydrothermal runs were performed using an electrically heated and water cooled 0 5 l batch reactor midiclave typ 3e 0 5lt büchi ag switzerland the stirrer was set to 2000 rpm hydrothermal temperatures were set to 189 0 6 c 218 0 1 c and 249 0 3 c for 30 min zw190 zw218 and zw249 and average pressures were 16 0 31 6 and 54 5 bar setting cover low medium and upper temperature range of htc processes after hydrothermal treatment a folded filter whatman 520 b 1 2240 mm ge healthcare uk was used to separate the process water from the coal slurry as suggested in literature for continuous tests technical more relevant htc conditions of 190 1 c and 217 3 c for 60 min feed sbr190 feed sbr217 at average pressures of 16 3 bar and 32 2 bar were chosen 9 26 at each temperature 12 hydrothermal runs were carried out and the process waters were mixed after filtration with folded filters the process waters were stored refrigerated at 4 c these process waters were also used for nitrification inhibition tests table 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of the process waters 2 2 zahn wellens tests zahn wellens tests were performed according to en iso 9888 1999 27 one day before the experiments aerobic inoculum from a nitrifying municipal wwtp in germany was rinsed three times with tap water and sieved 400 μm to remove coarse particulate substances in addition one test zw218 was inoculated with pre exposed biomass from a previous zahn wellens test following the same procedure the inoculum activity was checked using ethylene glycol and also inoculum blanks were set up the test vessels 2 l were filled with inoculum to a total mixed liquid suspended solids concentration mlss of 0 88 g l the process waters were diluted to achieve an initial doc of 350 mg c l the vessels were mixed with magnetic stirrers and aerated with a diaphragm pump via a wash bottle containing deionized water at 22 2 0 4 c to ensure sufficient dissolved oxygen do in the reactors 2 mg o2 l do was measured using a multi 3620 ids and an fdo 925 xylem analytics germany sales gmbh co kg and aeration was regulated if necessary the ph was adjusted several times a day to 6 7 7 8 using h2so4 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m before each sampling water losses due to evaporation were measured gravimetrically and replaced with deionized water all tests with process waters were carried out in triplicates with blanks in duplicates and with references in singles the doc removal of the reference compound was almost 100 after 15 days of incubation which proves a sufficient activity of the inoculum to calculate the doc removal rate the initial doc in the suspensions was used this differs from en iso 9888 1999 which recommends using the doc 2 5 to 3 5 h after starting the experiments to account for adsorption processes at the beginning during the first 3 h the doc removal was already 15 26 indicating as expected a high concentration of readily biodegradable substances such high organics removal was considered unlikely for adsorption only and was therefore attributed to biological degradation 2 3 sbr setup two continuous activated sludge reactors sbr190 and sbr217 were operated in parallel each vessel had a reaction volume of 300 ml and was aerated and mixed in the same way as the zahn wellens tests the sbrs were inoculated with nitrifying biomass from a lab scale reactor which was fed with htc process water temperature conductivity redox potential and ph were measured continuously using condumax cls21d and memosens cps16d sensors endress hauser conducta gmbh co kg germany a ph controlled peristaltic pump ismatec ismb833c cole parmer gmbh germany dispensed h2so4 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m to ensure a ph between 6 8 and 7 5 the temperature was 19 7 20 5 c the do was controlled manually several times a day to assure sufficient do in the reactors 2 mg o2 l the sbrs had one cycle per day i the reactor was filled manually with a volumetric pipette with 30 ml or 60 ml which depended on the operation phase see table 2 ii aeration and mixing started for 23 h iii settling for 30 min and iv effluent was removed manually with a volumetric pipette again losses due to evaporation were recorded gravimetrically and replaced with deionized water before step iv the effluent was analyzed 2 3 times a week and the influent once every two weeks samples for mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were taken from the fully mixed suspension once a week beyond that no additional sludge was removed from the systems and the sludge retention time srt should be sufficiently high for nitrification due to strong foaming 10 μl silicon free defoaming agent based on fatty alcohols was added daily ecso 8361 envirochemie gmbh germany the test reactors were operated in 3 phases with different process water

was taken from the same wwtp and prepared the same way as described in section 2 2 mixing aeration and temperature were also similar the do was checked regularly and ensured to be above 3 mg l and the ph was checked at the beginning and the end of the tests all tests ran for 3 5 h starting with the addition of inoculum mlss was adjusted to 2 3 3 3 g l and the initial nh4 n concentration was 50 mg n l to avoid ammonia inhibition nh4 2so4 was added to set the different shares of process water to 50 mg n l in each batch however the high nh4 n concentrations in the process waters only allowed a process water share of 4 therefore a second series was conducted with an initial nh4 n concentration of 250 mg n l allowing a share of up to 22 in addition to feed sbr190 and feed sbr217 the treated effluents of the sbrs during phase 1 were tested on nitrification inhibition again the tests needed to be performed with a defoaming agent as described in section 2 3 after each test the samples were filtered 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c before being analyzed for oxidized nitrogen nitrite and nitrate the inhibition rates in in and maximum nitrification rate rn in mg n g mlss h were calculated

color of samples which is mostly caused by melanoidins was evaluated by measuring specific uv absorbance at 475 nm as proposed by arimi et al 29 2 6 assessing the effect of htc on the effluent of a wwtp for this estimation sbr treatment of the htc process water was considered as a pretreatment step before discharge into an exemplary full scale wwtp from this wwtp we obtained the was for htc experiments the inflow qwwtp was 5400 m3 d and the was flow qwas was 11 1 m3 d with 9 2 total solids on average in 2020 and 2021 doc and don after sbr treatment were expected to be refractory for biodegradation in the wwtp and therefore increase the effluent concentrations of the wwtp assuming constant mass during htc and 65 total solids after dewatering the htc coal slurry 30 the mass balance

suva for zw218 and zw218 with pre exposed inoculum are depicted in fig 1a both batches show that the htc process waters contain a large fraction of readily biodegradable organics which resulted in a doc removal of 67 1 1 5 and 74 9 0 7 within 3 days of incubation between days 3 and 10 the doc removal was lower which indicates the presence of a slowly biodegradable fraction from day 10 on doc was only marginally reduced implying that biodegradable doc had been almost completely removed pre exposed inoculum in zw218 showed a slightly faster and further reduction of doc this indicates that adaption of aerobic microorganisms enables a faster removal of readily biodegradable compounds and additional removal of some of the slowly biodegradable compounds on day 28 the regular test duration to identify non biodegradable compounds according to en iso 9888 1999 doc was removed by 78 5 0 3 and 81 9 0 2 for zw218 and zw218 respectively extending the test period to 50 days had no significant effect on doc removal the suva increased from 1 4 l mg m to 3 2 and 3 3 l mg m for zw218 and zw218 on day 28 it followed the overall trend of doc removal by already reaching values above 3 l mg m after 8 days and by showing only a minor raise in the further course of tests increasing suvas indicate the removal of compounds that do not absorb uv light and the enrichment of hydrophobic humic like compounds 31 which are not available for biological treatment this could be caused by heterocyclic and aromatic structure of melanoidins which show a high uv quenching and therefore a high suva 32 accordingly the suva curve shows that a majority of readily biodegradable substances were degraded in the first days gupta et al 33 obtained similar results by investigating the removal of organic matter from return liquors from dewatering thermal hydrolysis digestate after 28 days of aerated incubation they observed a humic substances uv254 removal of 15 20 and a doc removal of 35 40 with this an increase in suva from 1 5 to 2 1 l mg m can be calculated all batches using non pre exposed biomass zw190 zw218 zw249 lead to very similar maximum doc removal fig 1c so the increasing htc reaction temperatures had only little impact on aerobic biodegradation this is quite surprising as lower biodegradability with increasing htc temperature was shown for anaerobic digestion of htc process waters 34 aerobic microorganisms are able to degrade the compounds that can form at elevated htc temperature to the same extent for example yeom et al 35 and pradeep et al 36 showed the adaption of biomass and biodegradation of phenols which are present in htc process water 9 also pahs were shown to be aerobically degraded 37 the degradation of n containing compounds was also shown in the evolution of ammonium fig 1b which was similar for all tests with non pre exposed biomass the increase in ammonium concentration with increasing htc temperature results from deamination which is the breakdown of dissolved nitrogen into lower molecular products releasing nh4 n 38 the evolution of nh4 n resulted from two simultaneous processes which cannot clearly be distinguished from each other the ammonification which releases ammonium due to the degradation of nitrogenous compounds and the nitrification which consumes ammonium the increase of nh4 n in the beginning of the tests shows that the rate of ammonification was higher than the rate of nitrification after 16 to 22 days ammonification slowed down and nitrification led to the decrease of nh4 n ammonia stripping could not be quantified in the tests but the ph and temperature see section 2 2 suggest that it is of minor importance comparing zw190 zw218 and zw249 higher htc temperatures seem to produce either nitrogenous compounds harder to degrade or more nitrification inhibition substances or both the evolution of nh4 n in zw218 shows the positive effect of biomass pre exposition nh4 n in zw218 increased until day 3 and was not detectable any longer after day 9 for zw218 with non pre exposed biomass the removal of nh4 n lasted beyond day 30 overall the tests show that nitrification can be achieved once microorganisms are adapted to htc process water 3 2 biodegradability in sbrs similar to the zahn wellens test the htc temperature had only a small effect on the doc removal and the suva in sbr190 and sbr217 but a slight dependence on the f mc ratio was observed fig 2 for f mc ratios from 31 to 76 mg c g mlss d the doc removal varied between 70 and 74 and the suva between 2 9 and 3 1 l mg m these f mc ratios were set during phases 2 and 3 with a 1 10 dilution of feed for higher f mc ratios of 185 263 mg c g mlss d which resulted from the undiluted process water in phase 1 doc removal was 68 74 and suva was 2 5 2 7 l mg m the lower suvas for higher f mc ratios imply that despite comparable doc removal fewer non aromatic compounds were removed in phase 1 32 since the cod doc ratio of the feed and the sbr effluent was 2 9 mg o2 mg c during every phase the cod removal can also be calculated from the doc fettig et al 23 reported a cod removal of about 80 at a sludge loading of 0 08 0 2 g o2 g mlss d during the aerobic treatment of htc process water at a similar sludge loading of 0 09 to 0 23 g o2 g mlss d in sbr190 and sbr217 the doc removal was roughly 72 this lower doc removal may be attributed to the use of different feedstock for htc and consequently differences in the process water composition the average doc removal of 72 equals rdoc of 28 3 3 nitrification performance and rdon in sbrs the type and concentration of nitrogen species during the different phases are summarized in fig 3a and b during phase 1 and for both sbrs nitrogen was present as ammonium and don no nitrification was observed in phase 1 probably due to inhibiting compounds but also due to nh3 which inhibits nitrosomonas in the range of 10 150 mg n l 39 the don concentration was 770 830 mg l and 470 830 mg l for sbr190 and sbr217 nh4 n was higher than in feed sbr190 and feed sbr217 suggesting that ammonification took place but was not complete with 69 75 nh4 n and 25 27 don for sbr190 and 75 85 nh4 n and 15 26 for sbr217 the degree of mineralization was almost similar similar mineralization rates have been observed in anaerobic batch tests 26 the observation of limited mineralization was also reported in literature as some melanoidins like pyridines and pyrazines were shown to mineralize to ammonium 40 42 whereas no complete biological removal of coloring melanoidins was reported 43 the don was removed to an almost similar extent despite the proportion of nh4 n in feed sbr217 35 compared to feed sbr190 26 see table 2 being higher this differences are due to the increased decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds into ammonium at higher hydrothermal temperatures 44 still don in feed sbr190 could be degraded to the same extent as feed sbr217 at higher hydrothermal reaction temperatures in addition htc temperature didn t affect the overall biodegradability of don however higher reaction temperatures than in our study 270 c to 345 c were reported to cause a lower biodegradability of don and higher rdon 44 compared to the tn in feed sbr190 4400 mg n l and feed sbr217 4800 mg n l concentrations in both sbrs were noticeable lower around 3000 mg n l and 3350 mg n l respectively this gap in tn of approx 1500 mg l can partly be attributed to biomass growth with the given feed cod and tn and at 20 c the estimated nitrogen for cell growth would be somewhere between 950 and 1 700 mg n l depending on the assumed biomass growth rates 45 in addition stripping of nh3 could explain some of the differences in tn although nh4 dominates at a ph of 7 5 according to the ammonium ammonia equilibrium nh3 was also present for both sbrs nh3 was calculated to be 41 45 mg l 39 ammonia stripping could not be quantified but probably contributed to the nitrogen loss in the zahn wellens tests it could not be clarified whether nitrification or ammonification is the limiting step however the comparison with the sbr test suggests that nitrification was the limiting step and not ammonification in phases 2 and 3 ratio don tn of sbr190 ranged between 23 and 39 69 103 mg n l for sbr217 don was 24 32 87 113 mg n l as the don was very similar for sbr190 and sbr217 at different operation settings the remaining don seems to be non biodegradable coloring substances such as maillard products were not or only slightly removed as the uv475 see table 3 remained constant during biodegradation a decolorization due to the biological removal of melanoidins as summarized by chandra et al 43 could not be observed on average the recalcitrant don tn was 28 for sbr190 and 25 for sbr217 the tn sludge loading significantly decreased due to the dilution of process water to 1 10 in phase 2 and nitrification set in no notable concentrations of ammonium and nitrite were measured in sbr217 indicating a high level of nitrification raob and rn were almost identical with 2 05 mg n g mlss h and 1 98 mg n g mlss h respectively although the tn loading rate was lower than in sbr217 a lower level of nitrification could be achieved in sbr190 both ammonium and nitrite were not completely oxidized and raob and rn were lower at 1 4 and 1 5 mg n g mlss h respectively in phase 3 tn loading was increased to 16 19 mg tn g mlss d which led to partial nitrification in both sbrs shares of nitrogen species were present on a similar scale in sbr190 and sbr217 of 4 13 18 27 and 37 48 for ammonium nitrite and nitrate respectively raob of both sbrs in phase 3 was only slightly higher than in phase 2 consequently nitrification was unlikely to be limited by ammonium shortage but the maximum aob activity seems to have been reached lower rn in phase 3 suggest a greater inhibition of nobs with increasing sludge loading calculated according to anthonisen et al 39 free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna reached 0 15 mg l and 0 18 mg l during phase 2 as well as 0 02 mg l and 0 05 mg l during phase 3 sbr190 for sbr217 fa reached 0 03 mg l and 0 13 mg l and fna 0 01 mg l and 0 06 mg l during phases 2 and 3 respectively accordingly fa and fna should have no significant effect on nitrification even though sbr217 showed a slightly better nitrification performance the inhibition of nitrification could not be further differentiated in sbr tests therefore subsequent inhibition tests were initiated to clarify whether lower nitrogen conversion in sbr190 was due to increased inhibition of nitrification 3 4 nitrification inhibition the inhibition of nitrification by feed sbr190 starts at low don sludge loadings and rapidly increases with raising don sludge loading fig 4a 50 inhibition ic50 was reached at around 28 mg don g mlss for effluent sbr190 the ic50 dropped 10 mg don g mlss this is equivalent to volumetric shares of 2 3 for feed sbr190 and about 5 for effluent sbr190 for feed sbr217 and effluent sbr217 fig 4b inhibition followed a similar trend but was more pronounced the ic50 was at 16 mg don g mlss and at 7 mg don g mlss respectively the volumetric shares were 1 2 for feed sbr217 and 4 for effluent sbr217 indicating that higher htc temperatures lead to the increased formation of nitrification inhibiting substances accordingly low htc temperatures are favorable for lower inhibition of nitrification however even at lower temperatures the process water has a strong inhibitory effect looking at the volumetric shares the inhibitory effect has been halved by the biological treatment but was still strong the specific inhibition in mg don g mlss on the other hand shows a different result the sbr effluents inhibited nitrification more than the htc process waters themselves this indicates that the inhibiting substances were still present after biodegradation and that these refractory compounds were primarily responsible for nitrification inhibition pagga et al 46 reported similar findings as nitrification inhibition caused by poorly degradable compounds was more severe compared to biodegradable ones nitrification inhibition of htc process waters could also not be reduced by ultrafiltration pretreatment as shown by kühni et al 21 in addition the authors recommend a 100 fold dilution of process water before discharging into nitrifying wastewater treatment plans to avoid inhibition in contrast to the aerobic pretreatment in this study the anaerobic pretreatment of brewer s grain htc process water could reduce the inhibition from 90 to 35 at a dilution of 1 50 23 beyond that no further studies dealing with nitrification inhibition of htc process waters are available the obtained results indicate that even biologically pre treated process water is of major concern for wwtps as htc process water not only contains recalcitrant doc and don but also disturbs nitrification as illustrated in fig 4 c and d rn reached 3 8 mg n g mlss h at low don sludge loadings with increasing don sludge loadings nitrification rates declined and dropped to zero at 240 mg don g mlss feed sbr190 and 145 mg don g mlss feed sbr217 standard deviations were quite high for the tests which is due to the use of new inoculum with different nitrification rates for each series of tests however each inoculum was within the required range between 2 and 6 5 mg n g mlss h batch inhibition tests do not directly relate to continuous tests since no long term effects can be deducted still they give an idea of the extent of inhibition even though feed sbr190 was less inhibiting than feed sbr217 the nitrification rate in sbr190 was lower than in sbr217 table 3 a possible explanation for those differences may be amount of nitrifying biomass present in the tests or the degree of adaption 3 5 effect of htc on wwtp effluent rdoc and rdon were used to calculate the effect of htc on the effluent of a full scale wwtp since there were no major differences the refractory concentrations across all phases 1 3 were used concentrations were lower in phases 2 and 3 due to the dilution the results of these calculations indicate that the effluent concentrations of the wwtp could be increased to a considerable extent especially for phase 1 effluent table 4 in particular the increase in effluent doc by up to 8 3 mg l and effluent cod by up to 24 1 mg o2 l may cause serious problems with regard to legal discharge limits for example the discharge limit of the model wastewater treatment plant is 40 mg o2 l which would be difficult to meet if the htc process water was recirculated higher effluent don is of minor importance as the concentrations were lower and dilution would be high enough to avoid inhibition of nitrification in general this approximation is not transferable to other wwtps as boundary conditions such as inflow conditions treatment steps or effluent regulations vary yet the results suggest that an aerobic biological treatment step alone is not sufficient for the treatment of htc process water additional treatment steps such as advanced oxidation processes are necessary similar results were found by toutian et al 47 who calculated an increase in effluent cod for thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion reactions resemble those of htc but the lower temperatures lead to less refractory compounds they found a sharp increase in effluent cod at 170 c of 12 21 mg o2 l compared to lower temperatures which is within the range of our predicted increase in effluent cod elevating the temperature from 170 c to 190 c does not seem to increase refractory compounds significantly 4 conclusions to make htc a proper alternative for the treatment of sewage sludge solutions to deal with the produced htc process water must be developed in summary this study showed that aerobic treatment cannot achieve satisfactory purification of the process water and further post treatment steps are required the following findings were obtained increasing htc temperature had basically no effect on the doc removal but increased the potential inhibition of nitrification doc removal in continuously operated sbrs was around 72 resulting in an effluent rdoc of 28 the effluent rdon tn ratio was 25 28 nitrification was inhibited to a large extent by substances that could not be effectively biodegraded discharging the undiluted pretreated htc process water in a wwtp plant could increase the effluent doc by 8 3 mg l and the effluent cod by 24 1 mg l credit authorship

in this industry an important fraction 5 50 of dyes cannot be integrated into the fabric and is washed and discharged directly into sewer systems 9 11 in addition the textile industry is the largest consumer of dyestuff at approximately 10 000 tons per year producing large amounts of colored wastewater 12 the effluents of this industry contain strong acids and bases organic and inorganic chlorinated compounds dyes bleaches thickening agents surfactants dispersants salts starches enzymes fats waxes sodium hydroxide and chloride silicates sulfates carbonates heavy metals reducing and oxidizing agents biocides resins etc 13 15 these pollutants can block air and sunlight from penetrating water decreasing oxygen inside water bodies and is unfavorable to aquatic flora and fauna inhibiting important activities such as the growth of bacteria responsible for biological degradation or the photosynthesis of algae 9 16 heavy metals and organic pollutants found in textile effluents can cause sub chronic damage liver kidney and lungs dna damage inducing mutagenicity and genotoxicity and carcinogenic effects in human and animals 17 to reduce colored effluents discharged into watercourses different governments have established the permissible limits for the final discharge table 1 lists the permissible limits for wastewater discharge from the textile industry in different countries different physical chemical and biological treatments and combinations of these have been tested for the treatment of textile wastewater however owing to the advantages and disadvantages of each method few have been accepted for full scale applications several alternatives have exhibited high removal of color cod turbidity and dissolved solids and promising results for further investigation such as biological 18 19 filtration 20 adsorption 21 advanced oxidation processes 22 ion exchange 23 ultraviolet 24 ozonation 25 photocatalysis 26 27 coagulation 28 and electrocoagulation ec 29 methods the processes of coagulation and flocculation cf have been extensively used in water and wastewater treatment by applying a wide range of chemicals mainly because they effectively reduce impurities in water such as cod turbidity color suspended solids heavy metals oils and organic matter the goal of this process is to allow chemical reagents to gather clump and become large flocculants with dissolved pollutants and the precipitation of some ions sulfates phosphates and carbonates some of the most common coagulants in cf include hydrolyzing metallic salts such as aluminum sulfate ferric chloride and ferric sulfate 30 over the last two decades the interest in analogous cf electrochemical methods has increased mainly because of the proven efficiencies for the treatment of dyes and other organic contaminants found in textile wastewater among the different electrochemical methods ec is one of the most promising techniques and its main advantages are low sludge generation minimal use of chemical reagents and simplicity of application and control in addition it is considered an eco friendly technology mainly because electrons are used as clean reagents 31 32 ec is an electrochemical method that consists of the in situ generation of coagulating agents by dissolving a sacrificial metallic anode eq 1 typically iron or aluminum and the formation of hydrogen and hydroxide ions at the cathode owing to the cathodic decomposition of water eq 2 33 1 m 0 m n n e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h for ec treatment the electrical conductivity of the wastewater μs cm should be sufficiently high and the presence of salts allows the mobility of electrons in the aqueous solution however when this value is low the addition of salts is required to enhance the electrical conductivity 34 various support electrolytes have been reported for ec treatment typically nacl na2so4 kcl and h2so4 35 36 in this context the main purpose of this study was to determine the synergistic effect of the electrocoagulation precipitation treatment ec cp on real textile wastewater obtained from the denim industry hydraulic retention time hrt current density and the addition of a bifunctional support electrolyte were evaluated in terms of color cod and turbidity removal and complexation of nitrogen and phosphate species the main research gap was the study of the bifunctionality of an electrolyte which consisted on a enhancement of the electric conductivity of the textile wastewater and b precipitation of the pollutants the energy consumption treatment time and reagent concentration decreased consequently the cost of the process decreased this is an affordable option for textile wastewater treatment for large scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and characterization textile wastewater 30l was obtained by grab sampling from a denim washing factory in mexico the compound sample was composed of 3 simple samples from different parts of the facility production inner sewage and outer municipal sewage pipes the samples were taken in 2 different seasonal periods according to the major factory production the sample was cooled at 2 c for preservation and physicochemical characterization a 150 ml textile wastewater sample was digested in a microwave for inductively coupled plasma icp analysis the raw and treated wastewater

dissolved solids hardness total nitrogen nitrates phosphates methylene blue active substances mbas chlorides and sulfates 2 2 chemical precipitation cp treatment cp treatment was performed in the jar test under the following operating conditions first a rapid mixing speed of 250 rpm rpm was applied for 15 min followed by a low mixing speed of 50 rpm for 10 min with a settling time of 20 min subsequently the liquid and solid phases were separated and the supernatant was characterized by cod color and turbidity the operating variables were the type and dose of the precipitating agents for this study cacl2 mgso4 and mgcl2 were chosen because of their applications reported in the literature 38 41 the different dosages tested were 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 g l resulting in 18 experiments the experimental design and data analysis were performed using minitab 20 3 software 2 3 electrocoagulation treatment for ec tests were conducted in batch mode on a cylindrical reactor designed with a diameter of 5 cm a length of 21 cm and a thickness of 4 mm thus the useful capacity was 0 43 l magnesium and iron were used as the anode and cathode respectively mg had a 98 01 purity supplementary material 1 the electrodes had a length of 20 cm a diameter of 1 8 cm and an anodic area of 118 19 cm2 with current densities of 42 31 a m2 0 5 a and 126 92 a m2 1 5 a before the treatment the electrodes were polished using sandpaper separated by 0 5 cm of interelectrode distance and connected to a digital dc power supply in galvanostatic mode the applied current densities table 2 provided voltages in the range of 7 6 21 8 v and no external mixing was required as the process itself provided sufficient turbulence to mix the solution the initial ph 4 5 was not modified but was monitored during the process and the area volume ratio a v was 38 9 m2 m3 both the a v and current density values were in accordance with other reported values 32 33 42 46 a central experimental design 22 star points was used for ec treatment it consisted of 12 experiments with six degrees of freedom a quadratic model was fitted using the statgraphics centurion xvi software supplementary material 2 the response variables were cod turbidity and color removal 2 4 continuous synergistic electrocoagulation precipitation system a continuous treatment with a two chamber reactor was performed for the synergistic ec cp process fig 1 it consisted of an inner reactor for ec and an outer reactor with a diameter of 9 5 cm length of 30 cm and thickness of 2 mm the useful capacity was 1 99 l the working ph was 4 5 textile sample ph and the electrodes were placed in parallel with 0 5 cm of interelectrode separation the values for each experimental factor were set at high and low values table 3 the experimental design was performed using statgraphics centurion xvi software to analyze the effect of different factors hrt current intensity and concentration of supporting electrolyte table 3 the response variables were removal cod color and turbidity a box behnken design was selected for the synergistic process resulting in 15 experiments with five degrees of freedom after the optimal operating conditions were determined hrt current density and supporting electrolyte maximum ascent tests were performed to validate the model obtained and the conditions of maximum removal efficiency were determined using the statgraphics centurion xvi software 2 5 sludge characterization the sludges from raw wastewater and after cp ec and ec cp treatments were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd a siemens d5000 diffractometer coupled with a copper anode x ray tube was used the analysis by scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with an electron x ray dispersive spectroscopy eds was realized by using a jeol jsm 6610lv microscope to determine crystallinity morphology and the elemental composition infrared spectroscopy ir was applied to determine the functional groups 2 6 kinetic reactions the kinetics for ec and coupled treatment were performed under optimal conditions aliquots were taken every 5 min and cod color and turbidity were analyzed the kinetics were fitted to the first eq 3 second eq 4 and the bmg eq 5 models using the statistica software 3 a a 0 e kt 4 a a 0 1 k a 0 t 5 c 1 t m bt c 0 where a0 or c0 initial concentration a or c final concentration t time k rate constant m and b bmg constants 2 7 species distribution diagrams species distribution diagrams were made using the medusa software 47 and the concentrations of the cations and anions were used to calculate the ionic strength the formed solid species were identified by xrd and quantified by sem chemical reaction mechanisms in solution were proposed for cp and ec 48 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial wastewater characterization table 4 shows the physicochemical characterization of the textile wastewater samples the electrical conductivity was 1 93 ms cm and the ph was acidic 4 5 however the permissible limit is 6 9 according to the epa ph values are directly related to the concentrations of contaminants in the water 49 the corresponding acidity was 386 1 mg l caco3 and low alkalinity 199 mg l likely associated with dissolved co2 with a hardness of 240 14 mg l caco3 the organic matter was quantified with 74 16 mg l bod5 and 1039 5 mg l cod therefore the biodegradability index bod5 cod is 0 071 according to metcalf and eddy biodegradability index values 0 5 indicate poor biodegradability 50 52 suggesting that the effluent cannot be treated by a conventional biological treatment 7 the permissible limits are 13 4 and 53 5 mg l for bod5 and cod respectively according to the epa the color of the textile wastewater was 683 u ptco and the epa permissible limit is 240 u ptco textiles typically contain several types of chemicals such as pigments surfactants dyes wax and bleach the total dissolved solids tdss total suspended solids tsss and settling solids were 1146 110 and 15 mg l respectively according to the epa the permissible limit for tsss is 36 mg l however the main proportion of pollutants is dissolved organic and inorganic compounds which can explain the turbidity 192 25 ntu nitrogenous matter was represented by high values of total nitrogen 13 mg l nitrites 12 54 mg l and nitrates 93 33 mg l phosphorus was present at 0 86 mg l and the discharge of a significant amount of nitrogen or phosphorus into water bodies can cause eutrophication problems and health effects such as cyanosis and blue child sickness 53 the sample exhibited 52 72 mg l for fats and oils which can reduce the penetration of air and sunlight into the water bodies the anions as chlorides 189 16 mg l fluorides 0 48 mg l and sulfates 403 38 mg l may incorporate salinity in the wastewater 3 2 precipitation treatment 3 2 1 effect of dosage during the cf treatment of textile wastewater the quantity of coagulant is a vital factor for determining the optimal dose to destabilize colloidal particles applying an underdose may prove insufficient to encourage colloidal particle assembly and an overdose reduces treatment efficiencies by increasing organic load turbidity slurry volume and treatment costs 30 to determine the optimal dose in this study three different coagulants were added to the jar test mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 at different initial concentrations 1 6 g l fig 2 an anova analysis was performed to determine the significative differences between coagulants which indicated that the optimal dose of mgcl2 was 5 g l and the removal efficiencies were 27 cod 76 color and 77 turbidity at ph 5 9 cacl2 4 g l removed 28 cod 75 color and 81 turbidity at ph 7 2 however when cacl2 increased 5 g l the removal efficiency of cod decreased a concentration of 5 g l mgso4 exhibited a removal of 8 cod 77 color and 84 turbidity which could be related to the decrease in ph 3 5 these results agree with 54 who reported different doses of natural coagulants for different pollutants from water and wastewater 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph is an important parameter in the coagulation flocculation process working in an adequate ph range and according to the physicochemical wastewater characteristics is vital to improve the removal efficiencies the ph influences the flocculants morphology size and strength affecting the liquid and solid separation 30 55 have reported that the optimal ph range is 5 0 6 5 for aluminum coagulants and 4 5 6 for ferric coagulants the initial ph of the study was 4 5 and changed to 6 7 7 3 and 3 5 after treatments with mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 the best removal efficiencies were obtained employing cacl2 that is 77 cod 76 color and 77 turbidity the lowest removal efficiencies were obtained with mgso4 because the ph decreased to 3 5 in addition bakshi and mokadam 56 reported an increment in color removal efficiencies up to 99 when the ph was increased from 4 0 to 11 0 and 4 0 to 12 0 using feso4 and mgcl2 respectively however the final ph was so alkaline that it limited discharge possibilities according to international laws ph 9 is the permissible limit epa according to speciation diagrams supplementary material 3 the removal efficiencies of phosphates sulfates and carbonates are determined by precipitation reactions occurring with mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 eqs 6 10 mgcl2 final ph 5 9 6 mg 2 hpo 4 2 mghpo 4 s cacl2 final ph 7 2 7 ca 2 co 3 2 caco 3 s 8 mg 2 so 4 2 mgso 4 s 9 ca 2 so 4 2 caso 4 s 10 5 ca 2 3 po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh s mgso4 final ph 3 5 eqs 8 9 are carried out 3 2 3 effect of mixing speed and time the coagulation flocculation process is carried out in 3 steps first a coagulant is added and rapidly mixed 75 700 rpm for 0 5 3 min in the second step a slower mixing 30 150 rpm for 5 30 min stimulates the production of flocculants 57 and third a sedimentation time is required to allow the separation of pollutants in this study the conditions were as follows rapid mixing at 250 rpm for 15 min and slow mixing at 50 rpm for 10 min followed by 30 min of sedimentation the particles are collided and form aggregates which can be significantly aided by agitation either in stirred tanks or in flow through devices rapid mixing is vital in the event of charge neutralization because insufficient mixing can lead to local overdose and re stabilization of certain particles 57 58 studied the removal of methylene blue by coagulation flocculation with biomaterials bentonite and opuntia ficus indica the mass of the coagulant bentonite was 0 9 g the mass of the flocculant opuntia ficus indica was 0 4 g the speed and stirring time of the coagulation step were 180 rpm and 4 min respectively the stirring speed and time of the flocculation step were 40 rpm and 15 min respectively with a settling time of 15 min 3 3 electrocoagulation performance the main operational parameters that influence the electrocoagulation process are the interelectrode distance solution ph type of electrodes current density and electrode configuration consequently these operational parameters must be optimized in each electrocoagulation study the main operational parameters investigated in this study are discussed below 3 3 1 effect of electrode material in the ec process the coagulant is produced by the dissolution of a sacrificial anode in the aqueous medium generating hydrometal species that effectively destabilizes the suspended emulsified or dissolved particles in aqueous medium through an electrical current applied fe 45 59 and al 60 are the most commonly used however cu 61 zn 62 and mg 33 have also been reported for ec performance 63 in this study ec treatment using a mg anode and fe cathode had positive results with up to 92 99 cod 88 58 color and 92 72 turbidity removal efficiencies and a settling time of 15 min after treatment it should be noted that when the settling time of the treated effluent was 1 h removal efficiencies of color and turbidity increased to 99 71 and 98 96 respectively the results obtained by using mg anodes were similar to those reported by other authors 33 they obtained 67 7 97 5 and 96 3 removal efficiencies of cod color and turbidity respectively donneys victoria et al 64 reported chloride and dissolved organic carbon removal rates of 69 1 and 90 4 respectively using mg oh 2 in contrast 65 treated indigo dye from textile wastewater al electrodes were used in a batch ec process 86 98 was the maximum dye removal percentage at optimum conditions of the current intensity 0 50 a initial concentration of dye 12 31 mg l and nacl concentration 2 67 mg l at ph 8 inter electrodes distance of 7 mm electrolysis time of 25 min and nacl concentration of 2 67 mg l depending on the material used as the sacrificial electrode in the ec process the treatment can be less expensive and more convenient the aluminum hydroxide flocculant is larger and has a lower density than iron hydroxide however it is difficult to avoid passivation of the aluminum anode during ec copper is another electrode material used in the removal of different pollutants in ec some works reported that cu material provides a higher removal efficiency than al electrodes cu exhibits uniform corrosion at the surface after the ec treatment besides several authors have suggested the use of miscellaneous materials as mg and zn the mechanism is like that reported for al fe and cu electrodes that consists of the anodic dissolution of mg or zn followed a coagulation and precipitation of pollutants depending on the solution ph the produced ions mg2 and zn2 allow the formation of the corresponding hydroxides mg oh 2 and zn oh 2 66 in this study the initial ph was 4 5 which increased to ph 10 fig 3 therefore a constant formation of mg oh 2 flocculants was observed particularly as gray flake shaped flocculants which led to the regular formation of sludge and floating flocculants owing to the high concentration of magnesium hydroxides even after the settling time the separation of dissolved pollutants continued which led to improved removal efficiencies 95 for color and turbidity after 1 h of settling time nevertheless the evaluation of other coagulants produced by ec is centered on residual metal concentrations in the treated water for example al concentration of 0 2 mg l is the permissible limit in wastewater whereas the limit for mg is set at 30 mg l to avoid any health related issues according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa according to the epa for textile industries the limits for cu and zn are 0 14 mg l 3 3 2 effect of ph in ec ph affects the chemistry of the coagulant pollutants and electrochemical processes in the solution 79 which is also associated with the electrodes used in this study the textile sample had a ph of 4 5 and after treatment under optimal conditions the ph increased to 10 7 fig 3 however after only 3 min of treatment ph values 9 were observed ph affects the speciation of mg and has a significant influence on the removal mechanism the ec mechanism is carried out by different steps 1 metal cations are formed in the sacrificial anode due to the current applied 2 hydroxyl ions are produced in the cathode by reducing of water 3 the reaction between metal cations with hydroxyl ions produces metallic hydroxides 4 the reaction of metal hydroxides and pollutants promotes the charge neutralization of contaminants 5 adsorption of pollutants with neutralized charge on metal hydroxides occurs and 6 h2 gas is formed at the cathode lifting the generated flocculants to the solution surface flotation fig 4 67 eqs 11 13 show the electrochemical and solution reactions performed during ec which involve the oxidation of mg to mg2 the h2o reduction to h2 and oh ions was performed on the cathode the solution reactions revealed the formation of metallic hydroxides anodic reaction 11 mg mg 2 2 e cathodic reaction 12 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 oh solution reaction 13 mg 2 2 h 2 o mg oh 2 s 2 h according to the speciation diagrams different species can be observed in the ec process at ph 10 4 using the mg anode eqs 14 16 14 mg 2 co 3 2 mgco 3 s 15 mg 2 2 oh mg oh 2 s 16 mg 2 ca 2 co 3 2 camg co 3 2 s a similar work studied the ph effect on the wastewater treatment from dyeing process of a textile industry ph 6 0 7 1 9 0 and 12 0 were tested the best results were obtained at ph 7 1 86 color 82 turbidity and 59 cod were achieved 68 3 3 3 effect of treatment time and kinetics according to the statistical analysis treatment time had the most significant influence on the experimental factors p 0 0001 kinetic analyses for cod color and turbidity fig 5a c were performed using statistica software they were fitted to a second order kinetic model under the optimal operating conditions current density 144 44 a m2 time 28 9 min no significant removal was observed after 15 min of treatment time table 5 lists the kinetic constants for the first second and bmg models the experimental data were best fitted to the second and bmg models r2 0 99 the kinetic constants for the second order model were cod 5 10 4 l mg min color 1 2 10 3 1 u ptco min and turbidity 1 1 10 2 1 ntu min similarly carmona carmona et al 33 reported that cod and color were fitted to a second order model kinetics constants of 1 22 10 1 l mg min and 2 51 10 3 1 u ptco min respectively whereas turbidity was fitted to a first order model 0 039 min 1 additionally bener et al 42 reported that for total organic carbon in textile wastewater the first and second order kinetic models were fitted however the second order kinetic model was more suitable and the kinetic constants ranged from 3 78 10 6 to 1 15 10 5 l mg min depending on the current density applied although the data were fitted to the bmg model with a high r2 0 99 the m constant exhibited negative values for color and turbidity which could be associated with rapid coagulation in treatment time 5 min 3 3 4 effect of current and time the variables that influence the ec efficiency are shown in fig 6 the current density is considered a substantial parameter in electrocoagulation behavior in the ec process the electron released is controlled by the current density promoting the metal ion dissociation from the electrodes depending on physicochemical characteristics of wastewater the applied current density is adjusted this variation is mainly due to the changes in ionic interactions produced by the nature of pollutant in the effluent in most cases the applied current density in the ec process typically vary from 0 01 to 880 a m2 67 3 3 5 electrical usage kwh l the current density is directly linked to faraday s laws which determine the amount of metal ions released into an aqueous solution eq 17 17 c i t m z f where c denotes the amount of metal ions dissolved g i the current intensity a t the electrolysis time s m the atomic weight of the anode material g mol z the metal oxidation state and f is the faraday constant 96 500c mol different currents were investigated 0 3 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 1 7 a providing current densities of 24 78 42 30 84 6 126 9 and 144 43 a m2 respectively fig 7 shows the behavior of a cod b color and c turbidity other authors reported current densities of 250 a m2 42 22 2 a m2 69 201 5 a m2 33 50 a m2 59 207 8 a m2 45 and 20 a m2 46 the optimal current density in this study was 144 67 a m2 when the current is raised the removal efficiencies were improved for all the parameters the applied current density is linked to the dissociation of metal ions an excess of current may decrease the ec removal efficiency due to in situ secondary reactions alongside with the colloidal charge reversal because of the overdosing of coagulants this behavior has the potential to reduce the electrode life span while decreasing the process efficiency thus the current density is an essential parameter in the ec process that must be optimized to reach the required treatment performance 67 under optimal operating conditions current density of 144 67 a m2 time of 28 9 min and initial ph of 4 5 93 cod 87 color and 93 turbidity removal were achieved according to eq 7 374 7 mg of mg was released in the ec system the dose applied was 0 86 g l mg which is a minor dose compared to the cp treatment 1 28 g l mg the operating cost of the ec treatment of textile wastewater was determined using eq 18 under optimal operating conditions 1 7 a 28 9 min and ph 4 5 18 kwh l uit v 0 001 where kwh l denotes the energy consumption u is the voltage v i is the current intensity a t is the treatment time h and v is the treated volume l ec consumes 0 040 kwh l applying the industrial cost of electricity supply in méxico at 0 044 us kwh the cost of the ec treatment is 1 82 us m3 some studies have reported similar results table 6 some of them are less expensive owing to the use of electrodes like al and fe which have less electric resistivity and consequently less electric tension hendaoui et al 70 reported 0 527 us m3 for indigo dyed effluent using iron electrodes 5 80 us m3 by bilińska et al 34 who employed iron electrodes on textile wastewater and 45 treated denim wastewater with an fe anode at 0 401 us m3 3 3 6 coupled treatment coupled treatment was performed under optimal conditions for ec cp in situ cacl2 was dosed at 2 mg ml as the supporting electrolyte and precipitating agent at a current intensity of 1 2 a 101 52 a m2 ph 4 5 and 40 min hrt in continuous mode 18 9 ml min the final ph was 10 4 fig 7 shows the performance for coupled treatment a cod b color and c turbidity fig 7 shows the response surface plots of the results obtained for cod 7a color 7b and turbidity 7c statistical analysis indicated that current had the most significant influence on ec cp treatment p 0 0002 followed by hrt p 0 0078 when current and hrt were increased the removal rates were favored for all parameters removal efficiencies up to 91 cod 93 color and 94 turbidity were achieved the supporting electrolyte had no influence on cod and color p 0 932 fig 7a and b were plotted at a fixed value of 2 0 g l cacl2 and fig 7c was plotted at a value of 6 g l because this dose had a higher turbidity removal 75 pointed out that ec is widely employed in integrated systems with other electrochemical technologies or conventional methods for effective removal of different pollutants with less cost and sometimes with shorter operation times it has also been observed that the hybrid effects besides increasing the removal efficiency can overcome the disadvantages of using electrocoagulation alone such as less sludge formation 76 studied the pretreatment effects of various target pollutant in real coal gasification gray water by coupling pulse electrocoagulation with chemical precipitation methods at ph 8 97 the removal rates of si b mn ba cod and nh4 n were 80 0 75 4 97 0 99 8 35 1 33 6 and 23 8 respectively the authors remark that sludge yield and operation costs were lower in the pec cp coupled system 59 reported a coupled treatment that include electrocoagulation electro oxidation activated carbon adsorption for the treatment of an industrial textile wastewater the best performance for ec i e dye removal 94 cod and toc degradation of 45 and 40 respectively was obtained using fe anode and boron doped diamond cathode with current density of 5 ma cm2 ph 9 3 60 rpm and 10 min of electrolysis after ec treatment the effluent biodegradability evaluated as the bod5 cod ratio increases from 0 14 to 0 23 the operation cost which includes chemical reagents electrodes energy consumption and sludge disposal was estimated in 3 83 usd m3 3 4 kinetics the kinetic constants of the ec cp process for the first second and bmg models are listed in table 5 in the case of cod the experimental data were fitted to the second model r2 0 91 with a kinetic constant of 5 10 4 l mg min similarly 43 treated an indigo dye wastewater with a continuous ec coupled with an activated carbon adsorption process and found that under optimal conditions of ec ph 5 4 t 10 min σ 2 ms cm and i 14 ma cm2 the process adjusted best to a second order kinetic model r2 0 95 with a kinetic constant for cod of 5 5 10 4 l mg min and 95 removal efficiency fig 8 for color and turbidity a first order model was fitted with r2 values of 0 96 and 0 99 with kinetic constants of 1 2 10 3 1 u min 1 and 1 1 10 2 min 1 respectively ahangarnokolaei ayati and ganjidoust 77 removed direct blue 71 dye toc and cod with a sequential ec ozonation process using al and fe electrodes and their results also followed a first order kinetic model al provided slightly better results with kinetic constants of 1 6 10 1 2 52 10 2 and 3 23 10 2 min 1 for blue dye cod and toc respectively the removal efficiencies were 99 51 and 62 respectively some advantages observed in this synergistic ec cp process are the increase of the removal efficiencies for organic and inorganic compounds as well as dyes a reduction of costs less sludge formation and increased life time of the electrodes other positive aspects include a stable flow of water with longer periods of operation simple equipment operation and generation of clear colorless and odorless water some limitations are that the sacrificial electrodes need to be replaced regularly and the use of electricity may be expensive in many places however solar panels can be used to reduce costs an impermeable oxide film may be formed on the cathode resulting in efficiency loss of the electrocoagulation unit gelatinous hydroxides may tend to solubilize in some cases 75 in general terms the results obtained by ec cp treatment were positive however other limitations may arise when moving to full scale implementation on denim washing factories future works could focus on large scale treatments 3 5 final characterization the table 7 shows the removal efficiencies of cod color and turbidity for denim wastewater by cp cacl2 ec and ec cp treatment under optimal conditions and operating costs it is evident that ec batch treatment provided the best removal efficiencies for all parameters according to table 4 the biodegradability index for raw wastewater was 0 07 and after treatment this value increased to 0 12 cp 0 26 ec and 0 22 ec cp similar results were obtained by 59 after ec treatment the effluent biodegradability increases from 0 14 to 0 23 detergents asmb decreased to 48 cp 90 ec and 66 ec cp the inorganic matter exhibited a similar behavior as the acidity decreased by 54 for cp and 100 for ec and ec cp whereas in the case of alkalinity cp ec and ec cp exhibited 100 59 and 78 respectively in this case the alkalinity obtained the best removal efficiency in the cp treatment because 6 g l cacl2 was added and the ph decreased from 4 5 to 2 82 for nutrients total nitrogen was removed 80 by cp 88 by ec and 67 by ec cp for nitrate 99 removal was achieved for all treatments cp ec and ec cp and the mg anode proved to remove nitrogen matter efficiently however an increase in phosphates was observed during cp this may be associated with the decrease in ph from 4 5 to 2 8 which promotes phosphates dissolution however during ec the phosphates decreased to 63 this behavior could be associated with the final ph of 10 which promotes the formation of solid species of phosphates increasing the sedimentation during ec cp treatment the final ph was 9 45 and phosphorus was 100 removed which may be owing to the combined action of mg and ca in solution to precipitate phosphates according to 78 this is a promising method for p and n precipitation from wastewater preferably using inexpensive coagulants such as magnesium with the added benefit of struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o formation furthermore struvite is a highly effective source of n mg and p and can therefore act as a replacement for chemical fertilizers in the agricultural industry the hardness sulfates chlorides and fluorine increased after cp because of the addition of a coagulant cacl2 an advantage of ec is that these parameters were decreased to 83 chlorides 60 hardness and 4 fluorine however the sulfates increased by 73 13 likely owing to the liberation of sulfates from indigo blue dye and detergents in the case of ec cp chlorides sulfates and hardness increased however fluorine decreased by 92 the electrical conductivity increased significantly during cp 12 48 ms cm and the treated wastewater ec did not change from the initial value 1 93 ms cm

12631,the textile industry is one of the most polluting activities since its processes handle 8000 different types of chemical products it consumes a significant volume of water for example a denim dying process requires from 30 to 50 l kg the goal of this study was to determine the synergistic effect of the electrocoagulation chemical precipitation treatment ec cp on real textile wastewater from the denim industry mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 were tested for cp and cacl2 exhibited the best results 77 76 and 77 of cod color and turbidity were removed respectively ec batch treatment was performed

efficiencies of 93 87 and 93 for cod color and turbidity respectively the main contribution and conclusion of this work were the bifunctional effect of the electrolyte cacl2 improves the conductivity and precipitates the pollutants the mg anode removes efficiently the organic matter and the nutrients n and p by complexation the synergistic ec cp achieved removal efficiencies were 91 93 and 94 for cod color and turbidity respectively the energetic costs for ec and ec cp treatments were 1 82 and 0 25 us m3 respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords camg bifunctional effect blue indigo dye continuous electrocoagulation textile wastewater cod and nutrients removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a high demand of water and dyes is required by the textile industry 1 approximately 8000 kg of fabric is produced daily consuming 1 6 million l of water 2 the dyes are recalcitrant organic molecules with high chemical stability and are highly resistant to external agents such as light heat oxidation and aerobic digestion 3 5 wastewater from the textile industry exhibits considerably low biodegradability and typically contains 2000 chemical compounds 1 6 7 wastewater having extremely high organic loads chemical oxygen demand cod and color can be released into the environment in particular persistent dyes can remain in the environment for up to 40 years under normal conditions 8 even at concentrations of 1 mg l 9 100 000 different dyes are commercially produced and most of them are used in the textile industry however in this industry an important fraction 5 50 of dyes cannot be integrated into the fabric and is washed and discharged directly into sewer systems 9 11 in addition the textile industry is the largest consumer of dyestuff at approximately 10 000 tons per year producing large amounts of colored wastewater 12 the effluents of this industry contain strong acids and bases organic and inorganic chlorinated compounds dyes bleaches thickening agents surfactants dispersants salts starches enzymes fats waxes sodium hydroxide and chloride silicates sulfates carbonates heavy metals reducing and oxidizing agents biocides resins etc 13 15 these pollutants can block air and sunlight from penetrating water decreasing oxygen inside water bodies and is unfavorable to aquatic flora and fauna inhibiting important activities such as the growth of bacteria responsible for biological degradation or the photosynthesis of algae 9 16 heavy metals and organic pollutants found in textile effluents can cause sub chronic damage liver kidney and lungs dna damage inducing mutagenicity and genotoxicity and carcinogenic effects in human and animals 17 to reduce colored effluents discharged into watercourses different governments have established the permissible limits for the final discharge table 1 lists the permissible limits for wastewater discharge from the textile industry in different countries different physical chemical and biological treatments and combinations of these have been tested for the treatment of textile wastewater however owing to the advantages and disadvantages of each method few have been accepted for full scale applications several alternatives have exhibited high removal of color cod turbidity and dissolved solids and promising results for further investigation such as biological 18 19 filtration 20 adsorption 21 advanced oxidation processes 22 ion exchange 23 ultraviolet 24 ozonation 25 photocatalysis 26 27 coagulation 28 and electrocoagulation ec 29 methods the processes of coagulation and flocculation cf have been extensively used in water and wastewater treatment by applying a wide range of chemicals mainly because they effectively reduce impurities in water such as cod turbidity color suspended solids heavy metals oils and organic matter the goal of this process is to allow chemical reagents to gather clump and become large flocculants with dissolved pollutants and the precipitation of some ions sulfates phosphates and carbonates some of the most common coagulants in cf include hydrolyzing metallic salts such as aluminum sulfate ferric chloride and ferric sulfate 30 over the last two decades the interest in analogous cf electrochemical methods has increased mainly because of the proven efficiencies for the treatment of dyes and other organic contaminants found in textile wastewater among the different electrochemical methods ec is one of the most promising techniques and its main advantages are low sludge generation minimal use of chemical reagents and simplicity of application and control in addition it is considered an eco friendly technology mainly because electrons are used as clean reagents 31 32 ec is an electrochemical method that consists of the in situ generation of coagulating agents by dissolving a sacrificial metallic anode eq 1 typically iron or aluminum and the formation of hydrogen and hydroxide ions at the cathode owing to the cathodic decomposition of water eq 2 33 1 m 0 m n n e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h for ec treatment the electrical conductivity of the wastewater μs cm should be sufficiently high and the presence of salts allows the mobility of electrons in the aqueous solution however when this value is low the addition of salts is required to enhance the electrical conductivity 34 various support electrolytes have been reported for ec treatment typically nacl na2so4 kcl and h2so4 35 36 in this context the main purpose of this study was to determine the synergistic effect of the electrocoagulation precipitation treatment ec cp on real textile wastewater obtained from the denim industry hydraulic retention time hrt current density and the addition of a bifunctional support electrolyte were evaluated in terms of color cod and turbidity removal and complexation of nitrogen and phosphate species the main research gap was the study of the bifunctionality of an electrolyte which consisted on a enhancement of the electric conductivity of the textile wastewater and b precipitation of the pollutants the energy consumption treatment time and reagent concentration decreased consequently the cost of the process decreased this is an affordable option for textile wastewater treatment for large scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and characterization textile wastewater 30l was obtained by grab sampling from a denim washing factory in mexico the compound sample was composed of 3 simple samples from different parts of the facility production inner sewage and outer municipal sewage pipes the samples were taken in 2 different seasonal periods according to the major factory production the sample was cooled at 2 c for preservation and physicochemical characterization a 150 ml textile wastewater sample was digested in a microwave for inductively coupled plasma icp analysis the raw and treated wastewater samples were characterized according to standard methods 37 the analyzed parameters were ph electrical conductivity acidity alkalinity color turbidity cod bod5 biodegradability suspended solids dissolved solids hardness total nitrogen nitrates phosphates methylene blue active substances mbas chlorides and sulfates 2 2 chemical precipitation cp treatment cp treatment was performed in the jar test under the following operating conditions first a rapid mixing speed of 250 rpm rpm was applied for 15 min followed by a low mixing speed of 50 rpm for 10 min with a settling time of 20 min subsequently the liquid and solid phases were separated and the supernatant was characterized by cod color and turbidity the operating variables were the type and dose of the precipitating agents for this study cacl2 mgso4 and mgcl2 were chosen because of their applications reported in the literature 38 41 the different dosages tested were 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 g l resulting in 18 experiments the experimental design and data analysis were performed using minitab 20 3 software 2 3 electrocoagulation treatment for ec tests were conducted in batch mode on a cylindrical reactor designed with a diameter of 5 cm a length of 21 cm and a thickness of 4 mm thus the useful capacity was 0 43 l magnesium and iron were used as the anode and cathode respectively mg had a 98 01 purity supplementary material 1 the electrodes had a length of 20 cm a diameter of 1 8 cm and an anodic area of 118 19 cm2 with current densities of 42 31 a m2 0 5 a and 126 92 a m2 1 5 a before the treatment the electrodes were polished using sandpaper separated by 0 5 cm of interelectrode distance and connected to a digital dc power supply in galvanostatic mode the applied current densities table 2 provided voltages in the range of 7 6 21 8 v and no external mixing was required as the process itself provided sufficient turbulence to mix the solution the initial ph 4 5 was not modified but was monitored during the process and the area volume ratio a v was 38 9 m2 m3 both the a v and current density values were in accordance with other reported values 32 33 42 46 a central experimental design 22 star points was used for ec treatment it consisted of 12 experiments with six degrees of freedom a quadratic model was fitted using the statgraphics centurion xvi software supplementary material 2 the response variables were cod turbidity and color removal 2 4 continuous synergistic electrocoagulation precipitation system a continuous treatment with a two chamber reactor was performed for the synergistic ec cp process fig 1 it consisted of an inner reactor for ec and an outer reactor with a diameter of 9 5 cm length of 30 cm and thickness of 2 mm the useful capacity was 1 99 l the working ph was 4 5 textile sample ph and the electrodes were placed in parallel with 0 5 cm of interelectrode separation the values for each experimental factor were set at high and low values table 3 the experimental design was performed using statgraphics centurion xvi software to analyze the effect of different factors hrt current intensity and concentration of supporting electrolyte table 3 the response variables were removal cod color and turbidity a box behnken design was selected for the synergistic process resulting in 15 experiments with five degrees of freedom after the optimal operating conditions were determined hrt current density and supporting electrolyte maximum ascent tests were performed to validate the model obtained and the conditions of maximum removal efficiency were determined using the statgraphics centurion xvi software 2 5 sludge characterization the sludges from raw wastewater and after cp ec and ec cp treatments were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd a siemens d5000 diffractometer coupled with a copper anode x ray tube was used the analysis by scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with an electron x ray dispersive spectroscopy eds was realized by using a jeol jsm 6610lv microscope to determine crystallinity morphology and the elemental composition infrared spectroscopy ir was applied to determine the functional groups 2 6 kinetic reactions the kinetics for ec and coupled treatment were performed under optimal conditions aliquots were taken every 5 min and cod color and turbidity were analyzed the kinetics were fitted to the first eq 3 second eq 4 and the bmg eq 5 models using the statistica software 3 a a 0 e kt 4 a a 0 1 k a 0 t 5 c 1 t m bt c 0 where a0 or c0 initial concentration a or c final concentration t time k rate constant m and b bmg constants 2 7 species distribution diagrams species distribution diagrams were made using the medusa software 47 and the concentrations of the cations and anions were used to calculate the ionic strength the formed solid species were identified by xrd and quantified by sem chemical reaction mechanisms in solution were proposed for cp and ec 48 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial wastewater characterization table 4 shows the physicochemical characterization of the textile wastewater samples the electrical conductivity was 1 93 ms cm and the ph was acidic 4 5 however the permissible limit is 6 9 according to the epa ph values are directly related to the concentrations of contaminants in the water 49 the corresponding acidity was 386 1 mg l caco3 and low alkalinity 199 mg l likely associated with dissolved co2 with a hardness of 240 14 mg l caco3 the organic matter was quantified with 74 16 mg l bod5 and 1039 5 mg l cod therefore the biodegradability index bod5 cod is 0 071 according to metcalf and eddy biodegradability index values 0 5 indicate poor biodegradability 50 52 suggesting that the effluent cannot be treated by a conventional biological treatment 7 the permissible limits are 13 4 and 53 5 mg l for bod5 and cod respectively according to the epa the color of the textile wastewater was 683 u ptco and the epa permissible limit is 240 u ptco textiles typically contain several types of chemicals such as pigments surfactants dyes wax and bleach the total dissolved solids tdss total suspended solids tsss and settling solids were 1146 110 and 15 mg l respectively according to the epa the permissible limit for tsss is 36 mg l however the main proportion of pollutants is dissolved organic and inorganic compounds which can explain the turbidity 192 25 ntu nitrogenous matter was represented by high values of total nitrogen 13 mg l nitrites 12 54 mg l and nitrates 93 33 mg l phosphorus was present at 0 86 mg l and the discharge of a significant amount of nitrogen or phosphorus into water bodies can cause eutrophication problems and health effects such as cyanosis and blue child sickness 53 the sample exhibited 52 72 mg l for fats and oils which can reduce the penetration of air and sunlight into the water bodies the anions as chlorides 189 16 mg l fluorides 0 48 mg l and sulfates 403 38 mg l may incorporate salinity in the wastewater 3 2 precipitation treatment 3 2 1 effect of dosage during the cf treatment of textile wastewater the quantity of coagulant is a vital factor for determining the optimal dose to destabilize colloidal particles applying an underdose may prove insufficient to encourage colloidal particle assembly and an overdose reduces treatment efficiencies by increasing organic load turbidity slurry volume and treatment costs 30 to determine the optimal dose in this study three different coagulants were added to the jar test mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 at different initial concentrations 1 6 g l fig 2 an anova analysis was performed to determine the significative differences between coagulants which indicated that the optimal dose of mgcl2 was 5 g l and the removal efficiencies were 27 cod 76 color and 77 turbidity at ph 5 9 cacl2 4 g l removed 28 cod 75 color and 81 turbidity at ph 7 2 however when cacl2 increased 5 g l the removal efficiency of cod decreased a concentration of 5 g l mgso4 exhibited a removal of 8 cod 77 color and 84 turbidity which could be related to the decrease in ph 3 5 these results agree with 54 who reported different doses of natural coagulants for different pollutants from water and wastewater 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph is an important parameter in the coagulation flocculation process working in an adequate ph range and according to the physicochemical wastewater characteristics is vital to improve the removal efficiencies the ph influences the flocculants morphology size and strength affecting the liquid and solid separation 30 55 have reported that the optimal ph range is 5 0 6 5 for aluminum coagulants and 4 5 6 for ferric coagulants the initial ph of the study was 4 5 and changed to 6 7 7 3 and 3 5 after treatments with mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 the best removal efficiencies were obtained employing cacl2 that is 77 cod 76 color and 77 turbidity the lowest removal efficiencies were obtained with mgso4 because the ph decreased to 3 5 in addition bakshi and mokadam 56 reported an increment in color removal efficiencies up to 99 when the ph was increased from 4 0 to 11 0 and 4 0 to 12 0 using feso4 and mgcl2 respectively however the final ph was so alkaline that it limited discharge possibilities according to international laws ph 9 is the permissible limit epa according to speciation diagrams supplementary material 3 the removal efficiencies of phosphates sulfates and carbonates are determined by precipitation reactions occurring with mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 eqs 6 10 mgcl2 final ph 5 9 6 mg 2 hpo 4 2 mghpo 4 s cacl2 final ph 7 2 7 ca 2 co 3 2 caco 3 s 8 mg 2 so 4 2 mgso 4 s 9 ca 2 so 4 2 caso 4 s 10 5 ca 2 3 po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 oh s mgso4 final ph 3 5 eqs 8 9 are carried out 3 2 3 effect of mixing speed and time the coagulation flocculation process is carried out in 3 steps first a coagulant is added and rapidly mixed 75 700 rpm for 0 5 3 min in the second step a slower mixing 30 150 rpm for 5 30 min stimulates the production of flocculants 57 and third a sedimentation time is required to allow the separation of pollutants in this study the conditions were as follows rapid mixing at 250 rpm for 15 min and slow mixing at 50 rpm for 10 min followed by 30 min of sedimentation the particles are collided and form aggregates which can be significantly aided by agitation either in stirred tanks or in flow through devices rapid mixing is vital in the event of charge neutralization because insufficient mixing can lead to local overdose and re stabilization of certain particles 57 58 studied the removal of methylene blue by coagulation flocculation with biomaterials bentonite and opuntia ficus indica the mass of the coagulant bentonite was 0 9 g the mass of the flocculant opuntia ficus indica was 0 4 g the speed and stirring time of the coagulation step were 180 rpm and 4 min respectively the stirring speed and time of the flocculation step were 40 rpm and 15 min respectively with a settling time of 15 min 3 3 electrocoagulation performance the main operational parameters that influence the electrocoagulation process are the interelectrode distance solution ph type of electrodes current density and electrode configuration consequently these operational parameters must be optimized in each electrocoagulation study the main operational parameters investigated in this study are discussed below 3 3 1 effect of electrode material in the ec process the coagulant is produced by the dissolution of a sacrificial anode in the aqueous medium generating hydrometal species that effectively destabilizes the suspended emulsified or dissolved particles in aqueous medium through an electrical current applied fe 45 59 and al 60 are the most commonly used however cu 61 zn 62 and mg 33 have also been reported for ec performance 63 in this study ec treatment using a mg anode and fe cathode had positive results with up to 92 99 cod 88 58 color and 92 72 turbidity removal efficiencies and a settling time of 15 min after treatment it should be noted that when the settling time of the treated effluent was 1 h removal efficiencies of color and turbidity increased to 99 71 and 98 96 respectively the results obtained by using mg anodes were similar to those reported by other authors 33 they obtained 67 7 97 5 and 96 3 removal efficiencies of cod color and turbidity respectively donneys victoria et al 64 reported chloride and dissolved organic carbon removal rates of 69 1 and 90 4 respectively using mg oh 2 in contrast 65 treated indigo dye from textile wastewater al electrodes were used in a batch ec process 86 98 was the maximum dye removal percentage at optimum conditions of the current intensity 0 50 a initial concentration of dye 12 31 mg l and nacl concentration 2 67 mg l at ph 8 inter electrodes distance of 7 mm electrolysis time of 25 min and nacl concentration of 2 67 mg l depending on the material used as the sacrificial electrode in the ec process the treatment can be less expensive and more convenient the aluminum hydroxide flocculant is larger and has a lower density than iron hydroxide however it is difficult to avoid passivation of the aluminum anode during ec copper is another electrode material used in the removal of different pollutants in ec some works reported that cu material provides a higher removal efficiency than al electrodes cu exhibits uniform corrosion at the surface after the ec treatment besides several authors have suggested the use of miscellaneous materials as mg and zn the mechanism is like that reported for al fe and cu electrodes that consists of the anodic dissolution of mg or zn followed a coagulation and precipitation of pollutants depending on the solution ph the produced ions mg2 and zn2 allow the formation of the corresponding hydroxides mg oh 2 and zn oh 2 66 in this study the initial ph was 4 5 which increased to ph 10 fig 3 therefore a constant formation of mg oh 2 flocculants was observed particularly as gray flake shaped flocculants which led to the regular formation of sludge and floating flocculants owing to the high concentration of magnesium hydroxides even after the settling time the separation of dissolved pollutants continued which led to improved removal efficiencies 95 for color and turbidity after 1 h of settling time nevertheless the evaluation of other coagulants produced by ec is centered on residual metal concentrations in the treated water for example al concentration of 0 2 mg l is the permissible limit in wastewater whereas the limit for mg is set at 30 mg l to avoid any health related issues according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa according to the epa for textile industries the limits for cu and zn are 0 14 mg l 3 3 2 effect of ph in ec ph affects the chemistry of the coagulant pollutants and electrochemical processes in the solution 79 which is also associated with the electrodes used in this study the textile sample had a ph of 4 5 and after treatment under optimal conditions the ph increased to 10 7 fig 3 however after only 3 min of treatment ph values 9 were observed ph affects the speciation of mg and has a significant influence on the removal mechanism the ec mechanism is carried out by different steps 1 metal cations are formed in the sacrificial anode due to the current applied 2 hydroxyl ions are produced in the cathode by reducing of water 3 the reaction between metal cations with hydroxyl ions produces metallic hydroxides 4 the reaction of metal hydroxides and pollutants promotes the charge neutralization of contaminants 5 adsorption of pollutants with neutralized charge on metal hydroxides occurs and 6 h2 gas is formed at the cathode lifting the generated flocculants to the solution surface flotation fig 4 67 eqs 11 13 show the electrochemical and solution reactions performed during ec which involve the oxidation of mg to mg2 the h2o reduction to h2 and oh ions was performed on the cathode the solution reactions revealed the formation of metallic hydroxides anodic reaction 11 mg mg 2 2 e cathodic reaction 12 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 oh solution reaction 13 mg 2 2 h 2 o mg oh 2 s 2 h according to the speciation diagrams different species can be observed in the ec process at ph 10 4 using the mg anode eqs 14 16 14 mg 2 co 3 2 mgco 3 s 15 mg 2 2 oh mg

were obtained at ph 7 1 86 color 82 turbidity and 59 cod were achieved 68 3 3 3 effect of treatment time and kinetics according to the statistical analysis treatment time had the most significant influence on the experimental factors p 0 0001 kinetic analyses for cod color and turbidity fig 5a c were performed using statistica software they were fitted to a second order kinetic model under the optimal operating conditions current density 144 44 a m2 time 28 9 min no significant removal was observed after 15 min of treatment time table 5 lists the kinetic constants for the first second and bmg models the experimental data were best fitted to the second and bmg models r2 0 99 the kinetic constants for the second order model were cod 5 10 4 l mg min color 1 2 10 3 1 u ptco min and turbidity 1 1 10 2 1 ntu min similarly carmona carmona et al 33 reported that cod and color were fitted to a second order model kinetics constants of 1 22 10 1 l mg min and 2 51 10 3 1 u ptco min respectively whereas turbidity was fitted to a first order model 0 039 min 1 additionally bener et al 42 reported that for total organic carbon in textile wastewater the first and second order kinetic models were fitted however the second order kinetic model was more suitable and the kinetic constants ranged from 3 78 10 6 to 1 15 10 5 l mg min depending on the current density applied although the data were fitted to the bmg model with a high r2 0 99 the m constant exhibited negative values for color and turbidity which could be associated with rapid coagulation in treatment time 5 min 3 3 4 effect of current and time the variables that influence the ec efficiency are shown in fig 6 the current density is considered a substantial parameter in electrocoagulation behavior in the ec process the electron released is controlled by the current density promoting the metal ion dissociation from the electrodes depending on physicochemical characteristics of wastewater the applied current density is adjusted this variation is mainly due to the changes in ionic interactions produced by the nature of pollutant in the effluent in most cases the applied current density in the ec process typically vary from 0 01 to 880 a m2 67 3 3 5 electrical usage kwh l the current density is directly linked to faraday s laws which determine the amount of metal ions released into an aqueous solution eq 17 17 c i t m z f where c denotes the amount of metal ions dissolved g i the current intensity a t the electrolysis time s m the atomic weight of the anode material g mol z the metal oxidation state and f is the faraday constant 96 500c mol different currents were investigated 0 3 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 1 7 a providing current densities of 24 78 42 30 84 6 126 9 and 144 43 a m2 respectively fig 7 shows the behavior of a cod b color and c turbidity other authors reported current densities of 250 a m2 42 22 2 a m2 69 201 5 a m2 33 50 a m2 59 207 8 a m2 45 and 20 a m2 46 the optimal current density in this study was 144 67 a m2 when the current is raised the removal efficiencies were improved for all the parameters the applied current density is linked to the dissociation of metal ions an excess of current may decrease the ec removal efficiency due to in situ secondary reactions alongside with the colloidal charge reversal because of the overdosing of coagulants this behavior has the potential to reduce the electrode life span while decreasing the process efficiency thus the current density is an essential parameter in the ec process that must be optimized to reach the required treatment performance 67 under optimal operating conditions current density of 144 67 a m2 time of 28 9 min and initial ph of 4 5 93 cod 87 color and 93 turbidity removal were achieved according to eq 7 374 7 mg of mg was released in the ec system the dose applied was 0 86 g l mg which is a minor dose compared to the cp treatment 1 28 g l mg the operating cost of the ec treatment of textile wastewater was determined using eq 18 under optimal operating conditions 1 7 a 28 9 min and ph 4 5 18 kwh l uit v 0 001 where kwh l denotes the energy consumption u is the voltage v i is the

treatment is 1 82 us m3 some studies have reported similar results table 6 some of them are less expensive owing to the use of electrodes like al and fe which have less electric resistivity and consequently less electric tension hendaoui et al 70 reported 0 527 us m3 for indigo dyed effluent using iron electrodes 5 80 us m3 by bilińska et al 34 who employed iron electrodes on textile wastewater and 45 treated denim wastewater with an fe anode at 0 401 us m3 3 3 6 coupled treatment coupled treatment was performed under optimal conditions for ec cp in situ cacl2 was dosed at 2 mg ml as the supporting electrolyte and precipitating agent at a current intensity of 1 2 a 101 52 a m2 ph 4 5 and 40 min hrt in continuous mode 18 9 ml min the final ph was 10 4 fig 7 shows the performance for coupled treatment a cod b color and c turbidity fig 7 shows the response surface plots of the results obtained for cod 7a color 7b and turbidity 7c statistical analysis indicated that current had the most significant influence on ec cp treatment p 0 0002 followed by hrt p 0 0078 when current and hrt were increased the removal rates were favored for all parameters removal efficiencies up to 91 cod 93 color and 94 turbidity were achieved the supporting electrolyte had no influence on cod and color p 0 932 fig 7a and b were plotted at a fixed value of 2 0 g l cacl2 and fig 7c was plotted at a value of 6 g l because this dose had a higher turbidity removal 75 pointed out that ec is widely employed in integrated systems with other electrochemical technologies or conventional methods for effective removal of different pollutants with less cost and sometimes with shorter operation times it has also been observed that the hybrid effects besides increasing the removal efficiency can overcome the disadvantages of using electrocoagulation alone such as less sludge formation 76 studied the pretreatment effects of various target pollutant in real coal gasification gray water by coupling pulse electrocoagulation with chemical precipitation methods at ph 8 97 the removal rates of si b mn ba cod and nh4 n were 80 0 75 4 97 0 99 8 35 1 33 6 and 23 8 respectively the authors remark that sludge yield and operation costs were lower in the pec cp coupled system 59 reported a coupled treatment that include electrocoagulation electro oxidation activated carbon adsorption for the treatment of an industrial textile wastewater the best performance for ec i e dye removal 94 cod and toc degradation of 45 and 40 respectively was obtained using fe anode and boron doped diamond cathode with current density of 5 ma cm2 ph 9 3 60 rpm and 10 min of electrolysis after ec treatment the effluent biodegradability evaluated as the bod5 cod ratio increases from 0 14 to 0 23 the operation cost which includes chemical reagents electrodes energy consumption and sludge disposal was estimated in 3 83 usd m3 3 4 kinetics the kinetic constants of the ec cp process for the first second and bmg models are listed in table 5 in the case of cod the experimental data were fitted to the second model r2 0 91 with a kinetic constant of 5 10 4 l mg min similarly 43 treated an indigo dye wastewater with a continuous ec coupled with an activated carbon adsorption process and found that under optimal conditions of ec ph 5 4 t 10 min σ 2 ms cm and i 14 ma cm2 the process adjusted best to a second order kinetic model r2 0 95 with a kinetic constant for cod of 5 5 10 4 l mg min and 95 removal efficiency fig 8 for color and turbidity a first order model was fitted with r2 values of 0 96 and 0 99 with kinetic constants of 1 2 10 3 1 u min 1 and 1 1 10 2 min 1 respectively ahangarnokolaei ayati and ganjidoust 77 removed direct blue 71 dye toc and cod with a sequential ec ozonation process using al and fe electrodes and their results also followed a first order kinetic model al provided slightly better results with kinetic constants of 1 6 10 1 2 52 10 2 and 3 23 10 2 min 1 for blue dye cod and toc respectively the removal efficiencies were 99 51 and 62 respectively some advantages observed in this synergistic ec cp process are the increase of the removal efficiencies for organic and inorganic compounds as well as dyes a reduction of costs less sludge formation and increased life time of the electrodes other positive aspects include a stable flow of water with longer periods of operation simple equipment operation and generation of clear colorless and odorless water some limitations are that the sacrificial electrodes need to be replaced regularly and the use of electricity may be expensive in many places however solar panels can be used to reduce costs an impermeable oxide film may be formed on the cathode resulting in efficiency loss of the electrocoagulation unit gelatinous hydroxides may tend to solubilize in some cases 75 in general terms the results obtained by ec cp treatment were positive however other limitations may arise when moving to full scale implementation on denim washing factories future works could focus on large scale treatments 3 5 final characterization the table 7 shows the removal efficiencies of cod color and turbidity for denim wastewater by cp cacl2 ec and ec cp treatment under optimal conditions and operating costs it is evident that ec batch treatment provided the best removal efficiencies for all parameters according to table 4 the biodegradability index for raw wastewater was 0 07 and after treatment this value increased to 0 12 cp 0 26 ec and 0 22 ec cp similar results were obtained by 59 after ec treatment the effluent biodegradability increases from 0 14 to 0 23 detergents asmb decreased to 48 cp 90 ec and 66 ec cp the inorganic matter exhibited a similar behavior as the acidity decreased by 54 for cp and 100 for ec and ec cp whereas in the case of alkalinity cp ec and ec cp exhibited 100 59 and 78 respectively in this case the alkalinity obtained the best removal efficiency in the cp treatment because 6 g l cacl2 was added and the ph decreased from 4 5 to 2 82 for nutrients total nitrogen was removed 80 by cp 88 by ec and 67 by ec cp for nitrate 99 removal was achieved for all treatments cp ec and ec cp and the mg anode proved to remove nitrogen matter efficiently however an increase in phosphates was observed during cp this may be associated with the decrease in ph from 4 5 to 2 8 which promotes phosphates dissolution however during ec the phosphates decreased to 63 this behavior could be associated with the final ph of 10 which promotes the formation of solid species of phosphates increasing the sedimentation during ec cp treatment the final ph was 9 45 and phosphorus was 100 removed which may be owing to the combined action of mg and ca in solution to precipitate phosphates according to 78 this is a promising method for p and n precipitation from wastewater preferably using inexpensive coagulants such as magnesium with the added benefit of struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o formation furthermore struvite is a highly effective source of n mg and p and can therefore act as a replacement for chemical fertilizers in the agricultural industry the hardness sulfates chlorides and fluorine increased after cp because of the addition of a coagulant cacl2 an advantage of ec is that these parameters were decreased to 83 chlorides 60 hardness and 4 fluorine however the sulfates increased by 73 13 likely owing to the liberation of sulfates from indigo blue dye and detergents in the case of ec cp chlorides sulfates and hardness increased however fluorine decreased by 92 the electrical conductivity increased significantly during cp 12 48 ms cm and the treated wastewater ec did not change from the initial value 1 93 ms cm whereas in ec cp it increased to 1 47 ms cm 3 6 sludge characterization fig 9 shows the initial and final characterization of the sludge generated from the raw and treated denim wastewater samples cp ec and ec cp by employing sem column 1 and xrd column 2 fig 9 a shows the sludge characterization for raw denim wastewater the main elements found are c 39 12 5 4 o 39 73 3 6 na 7 35 1 4 s 6 94 0 6 al 3 21 0 4 si 1 59 0 3 cl 0 60 0 ca 0 37 0 1 k 0 23 0 and mn 0 12 0 the xrd results show the presence of some compounds found in the sludge in the case of denim wastewater siderite axinite mg and polyhalite are the most common sem analysis reveals a disperse sludge structure with more space between the particles fig 9 b shows the sludge characterization after cp treatment the elements found are c 44 04 6 o 29 51 3 cl 11 38 1 4 ca 7 43 0 9 al 2 72 0 5 s 1 98 0 2 si 0 83 0 2 and mg 0 57 0 for cp treatment the main compounds found are ca5si2o7 co3 2 tilleyite and al2ca2o15si5 the structure of the sludge has a severely porous appearance resembling a sponge like texture fig 9 c shows the sludge characterization after ec treatment the elements found are c 22 06 3 7 o 52 99 2 mg 22 99 1 8 s 0 63 0 1 na 0 52 0 1 si 0 47 0 02 and al 0 35 0 1 except for c and o mg has the largest presence in the sludge mainly owing to the in situ generation of mg 374 7 mg mg is released during the process eq 7 although the sludge produced by ec and ec cp treatments are extremely similar no spaces are observed between the particles in the batch ec sludge with an almost flat surface with bigger particles that stand out of the surface fig 9 d shows the sludge characterization after ec cp coupled treatments the elements found are c 27 52 2 7 o 46 05 1 7 mg 14 93 1 7 cl 4 70 1 3 al 2 84 0 3 na 1 16 0 9 si 1 06 0 2 s 0 89 0 12 ca 0 74 0 7 and mn 0 11 0 in the case of ec and ec cp brucite mg oh 2 is the main species observed during the xrd analysis however calcite caco3 is also present after ec cp mainly because of the use of cacl2 for producing the synergistic effect sem analysis reveals that sludges from ec cp and ec cp are innocuous they do not present heavy metals and only al is present in low or trace concentrations mg released during ec give alkalinity to the sludge which could be effective in the case of a possible use in agriculture in addition it could be used in a landfill for the compaction of urban solid wastes 4 conclusions the effects of cp ec and synergistic continuous ec cp treatments on textile wastewater were evaluated for cp treatment mgcl2 cacl2 and mgso4 were used as chemical coagulants cacl2 was determined as the optimal reaching removal efficiencies of up to 77 for cod 76 for color and 77 for turbidity at a final ph of 7 2 ec batch treatment using mgfe anode and cathode respectively was efficient for textile wastewater treatment with optimal conditions of 29 min and a current density of 144 7 a m2 at an initial and final ph of 4 5 and 10 7 respectively removal efficiencies of 92 99 for cod 88 58 for color and 92 72 for turbidity were achieved with an operating cost of 1 82 us m3 for the synergistic continuous ec cp treatment with mgfe electrodes 2 mg ml cacl2 was pre dosed at the optimal conditions of 1 2 a current density of 101 52 a m2 starting ph of 4 5 final ph of 10 4 and hrt of 40 min in the continuous mode 18 9 ml min removal efficiencies of 91 for cod 93 for color and 94 for turbidity were achieved with an operating cost of 0 25 us m3 the most influential factor for ec and ec cp was current density followed by hrt cacl2 was used as a bifunctional support for the electrolyte precipitating agent in the combined ec cp process future perspectives include large scale applications of this process on textile washing

12632,2 ethylhexanol unit from a petrochemical complex has a very pollutant wastewater in terms of cod which most of available techniques cannot treat it according to the previous researches on this type of wastewater electro fenton as an effective technique was chosen since this process appropriately performs in the acidic conditions and this is a problem for several industries a core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst was synthesized and applied to neutralize the operating ph several technical tests on the catalyst quality were successfully carried out design expert software and anova method were then used to design the electro fenton experiments and investigate the optimal conditions the optimal conditions were found at ph of 6 98 reaction time of 59 22 min current density of 51 34 ma cm2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio of 2 84 volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater of 1 19 ml l and nanocatalyst dosage of 1 76 g for 93 87 of cod removal keywords bentonite base effluent heavy alcohol heterogeneous electro fenton statistical analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction petrochemical effluents are containing multiple pollutants with high chemical oxygen demand cod amounts 1 one of these comes from 2 ethylhexanol 2eh unit 2eh as an oxo alcohol has chemical formula of c8h18o its production consumes high energy and produces a large volume of alkaline wastewater 2eh is produced during the aldolizaion process of n butyraldehyde to produce 2 ethyl hexenal with sodium butyrate octene aldehyde few other aldehydes and organic sodium acid however some of these are biodegradable but the biological degradation process normally needs high oxygen amounts 2 3 therefore a pre treatment is encouraged to reduce cod amount of a highly contaminated wastewater there are some appropriate treatment methods such as oxidation acid treatment and extraction during sodium butyrate and octane aldehyde recovery in effluents consequently advanced and modern strategies development for treating the resistant high concentration wastewaters is strongly requested 4 5 advanced oxidation processes aops have recently been noticed by several applicants due to producing hydroxyl radicals which make them more efficient safe and biocompatible 6 according to a lot of recommendations electro fenton as an aop was chosen 1 in this process ionized forms of iron as catalyst accelerate fenton reactions with hydrogen peroxide and increase the production rate of hydroxyl radicals oh hydroperoxide ho2 or superoxide radical o2 in fact hydroxyl radical as a strong oxidant is used to destroy compounds that are not completely oxidized by the conventional oxidants such as oxygen ozone and chlorine 7 8 the produced hydroxyl radical is a very strong oxidizing agent that can eventually convert the contaminants to non toxic minerals and become harmless compounds water and carbon dioxide 9 10 homogeneous electro fenton process usually performs under the acidic conditions ph 3 with free ion catalyst fe2 11 heterogeneous catalysts can usually be used under high phs so it is not necessary to increase ph of acidic wastewaters in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts to neutralize them 12 13 a solid should have several properties to use as a catalyst 14 in addition the optimal structure of a catalyst should have high activity and selectivity to produce hydroxyl radicals high specific surface area homogeneity and porous structure there are two types of catalysts involving natural and synthetic ones which can properly pass the mentioned properties 15 16 since iron compounds traditionally catalyze the fenton process a heterogeneous catalyst based on them may dramatically be used due to neutralizing the operating ph clay and iron oxide as catalyst was proposed to treat industrial effluents during the fenton reactions 17 furthermore nanoparticles are more efficient than the conventional heterogeneous catalysts due to having large surface area and low diffusion resistance 18 19 the nanocatalysts have low diffusion resistance and are readily available to substrate surface molecules 20 in a heterogeneous catalysis iron nanoparticles are stabilized in the catalyst structure and can effectively produce hydroxyl radical from the peroxide hydrogen decomposition without iron hydroxide precipitation the catalyst can easily be recovered after the reaction and remain active after multiple uses the catalyst stability furthers heterogeneous fenton reactions over a wide range of phs even at neutral one 21 22 few studies concentrated on the heterogeneous electro fenton associated with cheap and abundant catalysts with proper stability and capability in the industrial applications 16 17 23 clay as a catalyst in heterogeneous reactions has been encouraged because it is abundant inexpensive chemically stable biocompatible structural stable during treatment high swelling and surface area and high cation exchange capacity 24 furthermore iron derivatives could stimulate the fenton reactions produce radical oxidants and break down pollutants 25 clay and its oxides could act both as catalyst and support for iron and the other metal species in the heterogeneous fenton reaction intermediate metals such as iron copper and etc are strongly bounded to exchange sites in the pore structure moreover they are not susceptible for leaching or and fouling during the process 26 bentonite is from clay family in a mineral form and smectite group and is composed of montmorillonite with a special layered structure the single layer of montmorillonite has enough space to support the nanoparticles and prevents accumulation 27 28 furthermore bentonite has an open porous structure which can accommodate a wide range of interchangeable cations such as iron ones therefore bentonite can act as both selective adsorbent and oxidation catalyst so it has been nominated to use in the fenton based processes 29 30 fe fe2o3 core shell nanoparticles are a type of zero valent iron nanoparticles which may show unique performance in the electro fenton process this will produce oxygen superoxide radicals through the activation of one electron and two electron molecular oxygen this will accelerate the conversion cycle of fe iii fe ii eventually hydroxyl radicals will be produced this increases active oxygen amount which will modify the electro fenton process and increase the operating ph up to the neutral one so this not only improves the ph range of electro fenton process but also avoids the dissolution of fe fe2o3 nanoparticles in an acidic solution in fact fe2o3 nanoparticles are coated during fe fe2o3 core shell nanoparticles preparation this will prevent their combustion in atmosphere and simplify their storage and transportation moreover it will assist the super oxygen radicals production therefore the rate of hydroxyl radicals production will increase up to 3 fold the combination of electro fenton with iron nanoparticles has been encouraged compared with the other iron structures such as α feooh α fe2o3 feocl zero valent iron powder fe0 ferrous fe2 and ferric ions fe3 applied by some researchers 9 11 19 22 31 2eh unit from some petrochemical companies produces a very pollutant wastewater which is a serious problem for environment since iran is a hub of petrochemical products this type of wastewater production is inevitable according to these companies reports and literature there is no an efficient technique for treating this type of wastewater since electro fenton technique traditional one without a catalyst as an efficient process was suggested for treating dangerous wastewaters with bod cod 1 and 2eh unit wastewater bod cod ratio 37 875 mg l 54 550 mg l was around 0 7 this technique was chosen in this research 32 according to the recent publication this technique properly works in the acidic phs which are not favorite of most of industries due to having high risk furthermore heterogeneous catalysts could neutralize the operating ph 18 so the electro fenton technique associated with a suitable catalyst iron one was selected to treat this wastewater 33 although some researchers focused on bentonite as a catalyst natural base but their nanocomposites were different with the current research however those catalysts often were uneconomic ones due to their expensive materials and synthesis techniques from an industrial point of view but they have been applied for treating some color wastewaters through the fenton like process 29 30 since fe fe2o3 core shell nanoparticles as an iron composite have some suitable properties such as strength and reusability they were supported on bentonite base as a natural one to make a novel heterogeneous catalyst in the electro fenton process then electro fenton technique was applied to treat a super pollutant based on cod and resistant wastewater obtained from the 2eh unit in fact a bentonite based iron catalyst was used to improve the operating conditions such as ph design expert software doe is applied to design and minimize the experiments and investigate the optimal conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium borohydride nabh4 was purchased from daejung co with purity 99 iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o bentonite ethanol with purity 99 8 and sulfuric acid with purity 97 were supplied by merck co the other reagents were found in the analytical grade 2 2 experiment design since the independent variables should be in the suitable ranges for preventing probable errors by software 34 they carefully found from the literature furthermore temperature effluent volume mixer speed electrodes distance and cross section of electrodes were respectively fixed at 25 0 5 c 250 ml 400 rpm 3 cm and 1 cm2 during the electro fenton process 33 34 design expert software version 13 was used to design model and optimize the process under response surface methodology rsm and box behnken sub tool the selected design factors involving reaction time min current density ma cm2 ph volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater ml l h2o2 fe2 molar ratio and nanocatalyst dosage were together converted into variables x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 in order to compare dimensionless variables and reduce the polynomial error table 1 shows low 1 center 0 and top 1 values of each variable according to the box behnken design 32 2 3 preparation of core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst according to several advantages bentonite was chosen as catalyst base and iron nanoparticles were deposited on it the nanocatalyst was produced by reducing sodium borohydride in iron bentonite mass ratio was at 1 20 1 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in water ethanol mixture 1 3 v v then 20 g of bentonite was added to the solution and put in an ultrasonic for 30 min sodium borohydride solution was also prepared by dissolving 2 g of nabh4 in 80 ml of distilled water sodium borohydride solution was drop wise added to the bentonite iron solution then the solution temperature rose to 100 c under stirring 200 rpm without any vortex and the solvent was completely evaporated the residual solid was washed 3 times with ethanol and dried at an oven with temperature of 50 c for 8 h the solid was heated at 500 c for 2 h to stabilize and calcinate the catalyst 11 32 35 36 finally several tests such as fesem edx xrd xrf and ftir were carried out 2 4 experimental procedure a 400 ml beaker as a reactor was used to perform the electro fenton process the solution ph was measured by a calibrated ph meter mettler toledo 320 digital and adjusted by sulfuric acid for each run a direct current power supply with variable voltages harris power supply model 202 20 v 5 a and a pair of stainless steel electrodes with a fixed distance of 3 cm and cross section of 1cm2 was used 1 feso4 7h2o amount was also measured to determine fe2 mole then it was poured into the reactor with an appropriate amount of iron bentonite nanocatalyst and the mixer was immediately switched on and adjusted to a constant speed of 400 rpm without any vortex the desired density was adjusted according to each run operating conditions and the reaction time was measured after the reaction the sample was allowed to settle for 30 min then each sample was analyzed in terms of cod using a cod meter aqualytic al 100 and its removal was found by 11 1 removal ci cf ci where ci and cf are the response variables cod concentrations before and after treatment respectively 2 5 characterization methods the size and morphology of the synthesized catalyst was surveyed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem apparatus mira3 tescan czechia the specific surface area was calculated according to the brunauere emmette teller bet method belsorp mimi ii japan the crystal structure was considered by x ray diffraction xrd philips x pert pw3040 60 cr lamp 2 289 angstrom using a cr radiation ranging from 10 2th to 100 2th the ftir analysis was carried out to scan samples and identify chemical compounds and functional groups xrf x ray fluorescence analytical technique was used to determine the elemental composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization 3 1 1 fesem edx the catalyst morphology shape size and particles arrangement during its preparation nanoparticles formation on the bentonite surface is shown in fig 1 however raw bentonite initially had a layered structure but it got a lot of micro and nanometer porosity during the iron nanoparticles formation on the bentonite they have uniformly been distributed with a regular shape and size of 50 70 nm 30 33 fig 2 shows edx images during entering iron nanoparticles into the catalyst edx analysis shows the chemical composition of bentonite surface and fe ca na o si mg k and al elements in it this shows that the bentonite is sodium type because its na amount 5 82 w is higher than ca amount 0 96 w 3 1 2 xrf analysis according to fig 3 xrf identifies various elements during the catalyst preparation iron element increased during the catalyst synthesis this indicates iron nanoparticles inclusion in the bentonite since iron amount in the catalyst has changed around 0 4 w with edx and xrf images comparison this confirms that iron nanoparticles have homogeneously been distributed inside the bentonite 3 1 3 bet analysis fig 4 and result in table 2 shows bet analysis which is in terms of nanocatalyst specific surface area during the nanocatalyst preparation in fact the special level increased from 2 44 to 31 73 m2g 1 the average size of holes decreased from 32 23 to 12 08 nm furthermore the adsorption isotherm changed from type iii in raw bentonite to type vi 36 37 this indicates the capillary density in the mesopores structure at the relative pressure range of 0 45 0 90 p p0 the adsorption isotherms gradually rose during the relative pressure range of 0 0 4 this indicates monolayer adsorption then the adsorption curves continuously rose and monolayer adsorption increased this leads to the molecular multilayer adsorption the desorption graph is on the top of adsorption one when the relative pressure is between 0 4 and 0 9 p p0 this leads to the hysteresis the adsorption and desorption graphs suddenly rose and finally coincided at the relative pressure of 0 9 1 p p0 this indicates many mesopores formation some macro holes d 50 nm and few micro holes d 2 nm are observed in pressures 0 4 and higher than 0 9 the hysteresis loop of raw bentonite is a combination of h3 and h4 which are wedge shaped and slit shaped pores this is due to the layered nature of bentonite plates the reason of adsorption hysteresis combination may be due to various compositions of clay smectites have h4 type hysteresis while illites kaolinites and chlorites have h3 type hysteresis therefore the abundance of each can determine the predominant adsorption hysteresis in bentonite in fact the adsorption hysteresis becomes a combination of h4 and h1 type during the catalyst preparation and new cylindrical pores are created and the layered structure of raw bentonite changes 38 39 3 1 4 ftir analysis fig 5 shows ftir analysis with a wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 to identify the functional groups the peak at 466 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibrations of si o si bonds while the peak at 524 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibrations of al o si bonds the peak at 793 cm 1 is related to quartz this is confirmed by x ray diffraction the peak at 919 cm 1 corresponds to the al al o bond while the peak in the region of 1035 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the si o si bond the peaks at 2928 and 2856 cm 1 indicate the presence of organic impurities the peaks at 1638 and 3446 cm 1 can be attributed to bending and stretching vibrations and water molecules adsorbed on the bentonite surface respectively the peak at 3626 cm 1 is attributed to the hydroxyl groups of octahedral bentonite sheets although the peaks at 3626 and 3446 cm 1 are related to the oh bond from h2o in the bentonite structure in various forms of bonded water surface water and water in the crystal network 40 41 it is clear that the related peaks to water have almost disappeared after the catalyst preparation at high temperature this indicates water removal from the bentonite structure due to heating 3 1 5 xrd analysis fig 6 shows x ray diffraction patterns of the raw bentonit and prepared nanocatalyst in the both montmorillonite phase 2θ 19 88 d 4 49 2θ 29 41 d 3 03 2θ 17 74 d 4 99

statistical analysis design expert software version 13 was applied to minimize number of experiments fifty four experiments with their set of operating conditions were designed and performed the relation between independent variables and response data was obtained through the factorial design a correlation for cod removal as a response based on the coded independent variables was investigated

to table 3 a high amount of f value 30 29 implies that the model is significant a low amount of p value 0 0500 indicates that the model terms are significant while the values 0 1000 indicate that the

agreement between the actual and predicted data fig 8 shows normal probability plot according to this figure the points response data will lie along a straight line if the residuals follow a normal distribution moreover the reliability of the model is evaluated with the observed residuals difference between the observed and predicted response data according to fig 9 a normal distribution is expected 11 44 3 3 various variables effects on the electro fenton process cod removal 3 3 1 ph effect the effect of ph on degradation of various pollutants has been investigated in the range of 2 8 6 according to the literature on the traditional electro fenton effect of ph in the acidic range is more than that of it in the alkaline range its reason is due to hydrogen peroxide stability in the acidic phs in fact ph affects the type of produced iron ions ferric or ferrous and thus plays an important role in the iron catalytic activity and hydrogen peroxide decomposition 5 9 15 maximum removal of an organic pollutant such as cod has been investigated at ph of 3 7 8 10 19 23 although the traditional electro fenton as an efficient technique has been recommended for treating high cod wastewaters but it has not been encouraged by most of industries due to having high risks at low phs such as ph 3 moreover cod removal will decrease at alkaline conditions this is due to iron hydroxide complex formation which limits the catalytic activity hydrogen peroxide molecules decompose into water and oxygen as well this will decrease active oxidant species furthermore iron ions hydrolysis causes formation of iron hydroxides deposited on the nanocatalyst surface in fact iron hydroxides precipitation on the nanocatalyst can prevent the regeneration of iron ions and thus the hydroxyl radicals production for the subsequent oxidation 7 15 20 in fact ph has an important role in the electro fenton process because it is responsible for the formation of hydroxyl radicals iron nanoparticles as an iron reagent can increase ph range and prevent the iron ions coagulation in the fenton system 11 therefore combination of electro fenton with a metal oxide heterogeneous nanocatalyst may provide a suitable condition neutral ph 12 14 16 18 according to fig 10 a e the cod removal was low at the acidic phs while it increased at the basic ones the maximum cod removal was found at ph of 7 in fig 10 a ph and molar ratio could mutually affect the cod removal this means that the cod removal would be at maximum if both ph and molar ratio were at maximum values as shown in fig 10 b the maximum cod removal occurred at middle values of both ph and volume ratio according to fig 10 c the cod removal would be at maximum when ph and reaction time mutually were at maximum values as shown in fig 10 d the maximum cod removal was observed at highest ph and middle value of current density fig 10 e shows maximum cod removal would be at maximum values of both ph and current density fig 11 shows the core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalytic mechanism during the electro fenton process the nanoparticles with preventing the complete leaching of iron ions formed on the nanocatalyst surface control iron release into the wastewater 17 19 in fact iron nanoparticles can produce o2 superoxide radicals in phs of 4 8 by reducing one electron of an oxygen molecule furthermore the superoxide radicals with zero valent iron improve the fe iii fe ii production cycle due to existing more active sites this continuously supplies iron ions for hydrogen peroxide decomposition and hydroxyl radicals production this will destroy organic pollutants of wastewaters 21 22 fe fe2o3 nanoparticles may activate two electron molecular oxygen to produce h2o2 through electron transfer from iron core to the surface of iron oxide shell moreover one electron molecular oxygen activation will produce o2 superoxide radicals by fe2 ions attached on the iron oxide shell surface 19 24 h2o2 and o2 superoxide production through molecular oxygen activation by fe fe2o3 nanoparticles increases the reactive oxygen species ross amount in fact this accelerates the fe iii fe ii cycle in high phs ph 4 the rate constant for the reaction of o2 superoxide with fe iii is 10 times larger than that of it for h2o2 and fe iii therefore fe iii with h2o2 reaction can be neglected moreover o2 superoxide production significantly inhibits insoluble iron products 11 19 24 26 32 36 eqs 3 10 show this process in detail the most critical step normally is production rate of oh from h2o2 in this process in the catalytic one solid catalyst properties control h2o2 generation and consequently the solution ph so the haber weiss circle mechanism can properly be fitted on it 9 19 3 fe

organic pollutants by products co 2 h 2 o 3 3 2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio and volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater as shown in fig 12 a c an increase in the volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater led to h2o2 fe2 molar ratio enhancement because reactor content initially was constant furthermore the cod removal increased up to optimal point 3 16 and then decreased its reason is due to wasting the reactive substances and reducing the wastewater cod fig 12 a and b show that the volume ratio reaction time and current density mutually affect the cod removal this means that the cod removal would be at maximum when those variables were at their middle values although maximum dosage of nanocatalyst would also increase the cod removal to maximum value according to fig 12 d g cod removal would be at low values when h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was at low value because hydroxyl radicals were not enough vice versa trend can be observed up to the optimal point 1 39 as well since the fenton reaction normally is a first order one reactants concentration increment would lead to reaction rate enhancement 19 as shown in fig 12 d the highest value of cod removal would occur at the middle values of volume ratio and molar ratio fig 12 e shows mutual effect of reaction time and molar ratio which led to the maximum cod removal fig 12 f shows that the cod removal would be at optimal point when current density and molar ratio respectively were at middle and maximum values fig 12 g shows that the highest cod removal took place at maximum nanocatalyst dosage and middle molar ratio values furthermore the nanocatalyst increment sharply affects the cod removal as seen in these figures the slope of volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater graph is sharper than the h2o2 fe2 molar ratio graph this indicates that the amount of hydrogen peroxide has more impact than the amount of iron salt 10 16 3 3 3 time effect according to fig 12 h i reaction time had a positive effect on the electro fenton process although its effect decreased after the optimal value of time fig 12 h shows that the highest cod removal occurred at maximum value of current density and middle value of reaction time fig 12 i shows that the maximum cod removal would be at maximum values of nanocatalyst dosage and reaction time in fact the reactants in the reaction medium will decrease over time and the rate of pollutant cod removal decreased 15 moreover time increment had no considerable effect on the cod removal in low h2o2 fe2 molar ratio and volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater as shown in fig 12 a and e time enhancement would affect cod removal when the reactants hydroxyl radicals production to be enough while an increment in h2o2 fe2 molar ratio or volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater without increasing reaction time had no considerable effect on the cod removal since the reactor content will decrease over time some other factors such as nanocatalyst dosage and effluent concentration may affect the cod removal 7 9 3 3 4 current density effect electrical current is one of the main parameters in the electro fenton process and especially in the electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production process figs 10 d and 12 b f j and h show the effect of the current density on the cod removal the cod removal increased up to the optimal point 56 37 ma and then decreased with the current density increment as shown in these figures the cod removal increased with intensifying the electrical current and consequently increasing the electrical potential difference an increase in the current intensity led to an increase in the production of ferrous ions and eventually hydroxyl radicals in fact this will amplify the electro fenton process 15 22 fig 12 j shows the mutual effect of current density and nanocatalyst dosage on the cod removal maximum cod removal occurred at middle value of current density and maximum value of nanocatalyst dosage the production rate of hydrogen peroxide on the cathode and in the electrolyte increased when the current density increased in fact oxidized metal amount would increase this led to the hydroxide clots coagulation and an organic pollutant cod removal increment on the other hand more and smaller bubbles which have bigger effective surfaces with longer retention times would be produced with the current density enhancement they could effectively remove the organic pollutants such as cod 11 45 46 in fact the current density increment would assist hydroxyl radicals preparation and fe2 cations production from fe3 cations on the anode and cathode surfaces respectively these would increase the chain reaction and continuous conversion of fe3 cations to fe2 cations through the electro fenton process 1 further increase in the current density would lead to the series of competitive electrode reactions such as oxygen evolution and hydrogen formation on the anode and cathode electrodes respectively these reactions will prevent the main fenton reactions 6 26 moreover the cell potential would increase with the current density excessive increment this would cause hydrogen peroxide destruction on the anode and heat the solution high temperature may drop the cod removal 47 48 3 3 5 nanocatalyst dosage effect as shown in figs 10 e and 12 c g i and j one of the effective parameters on the heterogeneous electro fenton process is the initial amount of nanocatalyst the cod removal would increase with increasing the nanocatalyst dosage up to the optimal point 2 g the cod removal would decrease with further increasing in the nanocatalyst dosage after the optimal point this may be due to the nanoparticles activity reduction 9 21 moreover available effective surfaces which the reactions were done on them increased with increasing the nanocatalyst dosage however the cod removal initially increased but it would decrease due to increasing the produced hydroxyl radicals which unintentionally reacted with fe2 cations scavenger reactions 12 14 22 3 4 optimization process the optimum operation conditions were statistically found through the doe software with maximizing the cod removal and then validated by an experiment under the same operation conditions according to table 4 the cod removal percentage was currently obtained at 93 87 at a neural ph while it was traditionally without a catalyst found at 81 70 at an acidic ph the nanocatalyst could modify the operating conditions and improve the cod removal percentage around 12 it seems that the applied nanocatalyst was able to optimally produce hydroxyl radicals which increased the cod removal 11 14 16 17 reduction in the other operation conditions except ph could economically encourage industries to scale up the mentioned conditions 3 5 nanocatalyst reusability and stability reusability is an important way to evaluate the properties of synthesized nanocatalyst so the reusability and stability of core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst was investigated by the cod removal determination under the optimal conditions by five consecutive tests according to table 5 the cod removal percentage still was around 80 after five continues uses the good stability is probably attributed to the strong interfacial interaction between the nanoparticles and the bentonite structure this would limit the dissolution and aggregation of nanoparticles in the wastewater and thus save their activity and stability 26 3 6 economic analysis energy cost can change because it strongly depends on the type of wastewater treatment technique operating variables and design of the electrochemical reactor it would usually be around 45 of the total operating cost the operating cost based on the removal of cod mass unit kg from wastewater volume unit m3 can be calculated as 49 11 operating cost m 3 kg cod removal acc bemc ceec other costs where cc is the chemical consumption kg m 3 kg 1 cod removal emc is the electrode material consumption kg m 3 kg 1 cod removal and eec is the electrical energy consumption kwh m 3 kg 1 cod removal a b and c are the costs of chemicals kg 1 electrode material kg 1 and electrical energy kwh 1 respectively where eec can be calculated as 12 eec kwh g toc cod i t u v c where u i t v and c are voltage v electrical current a electrolysis time h volume of wastewater l and cod or toc removal mg l since electricity price electrical energy consumption cost of eec total cost of eec kg removed cod electrode replacing chemicals and other operational costs respectively were around 0 0039 kwh 120 kwh m3 0 468 m3 of wastewater 0 0936 kg cod 0 17 0 40 and 0 10 m3 total cost was found at 1 138 m3 of wastewater in this research although mousset et al applied various advanced oxidation techniques to treat a phenolic wastewater but they found that the electro fenton technique was as a more economic one 50 however canizares et al applied three electrochemical ozone and fenton base techniques to treat various wastewaters but they economically proposed the fenton technique 51 he et al found that the electro fenton method consumed the lowest energy compared with the other electrochemical techniques 15 ghanbari and moradi treated a textile wastewater with electrocoagulation electrochemical electro fenton and peroxi coagulation methods they concluded that the electro fenton technique was as a more efficient and economic one due to having a shorter treating time 52 ismail et al suggested the heterogeneous catalytic electro fenton method compared with the other fenton base techniques because it had the lowest cost 53 4 conclusions in this study heterogeneous core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst was synthesized and used to improve the electro fenton process various tests such as fesem edx bet xrd ftir and xrf were applied to confirm that a proper synthesis was carried out very low sludge formation which is ignorable and o2 superoxide ions production improvement through iron ions adsorption on the fe fe2o3 shell were two fantastic advantages of this catalytic treatment process it was concluded that the use of nanocatalyst would improve the cod removal around 12 in a neutral environment compared with the traditional electro fenton without a heterogeneous catalyst in order to ensure reusability and stability of the synthetic nanocatalyst it used five times and its performance dropped only 15 the treatment process was also studied from an economic point of view it was found that the operating cost of the nanocatalytic electro fenton process was less than the traditional electro fenton and the other advanced oxidation methods therefore an economic treatment through a catalytic process was investigated

paper 
12632,2 ethylhexanol unit from a petrochemical complex has a very pollutant wastewater in terms of cod which most of available techniques cannot treat it according to the previous researches on this type of wastewater electro fenton as an effective technique was chosen since this process appropriately performs in the acidic conditions and this is a problem for several industries a core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst was synthesized and applied to neutralize the operating ph several technical tests on the catalyst quality were successfully carried out design expert software and anova method were then used to design the electro fenton experiments and investigate the optimal conditions the optimal conditions were found at ph of 6 98 reaction time of 59 22 min current density of 51 34 ma cm2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio of 2 84 volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater of 1 19 ml l and nanocatalyst dosage of 1 76 g for 93 87 of cod removal keywords bentonite base effluent heavy alcohol heterogeneous electro fenton statistical analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction petrochemical effluents are containing multiple pollutants with high chemical oxygen demand cod amounts 1 one of these comes from 2 ethylhexanol 2eh unit 2eh as an oxo alcohol has chemical formula of c8h18o its production consumes high energy and produces a large volume of alkaline wastewater 2eh is produced during the aldolizaion process of n butyraldehyde to produce 2 ethyl hexenal with sodium butyrate octene aldehyde few other aldehydes and organic sodium acid however some of these are biodegradable but the biological degradation process normally needs high oxygen amounts 2 3 therefore a pre treatment is encouraged to reduce cod amount of a highly contaminated wastewater there are some appropriate treatment methods such as oxidation acid treatment and extraction during sodium butyrate and octane aldehyde recovery in effluents consequently advanced and modern strategies development for treating the resistant high concentration wastewaters is strongly requested 4 5 advanced oxidation processes aops have recently been noticed by several applicants due to producing hydroxyl radicals which make them more efficient safe and biocompatible 6 according to a lot of recommendations electro fenton as an aop was chosen 1 in this process ionized forms of iron as catalyst accelerate fenton reactions with hydrogen peroxide and increase the production rate of hydroxyl radicals oh hydroperoxide ho2 or superoxide radical o2 in fact hydroxyl radical as a strong oxidant is used to destroy compounds that are not completely oxidized by the conventional oxidants such as oxygen ozone and chlorine 7 8 the produced hydroxyl radical is a very strong oxidizing agent that can eventually convert the contaminants to non toxic minerals and become harmless compounds water and carbon dioxide 9 10 homogeneous electro fenton process usually performs under the acidic conditions ph 3 with free ion catalyst fe2 11 heterogeneous catalysts can usually be used under high phs so it is not necessary to increase ph of acidic wastewaters in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts to neutralize them 12 13 a solid should have several properties to use as a catalyst 14 in addition the optimal structure of a catalyst should have high activity and selectivity to produce hydroxyl radicals high specific surface area homogeneity and porous structure there are two types of catalysts involving natural and synthetic ones which can properly pass the mentioned properties 15 16 since iron compounds traditionally catalyze the fenton process a heterogeneous catalyst based on them may dramatically be used due to neutralizing the operating ph clay and iron oxide as catalyst was proposed to treat industrial effluents during the fenton reactions 17 furthermore nanoparticles are more efficient than the conventional heterogeneous catalysts due to having large surface area and low diffusion resistance 18 19 the nanocatalysts have low diffusion resistance and are readily available to substrate surface molecules 20 in a heterogeneous catalysis iron nanoparticles are stabilized in the catalyst structure and can effectively produce hydroxyl radical from the peroxide hydrogen decomposition without iron hydroxide precipitation the catalyst can easily be recovered after the reaction and remain active after multiple uses the catalyst stability furthers heterogeneous fenton reactions over a wide range of phs even at neutral one 21 22 few studies concentrated on the heterogeneous electro fenton associated with cheap and abundant catalysts with proper stability and capability in the industrial applications 16 17 23 clay as a catalyst in heterogeneous reactions has been encouraged because it is abundant inexpensive chemically stable biocompatible structural stable during treatment high swelling and surface area and high cation exchange capacity 24 furthermore iron derivatives could stimulate the fenton reactions produce radical oxidants and break down pollutants 25 clay and its oxides could act both as catalyst and support for iron and the other metal species in the heterogeneous fenton reaction intermediate metals such as iron copper and etc are strongly bounded to exchange sites in the pore structure moreover they are not susceptible for leaching or and fouling during the process 26 bentonite is from clay family in a mineral form and smectite group and is composed of montmorillonite with a special layered structure the single layer of montmorillonite has enough space to support the nanoparticles and prevents accumulation 27 28 furthermore bentonite has an open porous structure which can accommodate a wide range of interchangeable cations such as iron ones therefore bentonite can act as both selective adsorbent and oxidation catalyst so it has been nominated to use in the fenton based processes 29 30 fe fe2o3 core shell nanoparticles are a type of zero valent iron nanoparticles which may show unique performance in the electro fenton process this will produce oxygen superoxide radicals through the activation of one electron and two electron molecular oxygen this will accelerate the conversion cycle of fe iii fe ii eventually hydroxyl radicals will be produced this increases active oxygen amount which will modify the electro fenton process and increase the operating ph up to the neutral one so this not only improves the ph range of electro fenton process but also avoids the dissolution of fe fe2o3 nanoparticles in an acidic solution in fact fe2o3 nanoparticles are coated during fe fe2o3 core shell nanoparticles preparation this will prevent their combustion in atmosphere and simplify their storage and transportation moreover it will assist the super oxygen radicals production therefore the rate of hydroxyl radicals production will increase up to 3 fold the combination of electro fenton with iron nanoparticles has been encouraged compared with the other iron structures such as α feooh α fe2o3 feocl zero valent iron powder fe0 ferrous fe2 and ferric ions fe3 applied by some researchers 9 11 19 22 31 2eh unit from some petrochemical companies produces a very pollutant wastewater which is a serious problem for environment since iran is a hub of petrochemical products this type of wastewater production is inevitable according to these companies reports and literature there is no an efficient technique for treating this type of wastewater since electro fenton technique traditional one without a catalyst as an efficient process was suggested for treating dangerous wastewaters with bod cod 1 and 2eh unit wastewater bod cod ratio 37 875 mg l 54 550 mg l was around 0 7 this technique was chosen in this research 32 according to the recent publication this technique properly works in the acidic phs which are not favorite of most of industries due to having high risk furthermore heterogeneous catalysts could neutralize the operating ph 18 so the electro fenton technique associated with a suitable catalyst iron one was selected to treat this wastewater 33 although some researchers focused on bentonite as a catalyst natural base but their nanocomposites were different with the current research however those catalysts often were uneconomic ones due to their expensive materials and synthesis techniques from an industrial point of view but they have been applied for treating some color wastewaters through the fenton like process 29 30 since fe fe2o3 core shell nanoparticles as an iron composite have some suitable properties such as strength and reusability they were supported on bentonite base as a natural one to make a novel heterogeneous catalyst in the electro fenton process then electro fenton technique was applied to treat a super pollutant based on cod and resistant wastewater obtained from the 2eh unit in fact a bentonite based iron catalyst was used to improve the operating conditions such as ph design expert software doe is applied to design and minimize the experiments and investigate the optimal conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium borohydride nabh4 was purchased from daejung co with purity 99 iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o bentonite ethanol with purity 99 8 and sulfuric acid with purity 97 were supplied by merck co the other reagents were found in the analytical grade 2 2 experiment design since the independent variables should be in the suitable ranges for preventing probable errors by software 34 they carefully found from the literature furthermore temperature effluent volume mixer speed electrodes distance and cross section of electrodes were respectively fixed at 25 0 5 c 250 ml 400 rpm 3 cm and 1 cm2 during the electro fenton process 33 34 design expert software version 13 was used to design model and optimize the process under response surface methodology rsm and box behnken sub tool the selected design factors involving reaction time min current density ma cm2 ph volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater ml l h2o2 fe2 molar ratio and nanocatalyst dosage were together converted into variables x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 in order to compare dimensionless variables and reduce the polynomial error table 1 shows low 1 center 0 and top 1 values of each variable according to the box behnken design 32 2 3 preparation of core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst according to several advantages bentonite was chosen as catalyst base and iron nanoparticles were deposited on it the nanocatalyst was produced by reducing sodium borohydride in iron bentonite mass ratio was at 1 20 1 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in water ethanol mixture 1 3 v v then 20 g of bentonite was added to the solution and put in an ultrasonic for 30 min sodium borohydride solution was also prepared by dissolving 2 g of nabh4 in 80 ml of distilled water sodium borohydride solution was drop wise added to the bentonite iron solution then the solution temperature rose to 100 c under stirring 200 rpm without any vortex and the solvent was completely evaporated the residual solid was washed 3 times with ethanol and dried at an oven with temperature of 50 c for 8 h the solid was heated at 500 c for 2 h to stabilize and calcinate the catalyst 11 32 35 36 finally several tests such as fesem edx xrd xrf and ftir were carried out 2 4 experimental procedure a 400 ml beaker as a reactor was used to perform the electro fenton process the solution ph was measured by a calibrated ph meter mettler toledo 320 digital and adjusted by sulfuric acid for each run a direct current power supply with variable voltages harris power supply model 202 20 v 5 a and a pair of stainless steel electrodes with a fixed distance of 3 cm and cross section of 1cm2 was used 1 feso4 7h2o amount was also measured to determine fe2 mole then it was poured into the reactor with an appropriate amount of iron bentonite nanocatalyst and the mixer was immediately switched on and adjusted to a constant speed of 400 rpm without any vortex the desired density was adjusted according to each run operating conditions and the reaction time was measured after the reaction the sample was allowed to settle for 30 min then each sample was analyzed in terms of cod using a cod meter aqualytic al 100 and its removal was found by 11 1 removal ci cf ci where ci and cf are the response variables cod concentrations before and after treatment respectively 2 5 characterization methods the size and morphology of the synthesized catalyst was surveyed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem apparatus mira3 tescan czechia the specific surface area was calculated according to the brunauere emmette teller bet method belsorp mimi ii japan the crystal structure was considered by x ray diffraction xrd philips x pert pw3040 60 cr lamp 2 289 angstrom using a cr radiation ranging from 10 2th to 100 2th the ftir analysis was carried out to scan samples and identify chemical compounds and functional groups xrf x ray fluorescence analytical technique was used to determine the elemental composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization 3 1 1 fesem edx the catalyst morphology shape size and particles arrangement during its preparation nanoparticles formation on the bentonite surface is shown in fig 1 however raw bentonite initially had a layered structure but it got a lot of micro and nanometer porosity during the iron nanoparticles formation on the bentonite they have uniformly been distributed with a regular shape and size of 50 70 nm 30 33 fig 2 shows edx images during entering iron nanoparticles into the catalyst edx analysis shows the chemical composition of bentonite surface and fe ca na o si mg k and al elements in it this shows that the bentonite is sodium type because its na amount 5 82 w is higher than ca amount 0 96 w 3 1 2 xrf analysis according to fig 3 xrf identifies various elements during the catalyst preparation iron element increased during the catalyst synthesis this indicates iron nanoparticles inclusion in the bentonite since iron amount in the catalyst has changed around 0 4 w with edx and xrf images comparison this confirms that iron nanoparticles have homogeneously been distributed inside the bentonite 3 1 3 bet analysis fig 4 and result in table 2 shows bet analysis which is in terms of nanocatalyst specific surface area during the nanocatalyst preparation in fact the special level increased from 2 44 to 31 73 m2g 1 the average size of holes decreased from 32 23 to 12 08 nm furthermore the adsorption isotherm changed from type iii in raw bentonite to type vi 36 37 this indicates the capillary density in the mesopores structure at the relative pressure range of 0 45 0 90 p p0 the adsorption isotherms gradually rose during the relative pressure range of 0 0 4 this indicates monolayer adsorption then the adsorption curves continuously rose and monolayer adsorption increased this leads to the molecular multilayer adsorption the desorption graph is on the top of adsorption one when the relative pressure is between 0 4 and 0 9 p p0 this leads to the hysteresis the adsorption and desorption graphs suddenly rose and finally coincided at the relative pressure of 0 9 1 p p0 this indicates many mesopores formation some macro holes d 50 nm and few micro holes d 2 nm are observed in pressures 0 4 and higher than 0 9 the hysteresis loop of raw bentonite is a combination of h3 and h4 which are wedge shaped and slit shaped pores this is due to the layered nature of bentonite plates the reason of adsorption hysteresis combination may be due to various compositions of clay smectites have h4 type hysteresis while illites kaolinites and chlorites have h3 type hysteresis therefore the abundance of each can determine the predominant adsorption hysteresis in bentonite in fact the adsorption hysteresis becomes a combination of h4 and h1 type during the catalyst preparation and new cylindrical pores are created and the layered structure of raw bentonite changes 38 39 3 1 4 ftir analysis fig 5 shows ftir analysis with a wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 to identify the functional groups the peak at 466 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibrations of si o si bonds while the peak at 524 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibrations of al o si bonds the peak at 793 cm 1 is related to quartz this is confirmed by x ray diffraction the peak at 919 cm 1 corresponds to the al al o bond while the peak in the region of 1035 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the si o si bond the peaks at 2928 and 2856 cm 1 indicate the presence of organic impurities the peaks at 1638 and 3446 cm 1 can be attributed to bending and stretching vibrations and water molecules adsorbed on the bentonite surface respectively the peak at 3626 cm 1 is attributed to the hydroxyl groups of octahedral bentonite sheets although the peaks at 3626 and 3446 cm 1 are related to the oh bond from h2o in the bentonite structure in various forms of bonded water surface water and water in the crystal network 40 41 it is clear that the related peaks to water have almost disappeared after the catalyst preparation at high temperature this indicates water removal from the bentonite structure due to heating 3 1 5 xrd analysis fig 6 shows x ray diffraction patterns of the raw bentonit and prepared nanocatalyst in the both montmorillonite phase 2θ 19 88 d 4 49 2θ 29 41 d 3 03 2θ 17 74 d 4 99

statistical analysis design expert software version 13 was applied to minimize number of experiments fifty four experiments with their set of operating conditions were designed and performed the relation between independent variables and response data was obtained through the factorial design a correlation for cod removal as a response based on the coded independent variables was investigated

to table 3 a high amount of f value 30 29 implies that the model is significant a low amount of p value 0 0500 indicates that the model terms are significant while the values 0 1000 indicate that the

agreement between the actual and predicted data fig 8 shows normal probability plot according to this figure the points response data will lie along a straight line if the residuals follow a normal distribution moreover the reliability of the model is evaluated with the observed residuals difference between the observed and predicted response data according to fig 9 a normal distribution is expected 11 44 3 3 various variables effects on the electro fenton process cod removal 3 3 1 ph effect the effect of ph on degradation of various pollutants has been investigated in the range of 2 8 6 according to the literature on the traditional electro fenton effect of ph in the acidic range is more than that of it in the alkaline range its reason is due to hydrogen peroxide stability in the acidic phs in fact ph affects the type of produced iron ions ferric or ferrous and thus plays an important role in the iron catalytic activity and hydrogen peroxide decomposition 5 9 15 maximum removal of an organic pollutant such as cod has been investigated at ph of 3 7 8 10 19 23 although the traditional electro fenton as an efficient technique has been recommended for treating high cod wastewaters but it has not been encouraged by most of industries due to having high risks at low phs such as ph 3 moreover cod removal will decrease at alkaline conditions this is due to iron hydroxide complex formation which limits the catalytic activity hydrogen peroxide molecules decompose into water and oxygen as well this will decrease active oxidant species furthermore iron ions hydrolysis causes formation of iron hydroxides deposited on the nanocatalyst surface in fact iron hydroxides precipitation on the nanocatalyst can prevent the regeneration of iron ions and thus the hydroxyl radicals production for the subsequent oxidation 7 15 20 in fact ph has an important role in the electro fenton process because it is responsible for the formation of hydroxyl radicals iron nanoparticles as an iron reagent can increase ph range and prevent the iron ions coagulation in the fenton system 11 therefore combination of electro fenton with a metal oxide heterogeneous nanocatalyst may provide a suitable condition neutral ph 12 14 16 18 according to fig 10 a e the cod removal was low at the acidic phs while it increased at the basic ones the maximum cod removal was found at ph of 7 in fig 10 a ph and molar ratio could mutually affect the cod removal this means that the cod removal would be at maximum if both ph and molar ratio were at maximum values as shown in fig 10 b the maximum cod removal occurred at middle values of both ph and volume ratio according to fig 10 c the cod removal would be at maximum when ph and reaction time mutually were at maximum values as shown in fig 10 d the maximum cod removal was observed at highest ph and middle value of current density fig 10 e shows maximum cod removal would be at maximum values of both ph and current density fig 11 shows the core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalytic mechanism during the electro fenton process the nanoparticles with preventing the complete leaching of iron ions formed on the nanocatalyst surface control iron release into the wastewater 17 19 in fact iron nanoparticles can produce o2 superoxide radicals in phs of 4 8 by reducing one electron of an oxygen molecule furthermore the superoxide radicals with zero valent iron improve the fe iii fe ii production cycle due to existing more active sites this continuously supplies iron ions for hydrogen peroxide decomposition and hydroxyl radicals production this will destroy organic pollutants of wastewaters 21 22 fe fe2o3 nanoparticles may activate two electron molecular oxygen to produce h2o2 through electron transfer from iron core to the surface of iron oxide shell moreover one electron molecular oxygen activation will produce o2 superoxide radicals by fe2 ions attached on the iron oxide shell surface 19 24 h2o2 and o2 superoxide production through molecular oxygen activation by fe fe2o3 nanoparticles increases the reactive oxygen species ross amount in fact this accelerates the fe iii fe ii cycle in high phs ph 4 the rate constant for the reaction of o2 superoxide with fe iii is 10 times larger than that of it for h2o2 and fe iii therefore fe iii with h2o2 reaction can be neglected moreover o2 superoxide production significantly inhibits insoluble iron products 11 19 24 26 32 36 eqs 3 10 show this process in detail the most critical step normally is production rate of oh from h2o2 in this process in the catalytic one solid catalyst properties control h2o2 generation and consequently the solution ph so the haber weiss circle mechanism can properly be fitted on it 9 19 3 fe

organic pollutants by products co 2 h 2 o 3 3 2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio and volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater as shown in fig 12 a c an increase in the volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater led to h2o2 fe2 molar ratio enhancement because reactor content initially was constant furthermore the cod removal increased up to optimal point 3 16 and then decreased its reason is due to wasting the reactive substances and reducing the wastewater cod fig 12 a and b show that the volume ratio reaction time and current density mutually affect the cod removal this means that the cod removal would be at maximum when those variables were at their middle values although maximum dosage of nanocatalyst would also increase the cod removal to maximum value according to fig 12 d g cod removal would be at low values when h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was at low value because hydroxyl radicals were not enough vice versa trend can be observed up to the optimal point 1 39 as well since the fenton reaction normally is a first order one reactants concentration increment would lead to reaction rate enhancement 19 as shown in fig 12 d the highest value of cod removal would occur at the middle values of volume ratio and molar ratio fig 12 e shows mutual effect of reaction time and molar ratio which led to the maximum cod removal fig 12 f shows that the cod removal would be at optimal point when current density and molar ratio respectively were at middle and maximum values fig 12 g shows that the highest cod removal took place at maximum nanocatalyst dosage and middle molar ratio values furthermore the nanocatalyst increment sharply affects the cod removal as seen in these figures the slope of volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater graph is sharper than the h2o2 fe2 molar ratio graph this indicates that the amount of hydrogen peroxide has more impact than the amount of iron salt 10 16 3 3 3 time effect according to fig 12 h i reaction time had a positive effect on the electro fenton process although its effect decreased after the optimal value of time fig 12 h shows that the highest cod removal occurred at maximum value of current density and middle value of reaction time fig 12 i shows that the maximum cod removal would be at maximum values of nanocatalyst dosage and reaction time in fact the reactants in the reaction medium will decrease over time and the rate of pollutant cod removal decreased 15 moreover time increment had no considerable effect on the cod removal in low h2o2 fe2 molar ratio and volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater as shown in fig 12 a and e time enhancement would affect cod removal when the reactants hydroxyl radicals production to be enough while an increment in h2o2 fe2 molar ratio or volume ratio of h2o2 to alcoholic wastewater without increasing reaction time had no considerable effect on the cod removal since the reactor content will decrease over time some other factors such as nanocatalyst dosage and effluent concentration may affect the cod removal 7 9 3 3 4 current density effect electrical current is one of the main parameters in the electro fenton process and especially in the electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production process figs 10 d and 12 b f j and h show the effect of the current density on the cod removal the cod removal increased up to the optimal point 56 37 ma and then decreased with the current density increment as shown in these figures the cod removal increased with intensifying the electrical current and consequently increasing the electrical potential difference an increase in the current intensity led to an increase in the production of ferrous ions and eventually hydroxyl radicals in fact this will amplify the electro fenton process 15 22 fig 12 j shows the mutual effect of current density and nanocatalyst dosage on the cod removal maximum cod removal occurred at middle value of current density and maximum value of nanocatalyst dosage the production rate of hydrogen peroxide on the cathode and in the electrolyte increased when the current density increased in fact oxidized metal amount would increase this led to the hydroxide clots coagulation and an organic pollutant cod removal increment on the other hand more and smaller bubbles which have bigger effective surfaces with longer retention times would be produced with the current density enhancement they could effectively remove the organic pollutants such as cod 11 45 46 in fact the current density increment would assist hydroxyl radicals preparation and fe2 cations production from fe3 cations on the anode and cathode surfaces respectively these would increase the chain reaction and continuous conversion of fe3 cations to fe2 cations through the electro fenton process 1 further increase in the current density would lead to the series of competitive electrode reactions such as oxygen evolution and hydrogen formation on the anode and cathode electrodes respectively these reactions will prevent the main fenton reactions 6 26 moreover the cell potential would increase with the current density excessive increment this would cause hydrogen peroxide destruction on the anode and heat the solution high temperature may drop the cod removal 47 48 3 3 5 nanocatalyst dosage effect as shown in figs 10 e and 12 c g i and j one of the effective parameters on the heterogeneous electro fenton process is the initial amount of nanocatalyst the cod removal would increase with increasing the nanocatalyst dosage up to the optimal point 2 g the cod removal would decrease with further increasing in the nanocatalyst dosage after the optimal point this may be due to the nanoparticles activity reduction 9 21 moreover available effective surfaces which the reactions were done on them increased with increasing the nanocatalyst dosage however the cod removal initially increased but it would decrease due to increasing the produced hydroxyl radicals which unintentionally reacted with fe2 cations scavenger reactions 12 14 22 3 4 optimization process the optimum operation conditions were statistically found through the doe software with maximizing the cod removal and then validated by an experiment under the same operation conditions according to table 4 the cod removal percentage was currently obtained at 93 87 at a neural ph while it was traditionally without a catalyst found at 81 70 at an acidic ph the nanocatalyst could modify the operating conditions and improve the cod removal percentage around 12 it seems that the applied nanocatalyst was able to optimally produce hydroxyl radicals which increased the cod removal 11 14 16 17 reduction in the other operation conditions except ph could economically encourage industries to scale up the mentioned conditions 3 5 nanocatalyst reusability and stability reusability is an important way to evaluate the properties of synthesized nanocatalyst so the reusability and stability of core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst was investigated by the cod removal determination under the optimal conditions by five consecutive tests according to table 5 the cod removal percentage still was around 80 after five continues uses the good stability is probably attributed to the strong interfacial interaction between the nanoparticles and the bentonite structure this would limit the dissolution and aggregation of nanoparticles in the wastewater and thus save their activity and stability 26 3 6 economic analysis energy cost can change because it strongly depends on the type of wastewater treatment technique operating variables and design of the electrochemical reactor it would usually be around 45 of the total operating cost the operating cost based on the removal of cod mass unit kg from wastewater volume unit m3 can be calculated as 49 11 operating cost m 3 kg cod removal acc bemc ceec other costs where cc is the chemical consumption kg m 3 kg 1 cod removal emc is the electrode material consumption kg m 3 kg 1 cod removal and eec is the electrical energy consumption kwh m 3 kg 1 cod removal a b and c are the costs of chemicals kg 1 electrode

of wastewater l and cod or toc removal mg l since electricity price electrical energy consumption cost of eec total cost of eec kg removed cod electrode replacing chemicals and other operational costs respectively were around 0 0039 kwh 120 kwh m3 0 468 m3 of wastewater 0 0936 kg cod 0 17 0 40 and 0 10 m3 total cost was found at 1 138 m3 of wastewater in this research although mousset et al applied various advanced oxidation techniques to treat a phenolic wastewater but they found that the electro fenton technique was as a more economic one 50 however canizares et al applied three electrochemical ozone and fenton base techniques to treat various wastewaters but they economically proposed the fenton technique 51 he et al found that the electro fenton method consumed the lowest energy compared with the other electrochemical techniques 15 ghanbari and moradi treated a textile wastewater with electrocoagulation electrochemical electro fenton and peroxi coagulation methods they concluded that the electro fenton technique was as a more efficient and economic one due to having a shorter treating time 52 ismail et al suggested the heterogeneous catalytic electro fenton method compared with the other fenton base techniques because it had the lowest cost 53 4 conclusions in this study heterogeneous core shell fe fe2o3 nanoparticles bentonite catalyst was synthesized and used to improve the electro fenton process various tests such as fesem edx bet xrd ftir and xrf were applied to confirm that a proper synthesis was carried out very low sludge formation which is ignorable and o2 superoxide ions production improvement through iron ions adsorption on the fe fe2o3 shell were two fantastic advantages of this catalytic treatment process it was concluded that the use of nanocatalyst would improve the cod removal around 12 in a neutral environment compared with the traditional electro fenton without a heterogeneous catalyst in order to ensure reusability and stability of the synthetic nanocatalyst it used five times and its performance dropped only 15 the treatment process was also studied from an economic point of view it was found that the operating cost of the nanocatalytic electro fenton process was less than the traditional electro fenton and the other advanced oxidation methods therefore an economic treatment through a catalytic process was investigated

12633,the discharge of toxic metal ions and pharmaceutical pollutants has become a global issue this work evaluated the efficiency of the hydrothermally synthesized superparamagnetic fe3o4 mos2 nanosheets and its fabrication with chitosan fe3o4 mos2 cs to remove cr vi and ciprofloxacin cip from simulated wastewater these nanohybrid materials are characterized by sem mapping raman tem xrd xps zeta potential ftir and bet analyses the affinity and selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial towards a mixture of cr vi as ii pb ii and cd ii metal ions from synthetic solution is studied through icp ms at trace levels the distribution coefficient kd for cr vi 1 2 104 ml g is higher than the other metal ions which reveals high selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs the fe3o4 mos2 cs has also displayed enhanced removal efficiency for ciprofloxacin emerging contaminant from synthetic solutions the fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials possess high saturation magnetization values of 68 00 emu g and 59 emu g respectively the adsorption process of cr vi highly depends upon the solution ph and the adsorption isotherm is followed by the langmuir isotherm model the kinetics of sorption is followed well by the pseudo second order model the adsorption mechanism is assumed due to functional group complexation and electrostatic interactions fe3o4 mos2 cs has displayed maximum sorption capacity for cr vi 175 4 mg g 1 and cip 190 7 mg g 1 respectively fe3o4 mos2 cs has been used in practical applications to remove cr vi 97 and cip 62 from real simulated wastewater the enhanced adsorption efficiency and excellent magnetic recyclability of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanohybrid material make it a promising sustainable adsorbent for clean production and wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords superparamagnetic molybdenum disulfide chitosan adsorption chromium ciprofloxacin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction an exponential rise in the human population and industries has led to severe environmental pollution restricting sustainable progress and affecting human health 1 2 toxic metal ions pharmaceuticals and other organic pollutants discharged into different water bodies cause global environmental issues due to their hazardous effects on ecological systems and human life 3 6 most of the toxic metals pb cr hg as cd hg etc and pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin tetracycline ofloxacin are bio accumulative non biodegradable and persistent 7 9 they hence pose a great threat to living life and their removal becomes necessary the conventional treatment techniques employed to eliminate the toxic metal ions and emerging contaminants from wastewater include membrane filtration ion exchange adsorption coagulation and other biological methods 10 however some of these techniques are not sustainable economical and efficient in removing multiple toxic pollutants 5 hence it is vital to develop sustainable economic efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment methods 11 the adsorption method has been deemed to be promising technique than other methods due to its facile operation high efficiency and economical nature for wastewater treatment 12 13 with the recent advancement in nanotechnology and rapid rise in hybrid nanocomposite materials magnetic nanomaterials are explored in wastewater treatment 14 17 magnetite fe3o4 possesses extraordinary characteristics and has been studied intensively owing to its superparamagnetic nature good thermal stability ease of preparation and low toxicity 18 fe3o4 is used in various applications like environmental remediation drug delivery catalysis magnetic resonance imaging mri etc 19 20 however pristine fe3o4 is highly susceptible to oxidation and tends to agglomerate 21 to prevent the fe3o4 oxidation and aggregation it is functionalized with different crosslinkers such as crosslinking of fe3o4 with polymers zeolites molecular organic frameworks mofs and transition metal dichalcogenides tmds 22 23 due to the outstanding stability and large surface area of two dimensional 2d transition metal dichalcogenides they have gained widespread public interest in catalysis energy storage and photochemistry during the last several years 24 to the best of our knowledge tmds are not explored extensively for environmental pollution cleanup molybdenum disulfide mos2 is an emerging tmd similar to the graphene structure in which each mo atom is sandwiched between two sulfur layers 25 the two dimensional mos2 layers bear a lot of functional sulfur groups on the surface still these layers are associated with aggregation and stack over one another limiting their effective surface area and activity to achieve a highly active stable and recyclable adsorbent it is important to design develop and fabricate a scaffold that prevents the aggregation and restacking of mos2 nanosheets and helps the mass transfer during the sorption process an idea scaffold should exhibit the attributes of excellent activity enhanced porosity high stability low toxicity easy handling and high recyclability 26 in another study pristine flower like spherical mos2 was synthesized by hydrothermal method and employed to remove cr vi the sorption isotherm and kinetics are favored by langmuir and pseudo second order models the cr vi is mainly adsorbed on mos2 via electrostatic interactions 27 chitosan cs a bio polymer possesses abundant functional amino groups along the chain responsible for the excellent sorption capacity of toxic metal ions via complexation with these amino groups 28 cs has been widely employed as a bio sorbent to eliminate toxic pollutants from wastewater 29 however due to strong intermolecular forces in chitosan the binding sites are decreased which results in the reduced efficiency of chitosan towards different pollutants due to poor mechanical strength lack of selectivity and poor stability in an acidic medium chitosan has limited practical applications to enhance the efficiency and stability of chitosan it is critical to fabricate it with other nanomaterials it has been reported in the literature that chemically modifying chitosan with different functional groups improves its sorption efficiency 30 however the chemical fabrication process is often time consuming in one of the studies magnetic chitosan iron iii hydrogel mch fe is used to remove cr vi from the aqueous phase within a short period the sorption isotherm and kinetics are well followed by langmuir and pseudo second order models the cr vi ions are adsorbed on positively charged mch fe via ion exchange and electrostatic interactions in which the ion exchange is the controlling factor 31 crosslinking of fe3o4 mos2 into chitosan is considered an excellent design for the removal of toxic pollutants from wastewater the fe3o4 nanoparticles impart strong superparamagnetic characteristics mos2 nanosheets have excellent selectivity and sorption efficiency towards metal ions and chitosan is a well known adsorbent for most toxic pollutants herein we reported the synthesis of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials by simple hydrothermal and crosslinking methods respectively to eliminate cr vi and cip from aqueous and simulated wastewater samples hence the combination of magnetic microspheres fe3o4 mos2 and chitosan could produce highly efficient hybrid nanomaterials with tremendous potential for clean environmental remediation 2 experimental 2 1 materials sodium molybdate

a water ethanol mixture dried at 70 c for 24 h and named mos2 for the synthesis of fe3o4 mos2 1 36 g of fecl3 0 28 g of purified mos2 and 8 00 g of ch3coonh4 are added to 70 ml of ethylene glycol and stirred for 7 h the dark green homogeneous solution is heated in a 100 ml autoclave at 180 c for 24 h after 24 h the autoclave was cooled down instantly by sprinkling cold water over it then the product is washed with a water ethanol mixture and separated by an external magnet the product is vacuum dried at 65 c to collect black powder fe3o4 mos2 2 3 preparation of fe3o4 mos2 cs to synthesize

renishaw at 532 nm excitation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir using kbr pellets is used to characterize the surface functional groups in the as prepared nanomaterials 2 5 adsorption experiments the batch equilibrium adsorption technique is employed to study the adsorption phenomenon it is determined that the adsorbent is mixed with the aqueous metal solutions for a certain period before it is separated using an external nd magnet the residual metal ion concentration in a mixture is determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms only to assess the selectivity of the as prepared adsorbents later on a uv visible spectrophotometer was employed in subsequent sorption studies of cr vi and cip from aqueous and simulated real wastewater samples the adsorption of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is determined by comparing the difference in the metal ion concentration before and after the sorption process the amount of cr vi adsorbed per gram of adsorbent is calculated by the equations shown below 32 1 q e 10 3 c o c e v m 2 q t c o c t v m 3 k d c o c f v c f m where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cr vi metal

distribution coefficient defined in eq 3 when tested against a combination of metal ions the fe3o4 mos2 cs demonstrated high selectivity for the cr vi ions the batch equilibrium technique is used for 24 h of contact time to evaluate the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 mos2 cs towards cr vi at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 scanning electron microscopy sem analysis the detailed morphology and size distribution of as prepared magnetic nanohybrid materials is demonstrated by sem analysis displayed in fig 1 the surface morphology of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials are well supported with tem results the spherical fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps are smooth and are uniformly dispersed on two dimensional ultrathin mos2 nanosheets fig 1a c as reported in the literature 33 34 the mnps are uniformly grown over the surface of mos2 nanosheets with an average particle size of about 20 nm it is observed that in magnetic fe3o4 mos2 nanocomposite the mnps are aggregated together to some extent thereby reducing the surface area and activity the 2d morphology of mos2 in fe3o4 mos2 is not destroyed after the functionalization with fe3o4 nanoparticles during the synthesis process which could be one of the advantages of environmental remediation in fe3o4 mos2 cs magnetic fe3o4 mos2 is highly interconnected within the cs matrix forming nanometer sized mesopores thereby suggesting successful synthesis of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial fig 1d f a closer look at the sem images of fe3o4 mos2 cs reveals that the aggregation of fe3o4 nanoparticles and stacking of mos2 nanosheets are highly reduced in the presence of the cs matrix this reduction in the aggregation and stacking of fe3o4 mos2 in the cs matrix improves the surface area and enhances the efficiency of the nanomaterial the elemental composition of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is determined by the eds element mapping technique figs s1 and s2 show a uniform distribution of the expected elements fe mo s and o in fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs respectively the sem eds results confirm the successful synthesis of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs magnetic nanomaterials 3 2 transmission electron microscopy tem analysis the high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem analysis is used to analyze the microstructural information of as synthesized magnetic nanohybrid materials as depicted in fig 2a c spherical fe3o4 nps are decorated over hexagonal nanosheets of mos2 with high crystallinity it has been observed from these tem images that fe3o4 nps are aggregated together to some extent in fe3o4 mos2 while as in fe3o4 mos2 cs the aggregation of fe3o4 nps is prevented due to the presence of cs biopolymer which is assumed due to the highly active functional groups and viscous nature of cs fig 2d f it has also been found that the sheet morphology of mos2 is slightly reduced and the mos2 sheets are wrapped up with a diameter of about 2 62 nm which is again due to the effect of the cs matrix these results reveal the presence of fe3o4 mos2 and cs phases together in the hybrid magnetic nanocomposite materials 3 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis the crystallinity and phase components of as prepared magnetic nanocomposite materials are studied with powder x ray diffraction the observed diffraction peaks in face centered cubic fe3o4 mos2 at 2θ 30 0 35 4 43 0 53 4 56 8 and 64 4 could be attributed to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of the magnetite phase 27 34 while as the diffraction peaks in fe3o4 mos2 at 2θ 14 4 32 7 39 6 49 7 and 60 1 could be indexed to 220 311 400 422 and 511 planes of mos2 nanosheets fig 3 35 37 the highly intense diffraction peak observed in the 002 plane of fe3o4 mos2 confirms the nature of mos2 nanosheets in fe3o4 mos2 sharp and intense diffraction bands are observed which confirm the nanocomposite material s well stacked crystalline nature apparently in fe3o4 mos2 cs all the above diffraction peaks are observed with less intensity this suggests the successful interaction or incorporation of fe3o4 mos2 into the polymer matrix which results in the lower crystallinity of the final fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial two additional peaks are observed in the fe3o4 mos2 cs 2θ 18 25 and 44 17 represented by green circles in fig 3 confirming the successful interaction between fe3o4 mos2 and cs phases 3 4 raman spectra analysis the chemical nature of as prepared magnetic nanohybrid materials is determined by raman spectra using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm in fig 4 the well resolved raman peaks observed in fe3o4 mos2 at 218 282 and 592 cm 1 correspond to a1g vibrational modes of fe3o4 and these bands are slightly shifted from that of pure raman spectra of pure fe3o4 nps 33 38 while the peaks observed at 377 and 403 cm 1 could be attributed to the 1e2g and a1g vibrational modes of mos2 39 an additional peak is also observed at 781 cm 1 which has been assumed due to the moo3 bond vibrations the raman peaks observed in fe3o4 mos2 are slightly shifted towards lower values as compared with their pure precursors which confirms the interaction between the fe3o4 nps and mos2 nanosheets on the other hand in fe3o4 mos2 cs all observed raman peaks are shifted slightly towards lower wavelengths with respect to the raman spectra of fe3o4 mos2 this also suggests an interaction between fe3o4 mos2 and cs biopolymer in fe3o4 mos2 cs two additional raman peaks observed at 1304 and 1572 cm 1 could be attributed to cs 40 3 5 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area adsorbents which possess excellent porosity and high surface area characteristics are ideal for removing toxic pollutants from the environment owing to the increased surface active sites the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials show type h3 hysteresis loops and type iv isotherms which confirms the mesoporous nature of as prepared samples the surface area of fe3o4 mos2 cs 39 m2 g is much higher than fe3o4 mos2 21 m2 g which results due to the presence of cs the pore volume and pore size of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs were analyzed by barrett joyner halenda bjh methods the pore volume and maximum pore size of as prepared magnetic materials are shown in table s1 fe3o4 mos2 cs possesses a higher pore size and pore volume compared to the pore volume with fe3o4 mos2 which is highly beneficial for toxic metal removal 3 6 magnetic properties the magnetic characteristics of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs were studied with vsm at an ambient temperature the magnetic hysteresis mh curves of prepared nanomaterials are shown in fig 5 the slope of the mh curve is close to zero which is a characteristic feature of superparamagnetic materials 41 the magnetic saturation values of fe3o4 mos2 68 emu g are higher as compared with fe3o4 mos2 cs 59 60 emu g the decrease in magnetization emu g for fe3o4 mos2 cs is due to incorporating cs content and a change in shape anisotropy it is evident from fig 5 that the black homogeneous suspension of fe3o4 mos2 cs can be easily separated by the magnet from the solution phase furthermore the ms values of fe3o4 mos2 are higher than fe3o4 mos2 cs leading to the agglomeration of fe3o4 mos2 microspheres and low adsorbent capacity by lowering the surface active sites 3 7 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the electronic interaction and chemical composition of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial are analyzed by the xps technique as displayed in fig 6 fig 6a displays the full survey xps spectrum of fe3o4 mos2 cs in which fe mo s o c and n elements are present the high resolution peaks observed for mo in fe3o4 mos2 cs at 230 and 233 ev indicate the presence of mo iv in the sample and are attributed to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 respectively fig 6b the high resolution xps spectrum of fe 2p consists of two bands around 712 and 725 ev that is associated with fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively which could be related to fe ii and fe iii of fe3o4 fig 6c the absence of a satellite peak at around 720 ev in fig 6c confirms that no ɣ fe2o3 phase is formed a typical core level spectrum of s exhibits two bands at 163 and 164 ev which corresponds to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 fig 6d fig 6e shows the o 1 s spectrum in which two bands are observed at 530 8 and 532 2 ev which correspond to feo and surface bonded hydroxyl groups respectively the results obtained from xps spectra of fe3o4 mos2 cs are in good concurrence with fe3o4 mos2 based nanocomposite materials as cited in the literature thereby confirming the formation of fe3o4 mos2 cs hybrid nanocomposite 33 39 3 8 adsorption properties effect of solid content ph and zeta potential phpzc the adsorbent dosage is a key factor that has a significant impact on the adsorption process in this work different adsorbent amounts 0 5 1 5 g l 1 are mixed with the solution containing a fixed concentration of 30 ppm of cr vi ions from fig 7a the adsorption efficiency increases as the amount of adsorbent increases until the saturation level is reached 1 g l 1 as predicted the adsorption capacity increases with the adsorbent concentration which might be due to more surface active sites on the magnetic hybrid nanomaterial at the higher dosage of the adsorbent 1 2 g l 1 the removal capacity increased slightly and was insignificant hence 1 g l 1 is used as the optimum amount of the adsorbent in all experiments in this work furthermore from fig 7a it is observed that fe3o4 mos2 cs hybrid nanocomposite shows improved adsorption capacity as compared with fe3o4 mos2 while keeping all the reaction conditions ideal the optimum concentration of the adsorbent for cip adsorption is kept fixed at 1 g l 1 the phenomenon of the adsorption process depends upon several factors ph directly impacts the sorption process as it affects the charge on the adsorbent surface and toxic metals fig 7b shows the removal capacity of cr vi by fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs in different ph solutions the removal efficiency of both the adsorbents decreases with increasing the solution ph fe3o4 mos2 cs shows higher adsorption capacity as compared with fe3o4 mos2 at ph 4 0 hence ph 4 0 is the optimum ph used in subsequent experiments this high adsorption capacity shown by fe3o4 mos2 cs in an acidic medium mainly corresponds to the following aspects the surface active functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent could be protonated and deprotonated which relies on the solution ph the functional moieties are protonated and bear a net positive charge at lower ph values in contrast in a neutral or basic ph these functional groups are either neutral or bear a negative charge on the adsorbent surface hcro4 is the major species of cr vi in the acidic ph hence in an acidic ph the adsorbent surface becomes positively charged which results in high adsorption of hcro4 cip adsorption on the adsorbent was also studied at different ph values as displayed in fig 7c the adsorption of cip is maximum at neutral ph which is assumed due to the surface charge of cip and the adsorbents cip molecules can be protonated or deprotonated depending upon the solution s ph it exists in the cationic form at a ph 5 8 while the zwitterionic state exists in the 5 9 to 8 9 ph range and the anionic form at a ph 9 both the adsorbents show maximum adsorption capacity towards the zwitterionic state of cip at neutral ph the adsorption of cip decreases in an acidic medium because both the adsorbate and the adsorbent bear a positive charge resulting in electrostatic repulsion while as in basic medium ph 9 the hydroxyl ions also compete for adsorption on the adsorbent which also leads to lower adsorption efficiency of cip the sorption of cr vi over the adsorbents is further explained with the help of zeta potential the phzpc is determined by dissolving the adsorbents 0 1 g in 50 ml of kcl solution the initial ph is kept constant by using 0 1 m naoh or hcl and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 24 h and the final ph is measured the zero point charge phzpc of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is calculated by plotting δph phinitial phfinal against phinitial and is found to be 6 8 and 6 5 respectively fig 7d when ph phzpc the adsorbent surface active functional groups are protonated and possess a net positive charge while as ph phzpc the adsorbent surface becomes negatively charged the cr vi ions exist in the aqueous phase in the form of negative ions hence the strong electrostatic force of attraction between the positively charged adsorbent surface and the negatively charged cr vi ions results in the high removal efficiency from aqueous solutions furthermore the removal efficiency of the magnetic adsorbent is reduced with increasing solution ph which is due to the reduced surface charge this results in the repulsion between the adsorbent and the negatively charged cr vi metal ions from the aqueous solution and their uptake is significantly reduced 3 9 selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs the adsorption of cr vi by fe3o4 mos2 cs from the aqueous phase is carried out in the batch method the selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs towards the mixture of four metal ions cr vi cd ii as ii pb ii is shown in table s2 along with distribution coefficient kd values it has been observed that fe3o4 mos2 cs has displayed higher removal efficiency towards cr vi among the mixture of metal ions which demonstrates superb selectivity of the magnetic nanohybrid material the cr vi concentration in the supernatant is reduced to almost 8 110 ppb within a short period the selectivity displayed by fe3o4 mos2 cs towards cr vi from a mixture of metal ions is assumed by the strong electrostatic interactions between the positively charged surface functional groups of fe3o4 mos2 cs with anionic forms of cr vi metal ions as discussed in 3 8 sub section 3 10 adsorption isotherm the impact on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents was studied at varying initial concentrations of cr vi 10 300 mg l 1 and cip 5 100 mg l 1 at 298 k respectively the sorption capacity of the adsorbents increases with increasing the concentration of cr vi and cip and reaches a maximum value within a short period to elucidate the sorption efficiency isotherm analysis is a key factor in determining the type of interactions between the adsorbate cr vi cip and the adsorbents fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs the experimental data is simulated with non linear langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms the sorption isotherm parameters were calculated from the plot of q e versus c e and the correlation coefficient r2 was used to choose the most viable model that could account for the adsorption performance the maximum adsorption saturation curves for cr vi and cip are displayed in fig 8a b the experimental data reveal the adsorption of cr vi initially increases sharply and then approaches a limiting adsorption capacity in contrast the adsorption of cip increases almost linearly reaching a saturation value the observed phenomenon of the adsorption process is explained by langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the langmuir model is related to monolayer physical adsorption in which finite adsorption sites are present with equal energies for adsorption and desorption processes q e q max c e b 1 c e b where qe mg g 1 and ce mg l 1 are the equilibrium concentration of metal ions on the adsorbent and aqueous phase respectively qmax mg g 1 is the theoretical saturated sorption capacity and b is the langmuir constant the freundlich adsorption isotherm model deals with both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption processes the adsorption process could be either physical or chemical and this model is employed for the adsorption processes in which limited sorption capacity is not observed q e k f c e 1 n kf mg1 n ln g is the freundlich adsorption coefficient which provides insights into relative adsorption capacity and the value of n gives adsorption strength the saturated sorption capacity and other parameters associated with the langmuir and the freundlich models were determined by non linear regression analysis the values of qmax for cr vi and cip are listed in tables s3 and s4 respectively the experimental results are correlated with both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the qmax values of cr vi 175 4 mg g 1 are close to the experimentally obtained saturated sorption capacity while the qmax values of cip 190 7 mg g 1 are quite far away from the experimentally obtained saturated sorption capacity the variation in the qmax value and that of the experimental sorption capacity value of cip is assumed due to the linearity sorption curve of cip the value of the correlation coefficient close to unity and higher regression coefficient suggests that the removal of cr vi by fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is well supported by the langmuir model in contrast the sorption of cip follows both langmuir and freundlich models hence the adsorption of cr vi onto the as prepared adsorbents follows monolayer coverage while cip sorption follows both the monolayer and multilayer coverage and both the simulation models provide clear insights into this phenomenon the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 mos2 cs and fe3o4 mos2 is much higher than other adsorbents reported in the literature shown in table s5 the sorption capacity of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 cs is more significant in terms of the amount of the adsorbent time and efficiency than the reported adsorbents 3 11 adsorption kinetics to understand the mechanism of adsorption different pathways for adsorption and rate of adsorption the sorption kinetics of as prepared materials were investigated until equilibrium was attained it is critical to determine the adsorption kinetics to develop and design efficient and sustainable adsorption systems in addition the sorption kinetics also interprets the sorption mechanism transition intermediates and factors affecting the reaction rate during the adsorbate adsorbent complex the non linear form of pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order kinetic models pso were used in this study to understand the sorption kinetics furthermore the removal of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs was monitored by the intraparticle diffusion model to determine the diffusion mechanism 3 11 1 pseudo first order kinetic model in several instances the pfo model is often relevant to the early stages of sorption processes and does not follow well to the whole contact time range 26 the pfo model proposed by lagergren is used to get the value of the adsorption rate constant based on adsorption capacity 27 as 4 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t where qt and qe represent the amounts of adsorbate adsorbed on adsorbent mg g 1 at any time t min and at equilibrium respectively and k1 is the rate constant of pfo adsorption min 1 the non linear plot of qt versus t as shown in fig 9 a b and the values of calculated sorption capacity qe rate constant k1 and correlation coefficients r2 for the sorption of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs are summarized in table 1 the qe values calculated from pfo are not in good agreement with the experimental values these results suggested that cr vi and cip adsorption onto fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs did not occur according to pfo kinetics 3 11 2 pseudo second order kinetic model the pso kinetic model assumes that the rate limiting factor in the chemisorption process involves the valence forces through sharing of electrons between the functional groups of the adsorbent and adsorbate 26 the behavior is more accurately anticipated by the pso model over the whole range of adsorption which may be expressed as 5 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption g mg 1 min 1 the non linear plot of qt versus t is shown in fig 9a b and the values of pso parameters qt and k2 were displayed in table 1 along with the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 for the sorption of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs the results showed that the r2 values were near unity 0 99 as compared with r2 values from the pfo model for both cr vi and cip pollutants this suggests the applicability of the pso kinetic model to explain the sorption process of cr vi and cip onto adsorbents the calculated qt values for cr vi and cip sorption correlate rather well with the experimental qt values table 1 as a result the pso kinetic model provides more accurate insights into the adsorption kinetics of cr vi and cip being adsorbed onto the adsorbents furthermore fe3o4 mos2 cs displays more sorption capacity for both cr vi and cip pollutants as compared with fe3o4 mos2 this is assumed due to more surface active sites and the large surface area of fe3o4 mos2 cs 3 11 3 intraparticle diffusion study it is assumed that the sorption of adsorbate on adsorbent involves either one or multiple steps such as pore diffusion surface diffusion film or external diffusion 42 the intraparticle diffusion model is often rate limiting in a batch reactor process an empirical relationship proposed by weber and morris states that if intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step then the amount of adsorbate adsorbed on the adsorbent varies with the square root of time to determine the diffusion mechanism the kinetic results were analyzed by the intra particle diffusion model expressed as q t k id t 1 2 c i where qt mg g 1 represents the adsorption capacity at time t min kid is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 and ci is the intercept mg g 1 a plot of qt vs t1 2 for intraparticle diffusion of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is shown in fig 9c d the parameters kid ci and r2 derived from the plots are displayed in table 2 the thickness of the boundary layer is governed by the values of ci i e the larger the intercept the greater the boundary layer effect 43 the adsorption process is governed only by intra particle diffusion if the plot of q t vs t 1 2 is linear and passes through the origin the results showed multi linear patterns suggesting that the adsorption process involves multiple steps the first small linear portion corresponds to film diffusion and the second step involves a gradual sorption process where intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting the third portion represents the equilibrium stage where the concentration of adsorbate in the solution is very low which results in the slowdown of the intraparticle diffusion process fig 9c d shows that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting phase in the adsorption process 3 12 cr vi and cip uptake from real water the removal efficacy of fe3o4 mos2 cs is further validated by analyzing the adsorption of the studied pollutants from real water samples obtained from a local lake in aligarh india the visible impurities of the water samples were removed by filtration prior to their usage the amount of cr vi and cip in real water samples is determined by the spiking technique the real wastewater samples were spiked with known cr vi and cip concentration 5 ppm to 15 ppm fe3o4 mos2 cs shows excellent adsorption efficiency towards cr vi than cip as displayed in table 3 the spiking technique reveals the practical application of the fe3o4 mos2 cs nanohybrid material to remove cr vi and cip from real wastewater samples 3 13 mechanism of adsorption the sorption of cr vi and cip onto the adsorbents from the aqueous phase were analyzed on the bases of sorption kinetics isotherm ph and zeta potential multiple processes often coexist during the adsorption phenomenon for instance surface complexation ion exchange and electrostatic interactions occur between the adsorbent and the pollutants 43 44 our results demonstrated that cr vi and cip were adsorbed onto the surface of fe3o4 mos2 cs which is consistent with the findings of earlier research 45 47 the ftir spectra of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs are shown in fig s3 no obvious change in the ftir spectra of the two adsorbents is observed only there is a slight reduction in the peak intensities of fe3o4 mos2 cs which is assumed due to the presence of chitosan to analyze the removal mechanism the ftir spectra of fe3o4 mos2 cs are taken before and after cr vi and cip adsorption to provide a more in depth explanation of these phenomena fig 10 in the ftir spectra of fe3o4 mos2 cs the absorption band observed at 582 cm 1 corresponds the stretching vibrations of feo groups this band is sharp and smooth with high intensity before adsorption and the intensity gets reduced after adsorption which reveals the interaction of fe with other groups a broadband appeared at 3400 cm 1 before and after cr vi adsorption which corresponds to stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups in fe oh groups this band becomes less broad and more intense after the adsorption of cip which is assumed due to the presence of more hydroxyl groups from cip cooh a sharp band observed after the adsorption of cip at 1395 cm 1 corresponds to oh bending vibrations feoh cip cooh the peak observed at 1632 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of nh groups cip chitosan with a similar trend as that of 3400 cm 1 48 49 finally the band appeared at 1106 cm 1 before and after adsorption is attributed to the co stretching vibration of chitosan 50 thus the ftir implications and findings reveal that the cr vi and cip are mainly adsorbed on the surface of the fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial as confirmed from the ph and zeta potential studies the cr vi exists in the anionic state and the surface of the adsorbent bears a positive charge in an acidic medium hence there is the possibility of electrostatic interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent on the other hand cip bears a positive charge in an acidic medium a negative charge in a basic medium and exists in the zwitterionic form in neutral ph in the acidic medium there is repulsion between the adsorbate and the adsorbent while as in the basic medium hydroxyl ions also compete for adsorption which results in the reduced removal efficiency of the fe3o4 mos2 cs hence the maximum removal efficiency of cip on fe3o4 mos2 cs is observed via electrostatic interactions at neutral ph 3 14 adsorption regeneration from a practical point of view the stability and recovery of the adsorbent are significant parameters to evaluate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of the adsorbent the cr vi adsorbed on the fe3o4 mos2 cs is desorbed using 2 m naoh and the surface active sites were reactivated by 1 m hcl the recyclability efficiency and the sorption capacity were examined for three consecutive adsorption desorption cycles fig 11 after three consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles the regenerated sample exhibited 89 cr vi metal ion removal this slight decrease in sorption capacity can be attributed to the structural changes in the structure of cs during chemical washing and drying processes 4 conclusion in summary a novel magnetic biosorbent has been developed by embedding fe3o4 mos2 nanosheets into crosslinked cs by ex situ method to remove heavy metals and cip from synthetic and simulated real wastewater the results showed that fe3o4 mos2 cs exhibited a high removal capacity for cr vi and cip in an aqueous phase which is assumed due to the presence of abundant amino functional groups on the cs surface and highly active sulfur groups on mos2 the adsorption efficiency highly relies upon the contaminant solution ph and the saturated adsorption efficiency of cr vi 175 4 mg g 1 and cip 190 7 mg g 1 is found to be ph 4 0 and 7 0 respectively the sorption isotherm of cr vi on fe3o4 mos2 cs is followed by both langmuir and freundlich models with a maximum sorption capacity of 175 4 mg g 1 while as the kinetics of sorption follows the pseudo second order model the adsorbed cr vi could be effectively desorbed by washing with 2 m naoh solution and the adsorbent surface active sites are reactivated by 1 m hcl the superparamagnetic properties of fe3o4 mos2 cs with zero coercivity enable its easy separation from wastewater with the external magnet this study could develop novel magnetic hybrid nanomaterials with excellent adsorption properties which

12633,the discharge of toxic metal ions and pharmaceutical pollutants has become a global issue this work evaluated the efficiency of the hydrothermally synthesized superparamagnetic fe3o4 mos2 nanosheets and its fabrication with chitosan fe3o4 mos2 cs to remove cr vi and ciprofloxacin cip from simulated wastewater these nanohybrid materials are characterized by sem mapping raman tem xrd xps zeta potential ftir and bet analyses the affinity and selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial towards a mixture of cr vi as ii pb ii and cd ii metal ions from synthetic solution is studied through icp ms at trace levels the distribution coefficient kd for cr vi 1 2 104 ml g is higher than the other metal ions which reveals high selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs the fe3o4 mos2 cs has also displayed enhanced removal efficiency for ciprofloxacin emerging contaminant from synthetic solutions the fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials possess high saturation magnetization values of 68 00 emu g and 59 emu g respectively the adsorption process of cr vi highly depends upon the solution ph and the adsorption isotherm is followed by the langmuir isotherm model the kinetics of sorption is followed well by the pseudo second order model the adsorption mechanism is assumed due to functional group complexation and electrostatic interactions fe3o4 mos2 cs has displayed maximum sorption capacity for cr vi 175 4 mg g 1 and cip 190 7 mg g 1 respectively fe3o4 mos2 cs has been used in practical applications to remove cr vi 97 and cip 62 from real simulated wastewater the enhanced adsorption efficiency and excellent magnetic recyclability of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanohybrid material make it a promising sustainable adsorbent for clean production and wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords superparamagnetic molybdenum disulfide chitosan adsorption chromium ciprofloxacin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction an exponential rise in the human population and industries has led to severe environmental pollution restricting sustainable progress and affecting human health 1 2 toxic metal ions pharmaceuticals and other organic pollutants discharged into different water bodies cause global environmental issues due to their hazardous effects on ecological systems and human life 3 6 most of the toxic metals pb cr hg as cd hg etc and pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin tetracycline ofloxacin are bio accumulative non biodegradable and persistent 7 9 they hence pose a great threat to living life and their removal becomes necessary the conventional treatment techniques employed to eliminate the toxic metal ions and emerging contaminants from wastewater include membrane filtration ion exchange adsorption coagulation and other biological methods 10 however some of these techniques are not sustainable economical and efficient in removing multiple toxic pollutants 5 hence it is vital to develop sustainable economic efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment methods 11 the adsorption method has been deemed to be promising technique than other methods due to its facile operation high efficiency and economical nature for wastewater treatment 12 13 with the recent advancement in nanotechnology and rapid rise in hybrid nanocomposite materials magnetic nanomaterials are explored in wastewater treatment 14 17 magnetite fe3o4 possesses extraordinary characteristics and has been studied intensively owing to its superparamagnetic nature good thermal stability ease of preparation and low toxicity 18 fe3o4 is used in various applications like environmental remediation drug delivery catalysis magnetic resonance imaging mri etc 19 20 however pristine fe3o4 is highly susceptible to oxidation and tends to agglomerate 21 to prevent the fe3o4 oxidation and aggregation it is functionalized with different crosslinkers such as crosslinking of fe3o4 with polymers zeolites molecular organic frameworks mofs and transition metal dichalcogenides tmds 22 23 due to the outstanding stability and large surface area of two dimensional 2d transition metal dichalcogenides they have gained widespread public interest in catalysis energy storage and photochemistry during the last several years 24 to the best of our knowledge tmds are not explored extensively for environmental pollution cleanup molybdenum disulfide mos2 is an emerging tmd similar to the graphene structure in which each mo atom is sandwiched between two sulfur layers 25 the two dimensional mos2 layers bear a lot of functional sulfur groups on the surface still these layers are associated with aggregation and stack over one another limiting their effective surface area and activity to achieve a highly active stable and recyclable adsorbent it is important to design develop and fabricate a scaffold that prevents the aggregation and restacking of mos2 nanosheets and helps the mass transfer during the sorption process an idea scaffold should exhibit the attributes of excellent activity enhanced porosity high stability low toxicity easy handling and high recyclability 26 in another study pristine flower like spherical mos2 was synthesized by hydrothermal method and employed to remove cr vi the sorption isotherm and kinetics are favored by langmuir and pseudo second order models the cr vi is mainly adsorbed on mos2 via electrostatic interactions 27 chitosan cs a bio polymer possesses abundant functional amino groups along the chain responsible for the excellent sorption capacity of toxic metal ions via complexation with these amino groups 28 cs has been widely employed as a bio sorbent to eliminate toxic pollutants from wastewater 29 however due to strong intermolecular forces in chitosan the binding sites are decreased which results in the reduced efficiency of chitosan towards different pollutants due to poor mechanical strength lack of selectivity and poor stability in an acidic medium chitosan has limited practical applications to enhance the efficiency and stability of chitosan it is critical to fabricate it with other nanomaterials it has been reported in the literature that chemically modifying chitosan with different functional groups improves its sorption efficiency 30 however the chemical fabrication process is often time consuming in one of the studies magnetic chitosan iron iii hydrogel mch fe is used to remove cr vi from the aqueous phase within a short period the sorption isotherm and kinetics are well followed by langmuir and pseudo second order models the cr vi ions are adsorbed on positively charged mch fe via ion exchange and electrostatic interactions in which the ion exchange is the controlling factor 31 crosslinking of fe3o4 mos2 into chitosan is considered an excellent design for the removal of toxic pollutants from wastewater the fe3o4 nanoparticles impart strong superparamagnetic characteristics mos2 nanosheets have excellent selectivity and sorption efficiency towards metal ions and chitosan is a well known adsorbent for most toxic pollutants herein we reported the synthesis of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials by simple hydrothermal and crosslinking methods respectively to eliminate cr vi and cip from aqueous and simulated wastewater samples hence the combination of magnetic microspheres fe3o4 mos2 and chitosan could produce highly efficient hybrid nanomaterials with tremendous potential for clean environmental remediation 2 experimental 2 1 materials sodium molybdate

experiments the batch equilibrium adsorption technique is employed to study the adsorption phenomenon it is determined that the adsorbent is mixed with the aqueous metal solutions for a certain period before it is separated using an external nd magnet the residual metal ion concentration in a mixture is determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms only to assess the selectivity of the as prepared adsorbents later on a uv visible spectrophotometer was employed in subsequent sorption studies of cr vi and cip from aqueous and simulated real wastewater samples the adsorption of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is determined by comparing the difference in the metal ion concentration before and after the sorption process the amount of cr vi adsorbed per gram of adsorbent is calculated by the equations shown below 32 1 q e 10 3 c o c e v m 2 q t c o c t v m 3 k d c o c f v c f m where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cr vi metal

distribution coefficient defined in eq 3 when tested against a combination of metal ions the fe3o4 mos2 cs demonstrated high selectivity for the cr vi ions the batch equilibrium technique is used for 24 h of contact time to evaluate the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 mos2 cs towards cr vi at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 scanning electron microscopy sem analysis the detailed morphology and size distribution of as prepared magnetic nanohybrid materials is demonstrated by sem analysis displayed in fig 1 the surface morphology of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials are well supported with tem results the spherical fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps are smooth and are uniformly dispersed on two dimensional ultrathin mos2 nanosheets fig 1a c as reported in the literature 33 34 the mnps are uniformly grown over the surface of mos2 nanosheets with an average particle size of about 20 nm it is observed that in magnetic fe3o4 mos2 nanocomposite the mnps are aggregated together to some extent thereby reducing the surface area and activity the 2d morphology of mos2 in fe3o4 mos2 is not destroyed after the functionalization with fe3o4 nanoparticles during the synthesis process which could be one of the advantages of environmental remediation in fe3o4 mos2 cs magnetic fe3o4 mos2 is highly interconnected within the cs matrix forming nanometer sized mesopores thereby suggesting successful synthesis of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial fig 1d f a closer look at the sem images of fe3o4 mos2 cs reveals that the aggregation of fe3o4 nanoparticles and stacking of mos2 nanosheets are highly reduced in the presence of the cs matrix this reduction in the aggregation and stacking of fe3o4 mos2 in the cs matrix improves the surface area and enhances the efficiency of the nanomaterial the elemental composition of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is determined by the eds element mapping technique figs s1 and s2 show a uniform distribution of the expected elements fe mo s and o in fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs respectively the sem eds results confirm the successful synthesis of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs magnetic nanomaterials 3 2 transmission electron microscopy tem analysis the high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem analysis is used to analyze the microstructural information of as synthesized magnetic nanohybrid materials as depicted in fig 2a c spherical fe3o4 nps are decorated over hexagonal nanosheets of mos2 with high crystallinity it has been observed from these tem images that fe3o4 nps are aggregated together to some extent in fe3o4 mos2 while as in fe3o4 mos2 cs the aggregation of fe3o4 nps is prevented due to the presence of cs biopolymer which is assumed due to the highly active functional groups and viscous nature of cs fig 2d f it has also been found that the sheet morphology of mos2 is slightly reduced and the mos2 sheets are wrapped up with a diameter of about 2 62 nm which is again due to the effect of the cs matrix these results reveal the presence of fe3o4 mos2 and cs phases together in the hybrid magnetic nanocomposite materials 3 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis the crystallinity and phase components of as prepared magnetic nanocomposite materials are studied with powder x ray diffraction the observed diffraction peaks in face centered cubic fe3o4 mos2 at 2θ 30 0 35 4 43 0 53 4 56 8 and 64 4 could be attributed to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of the magnetite phase 27 34 while as the diffraction peaks in fe3o4 mos2 at 2θ 14 4 32 7 39 6 49 7 and 60 1 could be indexed to 220 311 400 422 and 511 planes of mos2 nanosheets fig 3 35 37 the highly intense diffraction peak observed in the 002 plane of fe3o4 mos2 confirms the nature of mos2 nanosheets in fe3o4 mos2 sharp and intense diffraction bands are observed which confirm the nanocomposite material s well stacked crystalline nature apparently in fe3o4 mos2 cs all the above diffraction peaks are observed with less intensity this suggests the successful interaction or incorporation of fe3o4 mos2 into the polymer matrix which results in the lower crystallinity of the final fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial two additional peaks are observed in the fe3o4 mos2 cs 2θ 18 25 and 44 17 represented by green circles in fig 3 confirming the successful interaction between fe3o4 mos2 and cs phases 3 4 raman spectra analysis the chemical nature of as prepared magnetic nanohybrid materials is determined by raman spectra using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm in fig 4 the well resolved raman peaks observed in fe3o4 mos2 at 218 282 and 592 cm 1 correspond to a1g vibrational modes of fe3o4 and these bands are slightly shifted from that of pure raman spectra of pure fe3o4 nps 33 38 while the peaks observed at 377 and 403 cm 1 could be attributed to the 1e2g and a1g vibrational modes of mos2 39 an additional peak is also observed at 781 cm 1 which has been assumed due to the moo3 bond vibrations the raman peaks observed in fe3o4 mos2 are slightly shifted towards lower values as compared with their pure precursors which confirms the interaction between the fe3o4 nps and mos2 nanosheets on the other hand in fe3o4 mos2 cs all observed raman peaks are shifted slightly towards lower wavelengths with respect to the raman spectra of fe3o4 mos2 this also suggests an interaction between fe3o4 mos2 and cs biopolymer in fe3o4 mos2 cs two additional raman peaks observed at 1304 and 1572 cm 1 could be attributed to cs 40 3 5 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area adsorbents which possess excellent porosity and high surface area characteristics are ideal for removing toxic pollutants from the environment owing to the increased surface active sites the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterials show type h3 hysteresis loops and type iv isotherms which confirms the mesoporous nature of as prepared samples the surface area of fe3o4 mos2 cs 39 m2 g is much higher than fe3o4 mos2 21 m2 g which results due to the presence of cs the pore volume and pore size of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs were analyzed by barrett joyner halenda bjh methods the pore volume and maximum pore size of as prepared magnetic materials are shown in table s1 fe3o4 mos2 cs possesses a higher pore size and pore volume compared to the pore volume with fe3o4 mos2 which is highly beneficial for toxic metal removal 3 6 magnetic properties the magnetic characteristics of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs were studied with vsm at an ambient temperature the magnetic hysteresis mh curves of prepared nanomaterials are shown in fig 5 the slope of the mh curve is close to zero which is a characteristic feature of superparamagnetic materials 41 the magnetic saturation values of fe3o4 mos2 68 emu g are higher as compared with fe3o4 mos2 cs 59 60 emu g the decrease in magnetization emu g for fe3o4 mos2 cs is due to incorporating cs content and a change in shape anisotropy it is evident from fig 5 that the black homogeneous suspension of fe3o4 mos2 cs can be easily separated by the magnet from the solution phase furthermore the ms values of fe3o4 mos2 are higher than fe3o4 mos2 cs leading to the agglomeration of fe3o4 mos2 microspheres and low adsorbent capacity by lowering the surface active sites 3 7 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the electronic interaction and chemical composition of fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial are analyzed by the xps technique as displayed in fig 6 fig 6a displays the full survey xps spectrum of fe3o4 mos2 cs in which fe mo s o c and n elements are present the high resolution peaks observed for mo in fe3o4 mos2 cs at 230 and 233 ev indicate the presence of mo iv in the sample and are attributed to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 respectively fig 6b the high resolution xps spectrum of fe 2p consists of two bands around 712 and 725 ev that is associated with fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively which could be related to fe ii and fe iii of fe3o4 fig 6c the absence of a satellite peak at around 720 ev in fig 6c confirms that no ɣ fe2o3 phase is formed a typical core level spectrum of s exhibits two bands at 163 and 164 ev which corresponds to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 fig 6d fig 6e shows the o 1 s spectrum in which two bands are observed at 530 8 and 532 2 ev which correspond to feo and surface bonded hydroxyl groups respectively the results obtained from xps spectra of fe3o4 mos2 cs are in good concurrence with fe3o4 mos2 based nanocomposite materials as cited in the literature thereby confirming the formation of fe3o4 mos2 cs hybrid nanocomposite 33 39 3 8 adsorption properties effect of solid content ph and zeta potential phpzc the adsorbent dosage is a key factor that has a significant impact on the adsorption process in this work different adsorbent amounts 0 5 1 5 g l 1 are mixed with the solution containing a fixed concentration of 30 ppm of cr vi ions from fig 7a the adsorption efficiency increases as the amount of adsorbent increases until the saturation level is reached 1 g l 1 as predicted the adsorption capacity increases with the adsorbent concentration which might be due to more surface active sites on the magnetic hybrid nanomaterial at the higher dosage of the adsorbent 1 2 g l 1 the removal capacity increased slightly and was insignificant hence 1 g l 1 is used as the optimum amount of the adsorbent in all experiments in this work furthermore from fig 7a it is observed that fe3o4 mos2 cs hybrid nanocomposite shows improved adsorption capacity as compared with fe3o4 mos2 while keeping all the reaction conditions ideal the optimum concentration of the adsorbent for cip adsorption is kept fixed at 1 g l 1 the phenomenon of the adsorption process depends upon several factors ph directly impacts the sorption process as it affects the charge on the adsorbent surface and toxic metals fig 7b shows the removal capacity of cr vi by fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs in different ph solutions the removal efficiency of both the adsorbents decreases with increasing the solution ph fe3o4 mos2 cs shows higher adsorption capacity as compared with fe3o4 mos2 at ph 4 0 hence ph 4 0 is the optimum ph used in subsequent experiments this high adsorption capacity shown by fe3o4 mos2 cs in an acidic medium mainly corresponds to the following aspects the surface active functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent could be protonated and deprotonated which relies on the solution ph the functional moieties are protonated and bear a net positive charge at lower ph values in contrast in a neutral or basic ph these functional groups are either neutral or bear a negative charge on the adsorbent surface hcro4 is the major species of cr vi in the acidic ph hence in an acidic ph the adsorbent surface becomes positively charged which results in high adsorption of hcro4 cip adsorption on the adsorbent was also studied at different ph values as displayed in fig 7c the adsorption of cip is maximum at neutral ph which is assumed due to the surface charge of cip and the adsorbents cip molecules can be protonated or deprotonated depending upon the solution s ph it exists in the cationic form at a ph 5 8 while the zwitterionic state exists in the 5 9 to 8 9 ph range and the anionic form at a ph 9 both the adsorbents show maximum adsorption capacity towards the zwitterionic state of cip at neutral ph the adsorption of cip decreases in an acidic medium because both the adsorbate and the adsorbent bear a positive charge resulting in electrostatic repulsion while as in basic medium ph 9 the hydroxyl ions also compete for adsorption on the adsorbent which also leads to lower adsorption efficiency of cip the sorption of cr vi over the adsorbents is further explained with the help of zeta potential the phzpc is determined by dissolving the adsorbents 0 1 g in 50 ml of kcl solution the initial ph is kept constant by using 0 1 m naoh or hcl and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 24 h and the final ph is measured the zero point charge phzpc of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is calculated by plotting δph phinitial phfinal against phinitial and is found to be 6 8 and 6 5 respectively fig 7d when ph phzpc the adsorbent surface active functional groups are protonated and possess a net positive charge while as ph phzpc the adsorbent surface becomes negatively charged the cr vi ions exist in the aqueous phase in the form of negative ions hence the strong electrostatic force of attraction between the positively charged adsorbent surface and the negatively charged cr vi ions results in the high removal efficiency from aqueous solutions furthermore the removal efficiency of the magnetic adsorbent is reduced with increasing solution ph which is due to the reduced surface charge this results in the repulsion between the adsorbent and the negatively charged cr vi metal ions from the aqueous solution and their uptake is significantly reduced 3 9 selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs the adsorption of cr vi by fe3o4 mos2 cs from the aqueous phase is carried out in the batch method the selectivity of fe3o4 mos2 cs towards the mixture of four metal ions cr vi cd ii as ii pb ii is shown in table s2 along with distribution coefficient kd values it has been observed that fe3o4 mos2 cs has displayed higher removal efficiency towards cr vi among the mixture of metal ions which demonstrates superb selectivity of the magnetic nanohybrid material the cr vi concentration in the supernatant is reduced to almost 8 110 ppb within a short period the selectivity displayed by fe3o4 mos2 cs towards cr vi from a mixture of metal ions is assumed by the strong electrostatic interactions between the positively charged surface functional groups of fe3o4 mos2 cs with anionic forms of cr vi metal ions as discussed in 3 8 sub section 3 10 adsorption isotherm the impact on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents was studied at varying initial concentrations of cr vi 10 300 mg l 1 and cip 5 100 mg l 1 at 298 k respectively the sorption capacity of the adsorbents increases with increasing the concentration of cr vi and cip and reaches a maximum value within a short period to elucidate the sorption efficiency isotherm analysis is a key factor in determining the type of interactions between the adsorbate cr vi cip and the adsorbents fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs the experimental data is simulated with non linear langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms the sorption isotherm parameters were calculated from the plot of q e versus c e and the correlation coefficient r2 was used to choose the most viable model that could account for the adsorption performance the maximum adsorption saturation curves for cr vi and cip are displayed in fig 8a b the experimental data reveal the adsorption of cr vi initially increases sharply and then approaches a limiting adsorption capacity in contrast the adsorption of cip increases almost linearly reaching a saturation value the observed phenomenon of the adsorption process is explained by langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the langmuir model is related to monolayer physical adsorption in which finite adsorption sites are present with equal energies for adsorption and desorption processes q e q max c e b 1 c e b where qe mg g 1 and ce mg l 1 are the equilibrium concentration of metal ions on the adsorbent and aqueous phase respectively qmax mg g 1 is the theoretical saturated sorption capacity and b is the langmuir constant the freundlich adsorption isotherm model deals with both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption processes the adsorption process could be either physical or chemical and this model is employed for the adsorption processes in which limited sorption capacity is not observed q e k f c e 1 n kf mg1 n ln g is the freundlich adsorption coefficient which provides insights into relative adsorption capacity and the value of n gives adsorption strength the saturated sorption capacity and other parameters associated with the langmuir and the freundlich models were determined by non linear regression analysis the values of qmax for cr vi and cip are listed in tables s3 and s4 respectively the experimental results are correlated with both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the qmax values of cr vi 175 4 mg g 1 are close to the experimentally obtained saturated sorption capacity while the qmax values of cip 190 7 mg g 1 are quite far away from the experimentally obtained saturated sorption capacity the variation in the qmax value and that of the experimental sorption capacity value of cip is assumed due to the linearity sorption curve of cip the value of the correlation coefficient close to unity and higher regression coefficient suggests that the removal of cr vi by fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is well supported by the langmuir model in contrast the sorption of cip follows both langmuir and freundlich models hence the adsorption of cr vi onto the as prepared adsorbents follows monolayer coverage while cip sorption follows both the monolayer and multilayer coverage and both the simulation models provide clear insights into this phenomenon the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 mos2 cs and fe3o4 mos2 is much higher than other adsorbents reported in the literature shown in table s5 the sorption capacity of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 cs is more significant in terms of the amount of the adsorbent time and efficiency than the reported adsorbents 3 11 adsorption kinetics to understand the mechanism of adsorption different pathways for adsorption and rate of adsorption the sorption kinetics of as prepared materials were investigated until equilibrium was attained it is critical to determine the adsorption kinetics to develop and design efficient and sustainable adsorption systems in addition the sorption kinetics also interprets the sorption mechanism transition intermediates and factors affecting the reaction rate during the adsorbate adsorbent complex the non linear form of pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order kinetic models pso were used in this study to understand the sorption kinetics furthermore the removal of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs was monitored by the intraparticle diffusion model to determine the diffusion mechanism 3 11 1 pseudo first order kinetic model in several instances the pfo model is often relevant to the early stages of sorption processes and does not follow well to the whole contact time range 26 the pfo model proposed by lagergren is used to get the value of the adsorption rate constant based on adsorption capacity 27 as 4 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t where qt and qe represent the amounts of adsorbate adsorbed on adsorbent mg g 1 at any time t min and at equilibrium respectively and k1 is the rate constant of pfo adsorption min 1 the non linear plot of qt versus t as shown in fig 9 a b and the values of calculated sorption capacity qe rate constant k1 and correlation coefficients r2 for the sorption of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs are summarized in table 1 the qe values calculated from pfo are not in good agreement with the experimental values these results suggested that cr vi and cip adsorption onto fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs did not occur according to pfo kinetics 3 11 2 pseudo second order kinetic model the pso kinetic model assumes that the rate limiting factor in the chemisorption process involves the valence forces through sharing of electrons between the functional groups of the adsorbent and adsorbate 26 the behavior is more accurately anticipated by the pso model over the whole range of adsorption which may be expressed as 5 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption g mg 1 min 1 the non linear plot of qt versus t is shown in fig 9a b and the values of pso parameters qt and k2 were displayed in table 1 along with the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 for the sorption of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs the results showed that the r2 values were near unity 0 99 as compared with r2 values from the pfo model for both cr vi and cip pollutants this suggests the applicability of the pso kinetic model to explain the sorption process of cr vi and cip onto adsorbents the calculated qt values for cr vi and cip sorption correlate rather well with the experimental qt values table 1 as a result the pso kinetic model provides more accurate insights into the adsorption kinetics of cr vi and cip being adsorbed onto the adsorbents furthermore fe3o4 mos2 cs displays more sorption capacity for both cr vi and cip pollutants as compared with fe3o4 mos2 this is assumed due to more surface active sites and the large surface area of fe3o4 mos2 cs 3 11 3 intraparticle diffusion study it is assumed that the sorption of adsorbate on adsorbent involves either one or multiple steps such as pore diffusion surface diffusion film or external diffusion 42 the intraparticle diffusion model is often rate limiting in a batch reactor process an empirical relationship proposed by weber and morris states that if intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step then the amount of adsorbate adsorbed on the adsorbent varies with the square root of time to determine the diffusion mechanism the kinetic results were analyzed by the intra particle diffusion model expressed as q t k id t 1 2 c i where qt mg g 1 represents the adsorption capacity at time t min kid is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 and ci is the intercept mg g 1 a plot of qt vs t1 2 for intraparticle diffusion of cr vi and cip on fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs is shown in fig 9c d the parameters kid ci and r2 derived from the plots are displayed in table 2 the thickness of the boundary layer is governed by the values of ci i e the larger the intercept the greater the boundary layer effect 43 the adsorption process is governed only by intra particle diffusion if the plot of q t vs t 1 2 is linear and passes through the origin the results showed multi linear patterns suggesting that the adsorption process involves multiple steps the first small linear portion corresponds to film diffusion and the second step involves a gradual sorption process where intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting the third portion represents the equilibrium stage where the concentration of adsorbate in the solution is very low which results in the slowdown of the intraparticle diffusion process fig 9c d shows that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting phase in the adsorption process 3 12 cr vi and cip uptake from real water the removal efficacy of fe3o4 mos2 cs is further validated by analyzing the adsorption of the studied pollutants from real water samples obtained from a local lake in aligarh india the visible impurities of the water samples were removed by filtration prior to their usage the amount of cr vi and cip in real water samples is determined by the spiking technique the real wastewater samples were spiked with known cr vi and cip concentration 5 ppm to 15 ppm fe3o4 mos2 cs shows excellent adsorption efficiency towards cr vi than cip as displayed in table 3 the spiking technique reveals the practical application of the fe3o4 mos2 cs nanohybrid material to remove cr vi and cip from real wastewater samples 3 13 mechanism of adsorption the sorption of cr vi and cip onto the adsorbents from the aqueous phase were analyzed on the bases of sorption kinetics isotherm ph and zeta potential multiple processes often coexist during the adsorption phenomenon for instance surface complexation ion exchange and electrostatic interactions occur between the adsorbent and the pollutants 43 44 our results demonstrated that cr vi and cip were adsorbed onto the surface of fe3o4 mos2 cs which is consistent with the findings of earlier research 45 47 the ftir spectra of fe3o4 mos2 and fe3o4 mos2 cs are shown in fig s3 no obvious change in the ftir spectra of the two adsorbents is observed only there is a slight reduction in the peak intensities of fe3o4 mos2 cs which is assumed due to the presence of chitosan to analyze the removal mechanism the ftir spectra of fe3o4 mos2 cs are taken before and after cr vi and cip adsorption to provide a more in depth explanation of these phenomena fig 10 in the ftir spectra of fe3o4 mos2 cs the absorption band observed at 582 cm 1 corresponds the stretching vibrations of feo groups this band is sharp and smooth with high intensity before adsorption and the intensity gets reduced after adsorption which reveals the interaction of fe with other groups a broadband appeared at 3400 cm 1 before and after cr vi adsorption which corresponds to stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups in fe oh groups this band becomes less broad and more intense after the adsorption of cip which is assumed due to the presence of more hydroxyl groups from cip cooh a sharp band observed after the adsorption of cip at 1395 cm 1 corresponds to oh bending vibrations feoh cip cooh the peak observed at 1632 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of nh groups cip chitosan with a similar trend as that of 3400 cm 1 48 49 finally the band appeared at 1106 cm 1 before and after adsorption is attributed to the co stretching vibration of chitosan 50 thus the ftir implications and findings reveal that the cr vi and cip are mainly adsorbed on the surface of the fe3o4 mos2 cs nanomaterial as confirmed from the ph and zeta potential studies the cr vi exists in the anionic state and the surface of the adsorbent bears a positive charge in an acidic medium hence there is the possibility of electrostatic interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent on the other hand cip bears a positive charge in an acidic medium a negative charge in a basic medium and exists in the zwitterionic form in neutral ph in the acidic medium there is repulsion between the adsorbate and the adsorbent while as in the basic medium hydroxyl ions also compete for adsorption which results in the reduced removal efficiency of the fe3o4 mos2 cs hence the maximum removal efficiency of cip on fe3o4 mos2 cs is observed via electrostatic interactions at neutral ph 3 14 adsorption regeneration from a practical point of view the stability and recovery of the adsorbent are significant parameters to evaluate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of the adsorbent the cr vi adsorbed on the fe3o4 mos2 cs is desorbed using 2 m naoh and the surface active sites were reactivated by 1 m hcl the recyclability efficiency and the sorption capacity were examined for three consecutive adsorption desorption cycles fig 11 after three consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles the regenerated sample exhibited 89 cr vi metal ion removal this slight decrease in sorption capacity can be attributed to the structural changes in the structure of cs during chemical washing and drying processes 4 conclusion in summary a novel magnetic biosorbent has been developed by embedding fe3o4 mos2 nanosheets into crosslinked cs by ex situ method to remove heavy metals and cip from synthetic and simulated real wastewater the results showed that fe3o4 mos2 cs exhibited a high removal capacity for cr vi and cip in an aqueous phase which is assumed due to the presence of abundant amino functional groups on the cs surface and highly active sulfur groups on mos2 the adsorption efficiency highly relies upon the contaminant solution ph and the saturated adsorption efficiency of cr vi 175 4 mg g 1 and cip 190 7 mg g 1 is found to be ph 4 0 and 7 0 respectively the sorption isotherm of cr vi on fe3o4 mos2 cs is followed by both langmuir and freundlich models with a maximum sorption capacity of 175 4 mg g 1 while as the kinetics of sorption follows the pseudo second order model the adsorbed cr vi could be effectively desorbed by washing with 2 m naoh solution and the adsorbent surface active sites are reactivated by 1 m hcl the superparamagnetic properties of fe3o4 mos2 cs with zero coercivity enable its easy separation from wastewater with the external magnet this study could develop novel magnetic hybrid nanomaterials with excellent adsorption properties which

12634,few studies have been carried out on sludge blankets in treatment systems however the sludge blanket in a uasb system is the area where microorganisms responsible for converting organic matter into biogas are concentrated considering its importance the present research aimed to study the sludge blanket of three uasb reactors used in the treatment of sugarcane vinasse pilot scale the main difference between them was the applied effluent recirculation rate 100 200 and 400 the research objective was to analyze the sludge blanket of these reactors to determine the granulometry the concentration of zinc lead cadmium nickel iron manganese copper total chromium calcium magnesium sodium and potassium and the organic and inorganic contents aiming to identify the physical chemical alterations in the sludge caused during the operational period a reduction in the granular diameter was observed in all systems up to the range between 0 4 and 1 mm provided by the increase in the hydraulic load the organic loading rate and biogas production and the increase in the mineral fraction in the sludge blanket associated with the metal contribution of vinasse to the sludge blanket metal accumulation such as magnesium sodium calcium and potassium was not detrimental to the methanogenic process due to the strategy of adapting biomass to vinasse by gradually increasing the vinasse load and the effects of antagonisms between magnesium and sodium and between potassium and sodium which reduced its toxic effects graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic process granules granulometry vinasse uasb data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recognizing the granulation process was a milestone in the anaerobic digestion of wastewater as this phenomenon increases the efficiency and applicability of uasb reactors in the anaerobic treatment of high organic load effluents 1 each granule present in the sludge is thought to contain all of the microorganisms necessary for the complete breakdown of wastewater organic contaminants in biogas 2 3 due to the compact nature of the granules there is a close association between anaerobic microorganisms resulting from the shortest diffusion distance to the metabolite transfer 4 the main factors of the granulation phenomenon are addressed by various approaches in the literature hulshoff pol et al gathered information about the existing theories and divided them into physical microbial and thermodynamics groups parameters such as liquid and biogas upflow velocity shear force and removal of excess sludge are considered to be mainly responsible for the granulation phenomenon in physical theory 5 according to mill et al granule size affects various granule properties such as porosity mass transfer and settling velocity all of which are important for substrate conversion and bioreactor performance sludge blankets can form granules naturally and sizes generally vary between 0 5 and 5 mm in diameter 6 however some researchers point out smaller diameter ranges such as 0 5 to 3 mm 7 0 4 to 2 mm 8 1 3 to 1 9 9 and 1 mm 10 the diffusion difficulty of the substrate in the granule can occur due to the increase in the granular dimension and results in the appearance of a central cavity thinning the granule walls which become more susceptible to rupture by shear forces washing with the effluent and disintegration 7 11 13 some scientific studies have related the size of the granule to the granular resistance property upflow velocity excess biomass disposal the biological process of cell growth and decay granule forming microorganisms and the concentration and type of substrate 11 14 15 the chemical composition of wastewater treated in biological systems has a significant impact on the chemical composition and structure of the granules 16 gutiérrez et al observed that the average diameter of the granules reduced to 0 3 mm with a consequent reduction in methane production due to the presence in the wastewater of nonylphenol ethoxylate a substance present worldwide in the formulation of cleaning products 10 wastewater has a specific characteristic inherent to its origin often with metal concentrations higher than those defined in the literature as essential for the anaerobic digestion 17 the impact of the metal content found in the effluent to be treated on the sludge can be advantageous or inhibitory depending on factors such as concentration of the constituents biomass adaptation antagonism and synergism and environmental and operational conditions the analysis of the organic load applied to the sludge hydraulic retention time upflow velocity ph temperature salinity availability of nutrients and presence of toxic substances and heavy metals must be observed to ensure the stability of the system 18 19 the inhibition of treatment systems can be caused by an adverse change in the microbial population or by inhibition of growth 20 and is observed by the reduction in the rate of methane gas production and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids the harmful effects of substances present in wastewater can be neutralized with operational strategies such as increasing the biomass retention time in the reactor 21 and the adaptation period 22 however in specific amounts some of these substances such as calcium magnesium iron and copper are favorable for microbial development as they act as important macronutrients and micronutrients for cell aggregation 23 light metal ions such as magnesium sodium potassium and calcium are often present in anaerobic digesters the latter being essential for the growth of certain methanogenic groups due to their importance in the formation and resistance of granules and in the retention of biomass in the system 24 26 however an excessive amount of calcium leads to the precipitation of carbonate and phosphate and provides toxicity in the anaerobic system the metallic elements mentioned can be released by the degradation of organic matter or added by means of ph adjustment chemicals 27 some of these constituents with coagulation properties can influence the microbial aggregation process considering that these elements act on microbial development and consequently affect the specific growth rate as any other nutrient the use of alkali with sodium to buffer the system represents potential harmful effects to the microorganisms involved in the process and the salinization of the soil when the effluent in question as is the case of vinasse is used for fertigation according to hierholtzer and akunna inhibition of the anaerobic process by sodium occurs through an increase in osmotic pressure or microbial dehydration 28 heavy metals such as iron zinc chromium copper cadmium and nickel can be present in concentrations harmful to the anaerobic process a distinctive feature of heavy metals is that unlike many other potentially toxic substances they accumulate and cause the system to fail 29 however the lack of some of them can cause a deficiency in the treatment as these substances are necessary cofactors for the functioning of the enzymes 26 30 much of the wastewater from industries such as vinasse is made up of abundant metals and is therefore challenging for the development of anaerobic digestion since in excess these constituents can be the cause of the failure in the treatment system due to overloading the sludge blanket vinasse wastewater from the production of alcohol and sugar from sugarcane rich in organic matter and potassium is characterized as an effluent with polluting power about 100 times greater than that of domestic sewage 31 despite the granular sludge blanket being responsible for the treatment efficiency no studies in the scientific literature have investigated the effects of vinasse on the physicochemical characteristics of the granules in general little emphasis has been given to understanding the importance of granules for anaerobic treatment optimization more studies are needed to evaluate the effects of different wastewater and operational parameters on the reactor sludge blanket to achieve better efficiencies and avoid system failures considering this context the present study analyzed the effect of the gradual exposure of the sludge blanket of uasb reactors submitted to sugarcane vinasse in order to analyze the influence of operational parameters organic loading rate substrate dilution and upflow velocity and the metals present in this wastewater zinc lead cadmium nickel iron manganese copper total chromium calcium magnesium sodium and potassium to the sludge blanket especially in its granulometry and chemical composition 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum the inoculum sludge came from the full scale uasb reactor treating waste from the ideal poultry slaughterhouse located in pereira são paulo the total volatile solids tvs and total fixed solids tfs concentrations were 43 g l 1 and 7 g l 1 respectively and specific methanogenic activity sma was 0 51 g cod g 1tvs day 1 table 1 shows the operating characteristics of the uasb reactor from which the sludge used as the inoculum in the present study was collected these characteristics can be important to understanding the changes in this sludge inoculum after being subjected to sugarcane vinasse processing under different operational conditions 2 2 wastewater the vinasse used from the rio pardo plant located in cerqueira césar são paulo was concentrated in the industry by evaporation due to the high organic load of the concentrated vinasse between 180 and 200 g cod l 1 dilution was necessary before use the defined feed concentration was approximately 20 g cod l 1 the characteristics of vinasse after dilution are shown in table 2 sodium bicarbonate was used to buffer the system the amount added initially was 1 g nahco3 g 1cod this value was gradually reduced to 0 3 g nahco3 g 1cod in 100 days maintaining this proportion until the end of the operation 2 3 uasb reactors and operational parameters the granular sludge blanket of three pilot scale uasb reactors r1 r2 and r3 for processing sugarcane alcohol distillery vinasse was analyzed during the operational period these systems were built using pvc they measured 19 5 cm in diameter d had a total volume of 120 l and height of 4 m were equipped with a modified three phase separator and equipped with an effluent recirculation device fig 1 they were inoculated with 60 l of anaerobic sludge reaction zone and provided with effluent recirculation at a rate of 100 200 and 400 compared to the feed volume for r1 r2 and r3 respectively the recirculation was aimed at diluting the vinasse and reducing the need to add alkali the reactors were provided with several sample collection points in the reactor the hydraulic rates and organic loading rates olr applied to the uasb reactors were staggered and increased aiming mainly at adapting the anaerobic sludge to the vinasse and at verifying the potential for reducing organic matter and generating methane the rise in organic loading rate occurred with the increase in vinasse flow rate which showed a relatively constant concentration of organic matter in terms of cod 20 g l 1 the weekly olr increase ranged from 20 at the beginning of the operation to 2 at the end of the operation some conditions for the increase in olr were assumed minimum organic material removal of 80 in terms of cod and concentration of methane in the biogas 60 table 3 shows the flow rates recirculation rates organic loading rates upflow velocities and operating times efficiency data from the r2 reactor presented in table 3 was published by del nery et al 47 the removed olr in these systems represented approximately 80 of the olr applied to all evaluated conditions the percentage of methane in the biogas was always above 60 the methane yield rates in the reactors compared to theoretical values ranged from 74 to 87 the average operating temperature of the reactors was 22 3 c in winter heaters were placed close to the reactors to avoid sudden temperature fluctuations the operating time of the reactors was up to 617 days for the r3 reactor table 3 2 4 sample collection method during the operation period eight sample collections of the sludge blanket from each of the reactors were carried out to evaluate the granulometry mineral fraction and metal content during the operational period the collections occurred at the organic loading rates of 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 15 17 5 and 20 g cod l 1 day 1 the sludge was removed from five points of the vertical profile of the reaction area an area inoculated with anaerobic sludge fig 1 before collecting samples from the sludge blanket the system was kept under the same conditions for approximately two weeks one liter of composite sample was collected with 200 ml of each of the five sampling points the removal was done from the top point 5 to the bottom point 1 due to the resettling of the sludge particles fig 1 from the homogenized composite sample the aliquot was removed for analysis the analysis of metals was performed in all samples and the granulometry in olrs of 5 10 15 and 20 g cod l 1d 1 2 5 determination of granulometry mineral fraction and metal content of the sludge blanket the granule size was determined according to a methodology proposed by alves et al 32 in this methodology the granules are carefully separated and placed in petri dishes and the images of these plates are captured and analyzed in the pro plus software version 6 0 nine bands of diameter were determined in mm 0 4 1 0 1 5 1 6 2 0 1 2 5 2 6 3 0 1 3 5 3 6 4 0 1 5 and 4 6 5 0 the lowest diameter 0 4 mm was defined according to the methodology limit and the highest 5 0 mm diameter was defined according to the granulometric data of the sampled granules themselves granular diameter frequency was estimated using basic descriptive statistics the kruskal wallis and tukey statistical tests were applied to verify whether the changes between one condition and the other were significant the statistical program used was past 4 02 to evaluate the possible effects of the organic load of the vinasse on the granular diameter the granulometry data of the reactors r1 r2 and r3 were analyzed and compared in the stages in which they were submitted to similar upflow velocities 0 125 m h 1 table 4 the mineral fraction of the sludge blanket was measured by the total fixed solids tfs and total solids ts ratio and the organic fraction by the total volatile solids tvs and total solids ts ratio determined according to apha et al 33 the quantified metals were zinc lead cadmium nickel iron manganese copper total chromium calcium magnesium sodium and potassium the analysis was performed by atomic absorption through the anaerobic sludge ash obtained by ignition in a 450 c muffle dissolved in acids 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 granulometry the analyses of the inoculum sludge and the sludge blanket of the reactors in the studied olrs showed that different granule sizes coexisted in the reactor the size of the analyzed granules ranged from 0 4 to 5 0 mm which is a diameter range pointed out in the literature as usual for anaerobic granules 6 34 however 99 8 0 1 of them had diameters between 0 4 and 3 5 mm fig 2 the greatest reduction in the granular diameter was observed in the r3 sludge blanket with 400 recirculation and was mainly associated with the higher upflow velocity 0 417 m h 1 in the last analyzed phase figs 2 and 3 statistically r1 with 100 recirculation and maximum upflow velocity of 0 167 m h 1 showed minor changes in the granular diameter its samples exposed to olrs 5 and 10 g cod l 1 day 1 with upflow velocities of 0 042 and 0 084 m h 1 respectively and those exposed to olrs 15 and 20 gcod l 1 day 1 with upflow velocities of 0 125 and 0 167 m h 1 respectively showed statistically equal particle size distributions veronez et al 35 who tested the effect of the upflow velocity by the effluent recirculation of 0 072 0 10 0 19 8 and 10 m h 1 observed a reduction in the granular diameter and the efficiency of the system at the highest upflow velocities 8 and 10 m h 1 in the present study with a maximum applied upflow velocity of 0 417 m h 1 a reduction in granular diameter was observed but not a reduction in treatment efficiency the average cod removal efficiency of the reactors was 88 7 and biogas methane content was 67 6 the influent concentration determined by the cod may also have influenced the granular dynamics r3 which showed the greatest reduction in granular diameter had the highest dilution 5 6 g cod l 1 due to the higher recirculation rate table 3 according to grotenhuis et al who tested propionate concentrations for feeding with 2 1 2 4 4 7 and 6 9 g cod l 1 the lower the cod of the feed the smaller the granule size 14 despite the higher recirculation rates that increased the dilution of the reactor feed they resulted in higher applied olrs table 3 and higher biogas production as a result the shear and hydraulic disturbance caused by the release of the biogas produced was also a factor that contributed to the reduction in the granular diameter corroborating the fact that the r3 reactor which received the largest olr had the greatest reduction in the granular diameter in the largest analyzed olrs in an attempt to evaluate the isolated effect of the shear caused by the biogas produced in the systems grotenhuis et al applied a gas rate about 5 times higher than that produced in the system analyzed by them and observed a reduction of 18 in the granular diameter 14 when comparing the granular diameter of reactors r1 r2 and r3 submitted to the same upflow velocity approximately 0 125 m h 1 differences were observed in the particle size between the reactors therefore in addition to the upflow velocity the biogas production rate and the cod concentration of the vinasse also influenced the granule size in the uasb systems when the reactors were submitted to similar upflow velocities 0 125 m h 1 the r3 reactor was submitted to a lower olr 7 g cod l 1 day 1 table 5 and therefore presented lower biogas production and consequently smaller shear these characteristics provided larger granules in the sludge blanket compared to other reactors submitted to the same upflow velocity the extent of the influence of vinasse on the granulometry was observed early on at the beginning of the reactors through the changes observed in the reactor sludge compared to the original characteristics of the inoculum the inoculum sludge had 46 4 of the granules in the granulometric range of 2 1 to 2 5 mm fig 2 and after being subjected to vinasse processing the granular diameter was significantly reduced in all systems already in the first phase analyzed with an olr of 5 g cod l 1 day 1 fig 2 hulshoff pol et al pointed out that the type of substrate is an essential factor for granular dynamics in treatment systems because they can select the microbial groups that form the granules 5 these authors used different food sources all simple compared to the complexity of vinasse such as propionate glucose sucrose organic volatile acids mixture and glucose peptone and meat extract mixture gutiérrez et al and moura et al also observed that the change in substrate influenced treatment efficiency and granule size 9 10 the predominant microbial group in the granules is related to the resistance of these bioparticles in the literature methanosaeta sp is generally considered to be responsible for more dense and resistant granules 4 5 3 2 physico chemical characterization of the sludge blanket the sludge blanket of the reactors showed a reduction in the total solids content 47 compared to the inoculation due to losses in the effluent and the removal of samples however the microorganisms selected in the system withstand the applied loads and maintained the system s performance there was a reduction in the proportion of total volatile solids and an increase in the proportion of total fixed solids in all reactor samples compared to the inoculum table 6 the reactors with the highest recirculation 200 and 400 were those with the lowest particle size and the highest proportion of tfs ts at the end of the operational period mills et al also observed that the concentration of inorganic matter was higher in smaller granules 2 therefore the less marked reduction in particle size in r1 may be related to a higher proportion of tvs ts compared to tfs ts the increase in tfs ts was related to the contribution of inorganic elements present in vinasse a higher concentration of inorganic elements in the influent may have led to higher mass transfer limitations in the granules causing a reduction in the granular diameter the vinasse treated in the systems had a concentration of manganese potassium magnesium and sodium of 4 7 1 7 mg l 1 1625 600 mg l 1 254 76 mg l 1 and 23 6 mg l 1 respectively above those considered essential and below those considered inhibitory by 17 there was an increase in the concentration of these substances in the sludge of all reactors table 7 compared to the inoculum the accumulation of manganese in the sludge blanket was up to four times greater than that observed for the inoculum sludge table 7 the presence of manganese may have favored the system as this element acts in the stabilization of methyltransferase of methanogenic microorganisms in redox reaction 36 sodium and magnesium showed concentrations up to six times higher in the sludge blanket of the systems compared to the inoculum table 7 sodium is essential for methanogenic microorganisms in concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 mg l 1 stimulating the anaerobic growth of mesophilic microorganisms however at concentrations between 3500 and 5500 mg l 1 and around 8000 mg l 1 in wastewater it can be moderately and strongly inhibitory respectively 17 in the present study the sodium concentration in the wastewater was low table 7 but it had high concentrations in the sludge blanket the accumulation of sodium in the reactor blanket was attributed to the concentration of sodium bicarbonate added for the buffering of the system although high the accumulation of sodium did not inhibit the process of anaerobic digestion according to gagliano et al granulation can be maintained in environments subjected to high salinity 10 and 20 g l 1 of sodium 37 the magnesium concentration in the sludge blanket in turn was associated with its presence in the vinasse table 7 the optimal concentration of magnesium is not well defined in the literature and the concentrations that can cause toxicity are variable mccarty determined that concentrations between 75 and 150 mg l 1 are stimulants between 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 can be toxic but adaptable and around 3000 mg l 1 inhibitory 17 romero güiza et al however did not observe stimulation or inhibition by magnesium between 40 and 400 mg l 1 while minor and major inhibition was observed at concentrations between 750 and 1000 mg l 1 and between 2000 and 4000 mg l 1 respectively 38 the magnesium concentration in the vinasse used in the present study did not qualify as toxic or as a stimulant but it may have acted by reducing the toxicity of sodium to methanogenic microorganisms by antagonism 36 according to rabelo et al the average potassium concentration in vinasse from brazilian distilleries is 2034 mg l 1 39 in the present study the vinasse used showed 1645 mg l 1 of potassium and the concentration in the sludge blanket of the systems analyzed was up to 15 times higher than that found in the inoculum table 7 the potassium concentration in the vinasse was higher than that considered stimulant 200 and 400 mg l 1 by mccarty 17 but it did not fit in the concentrations described as possibly inhibitory 2500 and 4500 mg l 1 or inhibitory 12 000 mg l 1 despite the high concentration in the sludge blanket there was no reduction in the efficiency of the systems probably due to the adaptation of the biomass to the imposed conditions and the antagonistic relationship that according to mccarty sodium and potassium present and their respective concentrations may have canceled out their toxicities 17 according to chen and cheng after adapting the sludge blanket the treatment systems can withstand twice the potassium concentration initially considered to be inhibitory 40 the calcium concentration in the sludge blanket of reactors r1 and r2 increased in the first sludge samples collected in the olrs of 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 g dqo l 1 day 1 but decreased again during the olr increase from 12 5 to 20 g dqo l 1 day 1 the change in the calcium concentration in the sludge blanket was related to the standard deviation of the calcium content observed in the feeding vinasse 527 222 mg l 1 in the present study the calcium concentration in the feeding vinasse was higher than that indicated as a stimulant and below the toxic limit jackson moss et al found that calcium concentrations of up to 7000 mg l 1 are not inhibitory 41 mccarty in turn pointed out concentrations of 2500 to 4500 mg l 1 as causing moderate inhibition the concentration of 8000 mg l 1 as strongly inhibitory and a concentration of 100 to 200 mg l 1 as a stimulant for biofilm formation 17 in the sludge blanket of the reactors analyzed here the calcium concentration was high in all phases analyzed with a minimum of 9600 mg kg 1 and a maximum of up to 90 300 mg kg 1 table 7 yu et al presented that calcium concentrations in granules were about 10 times greater than in feeds 42 according to yu et al calcium concentrations from 100 to 200 mg l 1 benefited the granulation while concentrations of over 500 mg l 1 harmed the process the authors also indicated that better calcium concentration depends on the influent cod they reported that the optimal calcium concentration to influent cod kept at 400 mg l was between 150 and 300 mg l 1 42 they reported that the optimal calcium concentration found was between 150 and 300 mg l 1 when the influent cod concentration was kept at 4000 mg l 1 it was not possible to evaluate the isolated effect of calcium concentration in the conditions studied in this research but overall the inefficiency of the treatment systems was not observed and the granulometric structure of the sludge blanket was maintained although there was a reduction in the granular diameter iron and zinc concentrations in the sludge blanket varied during the operation of the reactors table 7 and therefore a tendency was not observed to reduce or accumulate these elements in the sludge blanket iron is present in the tissue of methanogenic microorganisms in concentrations higher than that of any other heavy metal and performs numerous functions in anaerobic processes due to its redox property and its role in the activation of several enzymes in addition to being able to form sulfide precipitates and promote excretion of extracellular polymers 36 zinc is also found in many methanogenic microorganisms and can be considered a superacid catalyst that works in many enzymatic processes 36 copper chromium cadmium and nickel were less present in the vinasse and sludge blanket of the reactors compared to the other constituents analyzed table 7 it was observed that copper was gradually released from the sludge blanket showing a reduction compared to the inoculum of 68 54 and 72 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively at the end of the operational period the chromium content in the sludge blanket was also reduced compared to the inoculum by up to 58 in r1 the reduction of copper and chromium in the sludge blanket of the reactors was related to the low concentration of these elements in the feeding vinasse copper and chromium functioned as nutrients for the cells promoting microbial activity 23 30 because to become inhibitory values above 1000 mgl 1 would be necessary 43 cadmium and nickel concentrations observed in the vinasse and sludge blanket of the reactors table 7 were also lower than those considered inhibitory by mueller and steiner 1992 who observed 50 inhibition by cadmium at concentrations of 650 mg l 1 and nickel toxicity at concentrations of 250 and 300 mg l 1 the presence of heavy metals such as chromium iron copper zinc cadmium and nickel was characterized as essential for microbial activity by fermoso et al 30 research carried out with sludge from 30 anaerobic digesters for wastewater treatment reported the possibility of limiting the anaerobic process due to the unavailability of some of these nutrients such as iron and nickel eight out of the 30 sludges observed showed an improvement in the rate of biogas production by at least 20 when supplemented with one of these elements 44 corroborating that iron and nickel acted in the present study as important nutrients for the results achieved by treatment systems 4 conclusion the increase in hydraulic load organic loading rate and biogas production contributed to the particle size reduction in the range of 0 4 1 0 mm there was an increase in the proportion of tfs ts in the granular sludge blanket provided by the inorganic elements present in vinasse the concentration of magnesium sodium potassium and calcium present in higher concentrations in vinasse was also present in greater amounts in the sludge blanket but did not cause damage to the performance of the reactors this result was associated with the strategy of adapting biomass to vinasse by gradually increasing the vinasse load funding this work was supported

12634,few studies have been carried out on sludge blankets in treatment systems however the sludge blanket in a uasb system is the area where microorganisms responsible for converting organic matter into biogas are concentrated considering its importance the present research aimed to study the sludge blanket of three uasb reactors used in the treatment of sugarcane vinasse pilot scale the main difference between them was the applied effluent recirculation rate 100 200 and 400 the research objective was to analyze the sludge blanket of these reactors to determine the granulometry the concentration of zinc lead cadmium nickel iron manganese copper total chromium calcium magnesium sodium and potassium and the organic and inorganic contents aiming to identify the physical chemical alterations in the sludge caused during the operational period a reduction in the granular diameter was observed in all systems up to the range between 0 4 and 1 mm provided by the increase in the hydraulic load the organic loading rate and biogas production and the increase in the mineral fraction in the sludge blanket associated with the metal contribution of vinasse to the sludge blanket metal accumulation such as magnesium sodium calcium and potassium was not detrimental to the methanogenic process due to the strategy of adapting biomass to vinasse by gradually increasing the vinasse load and the effects of antagonisms between magnesium and sodium and between potassium and sodium which reduced its toxic effects graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic process granules granulometry vinasse uasb data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recognizing the granulation process was a milestone in the anaerobic digestion of wastewater as this phenomenon increases the efficiency and applicability of uasb reactors in the anaerobic treatment of high organic load effluents 1 each granule present in the sludge is thought to contain all of the microorganisms necessary for the complete breakdown of wastewater organic contaminants in biogas 2 3 due to the compact nature of the granules there is a close association between anaerobic microorganisms resulting from the shortest diffusion distance to the metabolite transfer 4 the main factors of the granulation phenomenon are addressed by various approaches in the literature hulshoff pol et al gathered information about the existing theories and divided them into physical microbial and thermodynamics groups parameters such as liquid and biogas upflow velocity shear force and removal of excess sludge are considered to be mainly responsible for the granulation phenomenon in physical theory 5 according to mill et al granule size affects various granule properties such as porosity mass transfer and settling velocity all of which are important for substrate conversion and bioreactor performance sludge blankets can form granules naturally and sizes generally vary between 0 5 and 5 mm in diameter 6 however some researchers point out smaller diameter ranges such as 0 5 to 3 mm 7 0 4 to 2 mm 8 1 3 to 1 9 9 and 1 mm 10 the diffusion difficulty of the substrate in the granule can occur due to the increase in the granular dimension and results in the appearance of a central cavity thinning the granule walls which become more susceptible to rupture by shear forces washing with the effluent and disintegration 7 11 13 some scientific studies have related the size of the granule to the granular resistance property upflow velocity excess biomass disposal the biological process of cell growth and decay granule forming microorganisms and the concentration and type of substrate 11 14 15 the chemical composition of wastewater treated in biological systems has a significant impact on the chemical composition and structure of the granules 16 gutiérrez et al observed that the average diameter of the granules reduced to 0 3 mm with a consequent reduction in methane production due to the presence in the wastewater of nonylphenol ethoxylate a substance present worldwide in the formulation of cleaning products 10 wastewater has a specific characteristic inherent to its origin often with metal concentrations higher than those defined in the literature as essential for the anaerobic digestion 17 the impact of the metal content found in the effluent to be treated on the sludge can be advantageous or inhibitory depending on factors such as concentration of the constituents biomass adaptation antagonism and synergism and environmental and operational conditions the analysis of the organic load applied to the sludge hydraulic retention time upflow velocity ph temperature salinity availability of nutrients and presence of toxic substances and heavy metals must be observed to ensure the stability of the system 18 19 the inhibition of treatment systems can be caused by an adverse change in the microbial population or by inhibition of growth 20 and is observed by the reduction in the rate of methane gas production and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids the harmful effects of substances present in wastewater can be neutralized with operational strategies such as increasing the biomass retention time in the reactor 21 and the adaptation period 22 however in specific amounts some of these substances such as calcium magnesium iron and copper are favorable for microbial development as they act as important macronutrients and micronutrients for cell aggregation 23 light metal ions such as magnesium sodium potassium and calcium are often present in anaerobic digesters the latter being essential for the growth of certain methanogenic groups due to their importance in the formation and resistance of granules and in the retention of biomass in the system 24 26 however an excessive amount of calcium leads to the precipitation of carbonate and phosphate and provides toxicity in the anaerobic system the metallic elements mentioned can be released by the degradation of organic matter or added by means of ph adjustment chemicals 27 some of these constituents with coagulation properties can influence the microbial aggregation process considering that these elements act on microbial development and consequently affect the specific growth rate as any other nutrient the use of alkali with sodium to buffer the system represents potential harmful effects to the microorganisms involved in the process and the salinization of the soil when the effluent in question as is the case of vinasse is used for fertigation according to hierholtzer and akunna inhibition of the anaerobic process by sodium occurs through an increase in osmotic pressure or microbial dehydration 28 heavy metals such as iron zinc chromium copper cadmium and nickel can be present in concentrations harmful to the anaerobic process a distinctive feature of heavy metals is that unlike many other potentially toxic substances they accumulate and cause the system to fail 29 however the lack of some of them can cause a deficiency in the treatment as these substances are necessary cofactors for the functioning of the enzymes 26 30 much of the wastewater from industries such as vinasse is made up of abundant metals and is therefore challenging for the development of anaerobic digestion since in excess these constituents can be the cause of the failure in the treatment system due to overloading the sludge blanket vinasse wastewater from the production of alcohol and sugar from sugarcane rich in organic matter and potassium is characterized as an effluent with polluting power about 100 times greater than that of domestic sewage 31 despite the granular sludge blanket being responsible for the treatment efficiency no studies in the scientific literature have investigated the effects of vinasse on the physicochemical characteristics of the granules in general little emphasis has been given to understanding the importance of granules for anaerobic treatment optimization more studies are needed to evaluate the effects of different wastewater and operational parameters on the reactor sludge blanket to achieve better efficiencies and avoid system failures considering this context the present study analyzed the effect of the gradual exposure of the sludge blanket of uasb reactors submitted to sugarcane vinasse in order to analyze the influence of operational parameters organic loading rate substrate dilution and upflow velocity and the metals present in this wastewater zinc lead cadmium nickel iron manganese copper total chromium calcium magnesium sodium and potassium to the sludge blanket especially in its granulometry and chemical composition 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum the inoculum sludge came from the full scale uasb reactor treating waste from the ideal poultry slaughterhouse located in pereira são paulo the total volatile solids tvs and total fixed solids tfs concentrations were 43 g l 1 and 7 g l 1 respectively and specific methanogenic activity sma was 0 51 g cod g 1tvs day 1 table 1 shows the operating characteristics of the uasb reactor from which the sludge used as the inoculum in the present study was collected these characteristics can be important to understanding the changes in this sludge inoculum after being subjected to sugarcane vinasse processing under different operational conditions 2 2 wastewater the vinasse used from the rio pardo plant located in cerqueira césar são paulo was concentrated in the industry by evaporation due to the high organic load of the concentrated vinasse between 180 and 200 g cod l 1 dilution was necessary before use the defined feed concentration was approximately 20 g cod l 1 the characteristics of vinasse after dilution are shown in table 2 sodium bicarbonate was used to buffer the system the amount added initially was 1 g nahco3 g 1cod this value was gradually reduced to 0 3 g nahco3 g 1cod in 100 days maintaining this proportion until the end of the operation 2 3 uasb reactors and operational parameters the granular sludge blanket of three pilot scale uasb reactors r1 r2 and r3 for processing sugarcane alcohol distillery vinasse was analyzed during the operational period these systems were built using pvc they measured 19 5 cm in diameter d had a total volume of 120 l and height of 4 m were equipped with a modified three phase separator and equipped with an effluent recirculation device fig 1 they were inoculated with 60 l of anaerobic sludge reaction zone and provided with effluent recirculation at a rate of 100 200 and 400 compared to the feed volume for r1 r2 and r3 respectively the recirculation was aimed at diluting the vinasse and reducing the need to add alkali the reactors were provided with several sample collection points in the reactor the hydraulic rates and organic loading rates olr applied to the uasb reactors were staggered and increased aiming mainly at adapting the anaerobic sludge to the vinasse and at verifying the potential for reducing organic matter and generating methane the rise in organic loading rate occurred with the increase in vinasse flow rate which showed a relatively constant concentration of organic matter in terms of cod 20 g l 1 the weekly olr increase ranged from 20 at the beginning of the operation to 2 at the end of the operation some conditions for the increase in olr were assumed minimum organic material removal of 80 in terms of cod and concentration of methane in the biogas 60 table 3 shows the flow rates recirculation rates organic loading rates upflow velocities and operating times efficiency data from the r2 reactor presented in table 3 was published by del nery et al 47 the removed olr in these systems represented approximately 80 of the olr applied to all evaluated conditions the percentage of methane in the biogas was always above 60 the methane yield rates in the reactors compared to theoretical values ranged from 74 to 87 the average operating temperature of the reactors was 22 3 c in winter heaters were placed close to the reactors to avoid sudden temperature fluctuations the operating time of the reactors was up to 617 days for the r3 reactor table 3 2 4 sample collection method during the operation period eight sample collections of the sludge blanket from each of the reactors were carried out to evaluate the granulometry mineral fraction and metal content during the operational period the collections occurred at the organic loading rates of 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 15 17 5 and 20 g cod l 1 day 1 the sludge was removed from five points of the vertical profile of the reaction area an area inoculated with anaerobic sludge fig 1 before collecting samples from the sludge blanket the system was kept under the same conditions for approximately two weeks one liter of composite sample was collected with 200 ml of each of the five sampling points the removal was done from the top point 5 to the bottom point 1 due to the resettling of the sludge particles fig 1 from the homogenized composite sample the aliquot was removed for analysis the analysis of metals was performed in all samples and the granulometry in olrs of 5 10 15 and 20 g cod l 1d 1 2 5 determination of granulometry mineral fraction and metal content of the sludge blanket the granule size was determined according to a methodology proposed by alves et al 32 in this methodology the granules are carefully separated and placed in petri dishes and the images of these plates are captured and analyzed in the pro plus software version 6 0 nine bands of diameter were determined in mm 0 4 1 0 1 5 1 6 2 0 1 2 5 2 6 3 0 1 3 5 3 6 4 0 1 5 and 4 6 5 0 the lowest diameter 0 4 mm was defined according to the methodology limit and the highest 5 0 mm diameter was defined according to the granulometric data of the sampled granules themselves granular diameter frequency was estimated using basic descriptive statistics the kruskal wallis and tukey statistical tests were applied to verify whether the changes between one condition and the other were significant the statistical program used was past 4 02 to evaluate the possible effects of the organic load of the vinasse on the granular diameter the granulometry data of the reactors r1 r2 and r3 were analyzed and compared in the stages in which they were submitted to similar upflow velocities 0 125 m h 1 table 4 the mineral fraction of the sludge blanket was measured by the total fixed solids tfs and total solids ts ratio and the organic fraction by the total volatile solids tvs and total solids ts ratio determined according to apha et al 33 the quantified metals were zinc lead cadmium nickel iron manganese copper total chromium calcium magnesium sodium and potassium the analysis was performed by atomic absorption through the anaerobic sludge ash obtained by ignition in a 450 c muffle dissolved in acids 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 granulometry the analyses of the inoculum sludge and the sludge blanket of the reactors in the studied olrs showed that different granule sizes coexisted in the reactor the size of the analyzed granules ranged from 0 4 to 5 0 mm which is a diameter range pointed out in the literature as usual for anaerobic granules 6 34 however 99 8 0 1 of them had diameters between 0 4 and 3 5 mm fig 2 the greatest reduction in the granular diameter was observed in the r3 sludge blanket with 400 recirculation and was mainly associated with the higher upflow velocity 0 417 m h 1 in the last analyzed phase figs 2 and 3 statistically r1 with 100 recirculation and maximum upflow velocity of 0 167 m h 1 showed minor changes in the granular diameter its samples exposed to olrs 5 and 10 g cod l 1 day 1 with upflow velocities of 0 042 and 0 084 m h 1 respectively and those exposed to olrs 15 and 20 gcod l 1 day 1 with upflow velocities of 0 125 and 0 167 m h 1 respectively showed statistically equal particle size distributions veronez et al 35 who tested the effect of the upflow velocity by the effluent recirculation of 0 072 0 10 0 19 8 and 10 m h 1 observed a reduction in the granular diameter and the efficiency of the system at the highest upflow velocities 8 and 10 m h 1 in the present study with a maximum applied upflow velocity of 0 417 m h 1 a reduction in granular diameter was observed but not a reduction in treatment efficiency the average cod removal efficiency of the reactors was 88 7 and biogas methane content was 67 6 the influent concentration determined by the cod may also have influenced the granular dynamics r3 which showed the greatest reduction in granular diameter had the highest dilution 5 6 g cod l 1 due to the higher recirculation rate table 3 according to grotenhuis et al who tested propionate concentrations for feeding with 2 1 2 4 4 7 and 6 9 g cod l 1 the lower the cod of the feed the smaller the granule size 14 despite the higher recirculation rates that increased the dilution of the reactor feed they resulted in higher applied olrs table 3 and higher biogas production as a result the shear and hydraulic disturbance caused by the release of the biogas produced was also a factor that contributed to the reduction in the granular diameter corroborating the fact that the r3 reactor which received the largest olr had the greatest reduction in the granular diameter in the largest analyzed olrs in an attempt to evaluate the isolated effect of the shear caused by the biogas produced in the systems grotenhuis et al applied a gas rate about 5 times higher than that produced in the system analyzed by them and observed a reduction of 18 in the granular diameter 14 when comparing the granular diameter of reactors r1 r2 and r3 submitted to the same upflow velocity approximately 0 125 m h 1 differences were observed in the particle size between the reactors therefore in addition to the upflow velocity the biogas production rate and the cod concentration of the vinasse also influenced the granule size in the uasb systems when the reactors were submitted to similar upflow velocities 0 125 m h 1 the r3 reactor was submitted to a lower olr 7 g cod l 1 day 1 table 5 and therefore presented lower biogas production and consequently smaller shear these characteristics provided larger granules in the sludge blanket compared to other reactors submitted to the same upflow velocity the extent of the influence of vinasse on the granulometry was observed early on at the beginning of the reactors through the changes observed in the reactor sludge compared to the original characteristics of the inoculum the inoculum sludge had 46 4 of the granules in the granulometric range of 2 1 to 2 5 mm fig 2 and after being subjected to vinasse processing the granular diameter was significantly reduced in all systems already in the first phase analyzed with an olr of 5 g cod l 1 day 1 fig 2 hulshoff pol et al pointed out that the type of substrate is an essential factor for granular dynamics in treatment systems because they can select the microbial groups that form the granules 5 these authors used different food sources all simple compared to the complexity of vinasse such as propionate glucose sucrose organic volatile acids mixture and glucose peptone and meat extract mixture gutiérrez et al and moura et al also observed that the change in substrate influenced treatment efficiency and granule size 9 10 the predominant microbial group in the granules is related to the resistance of these bioparticles in the literature methanosaeta sp is generally considered to be responsible for more dense and resistant granules 4 5 3 2 physico chemical characterization of the sludge blanket the sludge blanket of the reactors showed a reduction in the total solids content 47 compared to the inoculation due to losses in the effluent and the removal of samples however the microorganisms selected in the system withstand the applied loads and maintained the system s performance there was a reduction in the proportion of total volatile solids and an increase in the proportion of total fixed solids in all reactor samples compared to the inoculum table 6 the reactors with the highest recirculation 200 and 400 were those with the lowest particle size and the highest proportion of tfs ts at the end of the operational period mills et al also observed that the concentration of inorganic matter was higher in smaller granules 2 therefore the less marked reduction in particle size in r1 may be related to a higher proportion of tvs ts compared to tfs ts the increase in tfs ts was related to the contribution of inorganic elements present in vinasse a higher concentration of inorganic elements in the influent may have led to higher mass transfer limitations in the granules causing a reduction in the granular diameter the vinasse treated in the systems had a concentration of manganese potassium magnesium and sodium of 4 7 1 7 mg l 1 1625 600 mg l 1 254 76 mg l 1 and 23 6 mg l 1 respectively above those considered essential and below those considered inhibitory by 17 there was an increase in the concentration of these substances in the sludge of all reactors table 7 compared to the inoculum the accumulation of manganese in the sludge blanket was up to four times greater than that observed for the inoculum sludge table 7 the presence of manganese may have favored the system as this element acts in the stabilization of methyltransferase of methanogenic microorganisms in redox reaction 36 sodium and magnesium showed concentrations up to six times higher in the sludge blanket of the systems compared to the inoculum table 7 sodium is essential for methanogenic microorganisms in concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 mg l 1 stimulating the anaerobic growth of mesophilic microorganisms however at concentrations between 3500 and 5500 mg l 1 and around 8000 mg l 1 in wastewater it can be moderately and strongly inhibitory respectively 17 in the present study the sodium concentration in the wastewater was low table 7 but it had high concentrations in the sludge blanket the accumulation of sodium in the reactor blanket was attributed to the concentration of sodium bicarbonate added for the buffering of the system although high the accumulation of sodium did not inhibit the process of anaerobic digestion according to gagliano et al granulation can be maintained in environments subjected to high salinity 10 and 20 g l 1 of sodium 37 the magnesium concentration in the sludge blanket in turn was associated with its presence in the vinasse table 7 the optimal concentration of magnesium is not well defined in the literature and the concentrations that can cause toxicity are variable mccarty determined that concentrations between 75 and 150 mg l 1 are stimulants between 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 can be toxic but adaptable and around 3000 mg l 1 inhibitory 17 romero güiza et al however did not observe stimulation or inhibition by magnesium between 40 and 400 mg l 1 while minor and major inhibition was observed at concentrations between 750 and 1000 mg l 1 and between 2000 and 4000 mg l 1 respectively 38 the magnesium concentration in the vinasse used in the present study did not qualify as toxic or as a stimulant but it may have acted by reducing the toxicity of sodium to methanogenic microorganisms by antagonism 36 according to rabelo et al the average potassium concentration in vinasse from brazilian distilleries is 2034 mg l 1 39 in the present study the vinasse used showed 1645 mg l 1 of potassium and the concentration in the sludge blanket of the systems analyzed was up to 15 times higher than that found in the inoculum table 7 the potassium concentration in the vinasse was higher than that considered stimulant 200 and 400 mg l 1 by mccarty 17 but it did not fit in the concentrations described as possibly inhibitory 2500 and 4500 mg l 1 or inhibitory 12 000 mg l 1 despite the high concentration in the sludge blanket there was no reduction in the efficiency of the systems probably due to the adaptation of the biomass to the imposed conditions and the antagonistic relationship that according to mccarty sodium and potassium present and their respective concentrations may have canceled out their toxicities 17 according to chen and cheng after adapting the sludge blanket the treatment systems can withstand twice the potassium concentration initially considered to be inhibitory 40 the calcium concentration in the sludge blanket of reactors r1 and r2 increased in the first sludge samples collected in the olrs of 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 g dqo l 1 day 1 but decreased again during the olr increase from 12 5 to 20 g dqo l 1 day 1 the change in the calcium concentration in the sludge blanket was related to the standard deviation of the calcium content observed in the feeding vinasse 527 222 mg l 1 in the present study the calcium concentration in the feeding vinasse was higher than that indicated as a stimulant and below the toxic limit jackson moss et al found that calcium concentrations of up to 7000 mg l 1 are not inhibitory 41 mccarty in turn pointed out concentrations of 2500 to 4500 mg l 1 as causing moderate inhibition the concentration of 8000 mg l 1 as strongly inhibitory and a concentration of 100 to 200 mg l 1 as a stimulant for biofilm formation 17 in the sludge blanket of the reactors analyzed here the calcium concentration was high in all phases analyzed with a minimum of 9600 mg kg 1 and a maximum of up to 90 300 mg kg 1 table 7 yu et al presented that calcium concentrations in granules were about 10 times greater than in feeds 42 according to yu et al calcium concentrations from 100 to 200 mg l 1 benefited the granulation while concentrations of over 500 mg l 1 harmed the process the authors also indicated that better calcium concentration depends on the influent cod they reported that the optimal calcium concentration to influent cod kept at 400 mg l was between 150 and 300 mg l 1 42 they reported that the optimal calcium concentration found was between 150 and 300 mg l 1 when the influent cod concentration was kept at 4000 mg l 1 it was not possible to evaluate the isolated effect of calcium concentration in the conditions studied in this research but overall the inefficiency of the treatment systems was not observed and the granulometric structure of the sludge blanket was maintained although there was a reduction in the granular diameter iron and zinc concentrations in the sludge blanket varied during the operation of the reactors table 7 and therefore a tendency was not observed to reduce or accumulate these elements in the sludge blanket iron is present in the tissue of methanogenic microorganisms in concentrations higher than that of any other heavy metal and performs numerous functions in anaerobic processes due to its redox property and its role in the activation of several enzymes in addition to being able to form sulfide precipitates and promote excretion of extracellular polymers 36 zinc is also found in many methanogenic microorganisms and can be considered a superacid catalyst that works in many enzymatic processes 36 copper chromium cadmium and nickel were less present in the vinasse and sludge blanket of the reactors compared to the other constituents analyzed table 7 it was observed that copper was gradually released from the sludge blanket showing a reduction compared to the inoculum of 68 54 and 72 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively at the end of the operational period the chromium content in the sludge blanket was also reduced compared to the inoculum by up to 58 in r1 the reduction of copper and chromium in the sludge blanket of the reactors was related to the low concentration of these elements in the feeding vinasse copper and chromium functioned as nutrients for the cells promoting microbial activity 23 30 because to become inhibitory values above 1000 mgl 1 would be necessary 43 cadmium and nickel concentrations observed in the vinasse and sludge blanket of the reactors table 7 were also lower than those considered inhibitory by mueller and steiner 1992 who observed 50 inhibition by cadmium at concentrations of 650 mg l 1 and nickel toxicity at concentrations of 250 and 300 mg l 1 the presence of heavy metals such as chromium iron copper zinc cadmium and nickel was characterized as essential for microbial activity by fermoso et al 30 research carried out with sludge from 30 anaerobic digesters for wastewater treatment reported the possibility of limiting the anaerobic process due to the unavailability of some of these nutrients such as iron and nickel eight out of the 30 sludges observed showed an improvement in the rate of biogas production by at least 20 when supplemented with one of these elements 44 corroborating that iron and nickel acted in the present study as important nutrients for the results achieved by treatment systems 4 conclusion the increase in hydraulic load organic loading rate and biogas production contributed to the particle size reduction in the range of 0 4 1 0 mm there was an increase in the proportion of tfs ts in the granular sludge blanket provided by the inorganic elements present in vinasse the concentration of magnesium sodium potassium and calcium present in higher concentrations in vinasse was also present in greater amounts in the sludge blanket but did not cause damage to the performance of the reactors this result was associated with the strategy of adapting biomass to vinasse by gradually increasing the vinasse load funding this work was supported
