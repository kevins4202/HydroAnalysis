15340,endotoxin is widely present in aquatic environments and can induce adverse health effects in this study dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma was used to remove bacterial endotoxin from the tailwater of a wastewater treatment plant the removal efficiency of total endotoxin activity was up to 92 with low electrical energy consumption 0 43 j ml 1 1 after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment which was better than other previously reported methods in the early stage of dbd plasma oxidation the expression of genes related to cell morphology and bacterial antioxidant enzyme synthesis was distinctly down regulated suggesting that cell integrity was destroyed leading to endotoxin release into the solution additionally endotoxin synthesis in the cells was suppressed the endotoxin in the solution was effectively removed by oh 1o2 and o2 generated by the dbd plasma with second order reaction rates of 2 69 1010 2 20 107 and 8 60 108 mol 1 l s 1 respectively the core toxic component of endotoxin lipid a was attacked by these strong oxidative species generating smaller molecular fragments with low toxicity consequently the inflammatory factors il 6 il β and tnf α of endotoxin decreased by 3 4 4 8 folds after the dbd plasma treatment implying that the health risks posed by endotoxin were greatly reduced this study revealed the intrinsic mechanisms of the highly efficient removal of bacterial endotoxin by dbd plasma oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords discharge plasma bacterial endotoxin molecular mechanisms inflammatory factor pathogens data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction endotoxin also called lipopolysaccharide lps is one of the main components of the cell walls of gram negative bacteria and some cyanobacteria o toole et al 2008 huang et al 2011 it is released after cell proliferation death and lysis xue et al 2019 and thus widely present in wastewater treatment plants wwtp as well as tailwater generally endotoxin exists in bound embedded in the cell wall and free released by the cell forms xue et al 2016 both of which are biologically active endotoxin is composed of o antigen core oligosaccharides and lipid a calabrese et al 2015 lipid a is the primary component in endotoxin inducing biological toxicity and immunogenicity wang et al 2021a generally endotoxin attaches to lysable binding proteins in the serum upon entering the host and then the complex interacts with cluster of differentiation 14 this polymer interacts with myeloid differentiation protein 2 and toll like receptor 4 triggering the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b bidne et al 2018 consequently various pro inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf α interleukin 6 il 6 and interleukin 1 il 1 are synthesized resulting in pneumonic responses bidne et al 2018 wang et al 2021a endotoxin has a wide range of biological effects and produces various physiological responses in humans intravenous injection of endotoxin in a low dose 2 ng kg 1 causes fever whereas a high dose induces blood circulation problems endotoxic shock and even death mehta et al 2010 lower doses of endotoxin 0 1 0 2 ng kg 1 have no clear clinical consequences but they may facilitate the production of pro inflammatory cytokines 4 20 fold changes in tnf α and il 6 rylander et al 1999 discovered that workers in a wwtp experienced inflammation of the upper respiratory tract diarrhea and fever recent research has shown that bacterial endotoxins in reclaimed water are a critical factor leading to inflammation in the lungs xue et al 2016 in addition endotoxin has been proven to generate other contaminants such as microcystins which are more hazardous best et al 2002 it has been reported that endotoxin activity can reach up to 600 183000 eu ml 1 in wastewater o toole et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 some conventional treatment methods including chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet uv irradiation have been widely used to inactivate bacteria however these methods are inefficient in eliminating endotoxin instead they boost endotoxin activity during the inactivation process gehr et al 2008 oh et al 2014 ren et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2011 discovered that endotoxin activity increased from 1000 eu ml 1 to 4000 eu ml 1 after 120 min of chlorine treatment low dose ozonation of wastewater increases endotoxin activity ren et al 2019 and high ozone concentrations disrupt human tissues and organs causing pulmonary edema and asthma wang et al 2022a there is no significant change in endotoxin activity under uv irradiation of 40 100 mj cm 2 gehr et al 2008 the endotoxin activity decreases only 4 2 when the uv dose increased to 480 mj cm 2 oh et al 2014 therefore more effective approaches for eliminating bacterial endotoxin should be urgently explored non thermal discharge plasma has gained considerable interest in wastewater treatment as a comprehensive advanced oxidation technology because of its high efficiency and friendliness wang et al 2018 non thermal discharge plasma is an incomplete ionization of a gaseous medium and its disinfection mechanism is based on various active species created such as superoxide anion radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh li et al 2021b recently discharge plasma has been widely employed for inactivating various microorganisms in aquatic environments including traditional bacteria antibiotic resistant bacteria and algae zhang et al 2014 song et al 2021 previous studies have found that strong oxidizing free radicals generated by discharge plasma induce cell wall destruction cell membrane lipid peroxidation enzyme activity reduction and dna damage wang et al 2021b li et al 2021b these studies mainly focused on microorganism inactivation efficiency and mechanisms ignoring the release of bacterial endotoxins when microorganisms died intracellular organic matter is released and removed during algae inactivation by the dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma treatment wang et al 2021b the release and transformation of extracellular polymer substances from microorganisms have been observed during sludge disintegration by surface plasma treatment li et al 2021a zhang et al 2016 compared the efficacy of endotoxin removal by dbd plasma oxidation and by dbd plasma activated water however they only evaluated the effect of the dbd plasma duration time on endotoxin activity bhatt et al 2021 also only evaluated the influence of voltage on endotoxin activity to date information regarding the molecular biological mechanisms of bacterial endotoxin release and decomposition during plasma induced microbial inactivation is lacking therefore the present study investigated the potential of bacterial endotoxin control in tailwater from a wwtp using dbd plasma oxidation first the occurrence and distribution of bacterial endotoxins in different wwtp processing units of the wwtp was analyzed second the removal efficiency of free and bound endotoxins was evaluated during the inactivation of total and gram negative bacteria third macro transcriptome analysis was performed to reveal the molecular biological mechanisms of endotoxin control during plasma induced microbial death finally possible decomposition mechanisms of endotoxins in the dbd plasma oxidation process were proposed and residual risks were assessed via cell viability inflammatory factors and pathogen spread 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents and chemicals gram negative bacteria

bacterial viability kit were purchased from invitrogen usa 2 2 water samples two types of water samples were used in this study tailwater and endotoxin simulated water in july 2021 the tailwater samples were collected from a wwtp in yangling shaanxi china which had anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o as the main treatment process the treatment volume of the wwtp was approximately 50 000 m3 per day the distribution of sampling sites is illustrated in fig s1 which included influent w1 primary setting tank w2 anaerobic tank w3 facultative tank w4 aerobic tank w5 secondary setting tank w6 and effluent w7 after disinfection after collection the water samples were tested within 24 h for the endotoxin simulated water 10 mg commercial endotoxin approximately 5000 000 eu solarbio science technology co ltd china extracted from escherichia coli o55 b5 was dissolved in 1 ml pyrogen free water xiamen bioendo technology co ltd xiamen china as the stock solution this was then diluted by the gradient method to 1100 eu ml 1 roughly equivalent to tailwater endotoxin concentration to obtain the working solution the solutions were stored at 4 c until use 2 3 experimental system for endotoxin removal a dbd plasma system was used to inactivate bacteria and eliminate the endotoxin the detailed introduction is presented in text s1 and fig s2 in a batch experiment 200 ml tailwater sample from the wwtp containing 2 5 105 cfu ml 1 bacteria was treated to evaluate endotoxin removal efficacy and molecular biological responses to explore the decomposition byproducts of endotoxin and residual risks cell viability and inflammatory factors endotoxin simulating water samples was used for the dbd plasma treatment the endotoxin working solution was about 1100 eu ml 1 similar to wastewater diluted using pyrogen free water the flow rate of air was 160 l h 1 and the applied voltage was 9 kv all experiments were performed in triplicate the ee o electrical energy consumption per order of endotoxin and ee or ee o divided by removal efficiency for endotoxin removal were calculated as described in text s1 2 4 rna extraction and macro transcription analysis the water samples from the experimental group 180 s of dbd plasma treatment and the control group 0 s of dbd plasma treatment were centrifuged for 10 min 5000 g 4 c to discard the supernatant and collect the cells after liquid nitrogen treatment the cells were stored at 80 c prior to rna extraction li et al 2020 the details of rna extraction and macro transcription analysis are presented in text s2 all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 5 analysis the inactivation efficiency of total bacteria tb and gram negative bacteria gnb in tailwater was assessed based on plate counts text s3 li et al 2021b endotoxin activity was determined by endpoint chromogenic limulus tachypleus tridentatus amebocyte lysate assay as described in text s3 and free endotoxin fe and bound endotoxin be were both measured intracellular ros were detected using an ros enzyme assay kit lipid peroxidation was determined by thiobarbituric acid chromogenic reaction using mda assay kit superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were determined using an sod and cat assay kits respectively the methods used for ros mda sod and cat analyses are illustrated in text s4 the integrity of the bacteria was determined using scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi laser confocal fluorescence microscopy lscm fv3000 olympus and flow cytometry fcm cyto flex bd biosciences as described in text s5 electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr bruker emxmicro 6 1 p l germany was used to identify the active species oh 1o2 and o2 produced by the dbd plasma system liu et al 2022 as described in text s6 the contributions of oh 1o2 and o2 to endotoxin removal are calculated in text s6 the steady state concentrations of ros and their second order reaction rates with the endotoxin are calculated in text s6 and table s1 a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan was used to evaluate the fluorescent characteristics of the endotoxin and parallel factor analysis parafac was used to analyze the data wang et al 2022b the details are shown in text s7 matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms applied biosystems usa was used to determine endotoxin degradation byproducts text s8 cell viability and cytokine levels were measured using cell counting kit 8 and elisa kit text s9 spss 21 spss statistics inc chicago il usa and origin 9 1 were used for statistical analysis and visualization respectively one way anova with tukey hsd post hoc test was applied to analyze significant differences p 0 05 which required the analysis of variance and normality test 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and distribution of bacterial endotoxin in wastewater fig 1 a shows the distribution of bacterial endotoxin in different wwtp treatment units the endotoxin activity ranged from approximately 637 eu ml 1 to 1689 eu ml 1 in different treatment units the endotoxin activity in both primary w2 and secondary w6 sedimentation tanks were significantly reduced p 0 05 as endotoxin was eliminated by adsorption and precipitation rapala et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 moreover the endotoxin activity decreased by approximately 41 27 of fe removal 75 of be removal in the entire wastewater treatment system zhang et al 2013 also reported that the removal efficiencies of fe and be were 30 and 70 in a typical wwtp respectively in particular the endotoxin activity in the aerobic tank w5 significantly p 0 05 increased from 906 eu ml 1 to 1455 eu ml 1 and a similar trend was also observed in the effluent after disinfection treatment this phenomenon was probably attributed to the massive proliferation of bacteria in the aerobic tank and the rapid division of cell walls which resulted in the release of endotoxin he et al 2018 the disinfection process prior to the release of effluent can also destroy the integrity of the cells resulting in endotoxin leakage dai et al 2018 thus the endotoxin activity was not effectively inhibited by traditional biological treatment system instead it increased meanwhile a significantly positive correlation p 0 05 between gnb and fe was observed fig 1b verifying that the endotoxin was mainly derived from gnb huang et al 2011 3 2 bacterial endotoxin removal performance by dbd plasma oxidation fig 2 depicts the removal of bacterial endotoxin in tailwater w7 by the dbd plasma treatment tb and gnb were completely inactivated after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig 2a meanwhile the removal efficiency of total endotoxin activity reached up to 92 with 95 fe and 88 be removal fig 2b these results suggested that dbd plasma oxidation not only killed the bacteria but also inactivated bacterial endotoxin effectively and fe was easier to remove than be after 15 s of the dbd plasma treatment the fe and be decreased by 69 and 20 respectively indicating that fe was eliminated during the early treatment stage 0 15 s this was also confirmed by the low gnb inactivation efficiency 0 1 log although tb and gnb inactivation efficiencies gradually increased with oxidation treatment the activities of both fe and be increased during the first 15 30 s of oxidation treatment be activity increased from 412 eu ml 1 15 s of the dbd plasma treatment to 609 eu ml 1 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment this might be due to the increased endotoxin release during the early destruction of abundant gnb 1 5 log huang et al 2011 xue et al 2019 a portion of the released endotoxin combined with the bacterial cells that were not completely destroyed resulting in the accumulation of be while the other portion directly formed fe ren et al 2019 as the dbd plasma treatment continued 30 180 s the activity of both forms progressively decreased the decrease in be might be due to its transition to fe and or direct decomposition by the dbd plasma treatment zhang et al 2016 however the transition of the be to fe and the degradation of fe were synchronous the continuous decrease in the fe suggested that the degradation rate of the fe was greater than the transition rate of the bound to the free form during the 30 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment which is in agreement with zhang et al 2016 these results demonstrated that the fe was rapidly decomposed and did not accumulate oh et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 plasma treatment modifies the ph of the treated solution leading to acidification zhang et al 2016 to eliminate the effects of bacterial endotoxin release under different ph conditions endotoxin simulated water was used to evaluate the effects of solution ph on endotoxin removal in this study the ph of the endotoxin simulated water rapidly decreased from the initial 7 5 to 3 6 after 60 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig s3a the quantity of generated ros would be affected by the solution ph in the dbd plasma system wang et al 2018 li et al 2020 leading to a change in endotoxin removal efficiency the endotoxin removal efficiency and the variations in reaction rate constant before and after dbd plasma oxidation under various ph conditions are depicted in figs s3b and s3c the reaction rate increased from 0 002 s 1 to 0 007 s 1 as the solution ph increased from 3 to 7 5 and then decreased to 0 005 s 1 at a solution ph of 11 previous studies have demonstrated that o3 dominated the oxidative decay of organic pollutants under acidic conditions while o3 generated during the discharge plasma was unstable and readily decomposed under alkaline conditions to produce oh which was more oxidative wang et al 2018 thus the degradation efficiency of endotoxin was enhanced under weak alkaline conditions however oh was consumed by oh reaction 1 and ho2 reactions 2 3 under alkaline conditions high ph muruganandham et al 2004 reducing the endotoxin removal efficiency 1 o h o h o h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 h h o 2 3 h o 2 o h h 2 o o 2 in addition the effects of different carrier gasses air ar and n2 on the endotoxin removal by the dbd plasma treatment were investigated as shown in fig s3d 77 2 of endotoxin was removed with air as the carrier gas after 180 s of dbd plasma oxidation whereas only 43 5 and 24 2 were removed with ar and n2 respectively inert gasses ar and n2 could not participate in many degradation processes n2 ionizes into n n2 and n in the discharge plasma leading to the degradation of pollutants wang et al 2015 ar is monoatomic and has a closed shell compared with n2 and electron collisions are inherently elastic wang et al 2015 thus the electrons of ar plasma have a higher energy than those of n2 which increases the production of oh and the decomposition of pollutants wang et al 2018 moreover oxidative o and o3 are produced more than n and n2 during the discharge plasma process under air because the bond dissociation energy of o2 5 12 ev is lower than that of n2 9 82 ev wang et al 2015 which is more conducive to the degradation of pollutants table s2 compares the endotoxin removal efficiencies of different techniques microwave irradiation of high power 260 w m 3 only removed 24 of endotoxin activity with an ee or of 21 44 j ml 1 1 wang et al 2019a the removal efficiency of endotoxin by 120 min photocatalysis ag tio2 treatment reached 60 with a high ee or of 42 21 j ml 1 1 sreeja and shetty 2016 the ee or of uv irradiation reached up to 2961 64 j ml 1 1 with the removal of only 11 endotoxin oh et al 2014 the ee o of dbd plasma oxidation 40 j ml 1 was comparable to that of uv cl2 35 j ml 1 but the ee or of 4 73 j ml 1 1 was considerably high xue et al 2019 overall dbd plasma oxidation in the present study exhibited the highest endotoxin removal efficiency with the lowest ee or 0 43 j ml 1 1 without the use of any additional exogenous chemical reagents 3 3 macro transcriptome analysis on endotoxin profiles induced by dbd plasma the above results demonstrated that endotoxin was released when bacteria were destroyed or died within 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment xue et al 2019 thus we investigated the correlation between cell integrity and endotoxin release fcm was used to track changes in bacterial viability as shown in fig 3 a before the dbd plasma treatment the proportion of viable cells was 63 28 in the tailwater owing to the presence of injured or dead bacteria ren et al 2019 after 30 s and 120 s of the dbd plasma treatment the cell viability decreased to 35 75 and 4 76 respectively suggesting that the integrity of the bacteria was destroyed by the dbd plasma treatment fig 3a c lscm was further used to characterize the destruction of the bacteria and the lscm images of syto9 pi staining of bacteria are illustrated in fig 3d f typical lscm images can be classified as damaged cells red fluorescence and intact cells green fluorescence xia et al 2017 xu et al 2021 most cells were intact exhibiting green fluorescence before the dbd plasma treatment red fluorescence gradually increased as the dbd plasma treatment continued and all cells exhibited red fluorescence after 120 s in line with this result the sem images showed that the cells were completely destroyed after 120 s of treatment fig 3g i lipid a the core component of endotoxin is frequently attached to fatty acid chains and these hydrophobic fatty acid chains are embedded in cell membranes xue et al 2016 consequently changes in cell membrane permeability can affect endotoxin release mda is a characteristic lipid peroxidation product and its production is positively correlated with the destruction of cell membranes ji et al 2018 the mda concentration increased significantly p 0 05 within 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig 4 a demonstrating that intensive oxidation occurred in the cell membranes furthermore the genome wide rna sequencing results figs 4b and s4 illustrate that after 30 s of treatment the genes associated with cell membrane permeability such as glycosyltransferase cell membrane biogenesis and glucose metabolism were significantly up regulated p 0 05 whereas genes encoding outer membrane prolipoprotein that maintained cell morphology were dramatically down regulated previous studies have reported that up regulation of outer membrane protein genes such as csgg ecnb and ybay enhanced membrane permeability li et al 2021b whereas down regulation of the outer membrane prolipoprotein genes destroyed the membrane structure lu et al 2020 this further disrupted bacterial integrity and increased cell permeability mychack et al 2019 li et al 2021b facilitating endotoxin release excessive accumulation of intracellular ros can damage normal bacterial functions such as cell membrane enzyme activity and dna to facilitate the release of endotoxin wang et al 2019a the amount of ros increased significantly with the oxidation treatment fig 5 a and increased by 3 9 times relative to that without treatment after 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment when excessive intracellular ros accumulate bacteria produce antioxidant enzymes such as sod and cat to resist oxidative stress nur et al 2014 lu et al 2020 as shown in fig 5b the activities of both sod and cat peaked after 120 s of the dbd plasma treatment and then declined significantly p 0 05 in the early stage of the dbd plasma treatment bacteria generated antioxidant enzymes to resist the external oxidative stress qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment cell integrity was disrupted resulting in the destruction of the antioxidant defense meng et al 2015 the results of gene expressions fig 5c revealed that the bacteria responded swiftly to the dbd plasma stimuli the genes encoding cat sod and glutathione gsh were down regulated by 1 9 3 9 fold after 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment compared with those of the control group further demonstrating that antioxidant enzyme synthesis was suppressed wang et al 2019b meanwhile nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate which is responsible for maintaining the gsh reduction state wang et al 2021b was also down regulated after the dbd plasma treatment the expression of genes that govern dna synthesis dna polymerase and respond to dna damage dna damage responsive proteins was also dramatically reduced after the dbd plasma treatment li et al 2021b reported that the up regulation of dna repair genes umuc and umud was associated with cell membrane damage which was confirmed by the 1 1 5 0 folds increase in the dna repair gene expressions in the present study fig 5c in addition gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that the normal life functions of bacteria particularly the synthesis of organic matter such as nitrogen and amino acids and rna binding were significantly hampered p 0 05 figure s5 the reduction in bacterial functions observed in this study was likely triggered by plasma oxidation which might have induced a bacterial sos response and disrupted normal bacterial functions to promote endotoxin leakage lu et al 2020 the synthesis of endotoxin is positively related to endotoxin activity trent et al 2006 rietschel and westphal 2020 the influence of the dbd plasma treatment on endotoxin synthesis at the transcriptional level was investigated fig 6 the endotoxin synthesis pathway ko00540 was suppressed according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database meanwhile the dominant genes of the pathways k06041 kdsd k00677 lpxa and k02536 lpxd were down regulated by 1 8 6 0 folds suggesting that endotoxin synthesis was inhibited by the dbd plasma treatment which might be another reason for the decrease in endotoxin levels endotoxin is a component of gnb cell wall o toole et al 2008 huang et al 2011 the genes encoding peptidoglycan the main component of bacterial cell walls rohs and bernhardt 2021 were significantly down regulated after 30 s of treatment fig s6 indicating that cell wall formation was blocked which in turn affected endotoxin synthesis in addition peptidoglycan binding proteins which can interact with other substances such as lipids and reassemble as new peptidoglycan components ducret and grangeasse 2021 were also down regulated by 2 5 3 5 folds fig s6 zhao et al 2018 found that lipid ii is inserted as a new component into peptidoglycan sacculus with the assembly of penicillin binding proteins these findings confirmed that endotoxin synthesis was suppressed leading to diminished endotoxin activity 3 4 possible mechanisms of endotoxin elimination to further reveal the elimination mechanisms of endotoxin activity a pure endotoxin solution was also used for the dbd plasma treatment similar to endotoxin removal in the tailwater significant elimination of endotoxin activity was observed in this treatment figure s3b ph 7 5 previous studies have shown that free radicals in the dbd plasma process participated in the oxidation of dna endotoxin and proteins during bacterial disinfection toyokawa et al 2017 li et al 2021b thus epr was used to determine changes in short lived ros with and without endotoxin addition as shown in fig 7 a the presence of oh 1o2 and o2 in the dbd plasma system was discovered and their signal intensities dropped as endotoxin was added indicating that they were engaged in endotoxin elimination to further explore the roles of ros isopropanol ipa furfuryl alcohol fa and p benzoquinone bq were used as scavengers for oh 1o2 and o2 respectively wang et al 2016 samovich et al 2018 these three scavengers have no significant effects on endotoxin removal the inhibitory effects of various scavengers on endotoxin removal are shown in figs 7b and s7 and text s6 after adding 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mmol l 1 ipa the inhibition rates of oh increased by 5 24 and 34 after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment respectively similarly the addition of various doses of fa significantly inhibited the elimination of endotoxin activity p 0 05 zhang et al 2016 found that oh captured hydrogen from lipid a polyunsaturated fatty acids and converted it to lipid free radicals then lipid peroxidation occurred from lipid free radicals and 1o2 to produce lipid peroxidation and lipid free radicals in addition the inhibition rate of 1o2 increased to 32 with the addition of 1 0 mmol l 1 bq these results suggested that oh 1o2 and o2 contributed to the elimination of endotoxin activity furthermore the steady state concentrations of oh 1o2 and o2 were 3 70 10 13 4 52 10 10 and 1 16 10 11 mol l 1 respectively the second order reaction rate constants of oh 1o2 and o2 with endotoxin were 2 69 1010 2 20 107 and 8 60 108 mol 1 l s 1 respectively fig 7c fig s8 and table s3 depict the maximum fluorescence intensity f max excitation emission matrix profiles ex em loadings and fluorescence peak positions of the four fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 and c4 analyzed by parafac in this study f max was employed to analyze the changes in these four endotoxin components and a larger f max indicated a higher content of this component wang et al 2022b as shown in figure s8a the f max of the microbial metabolite c3 protein like increased with an increase in endotoxin concentration indicating that c3 might represent endotoxin in this study furthermore the disappearance of c3 and the increase in c1 and c2 indicated that endotoxin was transformed into other by products still belong to protein like during the dbd plasma treatment which was in agreement with the results of wang et al 2016 maldi tof ms was used to determine intermediate products endotoxin is composed of o antigen core oligosaccharides and lipid a and lipid a is composed of two glucosamine units linked by a glycosidic bond for the basic structure and connected with 4 7 fatty acid chains three 3 deoxy d manno oct ulosonic acid kdo groups are attached to the core polysaccharide and o antigen polysaccharide chains of lipid a to produce a full endotoxin calabrese et al 2015 because of the complicated structure of endotoxin having no definite molecular form we selected compounds with a relative intensity 5 5 for analysis molinaro et al 2015 as shown in fig s9 and table s4 nine compounds p1 p9 were discovered after 60 s of the dbd plasma treatment and seven compounds were detected after 180 s of treatment the relative intensity of byproducts p7 and p8 decreased with the treatment while that of p3 and p4 increased indicating a possible intertransformation between them furthermore p2 and p9 disappeared after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment suggesting that they were completely converted into other byproducts a possible explanation for the disappearance of some peaks and increased intensities of other peaks could be the roles of ros in endotoxin decomposition based on the evolution of these byproducts and the potential roles of ros in endotoxin decomposition we speculated the possible degradation pathways of endotoxin fig 8 first the ros generated from dbd plasma oxidation captured the hydrogen atoms in glucosamine leading to the subsequent breakage of co and cc bonds cui et al 2018 the original monosaccharide and glycosidic bonds were broken resulting in the disintegration of the long lipopolysaccharide chain to form p1 p4 p7 p8 and p9 subsequently the methyl group ch3 in p7 was oxidized to acetate ch3coo to form p5 the byproduct p9 was composed of d galactose l rhamnose and hexose d galactose and hexose were easily oxidized by free radicals to form two vacancies based on the poly β 1 6 n acetylglucosamine molecular model cui et al 2018 troudi et al 2021 and the vacancies could combine with the ketodeoxynononic group in p4 to produce p3 or combined with l rhamnose in p8 to produce p2 the l rhamnose was structurally unstable cui et al 2018 and was replaced by ketodeoxynononic acid to form p3 the disappearance of p2 and the increase in p3 after 180 s of treatment also demonstrated that transition from p2 to p3 was possible fig s9 in addition the co and cc bonds in hexose could also be broken yang et al 2020 and the vacancy of co attracts d ribose which could react with ketodeoxynononic acid in p4 to form p6 these results suggested that endotoxin macromolecules were converted to relatively smaller molecular compounds which was in consistent with the findings of molinaro et al 2015 and yang et al 2020 3 5 risk assessment of bacterial endotoxin after dbd plasma oxidation the above analyses showed that some intermediates were produced during the dbd plasma treatment of endotoxin however their potential toxicities are unknown thus the cell viability and inflammatory induction of the endotoxin simulating water before and after the dbd plasma treatment were investigated figs 9 and s10 the damage caused by endotoxin to cell viability human bronchial epithelial cells beas 2b was significantly p 0 05 reduced after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig 9a one of the main toxicities of endotoxin was to induce inflammation which could result in fever allergies shock intravascular coagulation and even death smit et al 2006 endotoxin was associated with decreased lung function fev1 and long term exposure to endotoxin was significantly related to symptoms of chronic bronchitis and cough shi et al 2010 other epidemiological data suggested that 25 of cancer related deaths were linked to chronic inflammation slattery et al 2009 compared with that in the group without treatment the expression of the inflammatory factors tnf α il β and il 6 decreased from 6 1 to 2 7 folds 7 8 to 3 8 folds and 7 1 to 2 3 folds after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment respectively figs 9b and s10a d this might be related to the breakdown of lipid a core toxic component of endotoxin as evidenced by the absence of a lipid a signal in the maldi tof ms analysis il β and tnf α stimulated the production and release of additional inflammatory factors kang et al 2020 il 6 could promote the immune response by increasing b cell growth and antibody production as well as by activating and proliferating t cells xue et al 2019 the decrease in these inflammatory factors demonstrated that the dbd plasma treatment could effectively attenuate endotoxin induced inflammation there was no significant change p 0 05 in il 10 expression because of its insensitivity to endotoxin stimulation which was consistent with a previous study xue et al 2016 moreover the risks posed by the tailwater after the dbd plasma treatment were also evaluated dbd plasma oxidation effectively inhibited the inflammatory effects but the changes in tnf α from 7 0 to 2 3 folds il β from 9 2 to 2 9 folds and il 6 from 7 9 to 2 2 folds figs 9c and s10e h were higher in the tailwater than in the endotoxin simulating water these results demonstrated that other factors such as pathogens in the tailwater also caused inflammation fishbain and peleg fishbain and peleg 2010 in addition to endotoxin acinetobacter and pseudomonas two of the most commonly reported pathogens showed significantly positive correlations p 0 05 with endotoxin levels during the dbd plasma treatment process fig 9d acinetobacter caused infection and pseudomonas could aggravate it fishbain and peleg 2010 lupo et al 2018 therefore the removal of pathogens reduced the risk of infection from tailwater 4 conclusions the potential of bacterial endotoxin removal in tailwater from a wwtp by dbd plasma oxidation was investigated and the molecular biological mechanisms of endotoxin control were explored dbd plasma oxidation could rapidly remove 88 95 of free and bound endotoxins within 180 s of treatment fcm sem and lscm analyses demonstrated that the integrity of almost all the bacteria was completely destroyed mda intracellular ros and sod and cat activity analyses showed that dbd plasma oxidation increased cell permeability damaged cell integrity and destroyed the antioxidant enzyme defense system of bacteria facilitating endotoxin release furthermore expression of the genes encoding cat sod and gsh that maintain cell morphology were associated with endotoxin synthesis pathways and encode peptidoglycan were all significantly down regulated after dbd plasma oxidation reducing endotoxin activity oh 1o2 and o2 in the dbd plasma process destroyed the structures of endotoxin especially the core toxic component consequently the damage caused by endotoxin to cell viability and the expression levels of inflammatory factors pathogens acinetobacter and pseudomonas were all successfully attenuated overall this research provides an alternative for the risk control of endotoxin in tailwater declaration of competing interest the

15340,endotoxin is widely present in aquatic environments and can induce adverse health effects in this study dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma was used to remove bacterial endotoxin from the tailwater of a wastewater treatment plant the removal efficiency of total endotoxin activity was up to 92 with low electrical energy consumption 0 43 j ml 1 1 after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment which was better than other previously reported methods in the early stage of dbd plasma oxidation the expression of genes related to cell morphology and bacterial antioxidant enzyme synthesis was distinctly down regulated suggesting that cell integrity was destroyed leading to endotoxin release into the solution additionally endotoxin synthesis in the cells was suppressed the endotoxin in the solution was effectively removed by oh 1o2 and o2 generated by the dbd plasma with second order reaction rates of 2 69 1010 2 20 107 and 8 60 108 mol 1 l s 1 respectively the core toxic component of endotoxin lipid a was attacked by these strong oxidative species generating smaller molecular fragments with low toxicity consequently the inflammatory factors il 6 il β and tnf α of endotoxin decreased by 3 4 4 8 folds after the dbd plasma treatment implying that the health risks posed by endotoxin were greatly reduced this study revealed the intrinsic mechanisms of the highly efficient removal of bacterial endotoxin by dbd plasma oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords discharge plasma bacterial endotoxin molecular mechanisms inflammatory factor pathogens data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction endotoxin also called lipopolysaccharide lps is one of the main components of the cell walls of gram negative bacteria and some cyanobacteria o toole et al 2008 huang et al 2011 it is released after cell proliferation death and lysis xue et al 2019 and thus widely present in wastewater treatment plants wwtp as well as tailwater generally endotoxin exists in bound embedded in the cell wall and free released by the cell forms xue et al 2016 both of which are biologically active endotoxin is composed of o antigen core oligosaccharides and lipid a calabrese et al 2015 lipid a is the primary component in endotoxin inducing biological toxicity and immunogenicity wang et al 2021a generally endotoxin attaches to lysable binding proteins in the serum upon entering the host and then the complex interacts with cluster of differentiation 14 this polymer interacts with myeloid differentiation protein 2 and toll like receptor 4 triggering the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b bidne et al 2018 consequently various pro inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf α interleukin 6 il 6 and interleukin 1 il 1 are synthesized resulting in pneumonic responses bidne et al 2018 wang et al 2021a endotoxin has a wide range of biological effects and produces various physiological responses in humans intravenous injection of endotoxin in a low dose 2 ng kg 1 causes fever whereas a high dose induces blood circulation problems endotoxic shock and even death mehta et al 2010 lower doses of endotoxin 0 1 0 2 ng kg 1 have no clear clinical consequences but they may facilitate the production of pro inflammatory cytokines 4 20 fold changes in tnf α and il 6 rylander et al 1999 discovered that workers in a wwtp experienced inflammation of the upper respiratory tract diarrhea and fever recent research has shown that bacterial endotoxins in reclaimed water are a critical factor leading to inflammation in the lungs xue et al 2016 in addition endotoxin has been proven to generate other contaminants such as microcystins which are more hazardous best et al 2002 it has been reported that endotoxin activity can reach up to 600 183000 eu ml 1 in wastewater o toole et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 some conventional treatment methods including chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet uv irradiation have been widely used to inactivate bacteria however these methods are inefficient in eliminating endotoxin instead they boost endotoxin activity during the inactivation process gehr et al 2008 oh et al 2014 ren et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2011 discovered that endotoxin activity increased from 1000 eu ml 1 to 4000 eu ml 1 after 120 min of chlorine treatment low dose ozonation of wastewater increases endotoxin activity ren et al 2019 and high ozone concentrations disrupt human tissues and organs causing pulmonary edema and asthma wang et al 2022a there is no significant change in endotoxin activity under uv irradiation of 40 100 mj cm 2 gehr et al 2008 the endotoxin activity decreases only 4 2 when the uv dose increased to 480 mj cm 2 oh et al 2014 therefore more effective approaches for eliminating bacterial endotoxin should be urgently explored non thermal discharge plasma has gained considerable interest in wastewater treatment as a comprehensive advanced oxidation technology because of its high efficiency and friendliness wang et al 2018 non thermal discharge plasma is an incomplete ionization of a gaseous medium and its disinfection mechanism is based on various active species created such as superoxide anion radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh li et al 2021b recently discharge plasma has been widely employed for inactivating various microorganisms in aquatic environments including traditional bacteria antibiotic resistant bacteria and algae zhang et al 2014 song et al 2021 previous studies have found that strong oxidizing free radicals generated by discharge plasma induce cell wall destruction cell membrane lipid peroxidation enzyme activity reduction and dna damage wang et al 2021b li et al 2021b these studies mainly focused on microorganism inactivation efficiency and mechanisms ignoring the release of bacterial endotoxins when microorganisms died intracellular organic matter is released and removed during algae inactivation by the dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma treatment wang et al 2021b the release and transformation of extracellular polymer substances from microorganisms have been observed during sludge disintegration by surface plasma treatment li et al 2021a zhang et al 2016 compared the efficacy of endotoxin removal by dbd plasma oxidation and by dbd plasma activated water however they only evaluated the effect of the dbd plasma duration time on endotoxin activity bhatt et al 2021 also only evaluated the influence of voltage on endotoxin activity to date information regarding the molecular biological mechanisms of bacterial endotoxin release and decomposition during plasma induced microbial inactivation is lacking therefore the present study investigated the potential of bacterial endotoxin control in tailwater from a wwtp using dbd plasma oxidation first the occurrence and distribution of bacterial endotoxins in different wwtp processing units of the wwtp was analyzed second the removal efficiency of free and bound endotoxins was evaluated during the inactivation of total and gram negative bacteria third macro transcriptome analysis was performed to reveal the molecular biological mechanisms of endotoxin control during plasma induced microbial death finally possible decomposition mechanisms of endotoxins in the dbd plasma oxidation process were proposed and residual risks were assessed via cell viability inflammatory factors and pathogen spread 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents and chemicals gram negative bacteria

bacterial viability kit were purchased from invitrogen usa 2 2 water samples two types of water samples were used in this study tailwater and endotoxin simulated water in july 2021 the tailwater samples were collected from a wwtp in yangling shaanxi china which had anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o as the main treatment process the treatment volume of the wwtp was approximately 50 000 m3 per day the distribution of sampling sites is illustrated in fig s1 which included influent w1 primary setting tank w2 anaerobic tank w3 facultative tank w4 aerobic tank w5 secondary setting tank w6 and effluent w7 after disinfection after collection the water samples were tested within 24 h for the endotoxin simulated water 10 mg commercial endotoxin approximately 5000 000 eu solarbio science technology co ltd china extracted from escherichia coli o55 b5 was dissolved in 1 ml pyrogen free water xiamen bioendo technology co ltd xiamen china as the stock solution this was then diluted by the gradient method to 1100 eu ml 1 roughly equivalent to tailwater endotoxin concentration to obtain the working solution the solutions were stored at 4 c until use 2 3 experimental system for endotoxin removal a dbd plasma system was used to inactivate bacteria and eliminate the endotoxin the detailed introduction is presented in text s1 and fig s2 in a batch experiment 200 ml tailwater sample from the wwtp containing 2 5 105 cfu ml 1 bacteria was treated to evaluate endotoxin removal efficacy and molecular biological responses to explore the decomposition byproducts of endotoxin and residual risks cell viability and inflammatory factors endotoxin simulating water samples was used for the dbd plasma treatment the endotoxin working solution was about 1100 eu ml 1 similar to wastewater diluted using pyrogen free water the flow rate of air was 160 l h 1 and the applied voltage was 9 kv all experiments were performed in triplicate the ee o electrical energy consumption per order of endotoxin and ee or ee o divided by removal efficiency for endotoxin removal were calculated as described in text s1 2 4 rna extraction and macro transcription analysis the water samples from the experimental group 180 s of dbd plasma treatment and the control group 0 s of dbd plasma treatment were centrifuged for 10 min 5000 g 4 c to discard the supernatant and collect the cells after liquid nitrogen treatment the cells were stored at 80 c prior to rna extraction li et al 2020 the details of rna extraction and macro transcription analysis are presented in text s2 all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 5 analysis the inactivation efficiency of total bacteria tb and gram negative bacteria gnb in tailwater was assessed based on plate counts text s3 li et al 2021b endotoxin activity was determined by endpoint chromogenic limulus tachypleus tridentatus amebocyte lysate assay as described in text s3 and free endotoxin fe and bound endotoxin be were both measured intracellular ros were detected using an ros enzyme assay kit lipid peroxidation was determined by thiobarbituric acid chromogenic reaction using mda assay kit superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were determined using an sod and cat assay kits respectively the methods used for ros mda sod and cat analyses are illustrated in text s4 the integrity of the bacteria was determined using scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi laser confocal fluorescence microscopy lscm fv3000 olympus and flow cytometry fcm cyto flex bd biosciences as described in text s5 electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr bruker emxmicro 6 1 p l germany was used to identify the active species oh 1o2 and o2 produced by the dbd plasma system liu et al 2022 as described in text s6 the contributions of oh 1o2 and o2 to endotoxin removal are calculated in text s6 the steady state concentrations of ros and their second order reaction rates with the endotoxin are calculated in text s6 and table s1 a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan was used to evaluate the fluorescent characteristics of the endotoxin and parallel factor analysis parafac was used to analyze the data wang et al 2022b the details are shown in text s7 matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms applied biosystems usa was used to determine endotoxin degradation byproducts text s8 cell viability and cytokine levels were measured using cell counting kit 8 and elisa kit text s9 spss 21 spss statistics inc chicago il usa and origin 9 1 were used for statistical analysis and visualization respectively one way anova with tukey hsd post hoc test was applied to analyze significant differences p 0 05 which required the analysis of variance and normality test 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and distribution of bacterial endotoxin in wastewater fig 1 a shows the distribution of bacterial endotoxin in different wwtp treatment units the endotoxin activity ranged from approximately 637 eu ml 1 to 1689 eu ml 1 in different treatment units the endotoxin activity in both primary w2 and secondary w6 sedimentation tanks were significantly reduced p 0 05 as endotoxin was eliminated by adsorption and precipitation rapala et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 moreover the endotoxin activity decreased by approximately 41 27 of fe removal 75 of be removal in the entire wastewater treatment system zhang et al 2013 also reported that the removal efficiencies of fe and be were 30 and 70 in a typical wwtp respectively in particular the endotoxin activity in the aerobic tank w5 significantly p 0 05 increased from 906 eu ml 1 to 1455 eu ml 1 and a similar trend was also observed in the effluent after disinfection treatment this phenomenon was probably attributed to the massive proliferation of bacteria in the aerobic tank and the rapid division of cell walls which resulted in the release of endotoxin he et al 2018 the disinfection process prior to the release of effluent can also destroy the integrity of the cells resulting in endotoxin leakage dai et al 2018 thus the endotoxin activity was not effectively inhibited by traditional biological treatment system instead it increased meanwhile a significantly positive correlation p 0 05 between gnb and fe was observed fig 1b verifying that the endotoxin was mainly derived from gnb huang et al 2011 3 2 bacterial endotoxin removal performance by dbd plasma oxidation fig 2 depicts the removal of bacterial endotoxin in tailwater w7 by the dbd plasma treatment tb and gnb were completely inactivated after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig 2a meanwhile the removal efficiency of total endotoxin activity reached up to 92 with 95 fe and 88 be removal fig 2b these results suggested that dbd plasma oxidation not only killed the bacteria but also inactivated bacterial endotoxin effectively and fe was easier to remove than be after 15 s of the dbd plasma treatment the fe and be decreased by 69 and 20 respectively indicating that fe was eliminated during the early treatment stage 0 15 s this was also confirmed by the low gnb inactivation efficiency 0 1 log although tb and gnb inactivation efficiencies gradually increased with oxidation treatment the activities of both fe and be increased during the first 15 30 s of oxidation treatment be activity increased from 412 eu ml 1 15 s of the dbd plasma treatment to 609 eu ml 1 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment this might be due to the increased endotoxin release during the early destruction of abundant gnb 1 5 log huang et al 2011 xue et al 2019 a portion of the released endotoxin combined with the bacterial cells that were not completely destroyed resulting in the accumulation of be while the other portion directly formed fe ren et al 2019 as the dbd plasma treatment continued 30 180 s the activity of both forms progressively decreased the decrease in be might be due to its transition to fe and or direct decomposition by the dbd plasma treatment zhang et al 2016 however the transition of the be to fe and the degradation of fe were synchronous the continuous decrease in the fe suggested that the degradation rate of the fe was greater than the transition rate of the bound to the free form during the 30 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment which is in agreement with zhang et al 2016 these results demonstrated that the fe was rapidly decomposed and did not accumulate oh et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 plasma treatment modifies the ph of the treated solution leading to acidification zhang et al 2016 to eliminate the effects of bacterial endotoxin release under different ph conditions endotoxin simulated water was used to evaluate the effects of solution ph on endotoxin removal in this study the ph of the endotoxin simulated water rapidly decreased from the initial 7 5 to 3 6 after 60 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig s3a the quantity of generated ros would be affected by the solution ph in the dbd plasma system wang et al 2018 li et al 2020 leading to a change in endotoxin removal efficiency the endotoxin removal efficiency and the variations in reaction rate constant before and after dbd plasma oxidation under various ph conditions are depicted in figs s3b and s3c the reaction rate increased from 0 002 s 1 to 0 007 s 1 as the solution ph increased from 3 to 7 5 and then decreased to 0 005 s 1 at a solution ph of 11 previous studies have demonstrated that o3 dominated the oxidative decay of organic pollutants under acidic conditions while o3 generated during the discharge plasma was unstable and readily decomposed under alkaline conditions to produce oh which was more oxidative wang et al 2018 thus the degradation efficiency of endotoxin was enhanced under weak alkaline conditions however oh was consumed by oh reaction 1 and ho2 reactions 2 3 under alkaline conditions high ph muruganandham et al 2004 reducing the endotoxin removal efficiency 1 o h o h o h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 h h o 2 3 h o 2 o h h 2 o o 2 in addition the effects of different carrier gasses air ar and n2 on the endotoxin removal by the dbd plasma treatment were investigated as shown in fig s3d 77 2 of endotoxin was removed with air as the carrier gas after 180 s of dbd plasma oxidation whereas only 43 5 and 24 2 were removed with ar and n2 respectively inert gasses ar and n2 could not participate in many degradation processes n2 ionizes into n n2 and n in the discharge plasma leading to the degradation of pollutants wang et al 2015 ar is monoatomic and has a closed shell compared with n2 and electron collisions are inherently elastic wang et al 2015 thus the electrons of ar plasma have a higher energy than those of n2 which increases the production of oh and the decomposition of pollutants wang et al 2018 moreover oxidative o and o3 are produced more than n and n2 during the discharge plasma process under air because the bond dissociation energy of o2 5 12 ev is lower than that of n2 9 82 ev wang et al 2015 which is more conducive to the degradation of pollutants table s2 compares the endotoxin removal efficiencies of different techniques microwave irradiation of high power 260 w m 3 only removed 24 of endotoxin activity with an ee or of 21 44 j ml 1 1 wang et al 2019a the removal efficiency of endotoxin by 120 min photocatalysis ag tio2 treatment reached 60 with a high ee or of 42 21 j ml 1 1 sreeja and shetty 2016 the ee or of uv irradiation reached up to 2961 64 j ml 1 1 with the removal of only 11 endotoxin oh et al 2014 the ee o of dbd plasma oxidation 40 j ml 1 was comparable to that of uv cl2 35 j ml 1 but the ee or of 4 73 j ml 1 1 was considerably high xue et al 2019 overall dbd plasma oxidation in the present study exhibited the highest endotoxin removal efficiency with the lowest ee or 0 43 j ml 1 1 without the use of any additional exogenous chemical reagents 3 3 macro transcriptome analysis on endotoxin profiles induced by dbd plasma the above results demonstrated that endotoxin was released when bacteria were destroyed or died within 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment xue et al 2019 thus we investigated the correlation between cell integrity and endotoxin release fcm was used to track changes in bacterial viability as shown in fig 3 a before the dbd plasma treatment the proportion of viable cells was 63 28 in the tailwater owing to the presence of injured or dead bacteria ren et al 2019 after 30 s and 120 s of the dbd plasma treatment the cell viability decreased to 35 75 and 4 76 respectively suggesting that the integrity of the bacteria was destroyed by the dbd plasma treatment fig 3a c lscm was further used to characterize the destruction of the bacteria and the lscm images of syto9 pi staining of bacteria are illustrated in fig 3d f typical lscm images can be classified as damaged cells red fluorescence and intact cells green fluorescence xia et al 2017 xu et al 2021 most cells were intact exhibiting green fluorescence before the dbd plasma treatment red fluorescence gradually increased as the dbd plasma treatment continued and all cells exhibited red fluorescence after 120 s in line with this result the sem images showed that the cells were completely destroyed after 120 s of treatment fig 3g i lipid a the core component of endotoxin is frequently attached to fatty acid chains and these hydrophobic fatty acid chains are embedded in cell membranes xue et al 2016 consequently changes in cell membrane permeability can affect endotoxin release mda is a characteristic lipid peroxidation product and its production is positively correlated with the destruction of cell membranes ji et al 2018 the mda concentration increased significantly p 0 05 within 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig 4 a demonstrating that intensive oxidation occurred in the cell membranes furthermore the genome wide rna sequencing results figs 4b and s4 illustrate that after 30 s of treatment the genes associated with cell membrane permeability such as glycosyltransferase cell membrane biogenesis and glucose metabolism were significantly up regulated p 0 05 whereas genes encoding outer membrane prolipoprotein that maintained cell morphology were dramatically down regulated previous studies have reported that up regulation of outer membrane protein genes such as csgg ecnb and ybay enhanced membrane permeability li et al 2021b whereas down regulation of the outer membrane prolipoprotein genes destroyed the membrane structure lu et al 2020 this further disrupted bacterial integrity and increased cell permeability mychack et al 2019 li et al 2021b facilitating endotoxin release excessive accumulation of intracellular ros can damage normal bacterial functions such as cell membrane enzyme activity and dna to facilitate the release of endotoxin wang et al 2019a the amount of ros increased significantly with the oxidation treatment fig 5 a and increased by 3 9 times relative to that without treatment after 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment when excessive intracellular ros accumulate bacteria produce antioxidant enzymes such as sod and cat to resist oxidative stress nur et al 2014 lu et al 2020 as shown in fig 5b the activities of both sod and cat peaked after 120 s of the dbd plasma treatment and then declined significantly p 0 05 in the early stage of the dbd plasma treatment bacteria generated antioxidant enzymes to resist the external oxidative stress qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment cell integrity was disrupted resulting in the destruction of the antioxidant defense meng et al 2015 the results of gene expressions fig 5c revealed that the bacteria responded swiftly to the dbd plasma stimuli the genes encoding cat sod and glutathione gsh were down regulated by 1 9 3 9 fold after 30 s of the dbd plasma treatment compared with those of the control group further demonstrating that antioxidant enzyme synthesis was suppressed wang et al 2019b meanwhile nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate which is responsible for maintaining the gsh reduction state wang et al 2021b was also down regulated after the dbd plasma treatment the expression of genes that govern dna synthesis dna polymerase and respond to dna damage dna damage responsive proteins was also dramatically reduced after the dbd plasma treatment li et al 2021b reported that the up regulation of dna repair genes umuc and umud was associated with cell membrane damage which was confirmed by the 1 1 5 0 folds increase in the dna repair gene expressions in the present study fig 5c in addition gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that the normal life functions of bacteria particularly the synthesis of organic matter such as nitrogen and amino acids and rna binding were significantly hampered p 0 05 figure s5 the reduction in bacterial functions observed in this study was likely triggered by plasma oxidation which might have induced a bacterial sos response and disrupted normal bacterial functions to promote endotoxin leakage lu et al 2020 the synthesis of endotoxin is positively related to endotoxin activity trent et al 2006 rietschel and westphal 2020 the influence of the dbd plasma treatment on endotoxin synthesis at the transcriptional level was investigated fig 6 the endotoxin synthesis pathway ko00540 was suppressed according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database meanwhile the dominant genes of the pathways k06041 kdsd k00677 lpxa and k02536 lpxd were down regulated by 1 8 6 0 folds suggesting that endotoxin synthesis was inhibited by the dbd plasma treatment which might be another reason for the decrease in endotoxin levels endotoxin is a component of gnb cell wall o toole et al 2008 huang et al 2011 the genes encoding peptidoglycan the main component of bacterial cell walls rohs and bernhardt 2021 were significantly down regulated after 30 s of treatment fig s6 indicating that cell wall formation was blocked which in turn affected endotoxin synthesis in addition peptidoglycan binding proteins which can interact with other substances such as lipids and reassemble as new peptidoglycan components ducret and grangeasse 2021 were also down regulated by 2 5 3 5 folds fig s6 zhao et al 2018 found that lipid ii is inserted as a new component into peptidoglycan sacculus with the assembly of penicillin binding proteins these findings confirmed that endotoxin synthesis was suppressed leading to diminished endotoxin activity 3 4 possible mechanisms of endotoxin elimination to further reveal the elimination mechanisms of endotoxin activity a pure endotoxin solution was also used for the dbd plasma treatment similar to endotoxin removal in the tailwater significant elimination of endotoxin activity was observed in this treatment figure s3b ph 7 5 previous studies have shown that free radicals in the dbd plasma process participated in the oxidation of dna endotoxin and proteins during bacterial disinfection toyokawa et al 2017 li et al 2021b thus epr was used to determine changes in short lived ros with and without endotoxin addition as shown in fig 7 a the presence of oh 1o2 and o2 in the dbd plasma system was discovered and their signal intensities dropped as endotoxin was added indicating that they were engaged in endotoxin elimination to further explore the roles of ros isopropanol ipa furfuryl alcohol fa and p benzoquinone bq were used as scavengers for oh 1o2 and o2 respectively wang et al 2016 samovich et al 2018 these three scavengers have no significant effects on endotoxin removal the inhibitory effects of various scavengers on endotoxin removal are shown in figs 7b and s7 and text s6 after adding 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mmol l 1 ipa the inhibition rates of oh increased by 5 24 and 34 after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment respectively similarly the addition of various doses of fa significantly inhibited the elimination of endotoxin activity p 0 05 zhang et al 2016 found that oh captured hydrogen from lipid a polyunsaturated fatty acids and converted it to lipid free radicals then lipid peroxidation occurred from lipid free radicals and 1o2 to produce lipid peroxidation and lipid free radicals in addition the inhibition rate of 1o2 increased to 32 with the addition of 1 0 mmol l 1 bq these results suggested that oh 1o2 and o2 contributed to the elimination of endotoxin activity furthermore the steady state concentrations of oh 1o2 and o2 were 3 70 10 13 4 52 10 10 and 1 16 10 11 mol l 1 respectively the second order reaction rate constants of oh 1o2 and o2 with endotoxin were 2 69 1010 2 20 107 and 8 60 108 mol 1 l s 1 respectively fig 7c fig s8 and table s3 depict the maximum fluorescence intensity f max excitation emission matrix profiles ex em loadings and fluorescence peak positions of the four fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 and c4 analyzed by parafac in this study f max was employed to analyze the changes in these four endotoxin components and a larger f max indicated a higher content of this component wang et al 2022b as shown in figure s8a the f max of the microbial metabolite c3 protein like increased with an increase in endotoxin concentration indicating that c3 might represent endotoxin in this study furthermore the disappearance of c3 and the increase in c1 and c2 indicated that endotoxin was transformed into other by products still belong to protein like during the dbd plasma treatment which was in agreement with the results of wang et al 2016 maldi tof ms was used to determine intermediate products endotoxin is composed of o antigen core oligosaccharides and lipid a and lipid a is composed of two glucosamine units linked by a glycosidic bond for the basic structure and connected with 4 7 fatty acid chains three 3 deoxy d manno oct ulosonic acid kdo groups are attached to the core polysaccharide and o antigen polysaccharide chains of lipid a to produce a full endotoxin calabrese et al 2015 because of the complicated structure of endotoxin having no definite molecular form we selected compounds with a relative intensity 5 5 for analysis molinaro et al 2015 as shown in fig s9 and table s4 nine compounds p1 p9 were discovered after 60 s of the dbd plasma treatment and seven compounds were detected after 180 s of treatment the relative intensity of byproducts p7 and p8 decreased with the treatment while that of p3 and p4 increased indicating a possible intertransformation between them furthermore p2 and p9 disappeared after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment suggesting that they were completely converted into other byproducts a possible explanation for the disappearance of some peaks and increased intensities of other peaks could be the roles of ros in endotoxin decomposition based on the evolution of these byproducts and the potential roles of ros in endotoxin decomposition we speculated the possible degradation pathways of endotoxin fig 8 first the ros generated from dbd plasma oxidation captured the hydrogen atoms in glucosamine leading to the subsequent breakage of co and cc bonds cui et al 2018 the original monosaccharide and glycosidic bonds were broken resulting in the disintegration of the long lipopolysaccharide chain to form p1 p4 p7 p8 and p9 subsequently the methyl group ch3 in p7 was oxidized to acetate ch3coo to form p5 the byproduct p9 was composed of d galactose l rhamnose and hexose d galactose and hexose were easily oxidized by free radicals to form two vacancies based on the poly β 1 6 n acetylglucosamine molecular model cui et al 2018 troudi et al 2021 and the vacancies could combine with the ketodeoxynononic group in p4 to produce p3 or combined with l rhamnose in p8 to produce p2 the l rhamnose was structurally unstable cui et al 2018 and was replaced by ketodeoxynononic acid to form p3 the disappearance of p2 and the increase in p3 after 180 s of treatment also demonstrated that transition from p2 to p3 was possible fig s9 in addition the co and cc bonds in hexose could also be broken yang et al 2020 and the vacancy of co attracts d ribose which could react with ketodeoxynononic acid in p4 to form p6 these results suggested that endotoxin macromolecules were converted to relatively smaller molecular compounds which was in consistent with the findings of molinaro et al 2015 and yang et al 2020 3 5 risk assessment of bacterial endotoxin after dbd plasma oxidation the above analyses showed that some intermediates were produced during the dbd plasma treatment of endotoxin however their potential toxicities are unknown thus the cell viability and inflammatory induction of the endotoxin simulating water before and after the dbd plasma treatment were investigated figs 9 and s10 the damage caused by endotoxin to cell viability human bronchial epithelial cells beas 2b was significantly p 0 05 reduced after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment fig 9a one of the main toxicities of endotoxin was to induce inflammation which could result in fever allergies shock intravascular coagulation and even death smit et al 2006 endotoxin was associated with decreased lung function fev1 and long term exposure to endotoxin was significantly related to symptoms of chronic bronchitis and cough shi et al 2010 other epidemiological data suggested that 25 of cancer related deaths were linked to chronic inflammation slattery et al 2009 compared with that in the group without treatment the expression of the inflammatory factors tnf α il β and il 6 decreased from 6 1 to 2 7 folds 7 8 to 3 8 folds and 7 1 to 2 3 folds after 180 s of the dbd plasma treatment respectively figs 9b and s10a d this might be related to the breakdown of lipid a core toxic component of endotoxin as evidenced by the absence of a lipid a signal in the maldi tof ms analysis il β and tnf α stimulated the production and release of additional inflammatory factors kang et al 2020 il 6 could promote the immune response by increasing b cell growth and antibody production as well as by activating and proliferating t cells xue et al 2019 the decrease in these inflammatory factors demonstrated that the dbd plasma treatment could effectively attenuate endotoxin induced inflammation there was no significant change p 0 05 in il 10 expression because of its insensitivity to endotoxin stimulation which was consistent with a previous study xue et al 2016 moreover the risks posed by the tailwater after the dbd plasma treatment were also evaluated dbd plasma oxidation effectively inhibited the inflammatory effects but the changes in tnf α from 7 0 to 2 3 folds il β from 9 2 to 2 9 folds and il 6 from 7 9 to 2 2 folds figs 9c and s10e h were higher in the tailwater than in the endotoxin simulating water these results demonstrated that other factors such as pathogens in the tailwater also caused inflammation fishbain and peleg fishbain and peleg 2010 in addition to endotoxin acinetobacter and pseudomonas two of the most commonly reported pathogens showed significantly positive correlations p 0 05 with endotoxin levels during the dbd plasma treatment process fig 9d acinetobacter caused infection and pseudomonas could aggravate it fishbain and peleg 2010 lupo et al 2018 therefore the removal of pathogens reduced the risk of infection from tailwater 4 conclusions the potential of bacterial endotoxin removal in tailwater from a wwtp by dbd plasma oxidation was investigated and the molecular biological mechanisms of endotoxin control were explored dbd plasma oxidation could rapidly remove 88 95 of free and bound endotoxins within 180 s of treatment fcm sem and lscm analyses demonstrated that the integrity of almost all the bacteria was completely destroyed mda intracellular ros and sod and cat activity analyses showed that dbd plasma oxidation increased cell permeability damaged cell integrity and destroyed the antioxidant enzyme defense system of bacteria facilitating endotoxin release furthermore expression of the genes encoding cat sod and gsh that maintain cell morphology were associated with endotoxin synthesis pathways and encode peptidoglycan were all significantly down regulated after dbd plasma oxidation reducing endotoxin activity oh 1o2 and o2 in the dbd plasma process destroyed the structures of endotoxin especially the core toxic component consequently the damage caused by endotoxin to cell viability and the expression levels of inflammatory factors pathogens acinetobacter and pseudomonas were all successfully attenuated overall this research provides an alternative for the risk control of endotoxin in tailwater declaration of competing interest the

the water scarcity ma et al 2020 the challenge of water scarcity drives stringent environmental regulations that intend to maximize the reuse of industrial wastewater xiong and wei 2017 spurring the growth of zero liquid discharge zld or minimal liquid discharge mld treatment of the industrial wastewater ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the zld has been applied to treat different types of industrial wastewaters such as textile wastewater li et al 2020a lin et al 2019 moreira et al 2021 shale gas produced water carrero parreño et al 2019 oilfield produced water zhao et al 2020b and steel wastewater jiang et al 2021a the steel industry is one of the largest water intensive sectors and wastewater dischargers the effective zld treatment of steel industrial wastewater can enable reduction of wastewater discharge and simultaneous recovery of resources jiang et al 2021a membrane based technology including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro has been increasingly applied in the zld process tong and elimelech 2016 due to its higher energy efficiency lower capital and operating costs compared with the thermal method panagopoulos 2021 xiao et al 2020 to purify separate and concentrate wastewater in the zld systems nf and ro membranes can be jointly used to form a complex but effective multi step membrane process including multi pass and multi stage modes the nf process enables separation of divalent ions from monovalent ions while the ro process is responsible for high level water purification and concentration of target streams chen et al 2021 ma et al 2021 in the multi step nf ro processes membrane fouling phenomenon is inevitable zheng et al 2018 which results in a decreased water flux increased operating pressure and more intense energy consumption bush et al 2016 severely hindering the stable operation of membrane based zld system zhao et al 2021 deciphering the characteristics and mechanisms of membrane fouling in the membrane based zld system is crucial for the development of effective fouling control strategies the membrane fouling originates from the inorganic and organic contaminants in the matrix of industrial wastewater chen et al 2021 song et al 2020 specifically the cold rolling wastewater from the steel industry often contains a variety of contaminants capable of inducing membrane fouling such as oils bactericides surfactants emulsifiers and salt ions jiang et al 2021b due to the effect of concentration polarization oranso and eric 2014 wende et al 2018 the concentration of the contaminants near the membrane surface can be markedly higher than those in the bulk phase moreover the high water recovery of the zld system can also contribute to the concentration of contaminants which further intensifies the deposition of foulants on the surface of membrane especially for those membrane steps responsible for treating concentrated streams this phenomenon implies that the membrane fouling conditions can be quite distinct among different steps of the nf ro zld processes however current studies only focused on the membrane fouling of single step in the membrane based processes song et al 2020 unal 2022 investigating the characteristics and mechanisms of membrane fouling from a new dimension i e analyzing multiple membrane steps in the membrane processes is imperative to establish a comprehensive understanding on the membrane fouling in the zld system herein membrane fouling characteristics and mechanisms in a full scale zld system for cold rolling wastewater brine treatment were investigated via a comprehensive analysis on multi step nf and ro membrane processes the water quality for each step of nf and ro processes was analyzed to construct a profile of the composition of contaminants the fouled membranes sampled from five different nf or ro membrane processes were systematically characterized correlation between the influent water quality and the membrane fouling characteristic was investigated the mechanisms of membrane fouling in the zld system were unraveled to elucidate the discrepancy in membrane fouling conditions for the different membrane processes this work will facilitate the development of membrane fouling control strategies in zld systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of the zld system a full scale zld system in a steel industrial plant for treating the ro brine of cold rolling wastewater was investigated the zld system consisting of a softening unit multi step membrane units and crystallization units fig 1 has a treatment capacity of 5000 m3 d the cold rolling wastewater brine was firstly treated by the softening unit including coagulation precipitation filter ultrafiltration uf and ion exchange for removal of the scaling ions ca2 and mg2 to ensure the stability of the subsequent membrane units the effluent from the softening unit was then fed into the 1st pass ro process for entrance into membrane units the brine of 1st pass ro process was fed to a two stage nf process to separate the nacl and na2so4 and concentrate the na2so4 enriched stream which was further subject to the freeze crystallization fc step for na2so4 recovery the permeates from nf processes were sent to the 2nd pass ro process to harvest freshwater and concentrate the nacl enriched stream to reduce the throughput of the evaporation crystallization unit an electrodialysis ed process was applied for the further concentration of the 2nd pass ro brine followed by a mechanical vapor recompression mvr step to crystallize the nacl salt the desalinated water in ed process was subject to coagulation and microfiltration mf treatment and then circulated to the uf process and the 2nd pass ro process resulting in zero wastewater discharged from the system permeates from the 1st pass ro and the 2nd pass ro processes were finally purified by the 3rd pass ro process to meet reused water standards the 3rd pass ro brine was flowed back to the 1st pass ro process the zld system has been operated for approximately 3 years one of the thorny problems occurring in the actual operation was that the water recovery rate of the high pressure membrane processes could not reach the design value among them the water recovery rates of 2nd stage nf and 2nd pass ro decreased by 10 0 15 0 and 10 0 20 0 under designed operating pressure respectively table s1 in addition although the water recovery rates of 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 3rd pass ro could reach the corresponding design values the membrane fouling was still noticed for these processes 2 2 sample collection 2 2 1 water samples the raw cold rolling wastewater brine was collected before its entrance into the softening step the feed of the nf and ro membrane processes were collected from the first membrane element all water sampling points were highlighted in fig 1 all the water samples were stored at 4 c in the laboratory to minimize the change of constituents in water samples 2 2 2 membrane coupons the fouled spiral wound elements of the nf and ro membrane processes were autopsied for comprehensively analyze each process of multi step membrane unit ten different membrane coupons of 20 50 cm2 were cut off from the first element of each process and transported freshly to the laboratory for analysis the water permeability and salt rejection of sampled membranes were tested immediately table 1 after 1 h pre compaction the performance of ro fouled membranes was measured with 1000 μs cm nacl at 1 5 mpa for 1 h and the performance of nf fouled membranes was measured with 2000 μs cm na2so4 at 0 6 mpa for 1 h the schematic of laboratory scale cross flow membrane filtration system and the procedure of membrane performance test were described in our previous studies dai et al 2019 dai et al 2020 the sampled membranes were stored at 4 c basic information of sampled membrane elements is presented in table 1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis the raw cold rolling wastewater brine and the influents from different high pressure membrane processes were subject to water quality analysis the ph and conductivity were measured by a conductivity meter ddsj 308f inesa instrument and a ph meter hq40d hach respectively the concentrations of cations ca2 mg2 al3 and fe3 and sio2 were quantified by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5110 measurement of chemical oxygen demand cod was conducted by a multiparameter bench photometer for laboratories dr3900 and dr2800 hach the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem aqualog horiba and total organic carbon toc toc vcph shimadzu were employed to determine the constituent and concentration of dissolved organic matter dom respectively the raw cold rolling wastewater brine was extracted with an equal volume of dichloromethane ch2cl2 and analyzed by using a two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms pegasus hrt 4d leco an appropriate amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 was dissolved into water samples to avoid emulsification occurred during extraction gc gc tof ms method parameters can be found in table s2 leco chroma tof software was used for data processing for ensuring the accuracy only the pollutants with characteristic peaks matching degree higher than 75 were counted tang et al 2021 2 3 2 characterization of fouled membrane the morphological features of fouled membrane samples were observed through a scanning electronic microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 at an accelerating voltage of 3 0 kv and the surface elemental analysis was conducted by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds oxford xplore at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectrum two perkinelmer was used to identify the functional groups of the fouled membranes the fouling layers on the membrane surface were collected by a spatula spoon and dried in an oven at 105 c for the x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultimate iv diffractometer analysis balcik 2021 2 3 3 extraction and characterization of membrane foulants the membrane samples were cut into circles with a radius of 2 5 cm and immersed in 50 ml solutions of di water or naoh solution ph 12 0 the sample immersed solutions were placed into a shaker for 10 h under 80 rpm and 40 c lee et al 2020 the resultant solutions were subject to eem measurements to investigate the composition of the foulants a fluorescence regional integration fri technique was used to quantify the contribution to the eem spectra of two delimited regions region i ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm representing soluble microbial product smp like substances region ii ex 250 nm em 380 nm representing humic acid ha like substances tian et al

secondary or tertiary responses at longer wavelengths mf of region i and ii was 2 69 and 1 59 respectively the resultant naoh solutions were extracted with an equal volume of ch2cl2 and analyzed by gc gc tof ms the extraction and analysis methods are listed in section 2 3 1 3 results 3 1 water quality analysis the water quality for the influent of each membrane process were examined table 2 no obvious difference was noticed in different water samples for ph ranged from 8 to 9 the conductivity cod and toc values of cold rolling wastewater brine exhibited no evident change after the softening process while their value increased by approximately 1 2 times from 1st pass ro influent to 1st stage nf influent which was attributed to the concentration effect by ro membrane filtration from 1st stage nf influent to 2nd stage nf influent the cod and toc values also doubled while the conductivity only increased by about 14 6 which ascribed to the high organic foulants rejection and low monovalent ions rejection by the nf membrane mohammad et al 2015 the conductivity cod and toc values entering the 2nd and 3rd pass ro decreased as these processes received the permeates rather than the brines from previous membrane processes the sio2 concentration showed a similar variation trend with the conductivity value before the 2nd stage nf process the unexpected increment of sio2 concentration in the 2nd pass ro influent was caused by the backflow of the ed desalinated water containing a high concentration of sio2 the ca2 concentration decreased from 246 20 mg l to 0 41 mg l after softening unit exhibiting a removal rate of 99 83 while the mg2 concentration reduced from 19 49 mg l to 0 06 mg l with a removal rate of 99 69 the scaling ions concentration in the feed water of the membrane unit was fairly low and therefore the scaling potential on subsequent membrane units should be effectively inhibited unless the concentration of the scaling ions occurred due to the high water recovery of the zld system lee et al 2020 the concentration of ca2 and mg2 increased slightly and reached highest value in the 2nd stage nf influent in the membrane unit due to the rejection and concentration of nf membrane the al3 and fe3 originated from the coagulation process maintained low concentration levels throughout the membrane unit eem was performed to fingerprint the dom in the influent of each unit in the multi step membrane process fig 2 there were three typical fluorescence peaks observed for pristine cold rolling wastewater brine in fig 2a and these peaks were labeled as peaks ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ peak i represents smp like substances while peaks ii and iii refer to ha like substances tian et al 2016 compared with cold rolling wastewater brine the reduction of fluorescence intensity in the 1st pass ro influent indicated that the softening unit could largely remove organic foulants especially those substance matched with peak ⅲ fig 2b as expected the organic foulants were rejected and markedly concentrated by the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf membrane fig 2c and d the fluorescence intensity of the 2nd stage nf influent was highest indicating the highest concentration of organic foulants which was consistent with the cod and toc values table 2 due to the high removal efficiency of organic foulants by 2nd stage nf and 2nd pass ro processes the fluorescence intensities of the 2nd pass ro influent and subsequent 3rd pass ro influent both declined dramatically fig 2e and f in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of foulant compositions in the influent gc gc tof ms analysis of the raw cold rolling wastewater brine was conducted and it successfully identified about 130 foulants each circle in the chromatogram represents a foulant fig 2g the foulants were classified into 8 categories total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs phenols alcohols acids esters aldehydes ketones and others among them the number of tphs was the largest about 110 the relative content correlating to the circle area of aromatic substances with chemical formula like c14h22o and c23h32o2 were highest notably aromatic substances existed in the cold rolling wastewater brine may contribute to the fluorescence in eem carstea et al 2016 2020 in addition a few alcohols acids esters and other organic foulants were also noticed in the raw cold rolling wastewater brine these foulants may have the potential to deposit on the membrane surface to induce membrane fouling 3 2 characterization of fouled membranes 3 2 1 sem edx analysis the morphological contrast of the fouling layer between different membranes was observed by the sem technique fig 3 a e the typical ridge and valley structure of the ro membrane was not observed from the image of 1st pass ro membrane fig 3a zhao et al 2020a indicating coverage of a layer of foulant on the membrane surface in the 1st stage nf process the presence of irregular and scattered particles was observed on the membrane fig 3b the distribution of silicon and aluminum corresponds well with the foulant distribution on the 1st stage nf membrane suggesting that silicon and aluminum were the main component of the foulant fig 3b there were more particles consisting elements of silicon oxygen and aluminum on the 2nd stage nf membrane surface fig 3c suggesting more severe fouling occurred in the 2nd stage nf process these results were verified by the water permeability decrement decreasing from 7 58 to 4 14 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 table 1 the percentages of silicon gradually increased in the 1st pass ro membrane 1st stage nf membrane and 2nd stage nf membrane fig 3f showing a positive correlation with the sio2 concentration in influents fig 3g these results revealed that the increased silicon fouling degree in 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf process was highly related to the increasing silicon concentration in influents the 2nd pass ro membrane was completely covered by an amorphous and dense fouling layer fig 3d which was mainly composed of silicon element ratio 64 2 wt and aluminum element ratio 7 8 wt fig 3f the severe fouling resulted in the decrease of water permeability from 6 63 to 0 88 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the salt rejection declined to 39 2 table 1 and the decline in salt rejection should be due to the colloidal enhanced concentration polarization the sio2 concentration in the 2nd pass ro influent was approximately 70 mg l table 2 because of the high recovery rate of the 2nd pass ro process 70 and concentration polarization the sio2 concentration at the vicinity of the membrane surface could reach 230 mg l which exceeded the saturation concentration 125 mg l at 25 c park et al 2020 therefore the severe silica scaling on the 2nd pass ro membrane may be initiated by the heterogeneous nucleation of silica on the membrane surface followed by continuous silica polymerization xie and gray 2017 the aluminum which facilitated silica formation chen et al 2020 deposited on the 2nd pass ro membrane with silica simultaneously fig d foulants on the 3rd pass ro membrane was sparsely distributed and primarily consisted of silica and aluminum fig 3e although the 3rd pass ro influent was the permeates from the 1st and 2nd ro processes the relatively low concentration of foulant can still induce a fouling layer covering the entire membrane surface since some studies have reported that organic foulant can still cover the membrane surface even its concentration is quite low li et al 2021 which implies that the organic foulant may contribute to the membrane fouling for 3rd pass ro membrane this result calls for a further extraction based analysis moreover the caso4 mgso4 or caf2 scaling was not observed in all fouled membranes indicating that the softening unit effectively prevented the scaling from hardness ions 3 2 2 atr ftir and xrd analysis the functional groups of foulants on membrane surfaces were characterized by atr ftir spectra fig 4 a the maximum absorbance of peak at 1025 cm 1 in the 2nd pass ro membrane was related to si o si revealing the presence of sio2 in the fouling layer li et al 2020b wang et al 2020a compared with the 2nd pass ro membrane other membranes presented relatively weak peaks corresponding to sio2 which were consistent with the results of eds analysis fig 3f these results validated severe silica scaling formed in the 2nd pass ro process while silica scaling was relatively slight in other membrane processes the xrd characterization was employed to determine the crystalline structure of foulants on membrane surfaces fig 4b the diffraction peaks are consistent with the joint committee powder diffraction standards jcpds card of al2o3 jcpds 50 0741 and alsi0 5o2 5 jcpds 29 0084 suggesting the collected foulant depositing on the membranes surface contained al2o3 and al2sio5 these results could be confirmed by the presence of si o and al in the eds analysis fig 3 since the diffraction peaks of sio2 were not observed the sio2 deposited on the membrane was primarily amorphous 3 3 characterization of extracted membrane foulants the characterization of fouled membranes suggested that the inorganic foulants were mainly composed of silica aluminum oxide and aluminum silicate the organic compounds present in cold rolling wastewater also have a great potential to deposit on the membrane surface and contribute to membrane fouling therefore the foulants on membrane surfaces were extracted by di water and naoh solution same procedures as water quality analysis in section 3 1 were performed for membrane extracts analysis the extracts were measured by both eem and gc gc tof ms to identify the characteristics of the organic foulants and assess the relationships between foulants concentration in influents and in extracts 3 3 1 fluorescence properties of the membrane foulants alkaline agents such as naoh are typically used to extract organic foulants via hydrolysis and solubilization jiang et al 2017 the foulants were extracted by di water and naoh solution respectively for eem measurement fig 5 a l sheng and yu 2006 smp like substances and ha like substances were detected in all the extracts among which ha like substances were the dominant organic fouling species from eem images the fluorescence intensities both smp like substances and ha like substances of nf membranes extracts were obviously higher than those of ro membranes extracts moreover the φi n normalized area volumes of extracts were calculated to compare the amount of organic foulant on the different membranes table s3 the φi n of nf membrane extracts were larger one order than those of ro membrane extracts these results could be attributed to the relatively high organic concentration in influent of the nf processes table 2 the φi n of extracts and influents were further used to assess the relationships between organic foulants concentration in influents and in extracts the φi n of two different classes organic foulants i e smp like substances and ha like substances in both di water and naoh extracts obviously correlated with the φi n of influents but the degree of correlation was different fig 5f and l in terms of smp like substances the φi n of extracts exhibited a linear correlation with φi n of influents the r 2 for di water extracts and influents was 0 942 fig 5f while for naoh extracts and influents was 0 988 fig 5l in terms of ha like substances the φi n of extracts and influents also positively correlated among five different processes the φi n of 1st stage nf extracts were quite high and did not linearly correlate with those of other processes these results suggesting that the amounts of organic foulants deposited on membranes in the zld system highly correlated with the influents concentration moreover the interactions between membranes and foulants have a great impact on foulants deposition which explains why the φi n of extracts and influents did not linearly correlate wang et al 2020b 3 3 2 gc gc tof ms analysis of the extracted foulants the naoh extracts were analyzed qualitatively and semi quantitatively using gc gc tof ms to identify the specific organic foulants fig 6 the foulants were also categorized as tphs phenols alcohols acids esters aldehydes ketones and others the total number of foulants in all extracts was approximately 130 of which 110 foulants 85 were identified as tphs fig 6a there was no obvious difference in categories and number of foulants between different extracts and raw cold rolling wastewater brine these results indicated that the compositions of organic foulants on membrane surfaces were consistent with the water quality of zld membrane systems notably only 3 6 were phenols among the 130 detected foulants in extracts fig 6a while the relative content percentage of phenols was as high as 20 fig 6b the reasons should be i the concentration of phenols in cold rolling wastewater brine was higher than those of other foulants fig 2g ii due to hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions phenols were more readily adsorbed to the membrane than tphs li et al 2015 virtanen et al 2018 4 discussion according to the above analysis on the membrane foulants we can obtain a comprehensive understanding of the membrane fouling condition for different membrane processes in the zld system for cold rolling wastewater brine treatment fig 7 notably the ed process was also applied in this full scale zld system ed is an electrically driven membrane process while nf and ro processes are driven by pressure the different driving forces should correspond with distinct mechanisms of membrane fouling therefore the membrane fouling analysis in this study only focused on the pressure driven nf and ro processes the membrane fouling behaviors along the wastewater flow direction in the pressure driven membrane processes of the zld system showed distinct characteristics increasing amounts of foulants were deposited on the membrane surfaces along the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf processes mu et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 among these three processes the membrane fouling in 1st ro process was the slightest corresponding to the lowest contaminant concentration in influent in contrast the organic fouling especially ha like substances and silica scaling were markedly intensive for the 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf membranes as the foulants were rejected and concentrated by previous membrane processes in the 2nd pass ro process the organic fouling was negligible thanks to the high rejection of organic matters in nf processes however severe inorganic fouling containing amorphous sio2 al2o3 and alsi0 5o2 5 occurred on the membrane surface the silica in the 2nd pass ro process reached saturation due to the recirculation flow containing relatively high concentration of silica high water recovery and concentration polarization resulting in an amorphous and dense fouling layer formed by heterogeneous nucleation of silica on the membrane surface and continuous silica polymerization xie and gray 2017 importantly the co deposition of aluminum was noticed particularly for the 2nd pass ro process which resulted from the possible electrostatic attraction between aluminum and silica the aluminum might bridge the neighboring silica particles and thereby enhance the self polymerization process of the silica intensifying the silica scaling on ro membrane surface chen et al 2020 in the 3rd pass ro process both the amounts of organic and inorganic foulants decreased dramatically due to the relatively low foulants concentration in its influent our membrane fouling analysis in a full scale zld system indicates the quite distinction among different steps of the nf ro processes which validated the necessity of conducting comprehensive membrane fouling analysis in a multi step membrane unit the membrane fouling variations in different steps were highly related to their influent qualities this result provides a new dimension to understand the mechanisms of membrane fouling in multi step membrane processes it is worth noting that the low concentration contaminants in the raw wastewater may lead to severe fouling due to the high water recovery and concentration polarization effect in the zld system the severe silica scaling in 2nd pass ro process in this study was caused by the concentration of sio2 in membrane processes moreover unlike conventional membrane fouling layer composition ngo et al 2021 membrane fouling compositions specific for the zld system should be carefully concerned to facilitate development of more effective fouling control strategies the insight of fouling characteristics and evolutions in multi step membrane zld processes inspires new strategies for membrane fouling control the most severe fouling occurred in this zld system was silica scaling in 2nd pass ro process keeping silica concentration in 2nd pass ro brine below its saturation concentration even under the effect of concentration polarization is crucial to the effective control of silica scaling as a consequence the following three control strategies are proposed i add silica scale inhibitors to the influent of 2nd pass ro process ii add a silica removal process like coagulation between two stage nf and 2nd pass ro process iii reduce the circulated flow rate of silica containing mf product water to the 2nd pass ro process in addition the organic fouling in the two stage nf processes could be alleviated by improving the dom removal efficiency of softening unit by process optimization or removing dom in the 1st pass ro brine before feeding the brine into the following nf processes for the aspect of membrane cleaning strategies the strategies for different membrane processes should be designed based on the foulant characteristics for the complex inorganic organic fouling in the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf processes alkaline agents were recommended to be used in tandem with acid agents huang et al 2020a moreover mixing surfactant metal chelating agent with alkaline agents would exhibit synergistic enhancement effect huang et al 2020b except for typical alkaline and acid cleaning agents a customized agent with high silica cleaning efficiency needs to be employed in the 2nd pass ro membrane cleaning regarding the slight fouling in the 3rd pass ro process only periodic and simple cleaning needs to be performed according to the recommendation of the membrane manufacturer we believe that the elucidation on the membrane fouling evolution in the full scale zld system could provide reference for the optimization of operating and cleaning strategies in the real industrial wastewater zld treatment plant 5 conclusions the membrane fouling behavior showed distinct characteristics along the wastewater flow direction in the zld system increasing amounts of foulants were deposited on the membrane surfaces along the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf processes the organic fouling and silica scaling were more intensive in 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf for treating concentrate of 1st pass ro in the 2nd pass ro process the organic fouling was negligible thanks to the high rejection of organic matters in nf processes however severe inorganic fouling containing amorphous sio2 al2o3 and al2sio5 occurred on the membrane surface in the 3rd pass ro process both the amounts of organic and inorganic foulants decreased dramatically in addition the specific organic foulants in cold rolling wastewater brine like aromatic substances and tphs were present widely and indiscriminately in membrane systems the elucidation on the membrane fouling evolution in the full scale zld system could provide reference for the

available on request 1 introduction the discharge of inappropriately treated industrial wastewater leads to the contamination of both ecological environment and water sources which severely aggravates the water scarcity ma et al 2020 the challenge of water scarcity drives stringent environmental regulations that intend to maximize the reuse of industrial wastewater xiong and wei 2017 spurring the growth of zero liquid discharge zld or minimal liquid discharge mld treatment of the industrial wastewater ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the zld has been applied to treat different types of industrial wastewaters such as textile wastewater li et al 2020a lin et al 2019 moreira et al 2021 shale gas produced water carrero parreño et al 2019 oilfield produced water zhao et al 2020b and steel wastewater jiang et al 2021a the steel industry is one of the largest water intensive sectors and wastewater dischargers the effective zld treatment of steel industrial wastewater can enable reduction of wastewater discharge and simultaneous recovery of resources jiang et al 2021a membrane based technology including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro has been increasingly applied in the zld process tong and elimelech 2016 due to its higher energy efficiency lower capital and operating costs compared with the thermal method panagopoulos 2021 xiao et al 2020 to purify separate and concentrate wastewater in the zld systems nf and ro membranes can be jointly used to form a complex but effective multi step membrane process including multi pass and multi stage modes the nf process enables separation of divalent ions from monovalent ions while the ro process is responsible for high level water purification and concentration of target streams chen et al 2021 ma et al 2021 in the multi step nf ro processes membrane fouling phenomenon is inevitable zheng et al 2018 which results in a decreased water flux increased operating pressure and more intense energy consumption bush et al 2016 severely hindering the stable operation of membrane based zld system zhao et al 2021 deciphering the characteristics and mechanisms of membrane fouling in the membrane based zld system is crucial for the development of effective fouling control strategies the membrane fouling originates from the inorganic and organic contaminants in the matrix of industrial wastewater chen et al 2021 song et al 2020 specifically the cold rolling wastewater from the steel industry often contains a variety of contaminants capable of inducing membrane fouling such as oils bactericides surfactants emulsifiers and salt ions jiang et al 2021b due to the effect of concentration polarization oranso and eric 2014 wende et al 2018 the concentration of the contaminants near the membrane surface can be markedly higher than those in the bulk phase moreover the high water recovery of the zld system can also contribute to the concentration of contaminants which further intensifies the deposition of foulants on the surface of membrane especially for those membrane steps responsible for treating concentrated streams this phenomenon implies that the membrane fouling conditions can be quite distinct among different steps of the nf ro zld processes however current studies only focused on the membrane fouling of single step in the membrane based processes song et al 2020 unal 2022 investigating the characteristics and mechanisms of membrane fouling from a new dimension i e analyzing multiple membrane steps in the membrane processes is imperative to establish a comprehensive understanding on the membrane fouling in the zld system herein membrane fouling characteristics and mechanisms in a full scale zld system for cold rolling wastewater brine treatment were investigated via a comprehensive analysis on multi step nf and ro membrane processes the water quality for each step of nf and ro processes was analyzed to construct a profile of the composition of contaminants the fouled membranes sampled from five different nf or ro membrane processes were systematically characterized correlation between the influent water quality and the membrane fouling characteristic was investigated the mechanisms of membrane fouling in the zld system were unraveled to elucidate the discrepancy in membrane fouling conditions for the different membrane processes this work will facilitate the development of membrane fouling control strategies in zld systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of the zld system a full scale zld system in a steel industrial plant for treating the ro brine of cold rolling wastewater was investigated the zld system consisting of a softening unit multi step membrane units and crystallization units fig 1 has a treatment capacity of 5000 m3 d the cold rolling wastewater brine was firstly treated by the softening unit including coagulation precipitation filter ultrafiltration uf and ion exchange for removal of the scaling ions ca2 and mg2 to ensure the stability of the subsequent membrane units the effluent from the softening unit was then fed into the 1st pass ro process for entrance into membrane units the brine of 1st pass ro process was fed to a two stage nf process to separate the nacl and na2so4 and concentrate the na2so4 enriched stream which was further subject to the freeze crystallization fc step for na2so4 recovery the permeates from nf processes were sent to the 2nd pass ro process to harvest freshwater and concentrate the nacl enriched stream to reduce the throughput of the evaporation crystallization unit an electrodialysis ed process was applied for the further concentration of the 2nd pass ro brine followed by a mechanical vapor recompression mvr step to crystallize the nacl salt the desalinated water in ed process was subject to coagulation and microfiltration mf treatment and then circulated to the uf process and the 2nd pass ro process resulting in zero wastewater discharged from the system permeates from the 1st pass ro and the 2nd pass ro processes were finally purified by the 3rd pass ro process to meet reused water standards the 3rd pass ro brine was flowed back to the 1st pass ro process the zld system has been operated for approximately 3 years one of the thorny problems occurring in the actual operation was that the water recovery rate of the high pressure membrane processes could not reach the design value among them the water recovery rates of 2nd stage nf and 2nd pass ro decreased by 10 0 15 0 and 10 0 20 0 under designed operating pressure respectively table s1 in addition although the water recovery rates of 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 3rd pass ro could reach the corresponding design values the membrane fouling was still noticed for these processes 2 2 sample collection 2 2 1 water samples the raw cold rolling wastewater brine was collected before its entrance into the softening step the feed of the nf and ro membrane processes were collected from the first membrane element all water sampling points were highlighted in fig 1 all the water samples were stored at 4 c in the laboratory to minimize the change of constituents in water samples 2 2 2 membrane coupons the fouled spiral wound elements of the nf and ro membrane processes were autopsied for comprehensively analyze each process of multi step membrane unit ten different membrane coupons of 20 50 cm2 were cut off from the first element of each process and transported freshly to the laboratory for analysis the water permeability and salt rejection of sampled membranes were tested immediately table 1 after 1 h pre compaction the performance of ro fouled membranes was measured with 1000 μs cm nacl at 1 5 mpa for 1 h and the performance of nf fouled membranes was measured with 2000 μs cm na2so4 at 0 6 mpa for 1 h the schematic of laboratory scale cross flow membrane filtration system and the procedure of membrane performance test were described in our previous studies dai et al 2019 dai et al 2020 the sampled membranes were stored at 4 c basic information of sampled membrane elements is presented in table 1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis the raw cold rolling wastewater brine and the influents from different high pressure membrane processes were subject to water quality analysis the ph and conductivity were measured by a conductivity meter ddsj 308f inesa instrument and a ph meter hq40d hach respectively the concentrations of cations ca2 mg2 al3 and fe3 and sio2 were quantified by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5110 measurement of chemical oxygen demand cod was conducted by a multiparameter bench photometer for laboratories dr3900 and dr2800 hach the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem aqualog horiba and total organic carbon toc toc vcph shimadzu were employed to determine the constituent and concentration of dissolved organic matter dom respectively the raw cold rolling wastewater brine was extracted with an equal volume of dichloromethane ch2cl2 and analyzed by using a two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms pegasus hrt 4d leco an appropriate amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 was dissolved into water samples to avoid emulsification occurred during extraction gc gc tof ms method parameters can be found in table s2 leco chroma tof software was used for data processing for ensuring the accuracy only the pollutants with characteristic peaks matching degree higher than 75 were counted tang et al 2021 2 3 2 characterization of fouled membrane

analysis was conducted by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds oxford xplore at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectrum two perkinelmer was used to identify the functional groups of the fouled membranes the fouling layers on the membrane surface were collected by a spatula spoon and dried in an oven at 105 c for the x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultimate iv diffractometer analysis balcik 2021 2 3 3 extraction and characterization of membrane foulants the membrane samples were cut into circles with a radius of 2 5 cm and immersed in 50 ml solutions of di water or naoh solution ph 12 0 the sample immersed solutions were placed into a shaker for 10 h under 80 rpm and 40 c lee et al 2020 the resultant solutions were subject to eem measurements to investigate the composition of the foulants a fluorescence regional integration fri technique was used to quantify the contribution to the eem spectra of two delimited regions region i ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm representing soluble microbial product smp like substances region ii ex 250 nm em 380 nm representing humic acid ha like substances tian et al

secondary or tertiary responses at longer wavelengths mf of region i and ii was 2 69 and 1 59 respectively the resultant naoh solutions were extracted with an equal volume of ch2cl2 and analyzed by gc gc tof ms the extraction and analysis methods are listed in section 2 3 1 3 results 3 1 water quality analysis the water quality for the influent of each membrane process were examined table 2 no obvious difference was noticed in different water samples for ph ranged from 8 to 9 the conductivity cod and toc values of cold rolling wastewater brine exhibited no evident change after the softening process while their value increased by approximately 1 2 times from 1st pass ro influent to 1st stage nf influent which was attributed to the concentration effect by ro membrane filtration from 1st stage nf influent to 2nd stage nf influent the cod and toc values also doubled while the conductivity only increased by about 14 6 which ascribed to the high organic foulants rejection and low monovalent ions rejection by the nf membrane mohammad et al 2015 the conductivity cod and toc values entering the 2nd and 3rd pass ro decreased as these processes received the permeates rather than the brines from previous membrane processes the sio2 concentration showed a similar variation trend with the conductivity value before the 2nd stage nf process the unexpected increment of sio2 concentration in the 2nd pass ro influent was caused by the backflow of the ed desalinated water containing a high concentration of sio2 the ca2 concentration decreased from 246 20 mg l to 0 41 mg l after softening unit exhibiting a removal rate of 99 83 while the mg2 concentration reduced from 19 49 mg l to 0 06 mg l with a removal rate of 99 69 the scaling ions concentration in the feed water of the membrane unit was fairly low and therefore the scaling potential on subsequent membrane units should be effectively inhibited unless the concentration of the scaling ions occurred due to the high water recovery of the zld system lee et al 2020 the concentration of ca2 and mg2 increased slightly and reached highest value in the 2nd stage nf influent in the membrane unit due to the rejection and concentration of nf membrane the al3 and fe3 originated from the coagulation process maintained low concentration levels throughout the membrane unit eem was performed to fingerprint the dom in the influent of each unit in the multi step membrane process fig 2 there were three typical fluorescence peaks observed for pristine cold rolling wastewater brine in fig 2a and these peaks were labeled as peaks ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ peak i represents smp like substances while peaks ii and iii refer to ha like substances tian et al 2016 compared with cold rolling wastewater brine the reduction of fluorescence intensity in the 1st pass ro influent indicated that the softening unit could largely remove organic foulants especially those substance matched with peak ⅲ fig 2b as expected the organic foulants were rejected and markedly concentrated by the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf membrane fig 2c and d the fluorescence intensity of the 2nd stage nf influent was highest indicating the highest concentration of organic foulants which was consistent with the cod and toc values table 2 due to the high removal efficiency of organic foulants by 2nd stage nf and 2nd pass ro processes the fluorescence intensities of the 2nd pass ro influent and subsequent 3rd pass ro influent both declined dramatically fig 2e and f in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of foulant compositions in the influent gc gc tof ms analysis of the raw cold rolling wastewater brine was conducted and it successfully identified about 130 foulants each circle in the chromatogram represents a foulant fig 2g the foulants were classified into 8 categories total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs phenols alcohols acids esters aldehydes ketones and others among them the number of tphs was the largest about 110 the relative content correlating to the circle area of aromatic substances with chemical formula like c14h22o and c23h32o2 were highest notably aromatic substances existed in the cold rolling wastewater brine may contribute to the fluorescence in eem carstea et al 2016 2020 in addition a few alcohols acids esters and other organic foulants were also noticed in the raw cold rolling wastewater brine these foulants may have the potential to deposit on the membrane surface to induce membrane fouling 3 2 characterization of fouled membranes 3 2 1 sem edx analysis the morphological contrast of the fouling layer between different membranes was observed by the sem technique fig 3 a e the typical ridge and valley structure of the ro membrane was not observed from the image of 1st pass ro membrane fig 3a zhao et al 2020a indicating coverage of a layer of foulant on the membrane surface in the 1st stage nf process the presence of irregular and scattered particles was observed on the membrane fig 3b the distribution of silicon and aluminum corresponds well with the foulant distribution on the 1st stage nf membrane suggesting that silicon and aluminum were the main component of the foulant fig 3b there were more particles consisting elements of silicon oxygen and aluminum on the 2nd stage nf membrane surface fig 3c suggesting more severe fouling occurred in the 2nd stage nf process these results were verified by the water permeability decrement decreasing from 7 58 to 4 14 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 table 1 the percentages of silicon gradually increased in the 1st pass ro membrane 1st stage nf membrane and 2nd stage nf membrane fig 3f showing a positive correlation with the sio2 concentration in influents fig 3g these results revealed that the increased silicon fouling degree in 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf process was highly related to the increasing silicon concentration in influents the 2nd pass ro membrane was completely covered by an amorphous and dense fouling layer fig 3d which was mainly composed of silicon element ratio 64 2 wt and aluminum element ratio 7 8 wt fig 3f the severe fouling resulted in the decrease of water permeability from 6 63 to 0 88 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the salt rejection declined to 39 2 table 1 and the decline in salt rejection should be due to the colloidal enhanced concentration polarization the sio2 concentration in the 2nd pass ro influent was approximately 70 mg l table 2 because of the high recovery rate of the 2nd pass ro process 70 and concentration polarization the sio2 concentration at the vicinity of the membrane surface could reach 230 mg l which exceeded the saturation concentration 125 mg l at 25 c park et al 2020 therefore the severe silica scaling on the 2nd pass ro membrane may be initiated by the heterogeneous nucleation of silica on the membrane surface followed by continuous silica polymerization xie and gray 2017 the aluminum which facilitated silica formation chen et al 2020 deposited on the 2nd pass ro membrane with silica simultaneously fig d foulants on the 3rd pass ro membrane was sparsely distributed and primarily consisted of silica and aluminum fig 3e although the 3rd pass ro influent was the permeates from the 1st and 2nd ro processes the relatively low concentration of foulant can still induce a fouling layer covering the entire membrane surface since some studies have reported that organic foulant can still cover the membrane surface even its concentration is quite low li et al 2021 which implies that the organic foulant may contribute to the membrane fouling for 3rd pass ro membrane this result calls for a further extraction based analysis moreover the caso4 mgso4 or caf2 scaling was not observed in all fouled membranes indicating that the softening unit effectively prevented the scaling from hardness ions 3 2 2 atr ftir and xrd analysis the functional groups of foulants on membrane surfaces were characterized by atr ftir spectra fig 4 a the maximum absorbance of peak at 1025 cm 1 in the 2nd pass ro membrane was related to si o si revealing the presence of sio2 in the fouling layer li et al 2020b wang et al 2020a compared with the 2nd pass ro membrane other membranes presented relatively weak peaks corresponding to sio2 which were consistent with the results of eds analysis fig 3f these results validated severe silica scaling formed in the 2nd pass ro process while silica scaling was relatively slight in other membrane processes the xrd characterization was employed to determine the crystalline structure of foulants on membrane surfaces fig 4b the diffraction peaks are consistent with the joint committee powder diffraction standards jcpds card of al2o3 jcpds 50 0741 and alsi0 5o2 5 jcpds 29 0084 suggesting the collected foulant depositing on the membranes surface contained al2o3 and al2sio5 these results could be confirmed by the presence of si o and al in the eds analysis fig 3 since the diffraction peaks of sio2 were not observed the sio2 deposited on the membrane was primarily amorphous 3 3 characterization of extracted membrane foulants the characterization of fouled membranes suggested that the inorganic foulants were mainly composed of silica aluminum oxide and aluminum silicate the organic compounds present in cold rolling wastewater also have a great potential to deposit on the membrane surface and contribute to membrane fouling therefore the foulants on membrane surfaces were extracted by di water and naoh solution same procedures as water quality analysis in section 3 1 were performed for membrane extracts analysis the extracts were measured by both eem and gc gc tof ms to identify the characteristics of the organic foulants and assess the relationships between foulants concentration in influents and in extracts 3 3 1 fluorescence properties of the membrane foulants alkaline agents such as naoh are typically used to extract organic foulants via hydrolysis and solubilization jiang et al 2017 the foulants were extracted by di water and naoh solution respectively for eem measurement fig 5 a l sheng and yu 2006 smp like substances and ha like substances were detected in all the extracts among which ha like substances were the dominant organic fouling species from eem images the fluorescence intensities both smp like substances and ha like substances of nf membranes extracts were obviously higher than those of ro membranes extracts moreover the φi n normalized area volumes of extracts were calculated to compare the amount of organic foulant on the different membranes table s3 the φi n of nf membrane extracts were larger one order than those of ro membrane extracts these results could be attributed to the relatively high organic concentration in influent of the nf processes table 2 the φi n of extracts and influents were further used to assess the relationships between organic foulants concentration in influents and in extracts the φi n of two different classes organic foulants i e smp like substances and ha like substances in both di water and naoh extracts obviously correlated with the φi n of influents but the degree of correlation was different fig 5f and l in terms of smp like substances the φi n of extracts exhibited a linear correlation with φi n of influents the r 2 for di water extracts and influents was 0 942 fig 5f while for naoh extracts and influents was 0 988 fig 5l in terms of ha like substances the φi n of extracts and influents also positively correlated among five different processes the φi n of 1st stage nf extracts were quite high and did not linearly correlate with those of other processes these results suggesting that the amounts of organic foulants deposited on membranes in the zld system highly correlated with the influents concentration moreover the interactions between membranes and foulants have a great impact on foulants deposition which explains why the φi n of extracts and influents did not linearly correlate wang et al 2020b 3 3 2 gc gc tof ms analysis of the extracted foulants the naoh extracts were analyzed qualitatively and semi quantitatively using gc gc tof ms to identify the specific organic foulants fig 6 the foulants were also categorized as tphs phenols alcohols acids esters aldehydes ketones and others the total number of foulants in all extracts was approximately 130 of which 110 foulants 85 were identified as tphs fig 6a there was no obvious difference in categories and number of foulants between different extracts and raw cold rolling wastewater brine these results indicated that the compositions of organic foulants on membrane surfaces were consistent with the water quality of zld membrane systems notably only 3 6 were phenols among the 130 detected foulants in extracts fig 6a while the relative content percentage of phenols was as high as 20 fig 6b the reasons should be i the concentration of phenols in cold rolling wastewater brine was higher than those of other foulants fig 2g ii due to hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions phenols were more readily adsorbed to the membrane than tphs li et al 2015 virtanen et al 2018 4 discussion according to the above analysis on the membrane foulants we can obtain a comprehensive understanding of the membrane fouling condition for different membrane processes in the zld system for cold rolling wastewater brine treatment fig 7 notably the ed process was also applied in this full scale zld system ed is an electrically driven membrane process while nf and ro processes are driven by pressure the different driving forces should correspond with distinct mechanisms of membrane fouling therefore the membrane fouling analysis in this study only focused on the pressure driven nf and ro processes the membrane fouling behaviors along the wastewater flow direction in the pressure driven membrane processes of the zld system showed distinct characteristics increasing amounts of foulants were deposited on the membrane surfaces along the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf processes mu et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 among these three processes the membrane fouling in 1st ro process was the slightest corresponding to the lowest contaminant concentration in influent in contrast the organic fouling especially ha like substances and silica scaling were markedly intensive for the 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf membranes as the foulants were rejected and concentrated by previous membrane processes in the 2nd pass ro process the organic fouling was negligible thanks to the high rejection of organic matters in nf processes however severe inorganic fouling containing amorphous sio2 al2o3 and alsi0 5o2 5 occurred on the membrane surface the silica in the 2nd pass ro process reached saturation due to the recirculation flow containing relatively high concentration of silica high water recovery and concentration polarization resulting in an amorphous and dense fouling layer formed by heterogeneous nucleation of silica on the membrane surface and continuous silica polymerization xie and gray 2017 importantly the co deposition of aluminum was noticed particularly for the 2nd pass ro process which resulted from the possible electrostatic attraction between aluminum and silica the aluminum might bridge the neighboring silica particles and thereby enhance the self polymerization process of the silica intensifying the silica scaling on ro membrane surface chen et al 2020 in the 3rd pass ro process both the amounts of organic and inorganic foulants decreased dramatically due to the relatively low foulants concentration in its influent our membrane fouling analysis in a full scale zld system indicates the quite distinction among different steps of the nf ro processes which validated the necessity of conducting comprehensive membrane fouling analysis in a multi step membrane unit the membrane fouling variations in different steps were highly related to their influent qualities this result provides a new dimension to understand the mechanisms of membrane fouling in multi step membrane processes it is worth noting that the low concentration contaminants in the raw wastewater may lead to severe fouling due to the high water recovery and concentration polarization effect in the zld system the severe silica scaling in 2nd pass ro process in this study was caused by the concentration of sio2 in membrane processes moreover unlike conventional membrane fouling layer composition ngo et al 2021 membrane fouling compositions specific for the zld system should be carefully concerned to facilitate development of more effective fouling control strategies the insight of fouling characteristics and evolutions in multi step membrane zld processes inspires new strategies for membrane fouling control the most severe fouling occurred in this zld system was silica scaling in 2nd pass ro process keeping silica concentration in 2nd pass ro brine below its saturation concentration even under the effect of concentration polarization is crucial to the effective control of silica scaling as a consequence the following three control strategies are proposed i add silica scale inhibitors to the influent of 2nd pass ro process ii add a silica removal process like coagulation between two stage nf and 2nd pass ro process iii reduce the circulated flow rate of silica containing mf product water to the 2nd pass ro process in addition the organic fouling in the two stage nf processes could be alleviated by improving the dom removal efficiency of softening unit by process optimization or removing dom in the 1st pass ro brine before feeding the brine into the following nf processes for the aspect of membrane cleaning strategies the strategies for different membrane processes should be designed based on the foulant characteristics for the complex inorganic organic fouling in the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf processes alkaline agents were recommended to be used in tandem with acid agents huang et al 2020a moreover mixing surfactant metal chelating agent with alkaline agents would exhibit synergistic enhancement effect huang et al 2020b except for typical alkaline and acid cleaning agents a customized agent with high silica cleaning efficiency needs to be employed in the 2nd pass ro membrane cleaning regarding the slight fouling in the 3rd pass ro process only periodic and simple cleaning needs to be performed according to the recommendation of the membrane manufacturer we believe that the elucidation on the membrane fouling evolution in the full scale zld system could provide reference for the optimization of operating and cleaning strategies in the real industrial wastewater zld treatment plant 5 conclusions the membrane fouling behavior showed distinct characteristics along the wastewater flow direction in the zld system increasing amounts of foulants were deposited on the membrane surfaces along the 1st pass ro 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf processes the organic fouling and silica scaling were more intensive in 1st stage nf and 2nd stage nf for treating concentrate of 1st pass ro in the 2nd pass ro process the organic fouling was negligible thanks to the high rejection of organic matters in nf processes however severe inorganic fouling containing amorphous sio2 al2o3 and al2sio5 occurred on the membrane surface in the 3rd pass ro process both the amounts of organic and inorganic foulants decreased dramatically in addition the specific organic foulants in cold rolling wastewater brine like aromatic substances and tphs were present widely and indiscriminately in membrane systems the elucidation on the membrane fouling evolution in the full scale zld system could provide reference for the

15342,methane emissions from the sewer system are considered to be a non negligible source of aggravating the greenhouse effect meanwhile the sewer system has long been plagued by sulfide induced corrosion problems this study explored the possibility of using a bioelectrochemical system to intensify the competition between electroactive bacteria methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria thereby reducing the production of methane and sulfide dual chamber bioelectrochemical reactors were constructed and operated in fed batch mode with the coexistence of electroactive bacteria methanogenic archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria acetate was supplied as the sole carbon source the results indicated that electrogenesis induced by the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v vs ag agcl had advantages over methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis in consuming acetate the stimulated electrogenesis by anode potentials resulted in a decrease in ph methane production was suppressed in the reactors with anode potentials of 0 42 and 0 2 v compared to open circuit controls in contrast to methane the capacity for sulfide production was facilitated in the reactors with the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v compared to open circuit controls 16s rrna gene analysis showed that geobacter was the most abundant genus on the anode biofilm in the anode potential controlled reactor while acetoclastic methanogens dominated in open circuit controls methanosaeta and methanosarcina were the most abundant methanogens in open circuit controls collectively our study demonstrates that the use of electrodes with anode potential control can help to control methane emissions but could not yet prevent sulfide production which requires further research graphical abstract image graphical

sewer system responsible for collecting and transporting sewage from generation locations to treatment plants plays an important role in urban sanitation systems however sewer gas is generated during sewage transportation and contains harmful components hydrogen sulfide and methane are the harmful components of most concern hereafter referred to as sewer gas accumulation of hydrogen sulfide results in severe pipe corrosion and thus decreases the expected lifetime of sewer infrastructure with a concrete corrosion rate ranging from 1 1 to 10 mm per year zuo et al 2019 owing to the corrosion issue a huge amount of money is involved in the maintenance of the sewer system for instance the usa pays 36 billion per year regarding the corrosion of drinking water and sewer system koch et al 2002 methane is a greenhouse gas and its global warming potential is more than 20 times stronger than carbon dioxide guisasola et al 2008 field measurements in australia indicated that the methane concentration in rising main sewers was approximately 5 to 30 mg l which could contribute about 12 100 of the additional greenhouse gas emission over that from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp guisasola et al 2008 sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma are the microorganisms responsible for producing sewer gas since anaerobic sewage usually contains less nitrate than sulfate sulfate is the most thermodynamically preferred electron acceptor in the sewage sulfate together with organic materials e g acetate and propionate serving as carbon and electron donor is utilized by srb to form sulfide gutierrez et al 2016 the microbiome attached to the sewer pipe surface primarily sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob can further oxidize sulfide into sulfuric acid with oxygen as the electron acceptor gutierrez et al 2016 the produced sulfuric acid can react with cement based sewer pipes producing two typical corrosion products gypsum and ettringite jiang et al 2014 ma can utilize acetate or hydrogen and co2 gas produced by fermentation to obtain energy and form methane in anaerobic sewers gutierrez et al 2016 current sulfide control technologies mainly rely on the addition of chemicals nemati et al 2001 and gutierrez et al 2014 demonstrated the suppression of srb activity by applying a metabolic inhibitor or ph shock gutierrez et al 2014 nemati et al 2001 moreover the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide oxygen and nitrate is used to remove the generated sulfide zhang et al 2008 current methane control strategies also rely on chemical dosing most of these chemicals are generally applied for suppressing sulfide production in sewers such as o2 ganigué and yuan 2014 no3 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 and naoh gutierrez et al 2009 however these current sewer gas control technologies require large amounts of chemical and capital investment 1 9 7 2 kg s removal zhang et al 2008 in addition the effectiveness of some current sewer gas control technologies can hardly maintain for a long period a field test revealed that after ph shock under various ph 10 5 12 5 and exposure time 0 5 6 0 h the activities of srb and ma gradually recovered within 1 and 4 weeks respectively gutierrez et al 2014 therefore there is a call for alternative technology to control sewer gas the essence of a robust sewer gas suppression is to continuously suppress the activity of ma and srb with minimized chemical and energy inputs bioelectrochemical system bes is a possible alternative technology to control sewer gas firstly the use of anode under close circuit condition has been proven to be capable of oxidizing sulfide ni et al 2019 sun et al 2009 secondly under close circuit condition the use of anode might also control sewer gas by intensifying the microbial competition as the anode favors the growth of electroactive bacteria of none srb group eab zhang et al 2020 found that the methane emission was controlled in a constructed wetland by incorporating with bes the suppression of methane is accompanied with a decrease in the relative abundance of ma and enrichment of eab zhang et al 2020 to date the use of anode in the suppression of methane emissions from rice paddy and wetland has been extensively studied ishii et al 2008 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 however although sulfate is also widely present in rice paddy and wetlands these studies did not involve the competition between eab and srb moreover these studies investigated the mitigation of methane emissions by employing microbial fuel cells mfc in which the anode potential was not stably controlled the influence of anode potentials on the competition among eab ma and srb in an environment where ma and srb coexist is still lacking sewer in this case in addition it is still unknown if the anode potential could suppress sulfate reduction as some srb species or sulfate reducing mixed communities are able to use anode as electron acceptor kang et al 2014 miran et al 2018 therefore this study fixed the anode potentials to investigate the effect of anode potentials on the competition among eab srb and ma for the electron donor e g acetate this study for the first time aimed to investigate the feasibility of suppressing sewer gas i e methane and sulfide by using a bes system due to the complexity of the sewer environment simplified simulated sewer conditions were required to allow us to first investigate the microbial competition between srb ma and eab i e electroactive bacteria of none srb group in more depth the key to simulating sewer conditions embedded with the bes system was to realize the coexistence of eab srb and ma therefore dual chamber bes reactors h cell were constructed and fed with synthetic wastewater which contained sulfate and acetate as the sole model carbon source a thermodynamic calculation was first carried out to identify the theoretical anode potential that favors the growth of eab over srb and ma which supports the selection of anode potentials in our experiment the current h2s and ch4 production from acetate a model compound representing organic materials in sewage under various anode potentials were evaluated a carbon balance was made to characterize the proportion of acetate consumption in different products including electrical current h2s and ch4 moreover the evolution of the anodic microbial community was determined and in this way to elucidate the effect of anode potentials on the microbial community 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and electrolytes two incubation bottles were used to prepare the two inocula used in this experiment one for eab and one for srb and ma the eab was incubated in a dual chamber bes reactor elzinga et al 2020 with a substrate of acetate at an anode potential of 0 35 v vs ag agcl for 35 days the srb and ma were obtained from the anaerobic granular sludge of the wastewater treatment plant of eerbeek and cultivated in serum bottles for 35 days 15 ml solution was taken from each of the eab and the srb ma enrichment so in total 30 ml and added to the anode chamber of each bes reactor in the anode chamber of each bes reactor the added 30 ml of inoculum was mixed with 270 ml of fresh anolyte after that the anode chamber was flushed with n2 for 30 min to obtain anaerobic conditions the anolyte contained 2 3 g l ch3coona 3h2o 1 58 g l na2so4 0 2 g l nh4cl 1 ml l vitamin and 1 ml l mineral solution wolin et al 1963 in a phosphate buffer solution 1 36 g l kh2po4 and 5 67 g l na2hpo4 50 mm the catholyte contained 50 mm phosphate buffer 2 2 bes construction four dual chamber bes reactors h cell in the lab scale were constructed elzinga et al 2020 the total volume of each chamber was 345 ml including 300 ml liquid phase and 45 ml gas phase anodic and cathodic chambers were separated by a cation exchange membrane fumasep fks fumatech bwt gmbh with a projected surface area of 8 cm2 graphite felt cgt carbon gmbh germany with a thickness of 0 38 cm was used as the material of anode and cathode the anode and cathode had a projected surface area of 15 cm2 titanium wires salomon s metalen the netherlands were passed through graphite felt and served as the current collector the anolyte and catholyte were mixed thoroughly using magnetic stirring with a fixed speed of 300 rpm gas produced in the anodic and cathodic chamber was collected separately by gas bags with a maximum capacity of 0 6 l cali 5 bondtm calibrated instruments inc usa 2 3 bes operation all four reactors were operated in fed batch mode the anode served as the working electrode the cathode served as the counter electrode and the ag agcl electrode served as the reference electrode ag agcl 3 m kcl prosenseqis qm 710x netherlands all the anode potentials present in this experiment are against the ag agcl reference electrode the anode potential was controlled by potentiostat ivium with ivium soft v2 462 eindhoven the netherlands the control strategy of each anode in different reactors is summarized in table 1 two reactors less positive anode potential lpa and more positive anode potential mpa were operated at the anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v respectively except for phase ii the backup information to select applied anode potentials is in si fig s1 in phase ii lpa and mpa were operated under open circuit condition one control reactor con was operated without electrodes another control reactor ocr was operated with the electrode while the external circuit was disconnected except for phase iii in phase iii ocr was operated at an anode potential of 0 2 v the duration of phase ii and phase iii was set to 4 days to avoid a substantial change in microbial community on the bioanode the operating temperature was maintained at 24 to 27 c 2 4 chemical analysis and calculations methane carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the gas phase were measured regularly by gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc 2010 series under the same conditions as described in hidalgo ulloa et al 2020 hach lange kit lck653 hach germany was used to analyze the sulfide in the liquid phase elzinga et al 2020 a gc agilent 7890b equipped with an hp ffap column 25 m 0 32 mm 0 50 µm was applied to measure the acetate concentration in the same way as jourdin et al 2018 helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 25 ml min during the first 3 minutes and 2 ml min until the end of the run the injection volume and temperature were 1 µl and 250 c respectively a flame ionization detector fid was applied at the temperature of 240 c sulfate concentration was quantified by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 rfic salt lake city usa equipped with autosampler as50 ionpac as 17 c 4 mm standard bore ic analytical column was applied with an eluent of potassium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 ml min the injection volume was 10 µl and the oven temperature was 30 c adrs 600 4 mm dynamically regenerated suppressor was used to increase the detection sensitivity the oxygen concentration in the anolyte was measured by fibox 4 trace and sensor spot sp pst 3 presens germany gas pressure in the reactor was measured by a gas pressure meter gmh 3151 germany the current density was determined based on the projected surface area of the anode reaction specific acetate consumptions rac and realistic gibbs free energies for sulfide production methane production and current generation were calculated as shown in supporting information 2 5 microbial community analysis to investigate the effect of anode potentials on the evolution of the microbial community the microbial communities on the anode biofilm and in the anolyte were taken for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing analysis at the end of the experiment 3 cm2 anode was taken from the reactor of ocr lpa and mpa 50 ml anolyte of each reactor was taken and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 mins genomic dna of the resulting pellets and anodes was extracted with a powersoil dna isolation kit de smit et al 2019 the extracted dna was then amplificated and sequenced as described by de smit et al 2019 the subsequent taxonomic analysis was performed by using the qiime2 diversity tool bolyen et al 2019 2 6 electrochemical analysis cyclic voltammetry cv for bio anode of lpa and mpa was conducted in current dual chamber reactor at the end of phase iv in cv analysis a dual chamber bes reactor with a new anode was built and tested as blank cv was successively carried out in three different mediums which were basal medium basal medium amended with 2 3 g l ch3coona 3h2o and basal medium amended with 2 3 g l ch3coona 3h2o and 1 58 g l na2so4 respectively the basal medium was without acetate and sulfate compared with the anolyte for each medium three consecutive cv cycles were carried out and the third cycle was shown anode potentials progressed positively from open circuit potential by using the potentiostat the scan range was 1 v to 0 2 v vs ag agcl with a scan rate of 1 mv s 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrogenesis stimulated by introducing anode potential the anode potentials facilitate electrogenesis derived from acetate oxidation in the presence of electroactive bacteria of none srb group eab methanogenic archaea ma and sulfate reducing bacteria srb as shown in fig 1 a in phase i the current density of reactors with anode potential of 0 2 v mpa and 0 42v lpa was mainly between 4 3 11 0 a m2 and 0 6 1 6 a m2 respectively the carbon balance indicated that the current generation mainly contributed by acetate oxidation rather than sulfide oxidation on the bioanode further elucidated in section 3 4 the anode potential of 0 2v is more favourable for acetate oxidation to generate current than the anode potential of 0 42v as shown in fig 1 a the current density of mpa was most of the time higher than that of lpa in addition the cv results also showed that the peak current of acetate oxidation in mpa was higher than that in lpa see si fig s3 this is consistent with the results of most studies investigating the optimal anode potential for current generation by eab finkelstein et al 2006 parot et al 2008 ter heijne et al 2008 within a certain range of anode potential the current generated by eab is positively correlated with the positive increase of anode potential the reason might be that the positively increased anode potential increased the energy yield of eab per electron transferred aelterman et al 2008 schröder 2007 however the current generated by eab does not increase continuously with increasing anode potential when the thermodynamic framework was fully exploited korth and harnisch 2019 ter heijne et al 2008 korth and harnisch 2019 indicated that the anode potential regulated the energy yield of eab by affecting the kinetics of extracellular electron transfer and intracellular nad nadh ratio when a sufficiently high nad nadh ratio was reached to fully exploit the thermodynamic framework a further positive increase of the anode potential could not increase the energy yield of eab korth and harnisch 2019 electrogenesis facilitated by anode potentials results in differences in the ph range of lpa and mpa from con and ocr fig 1 b the initial ph of each reactor was around 7 3 during the experiment including both the start up and the experimental phases the ph range of the anolyte was 6 49 7 55 in lpa and 4 72 7 62 in mpa si fig s2 in contrast the ph in con and ocr was usually in a relatively high range mainly between 7 25 and 7 96 si fig s2 the ph decreases in lpa and mpa were most likely due to the dominance of electrogenesis with concurring production of protons while the eab metabolizes acetate table 2 eq3 unlike lpa and mpa the main biological processes in con and ocr were methane and sulfide production fig 2 according to reaction equations table 2 eq1 and eq2 and previous studies fukuzaki et al 1990 kaksonen et al 2004 the methane and sulfide production by consuming acetate could increase the ph therefore the difference in ph range suggested that in the presence of anode potentials electrogenesis was more competitive than methane and sulfide production at the same initial ph 3 2 methanogenesis suppressed due to the anode potential and the subsequent ph decrease in the presence of eab srb and ma methane production rate and accumulation were lower in the reactors with the controlled anode potential as shown in fig 1 c the methane accumulation in lpa and mpa was lower than that in con and ocr for instance in phase i c the methane accumulation in lpa and mpa was 0 03 and 0 51 mmol l anolyte respectively while the methane accumulation in con and ocr was 29 04 and 17 67 mmol l anolyte respectively these results indicate that the ma activity has been suppressed when applying the anode potential of 0 42 lpa and 0 2 v mpa this is consistent with a previous study investigating the competitive relationship between eab and ma without the presence of sulfate and srb which found that closed circuit condition in bioelectrochemical systems can reduce methane production when using cellulose as the carbon source ishii et al 2008 the stimulation of electrogenesis by anode potentials intensified acetate competition which might be one of the reasons for methane suppression in mpa the intensified acetate competition was reflected in accelerated acetate consumption dominated by electrogenesis in mpa the acetate consumption rate in phase i was higher than that of the other three reactors see si fig s4 and most of the acetate consumption was used to generate current fig 2 similarly zhao et al 2019 also found that by applying an anode potential of 20 mv vs ag agcl methane was suppressed accompanied by accelerated acetate consumption under the ph controlled condition at ph around 7 zhao et al 2019 the dominance of electrogenesis in acetate competition with methanogenesis might be due to the advantages of thermodynamics and kinetics thermodynamically the electrogenesis at anode potentials of 0 2 v might be more exergonic than methane production based on the real time experimental conditions in the start up phase the gibbs free energy for electrogenesis in mpa was 142 to 190 kj per mole acetate oxidation while that for methane production in mpa was 46 to 57 kj per mole acetate oxidation table s1 from a kinetic point of view acetoclastic eab might grow faster than acetoclastic ma by using acetate studies have summarized that the monod half saturation constant ks for acetate utilization is 0 5 mm to 5 mm for acetoclastic ma oude elferink et al 1998 stams et al 2019 and 1 8 mm anode potentials of 0 4v to 2 9 mm anode potential of 0 1v for eab lee et al 2009 sapireddy et al 2021 although there is no evident difference between the ks of acetoclastic eab and ma the maximum specific growth rate µmax of eab seems to be higher than that of ma when feeding acetate as the carbon source the µmax of acetoclastic eab was reported to be 3 2 day 1 at an anode potential of 0 4 v and 9 1 7 day 1 to 27 9 4 8 day 1 at an anode potential of 0 1 v lee et al 2009 sapireddy et al 2021 which was higher than that of acetoclastic ma 0 08 0 69 day 1 oude elferink et al 1998 besides the intensified acetate competition the ph decreases of anolyte caused by the active acetate respiration on the bioanode might further reduce the methane production in mpa fig 1 b several studies showed that the decrease of ph might adversely affect the activity of acetoclastic methanogens for instance sun et al 2020 indicated that as the initial ph value drops from 7 5 to 5 1 the decay rate of acetoclastic methanogens continues to increase sun et al 2020 tiwari and ghangrekar 2015 found that the methanogenic activity of microbial fuel cell mfc inoculated with acidic pretreated sludge ph 5 3 was 6 times lower than that of untreated sludge tiwari and ghangrekar 2015 therefore the ph decrease induced by electrogenesis might cause the suppression of methanogens in mpa in contrast to mpa the electrogenesis in lpa did not intensify the competition for acetate the acetate consumption rate of lpa was even lower compared to that of con and ocr si fig s4 although the current density of lpa demonstrated the electro catalytic activity of anode biofilm in phase i fig 1 a however since most of the acetate consumption in lpa was used to generate current fig 2 the proton concentration ph in lpa was higher than in con and ocr fig 1 b therefore decreased methane production in lpa might be due to the drop in ph rather than intensified competition for acetate as induced by electrogenesis collectively based on the thermodynamic and kinetic advantages the anode potential facilitates the dominance of electrogenesis in the acetate competition with methanogenesis the stimulated electrogenesis appeared to be able to suppress methanogenesis under the presence of srb either by intensifying competition for acetate or by decreasing the ph 3 3 sulfidogenesis not suppressed by the anode potential the effect of anode potentials on the srb activity under the presence of ma was investigated by analyzing the cumulative sulfide production fig 1 d and sulfate consumption fig 1 e in contrast to methane despite the presence of lower ph there was no suppression of sulfide production and sulfate reduction in lpa and mpa as shown in fig 1 d and fig 1 e both rates for sulfate consumption and sulfide production at lpa increased over time and became the highest since phase i c moreover in phase ii no anode potentials available the cumulative sulfate consumption and sulfide production in lpa and mpa were both higher than that of con and ocr these results suggested that the anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v did not suppress sulfidogenesis and might have even facilitated the activity of srb a possible reason for this could be that besides eab some of the srb species use the anode as an electron acceptor kang et al 2014 miran et al 2018 in our study 16s rrna gene analysis demonstrated the presence of desulfovibrio a well known srb genus with electroactive capacity eaktasang et al 2013 kang et al 2014 in all reactors our thermodynamic calculation based on real time experimental conditions shows that the electroactive srb using anode as an electron acceptor could obtain comparable in lpa or much more in mpa energy than using sulfate as the electron acceptor per equivalent of acetate consumption in lpa with anode and sulfate as electron acceptors the gibbs free energies of the electroactive srb are 45 to 87 kj mol and 60 to 76 kj mol respectively in mpa with anode and sulfate as electron acceptors the gibbs free energies of electroactive srb are 180 to 268 kj mol and 53 to 80 kj mol respectively see si fig s5 therefore employing anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v could enhance the activity of electroactive srb sulfide production rate of lpa and mpa in phase ii was higher than that in phase i fig 1 d for instance in phase ii the sulfide production rate of lpa and mpa was 0 48 and 0 44 mmol l anolyte d respectively while in phase i c the sulfide production rate of lpa and mpa was 0 28 and 0 17 mmol l anolyte d respectively likewise the sulfate consumption rate of lpa and mpa in phase ii increased by 17 and 172 respectively compared to that in phase i c fig 1 e we proposed three possible reasons 1 in lpa and mpa some srb species might be electroactive e g desulfovibrio spp and could use an anode as the electron acceptor when the anode potential was applied electroactive srb species transferred the electrons generated from the acetate oxidation to the anode instead of reducing sulfate when the anode potential was not available in phase ii sulfate was used by electroactive srb species as the electron acceptor 2 in mpa when the anode potential of 0 2 v was applied in phase i the electrogenesis might intensify the acetate competition with srb as previously discussed in section 3 2 electrogenesis at an anode potential of 0 2 v not only accelerated the acetate consumption fig s4 but also accounted for most of the acetate consumption fig 2 3 sulfide oxidation might occur in mpa in phase i which will be further discussed in the following paragraph in phase iii and iv the sulfide accumulation in mpa showed similar patterns sulfide accumulation first increased and then decreased fig 1 d these decreases in sulfide accumulation indicated that sulfide oxidation at the anode might occur this is in accordance with the study of ni et al 2019 which found bioelectrochemical sulfide oxidation to sulfate and elemental sulfur at anode potentials of 0 3 and 0 35 v vs ag agcl ni et al 2019 our thermodynamic calculation based on real time experimental conditions showed that the sulfide oxidation to sulfate and elemental sulfur could occur gibbs free energies of sulfide oxidation to sulfate and elemental sulfur were approximately 120 to 180 and 30 kj per mole sulfide oxidation respectively see si fig s6 overall our results show that applying anode potentials enhanced sulfide production the reason might be that some of the srb species in the reactors are electroactive as suggested by 16s rrna analysis and are capable of using the anode as an electron acceptor moreover sulfide oxidation might occur when applying an anode potential of 0 2 v 3 4 carbon balance reaction specific acetate consumption rac for sulfide production based on sulfate consumption rac for methane production and rac for current generation were used to assess the competitive relationship between srb ma and eab under different experimental conditions fig 2 in the reactors without anode potentials rac for methane production was the highest for instance in phase i the rac for methane production of con and ocr was 82 7 9 3 and 68 2 19 5 respectively while the rac for sulfide production of con and ocr was 14 7 2 and 12 3 7 8 respectively this indicated that in the reactors without anode potentials ma had an advantage over srb in the acetate competition brand et al 2014 also found that ma could outcompete srb in an environment where acetate was the sole carbon source van den brand et al 2014 from a thermodynamic point of view the sulfate reduction has a small advantage over methane production based on real time experimental conditions in phase i the gibbs free energies of sulfate reduction in con and ocr were 44 to 57 kj mol and 51 to 63 kj mol while the gibbs free energies of methane production in con and ocr were 17 to 44 kj mol and 22 to 46 kj mol moreover the acetoclastic srb appears to have only slightly better kinetic properties for acetate than acetoclastic ma stams et al 2005 due to the insignificant thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of acetoclastic srb over ma differences in relative abundance in the inoculum might have a stronger effect on the competition between srb and ma in our system this difference was actually significant according to the 16 rrna analysis of the inoculum in which the relative abundance of acetoclastic ma was above 25 while that of the acetoclastic srb was below 3 unlike con and ocr in which there was no electric circuit the highest proportion of acetate consumption was used for the current generation when the anode potentials were applied in phase i rac for current generation of lpa and mpa was 61 8 12 5 and 89 7 3 4 respectively while the rac for sulfide production of lpa and mpa was 20 12 8 and 3 5 1 6 respectively and the rac for methane production of lpa and mpa was around 0 3 the high rac for current generation of mpa could be due to both acetate oxidation and sulfide oxidation at the anode as the rac for current generation was determined by comparing the measured current with the consumed acetate see supporting information the contribution of sulfide oxidation to the rac for current generation of mpa was much lower than that of acetate oxidation in phase i even assuming that all formed sulfide was oxidized to sulfate its contribution to rac for current generation of mpa was only 3 5 1 6 these results suggested that the applied anode potentials facilitated the dominance of eab and or electroactive srb in the acetate competition this was in accordance with other bes studies that reported coulombic efficiency on the basis of substrate consumed higher than 60 by using acetate as the carbon source aelterman et al 2008 yang et al 2015 in phase ii most of the acetate consumption of lpa and mpa was used for sulfide production while most of the acetate consumption of con and ocr was used for methane production these results suggested that the applied anode potentials were more conducive to the activity of srb compared with ma this finding also hinted at the possibility of the existence of electroactive srb species e g desulfovibrio spp overall our results show that ma could outcompete srb in an environment containing acetate as the sole carbon source the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v facilitate the dominance of electrogenesis over sulfide and methane production in the acetate competition 3 5 microbial community the applied anode potential stimulated the growth of geobacter as was indicated by being the dominant genus in the anode biofilm with a relative abundance higher than 33 in lpa and mpa and with only 3 in ocr fig 3 geobacter is a commonly known electroactive bacteria that attaches well to the bioanode and capable of generating current with acetate as the electron donor bond and lovley 2003 the analysis of 16s rrna gene analysis indicated that the acetoclastic ma including methanosaeta and methanosarcina was the dominant genus in con and ocr as shown in fig 3 the relative abundance of methanosarcina in con and ocr were higher than 25 the anolyte of con contained 7 4 of methanosaeta and the relative abundance of methanosaeta on the anode biofilm of ocr was 3 5 in contrast to con and ocr the relative abundance of methanosaeta and methanosarcina in lpa and mpa were lower than 0 8 except for the bioanode at lpa which contained 5 4 of methanosaeta these results suggest that the applied anode potentials resulted in a decrease in the relative abundance of acetoclastic ma this finding was in consonance with the aforementioned reduction in methane production in the reactors with controlled anode potentials fig 1 c srb was found in all reactors and seemed to be slightly more abundant in the anode potential controlled reactors compared to ocr and con table s2 desulfovibrio was the most abundant srb genus in all reactors table s2 several studies have demonstrated that the desulfovibrio desulfuricans a predominant srb in the subsurface environment is electroactive and can transfer the electrons to the insoluble electrode eaktasang et al 2013 kang et al 2014 these results might imply that the enhanced sulfide production in reactors with applied anode potentials might be related to the presence of electroactive srb fig 1 d and fig 1 e notably the relative abundance of wolinella was higher than 59 in the anolyte of lpa and mpa fig 3 wolinella is known to grow by anaerobic nitrate respiration simon et al 2003 however no ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria with relative abundance above 2 were found in this study moreover the real time concentration of nitrate and nitrite in lpa and mpa were under detection level therefore the reason for the high relative abundance of wolinella remains unclear and requires further study 3 6 practical implications for methane and sulfide control in sewers this study for the first time investigated the effect of anode potentials on the competition among eab srb and ma the results indicated that the methane production was suppressed by applying anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2v in contrast the capacity of sulfide production was stimulated by the applied anode potentials however there was no significant increase in the actual sulfide production at the anode potential of 0 2 v due to electron acceptors competition i e anode vs sulfate and or sulfide oxidation these findings suggested that the bes system has the potential to suppress methane production in sewers according to the results of this study an anode potential of 0 42 v could be sufficient to control methane production in sewers this anode potential is also a common anode potential in mfc logan 2009 the advantage of mfc is that it does not require additional electrical circuits to control the anode potential therefore we envision introducing the mfc into sewers by adding a layer of the electrodes attached to the inner sewer pipe surfaces the part of attached electrode placed at the bottom of sewer pipes in anaerobic conditions could work as an anode where the oxidation of organic matter occurs the part of attached electrode placed at the aerobic sewage zone aerobic condition could work as cathode where oxygen reduction occurs in addition a previous study found that the short circuited mfc could further accelerate the oxidation of organic matter than traditional mfc with external resistance erable et al 2011 therefore to maximize the current generation of the attached electrode mfc in the sewer pipes the anode and cathode could connect directly to become a short circuited mfc however the effectiveness of a short circuited mfc on sewer gas control still needs to be investigated applying a more positive anode potential in this case 0 2v does suppress methanogens and could oxidize the sulfide produced but it does not suppress the sulfide production future study could look into the effect of other sewer conditions like complex organic substrate continuous outflow etc on the suppression of srb or focus on stimulating the sulfide oxidation by the bioanode alternatively sulfide induced sewer corrosion could also be mitigated by applying sewer pipes made of acid resistant materials in practical applications such as geopolymer concretes gpc grengg et al 2018 and polyvinyl chloride pvc makris et al 2020 in previous study bishop 1990 exposed pvc samples to 5 sulfuric acid for more than 1 year and the results showed a negligible effect on pipe stiffness bishop 1990 therefore combining mfc with corrosion resistant sewer pipes could be a potential option to simultaneously achieve the suppression of methane production and the mitigation of sulfide induced sewer corrosion in order to realize the use of bes systems for sewer gas suppression in sewers further research is still required from scientific and engineering perspectives from a scientific perspective the impact of the complex environment of the sewer including the complex carbon sources in sewage and the presence of sewer sediments on anode performance still requires further research from an engineering perspective the effect of different hydraulics and oxygen penetration on the anode performance also needs to be further investigated in full scale sewer pipe reactors moreover although the addition of an extra layer to sewer pipes for corrosion protection has been extensively studied roghanian and banthia 2019 wang et al 2020 the installation of mfc through adding a layer of the attached electrode into sewer pipes still requires further investigation 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of using a bioelectrochemical system bes to suppress sewer gas i e methane and hydrogen sulfide the result demonstrated for the first time the possible suppression of methanogens by applying bes in a simulated sewer condition by introducing the anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v electrogenesis had an advantage in the acetate competition with methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis electrogenesis accounted for the majority of acetate consumption resulting in a decrease in ph combining the acetate competition and the ph decrease bes suppressed methane production and the relative abundance of acetoclastic ma was also lower compared to open circuit controls therefore bioelectrochemical systems might be a promising alternative to traditional sewer gas control strategies like ph shocks or chemical dosing in contrast to methane suppression the microbiome adapted to the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v showed increased sulfide production capacity the increase in sulfide production could be avoided by positively adjusting the anode potential due to the sulfide oxidation and or the competition between electron acceptors e g anode and sulfate the future research will further investigate the suppression of sulfide production and the feasibility of using bes for sewer gas suppression in a less controlled environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15342,methane emissions from the sewer system are considered to be a non negligible source of aggravating the greenhouse effect meanwhile the sewer system has long been plagued by sulfide induced corrosion problems this study explored the possibility of using a bioelectrochemical system to intensify the competition between electroactive bacteria methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria thereby reducing the production of methane and sulfide dual chamber bioelectrochemical reactors were constructed and operated in fed batch mode with the coexistence of electroactive bacteria methanogenic archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria acetate was supplied as the sole carbon source the results indicated that electrogenesis induced by the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v vs ag agcl had advantages over methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis in consuming acetate the stimulated electrogenesis by anode potentials resulted in a decrease in ph methane production was suppressed in the reactors with anode potentials of 0 42 and 0 2 v compared to open circuit controls in contrast to methane the capacity for sulfide production was facilitated in the reactors with the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v compared to open circuit controls 16s rrna gene analysis showed that geobacter was the most abundant genus on the anode biofilm in the anode potential controlled reactor while acetoclastic methanogens dominated in open circuit controls methanosaeta and methanosarcina were the most abundant methanogens in open circuit controls collectively our study demonstrates that the use of electrodes with anode potential control can help to control methane emissions but could not yet prevent sulfide production which requires further research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioelectrochemical system anode potential sewer gas methane suppression sulfide production electrogenesis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the sewer system responsible for collecting and transporting sewage from generation locations to treatment plants plays an important role in urban sanitation systems however sewer gas is generated during sewage transportation and contains harmful components hydrogen sulfide and methane are the harmful components of most concern hereafter referred to as sewer gas accumulation of hydrogen sulfide results in severe pipe corrosion and thus decreases the expected lifetime of sewer infrastructure with a concrete corrosion rate ranging from 1 1 to 10 mm per year zuo et al 2019 owing to the corrosion issue a huge amount of money is involved in the maintenance of the sewer system for instance the usa pays 36 billion per year regarding the corrosion of drinking water and sewer system koch et al 2002 methane is a greenhouse gas and its global warming potential is more than 20 times stronger than carbon dioxide guisasola et al 2008 field measurements in australia indicated that the methane concentration in rising main sewers was approximately 5 to 30 mg l which could contribute about 12 100 of the additional greenhouse gas emission over that from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp guisasola et al 2008 sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma are the microorganisms responsible for producing sewer gas since anaerobic sewage usually contains less nitrate than sulfate sulfate is the most thermodynamically preferred electron acceptor in the sewage sulfate together with organic materials e g acetate and propionate serving as carbon and electron donor is utilized by srb to form sulfide gutierrez et al 2016 the microbiome attached to the sewer pipe surface primarily sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob can further oxidize sulfide into sulfuric acid with oxygen as the electron acceptor gutierrez et al 2016 the produced sulfuric acid can react with cement based sewer pipes producing two typical corrosion products gypsum and ettringite jiang et al 2014 ma can utilize acetate or hydrogen and co2 gas produced by fermentation to obtain energy and form methane in anaerobic sewers gutierrez et al 2016 current sulfide control technologies mainly rely on the addition of chemicals nemati et al 2001 and gutierrez et al 2014 demonstrated the suppression of srb activity by applying a metabolic inhibitor or ph shock gutierrez et al 2014 nemati et al 2001 moreover the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide oxygen and nitrate is used to remove the generated sulfide zhang et al 2008 current methane control strategies also rely on chemical dosing most of these chemicals are generally applied for suppressing sulfide production in sewers such as o2 ganigué and yuan 2014 no3 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 and naoh gutierrez et al 2009 however these current sewer gas control technologies require large amounts of chemical and capital investment 1 9 7 2 kg s removal zhang et al 2008 in addition the effectiveness of some current sewer gas control technologies can hardly maintain for a long period a field test revealed that after ph shock under various ph 10 5 12 5 and exposure time 0 5 6 0 h the activities of srb and ma gradually recovered within 1 and 4 weeks respectively gutierrez et al 2014 therefore there is a call for alternative technology to control sewer gas the essence of a robust sewer gas suppression is to continuously suppress the activity of ma and srb with minimized chemical and energy inputs bioelectrochemical system bes is a possible alternative technology to control sewer gas firstly the use of anode under close circuit condition has been proven to be capable of oxidizing sulfide ni et al 2019 sun et al 2009 secondly under close circuit condition the use of anode might also control sewer gas by intensifying the microbial competition as the anode favors the growth of electroactive bacteria of none srb group eab zhang et al 2020 found that the methane emission was controlled in a constructed wetland by incorporating with bes the suppression of methane is accompanied with a decrease in the relative abundance of ma and enrichment of eab zhang et al 2020 to date the use of anode in the suppression of methane emissions from rice paddy and wetland has been extensively studied ishii et al 2008 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 however although sulfate is also widely present in rice paddy and wetlands these studies did not involve the competition between eab and srb moreover these studies investigated the mitigation of methane emissions by employing microbial fuel cells mfc in which the anode potential was not stably controlled the influence of anode potentials on the competition among eab ma and srb in an environment where ma and srb coexist is still lacking sewer in this case in addition it is still unknown if the anode potential could suppress sulfate reduction as some srb species or sulfate reducing mixed communities are able to use anode as electron acceptor kang et al 2014 miran et al 2018 therefore this study fixed the anode potentials to investigate the effect of anode potentials on the competition among eab srb and ma for the electron donor e g acetate this study for the first time aimed to investigate the feasibility of suppressing sewer gas i e methane and sulfide by using a bes system due to the complexity of the sewer environment simplified simulated sewer conditions were required to allow us to first investigate the microbial competition between srb ma and eab i e electroactive bacteria of none srb group in more depth the key to simulating sewer conditions embedded with the bes system was to realize the coexistence of eab srb and ma therefore dual chamber bes reactors h cell were constructed and fed with synthetic wastewater which contained sulfate and acetate as the sole model carbon source a thermodynamic calculation was first carried out to identify the theoretical anode potential that favors the growth of eab over srb and ma which supports the selection of anode potentials in our experiment the current h2s and ch4 production from acetate a model compound representing organic materials in sewage under various anode potentials were evaluated a carbon balance was made to characterize the proportion of acetate consumption in different products including electrical current h2s and ch4 moreover the evolution of the anodic microbial community was determined and in this way to elucidate the effect of anode potentials on the microbial community 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and electrolytes two incubation bottles were used to prepare the two inocula used in this experiment one for eab and one for srb and ma the eab was incubated in a dual chamber bes reactor elzinga et al 2020 with a substrate of acetate at an anode potential of 0 35 v vs ag agcl for 35 days the srb and ma were obtained from the anaerobic granular sludge of the wastewater treatment plant of eerbeek and cultivated in serum bottles for 35 days 15 ml solution was taken from each of the eab and the srb ma enrichment so in total 30 ml and added to the anode chamber of each bes reactor in the anode chamber of each bes reactor the added 30 ml of inoculum was mixed with 270 ml of fresh anolyte after that the anode chamber was flushed with n2 for 30 min to obtain anaerobic conditions the anolyte contained 2 3 g l ch3coona 3h2o 1 58 g l na2so4 0 2 g l nh4cl 1 ml l vitamin and 1 ml l mineral solution wolin et al 1963 in a phosphate buffer solution 1 36 g l kh2po4 and 5 67 g l na2hpo4 50 mm the catholyte contained 50 mm phosphate buffer 2 2 bes construction four dual chamber bes reactors h cell in the lab scale were constructed elzinga et al 2020 the total volume of each chamber was 345 ml including 300 ml liquid phase and 45 ml gas phase anodic and cathodic chambers were separated by a cation exchange membrane fumasep fks fumatech bwt gmbh with a projected surface area of 8 cm2 graphite felt cgt carbon gmbh germany with a thickness of 0 38 cm was used as the material of anode and cathode the anode and cathode had a projected surface area of 15 cm2 titanium wires salomon s metalen the netherlands were passed through graphite felt and served as the current collector the anolyte and catholyte were mixed thoroughly using magnetic stirring with a fixed speed of 300 rpm gas produced in the anodic and cathodic chamber was collected separately by gas bags with a maximum capacity of 0 6 l cali 5 bondtm calibrated instruments inc usa 2 3 bes operation all four reactors were operated in fed batch mode the anode served as the working electrode the cathode served as the counter electrode and the ag agcl electrode served as the reference electrode ag agcl 3 m kcl prosenseqis qm 710x netherlands all the anode potentials present in this experiment are against the ag agcl reference electrode the anode potential was controlled by potentiostat ivium with ivium soft v2 462 eindhoven the netherlands the control strategy of each anode in different reactors is summarized in table 1 two reactors less positive anode potential lpa and more positive anode potential mpa were operated at the anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v respectively except for phase ii the backup information to select applied anode potentials is in si fig s1 in phase ii lpa and mpa were operated under open circuit condition one control reactor con was operated without electrodes another control reactor ocr was operated with the electrode while the external circuit was disconnected except for phase iii in phase iii ocr was operated at an anode potential of 0 2 v the duration of phase ii and phase iii was set to 4 days to avoid a substantial change in microbial community on the bioanode the operating temperature was maintained at 24 to 27 c 2 4 chemical analysis and calculations methane carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the gas phase were measured regularly by gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc 2010 series under the same conditions as described in hidalgo ulloa et al 2020 hach lange kit lck653 hach germany was used to analyze the sulfide in the liquid phase elzinga et al 2020 a gc agilent 7890b equipped with an hp ffap column 25 m 0 32 mm 0 50 µm was applied to measure the acetate concentration in the same way as jourdin et al 2018 helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 25 ml min during the first 3 minutes and 2 ml min until the end of the run the injection volume and temperature were 1 µl and 250 c respectively a flame ionization detector fid was applied at the temperature of 240 c sulfate concentration was quantified by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 rfic salt lake city usa equipped with autosampler as50 ionpac as 17 c 4 mm standard bore ic analytical column was applied with an eluent of potassium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 ml min the injection volume was 10 µl and the oven temperature was 30 c adrs 600 4 mm dynamically regenerated suppressor was used to increase the detection sensitivity the oxygen concentration in the anolyte was measured by fibox 4 trace and sensor spot sp pst 3 presens germany gas pressure in the reactor was measured by a gas pressure meter gmh 3151 germany the current density was determined based on the projected surface area of the anode reaction specific acetate consumptions rac and realistic gibbs free energies for sulfide production methane production and current generation were calculated as shown in supporting information 2 5 microbial community analysis to investigate the effect of anode potentials on the evolution of the microbial community the microbial communities on the anode biofilm and in the anolyte were taken for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing analysis at the end of the experiment 3 cm2 anode was taken from the reactor of ocr lpa and mpa 50 ml anolyte of each reactor was taken and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 mins genomic dna of the resulting pellets and anodes was extracted with a powersoil dna isolation kit de smit et al 2019 the extracted dna was then amplificated and sequenced as described by de smit et al 2019 the subsequent taxonomic analysis was performed by using the qiime2 diversity tool bolyen et al 2019 2 6 electrochemical analysis cyclic voltammetry cv for bio anode of lpa and mpa was conducted in current dual chamber reactor at the end of phase iv in cv analysis a dual chamber bes reactor with a new anode was built and tested as blank cv was successively carried out in three different mediums which were basal medium basal medium amended with 2 3 g l ch3coona 3h2o and basal medium amended with 2 3 g l ch3coona 3h2o and 1 58 g l na2so4 respectively the basal medium was without acetate and sulfate compared with the anolyte for each medium three consecutive cv cycles were carried out and the third cycle was shown anode potentials progressed positively from open circuit potential by using the potentiostat the scan range was 1 v to 0 2 v vs ag agcl with a scan rate of 1 mv s 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrogenesis stimulated by introducing anode potential the anode potentials facilitate electrogenesis derived from acetate oxidation in the presence of electroactive bacteria of none srb group eab methanogenic archaea ma and sulfate reducing bacteria srb as shown in fig 1 a in phase i the current density of reactors with anode potential of 0 2 v mpa and 0 42v lpa was mainly between 4 3 11 0 a m2 and 0 6 1 6 a m2 respectively the carbon balance indicated that the current generation mainly contributed by acetate oxidation rather than sulfide oxidation on the bioanode further elucidated in section 3 4 the anode potential of 0 2v is more favourable for acetate oxidation to generate current than the anode potential of 0 42v as shown in fig 1 a the current density of mpa was most of the time higher than that of lpa in addition the cv results also showed that the peak current of acetate oxidation in mpa was higher than that in lpa see si fig s3 this is consistent with the results of most studies investigating the optimal anode potential for current generation by eab finkelstein et al 2006 parot et al 2008 ter heijne et al 2008 within a certain range of anode potential the current generated by eab is positively correlated with the positive increase of anode potential the reason might be that the positively increased anode potential increased the energy yield of eab per electron transferred aelterman et al 2008 schröder 2007 however the current generated by eab does not increase continuously with increasing anode potential when the thermodynamic framework was fully exploited korth and harnisch 2019 ter heijne et al 2008 korth and harnisch 2019 indicated that the anode potential regulated the energy yield of eab by affecting the kinetics of extracellular electron transfer and intracellular nad nadh ratio when a sufficiently high nad nadh ratio was reached to fully exploit the thermodynamic framework a further positive increase of the anode potential could not increase the energy yield of eab korth and harnisch 2019 electrogenesis facilitated by anode potentials results in differences in the ph range of lpa and mpa from con and ocr fig 1 b the initial ph of each reactor was around 7 3 during the experiment including both the start up and the experimental phases the ph range of the anolyte was 6 49 7 55 in lpa and 4 72 7 62 in mpa si fig s2 in contrast the ph in con and ocr was usually in a relatively high range mainly between 7 25 and 7 96 si fig s2 the ph decreases in lpa and mpa were most likely due to the dominance of electrogenesis with concurring production of protons while the eab metabolizes acetate table 2 eq3 unlike lpa and mpa the main biological processes in con and ocr were methane and sulfide production fig 2 according to reaction equations table 2 eq1 and eq2 and previous studies fukuzaki et al 1990 kaksonen et al 2004 the methane and sulfide production by consuming acetate could increase the ph therefore the difference in ph range suggested that in the presence of anode potentials electrogenesis was more competitive than methane and sulfide production at the same initial ph 3 2 methanogenesis suppressed due to the anode potential and the subsequent ph decrease in the presence of eab srb and ma methane production rate and accumulation were lower in the reactors with the controlled anode potential as shown in fig 1 c the methane accumulation in lpa and mpa was lower than that in con and ocr for instance in phase i c the methane accumulation in lpa and mpa was 0 03 and 0 51 mmol l anolyte respectively while the methane accumulation in con and ocr was 29 04 and 17 67 mmol l anolyte respectively these results indicate that the ma activity has been suppressed when applying the anode potential of 0 42 lpa and 0 2 v mpa this is consistent with a previous study investigating the competitive relationship between eab and ma without the presence of sulfate and srb which found that closed circuit condition in bioelectrochemical systems can reduce methane production when using cellulose as the carbon source ishii et al 2008 the stimulation of electrogenesis by anode potentials intensified acetate competition which might be one of the reasons for methane suppression in mpa the intensified acetate competition was reflected in accelerated acetate consumption dominated by electrogenesis in mpa the acetate consumption rate in phase i was higher than that of the other three reactors see si fig s4 and most of the acetate consumption was used to generate current fig 2 similarly zhao et al 2019 also found that by applying an anode potential of 20 mv vs ag agcl methane was suppressed accompanied by accelerated acetate consumption under the ph controlled condition at ph around 7 zhao et al 2019 the dominance of electrogenesis in acetate competition with methanogenesis might be due to the advantages of thermodynamics and kinetics thermodynamically the electrogenesis at anode potentials of 0 2 v might be more exergonic than methane production based on the real time experimental conditions in the start up phase the gibbs free energy for electrogenesis in mpa was 142 to 190 kj per mole acetate oxidation while that for methane production in mpa was 46 to 57 kj per mole acetate oxidation table s1 from a kinetic point of view acetoclastic eab might grow faster than acetoclastic ma by using acetate studies have summarized that the monod half saturation constant ks for acetate utilization is 0 5 mm to 5 mm for acetoclastic ma oude elferink et al 1998 stams et al 2019 and 1 8 mm anode potentials of 0 4v to 2 9 mm anode potential of 0 1v for eab lee et al 2009 sapireddy et al 2021 although there is no evident difference between the ks of acetoclastic eab and ma the maximum specific growth rate µmax of eab seems to be higher than that of ma when feeding acetate as the carbon source the µmax of acetoclastic eab was reported to be 3 2 day 1 at an anode potential of 0 4 v and 9 1 7 day 1 to 27 9 4 8 day 1 at an anode potential of 0 1 v lee et al 2009 sapireddy et al 2021 which was higher than that of acetoclastic ma 0 08 0 69 day 1 oude elferink et al 1998 besides the intensified acetate competition the ph decreases of anolyte caused by the active acetate respiration on the bioanode might further reduce the methane production in mpa fig 1 b several studies showed that the decrease of ph might adversely affect the activity of acetoclastic methanogens for instance sun et al 2020 indicated that as the initial ph value drops from 7 5 to 5 1 the decay rate of acetoclastic methanogens continues to increase sun et al 2020 tiwari and ghangrekar 2015 found that the methanogenic activity of microbial fuel cell mfc inoculated with acidic pretreated sludge ph 5 3 was 6 times lower than that of untreated sludge tiwari and ghangrekar 2015 therefore the ph decrease induced by electrogenesis might cause the suppression of methanogens in mpa in contrast to mpa the electrogenesis in lpa did not intensify the competition for acetate the acetate consumption rate of lpa was even lower compared to that of con and ocr si fig s4 although the current density of lpa demonstrated the electro catalytic activity of anode biofilm in phase i fig 1 a however since most of the acetate consumption in lpa was used to generate current fig 2 the proton concentration ph in lpa was higher than in con and ocr fig 1 b therefore decreased methane production in lpa might be due to the drop in ph rather than intensified competition for acetate as induced by electrogenesis collectively based on the thermodynamic and kinetic advantages the anode potential facilitates the dominance of electrogenesis in the acetate competition with methanogenesis the stimulated electrogenesis appeared to be able to suppress methanogenesis under the presence of srb either by intensifying competition for acetate or by decreasing the ph 3 3 sulfidogenesis not suppressed by the anode potential the effect of anode potentials on the srb activity under the presence of ma was investigated by analyzing the cumulative sulfide production fig 1 d and sulfate consumption fig 1 e in contrast to methane despite the presence of lower ph there was no suppression of sulfide production and sulfate reduction in lpa and mpa as shown in fig 1 d and fig 1 e both rates for sulfate consumption and sulfide production at lpa increased over time and became the highest since phase i c moreover in phase ii no anode potentials available the cumulative sulfate consumption and sulfide production in lpa and mpa were both higher than that of con and ocr these results suggested that the anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v did not suppress sulfidogenesis and might have even facilitated the activity of srb a possible reason for this could be that besides eab some of the srb species use the anode as an electron acceptor kang et al 2014 miran et al 2018 in our study 16s rrna gene analysis demonstrated the presence of desulfovibrio a well known srb genus with electroactive capacity eaktasang et al 2013 kang et al 2014 in all reactors our thermodynamic calculation based on real time experimental conditions shows that the electroactive srb using anode as an electron acceptor could obtain comparable in lpa or much more in mpa energy than using sulfate as the electron acceptor per equivalent of acetate consumption in lpa with anode and sulfate as electron acceptors the gibbs free energies of the electroactive srb are 45 to 87 kj mol and 60 to 76 kj mol respectively in mpa with anode and sulfate as electron acceptors the gibbs free energies of electroactive srb are 180 to 268 kj mol and 53 to 80 kj mol respectively see si fig s5 therefore employing anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v could enhance the activity of electroactive srb sulfide production rate of lpa and mpa in phase ii was higher than that in phase i fig 1 d for instance in phase ii the sulfide production rate of lpa and mpa was 0 48 and 0 44 mmol l anolyte d respectively while in phase i c the sulfide production rate of lpa and mpa was 0 28 and 0 17 mmol l anolyte d respectively likewise the sulfate consumption rate of lpa and mpa in phase ii increased by 17 and 172 respectively compared to that in phase i c fig 1 e we proposed three possible reasons 1 in lpa and mpa some srb species might be electroactive e g desulfovibrio spp and could use an anode as the electron acceptor when the anode potential was applied electroactive srb species transferred the electrons generated from the acetate oxidation to the anode instead of reducing sulfate when the anode potential was not available in phase ii sulfate was used by electroactive srb species as the electron acceptor 2 in mpa when the anode potential of 0 2 v was applied in phase i the electrogenesis might intensify the acetate competition with srb as previously discussed in section 3 2 electrogenesis at an anode potential of 0 2 v not only accelerated the acetate consumption fig s4 but also accounted for most of the acetate consumption fig 2 3 sulfide oxidation might occur in mpa in phase i which will be further discussed in the following paragraph in phase iii and iv the sulfide accumulation in mpa showed similar patterns sulfide accumulation first increased and then decreased fig 1 d these decreases in sulfide accumulation indicated that sulfide oxidation at the anode might occur this is in accordance with the study of ni et al 2019 which found bioelectrochemical sulfide oxidation to sulfate and elemental sulfur at anode potentials of 0 3 and 0 35 v vs ag agcl ni et al 2019 our thermodynamic calculation based on real time experimental conditions showed that the sulfide oxidation to sulfate and elemental sulfur could occur gibbs free energies of sulfide oxidation to sulfate and elemental sulfur were approximately 120 to 180 and 30 kj per mole sulfide oxidation respectively see si fig s6 overall our results show that applying anode potentials enhanced sulfide production the reason might be that some of the srb species in the reactors are electroactive as suggested by 16s rrna analysis and are capable of using the anode as an electron acceptor moreover sulfide oxidation might occur when applying an anode potential of 0 2 v 3 4 carbon balance reaction specific acetate consumption rac for sulfide production based on sulfate consumption rac for methane production and rac for current generation were used to assess the competitive relationship between srb ma and eab under different experimental conditions fig 2 in the reactors without anode potentials rac for methane production was the highest for instance in phase i the rac for methane production of con and ocr was 82 7 9 3 and 68 2 19 5 respectively while the rac for sulfide production of con and ocr was 14 7 2 and 12 3 7 8 respectively this indicated that in the reactors without anode potentials ma had an advantage over srb in the acetate competition brand et al 2014 also found that ma could outcompete srb in an environment where acetate was the sole carbon source van den brand et al 2014 from a thermodynamic point of view the sulfate reduction has a small advantage over methane production based on real time experimental conditions in phase i the gibbs free energies of sulfate reduction in con and ocr were 44 to 57 kj mol and 51 to 63 kj mol while the gibbs free energies of methane production in con and ocr were 17 to 44 kj mol and 22 to 46 kj mol moreover the acetoclastic srb appears to have only slightly better kinetic properties for acetate than acetoclastic ma stams et al 2005 due to the insignificant thermodynamic and kinetic advantages of acetoclastic srb over ma differences in relative abundance in the inoculum might have a stronger effect on the competition between srb and ma in our system this difference was actually significant according to the 16 rrna analysis of the inoculum in which the relative abundance of acetoclastic ma was above 25 while that of the acetoclastic srb was below 3 unlike con and ocr in which there was no electric circuit the highest proportion of acetate consumption was used for the current generation when the anode potentials were applied in phase i rac for current generation of lpa and mpa was 61 8 12 5 and 89 7 3 4 respectively while the rac for sulfide production of lpa and mpa was 20 12 8 and 3 5 1 6 respectively and the rac for methane production of lpa and mpa was around 0 3 the high rac for current generation of mpa could be due to both acetate oxidation and sulfide oxidation at the anode as the rac for current generation was determined by comparing the measured current with the consumed acetate see supporting information the contribution of sulfide oxidation to the rac for current generation of mpa was much lower than that of acetate oxidation in phase i even assuming that all formed sulfide was oxidized to sulfate its contribution to rac for current generation of mpa was only 3 5 1 6 these results suggested that the applied anode potentials facilitated the dominance of eab and or electroactive srb in the acetate competition this was in accordance with other bes studies that reported coulombic efficiency on the basis of substrate consumed higher than 60 by using acetate as the carbon source aelterman et al 2008 yang et al 2015 in phase ii most of the acetate consumption of lpa and mpa was used for sulfide production while most of the acetate consumption of con and ocr was used for methane production these results suggested that the applied anode potentials were more conducive to the activity of srb compared with ma this finding also hinted at the possibility of the existence of electroactive srb species e g desulfovibrio spp overall our results show that ma could outcompete srb in an environment containing acetate as the sole carbon source the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v facilitate the dominance of electrogenesis over sulfide and methane production in the acetate competition 3 5 microbial community the applied anode potential stimulated the growth of geobacter as was indicated by being the dominant genus in the anode biofilm with a relative abundance higher than 33 in lpa and mpa and with only 3 in ocr fig 3 geobacter is a commonly known electroactive bacteria that attaches well to the bioanode and capable of generating current with acetate as the electron donor bond and lovley 2003 the analysis of 16s rrna gene analysis indicated that the acetoclastic ma including methanosaeta and methanosarcina was the dominant genus in con and ocr as shown in fig 3 the relative abundance of methanosarcina in con and ocr were higher than 25 the anolyte of con contained 7 4 of methanosaeta and the relative abundance of methanosaeta on the anode biofilm of ocr was 3 5 in contrast to con and ocr the relative abundance of methanosaeta and methanosarcina in lpa and mpa were lower than 0 8 except for the bioanode at lpa which contained 5 4 of methanosaeta these results suggest that the applied anode potentials resulted in a decrease in the relative abundance of acetoclastic ma this finding was in consonance with the aforementioned reduction in methane production in the reactors with controlled anode potentials fig 1 c srb was found in all reactors and seemed to be slightly more abundant in the anode potential controlled reactors compared to ocr and con table s2 desulfovibrio was the most abundant srb genus in all reactors table s2 several studies have demonstrated that the desulfovibrio desulfuricans a predominant srb in the subsurface environment is electroactive and can transfer the electrons to the insoluble electrode eaktasang et al 2013 kang et al 2014 these results might imply that the enhanced sulfide production in reactors with applied anode potentials might be related to the presence of electroactive srb fig 1 d and fig 1 e notably the relative abundance of wolinella was higher than 59 in the anolyte of lpa and mpa fig 3 wolinella is known to grow by anaerobic nitrate respiration simon et al 2003 however no ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria with relative abundance above 2 were found in this study moreover the real time concentration of nitrate and nitrite in lpa and mpa were under detection level therefore the reason for the high relative abundance of wolinella remains unclear and requires further study 3 6 practical implications for methane and sulfide control in sewers this study for the first time investigated the effect of anode potentials on the competition among eab srb and ma the results indicated that the methane production was suppressed by applying anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2v in contrast the capacity of sulfide production was stimulated by the applied anode potentials however there was no significant increase in the actual sulfide production at the anode potential of 0 2 v due to electron acceptors competition i e anode vs sulfate and or sulfide oxidation these findings suggested that the bes system has the potential to suppress methane production in sewers according to the results of this study an anode potential of 0 42 v could be sufficient to control methane production in sewers this anode potential is also a common anode potential in mfc logan 2009 the advantage of mfc is that it does not require additional electrical circuits to control the anode potential therefore we envision introducing the mfc into sewers by adding a layer of the electrodes attached to the inner sewer pipe surfaces the part of attached electrode placed at the bottom of sewer pipes in anaerobic conditions could work as an anode where the oxidation of organic matter occurs the part of attached electrode placed at the aerobic sewage zone aerobic condition could work as cathode where oxygen reduction occurs in addition a previous study found that the short circuited mfc could further accelerate the oxidation of organic matter than traditional mfc with external resistance erable et al 2011 therefore to maximize the current generation of the attached electrode mfc in the sewer pipes the anode and cathode could connect directly to become a short circuited mfc however the effectiveness of a short circuited mfc on sewer gas control still needs to be investigated applying a more positive anode potential in this case 0 2v does suppress methanogens and could oxidize the sulfide produced but it does not suppress the sulfide production future study could look into the effect of other sewer conditions like complex organic substrate continuous outflow etc on the suppression of srb or focus on stimulating the sulfide oxidation by the bioanode alternatively sulfide induced sewer corrosion could also be mitigated by applying sewer pipes made of acid resistant materials in practical applications such as geopolymer concretes gpc grengg et al 2018 and polyvinyl chloride pvc makris et al 2020 in previous study bishop 1990 exposed pvc samples to 5 sulfuric acid for more than 1 year and the results showed a negligible effect on pipe stiffness bishop 1990 therefore combining mfc with corrosion resistant sewer pipes could be a potential option to simultaneously achieve the suppression of methane production and the mitigation of sulfide induced sewer corrosion in order to realize the use of bes systems for sewer gas suppression in sewers further research is still required from scientific and engineering perspectives from a scientific perspective the impact of the complex environment of the sewer including the complex carbon sources in sewage and the presence of sewer sediments on anode performance still requires further research from an engineering perspective the effect of different hydraulics and oxygen penetration on the anode performance also needs to be further investigated in full scale sewer pipe reactors moreover although the addition of an extra layer to sewer pipes for corrosion protection has been extensively studied roghanian and banthia 2019 wang et al 2020 the installation of mfc through adding a layer of the attached electrode into sewer pipes still requires further investigation 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of using a bioelectrochemical system bes to suppress sewer gas i e methane and hydrogen sulfide the result demonstrated for the first time the possible suppression of methanogens by applying bes in a simulated sewer condition by introducing the anode potential of 0 42 v and 0 2 v electrogenesis had an advantage in the acetate competition with methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis electrogenesis accounted for the majority of acetate consumption resulting in a decrease in ph combining the acetate competition and the ph decrease bes suppressed methane production and the relative abundance of acetoclastic ma was also lower compared to open circuit controls therefore bioelectrochemical systems might be a promising alternative to traditional sewer gas control strategies like ph shocks or chemical dosing in contrast to methane suppression the microbiome adapted to the anode potentials of 0 42 v and 0 2 v showed increased sulfide production capacity the increase in sulfide production could be avoided by positively adjusting the anode potential due to the sulfide oxidation and or the competition between electron acceptors e g anode and sulfate the future research will further investigate the suppression of sulfide production and the feasibility of using bes for sewer gas suppression in a less controlled environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15343,optimal pressure management is a standard strategy for water loss minimization in water distribution systems wds a pragmatic solution to regulating water pressures and leakage is introducing pressure reducing valves prvs this paper presents a valve positioning algorithm for optimally deciding the positions and setpoints of prvs in a wds the algorithm derives the hydraulic solution of a wds as a directed graph established on the flow directions using epanet 2 2 and develops the downstream network supplied by water flowing out of every pipe in the network by applying the depth first search method the algorithm later recognizes the pipes leading to the most extended downstream networks with pressures above the minimum required service pressure and prioritizes them as the ideal locations for prv placement in this way the proposed algorithm overcomes the limitations of the state of the art in realistically conceptualizing the leakage reduction for optimally positioning the prvs in wds four studies with varying complexities were selected to demonstrate the algorithm s applicability for deriving pressure management solutions the solution time for prv positioning was in seconds for the first three networks and several minutes for the extensive fourth case study the results corroborate the algorithm s ability to pinpoint the critical nodes with the most increased potential for downstream pressure control and for maintaining the pressure at the least required service pressure level through optimally allocating the prvs with acceptable setpoint values within the pipe network graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pressure reducing valve prv valve positioning pressure management leakage reduction water distribution system optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water losses via leakages in water distribution systems wds are directly attributable to the challenging management of its components extreme water losses can cause service disruption and energy losses and may proliferate the probability of contaminant intrusion in pipes due to low negative pressure conditions colombo and karney 2005 puust et al 2010 sadiq et al 2006 therefore minimizing background leakages and pipe bursts is critical for improving the reliability competence and overall performance of wds several strategies leak detection annual rehabilitation and pressure management have been proposed in this regard el zahab and zayed 2019 gupta and kulat 2018 lambert 2002 out of them optimal pressure management is widely recognized as the classic and most effective water loss minimization strategy for wds awwa american water works association 2003 lambert 2003 vicente et al 2016 apart from leakage reduction pressure management also has benefits such as prolonging the life of wds components by decreasing new pipe breaks and bursts and saving water through the lessening of consumption lambert and fantozzi 2010 water pressures in wds are dynamic and it varies diurnally owing to the fluctuations in the water demands at the consumer ends generally the water demands are at their peak and the water pressures are typically at their lowest levels during the mid day due to the increased head losses inside pipes alternatively during minimum water demands typically during nighttime the water pressures would be at their highest levels the excessive pressures may be controlled by operating the pumps however the pumps are generally positioned at the headworks and thus scheduling their operations only provides an option for managing the overall pressure at definite distribution network zones comparable to pump scheduling adapting the operations of the water tank would also induce only insignificant effects on the downstream pressure reduction because of the narrow bandwidth between the high and low operational tank water levels however introducing pressure reducing valves prvs at specific network locations reduces the water pressures supplied to downstream subareas suffering from excess pressures and effectively delivers better pressure management countless studies in the literature signify the importance of placing prvs in wds for pressure management ali 2015 araujo et al 2006 covelli et al 2016 creaco and pezzinga 2015 de paola et al 2017 gupta et al 2018 jowitt and xu 1990 liberatore and sechi 2009 magini et al 2007 nicolini and zovatto 2009 pecci et al 2019 price and ostfeld 2022 reis et al 1997 vairavamoorthy and lumbers 1998 placing a prv in wds aims to make the water pressure at any network location customarily critical demand node closer to the least required service pressure once positioned prvs may be controlled locally with a hydraulic actuator or remotely by employing a communication network between the valve and a controller in both cases the setpoints need to be chosen to constantly maintain definite water pressures at critical network locations over the entire day in a previous work price and ostfeld 2022 two authors of this paper have demonstrated the development and application of an algorithm dealing with locating the critical nodes and determining the optimal positions of prvs in wds in their methodology price and ostfeld 2022 employed the epanet 2 2 rossman et al 2020 solution of a hydraulic model as a directed graph established on the flow directions to determine the most effective pipes and the optimal locations of locally controlled prvs based on two criteria the number of downstream nodes and the pressure reduction potential price and ostfeld 2022 selected the criterion of the number of downstream nodes in their algorithm because the pressures in epanet 2 2 are measured at the nodes and not along the pipes however such a simplification made the leakage estimations using this algorithm partly unrealistic because in real world networks the leakage losses are determined principally by the number of pipe joints controlled entirely by the pipe lengths and not by the number of consumer locations in this paper we attempt to overcome this drawback of the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm a new algorithm that considers the downstream pipe length and conceptualizes the leakage reduction in a improved way is considered for optimally positioning the prvs in wds the rest of the paper is organized as follows a brief literature review an explanation of the methodology a demonstration of the algorithm in four case studies and conclusions 2 literature review numerous mathematical modeling studies focusing on applying a multitude of computing techniques and algorithms for deciding the positions and settings of prvs for pressure management and subsequent leakage reduction can be found in the literature one of the pioneering works in this area was reported by jowitt and xu 1990 in this paper jowitt and xu 1990 determined the settings of the prvs already placed at predefined locations by solving a linear program model that minimizes leakage the researchers employed the linear theory method and linearized the non linear equations describing the head flow relationships in the water distribution network later vairavamoorthy and lumbers 1998 improved the linear program model of jowitt and xu 1990 and made prv setting optimization model more robust and efficient by using non linear programming these researchers solved the non linear equations describing the head flow relationships in the water distribution network by adopting the sequential quadratic programming method dissimilar to the two studies mentioned above the attempt by savić and walters 1995 for optimally deciding the settings of isolating valves for pressure management in water distribution networks involved the application of the principles of evolutionary design and genetic algorithms ga this was also one of the first applications of the evolution program in wds engineering however it may be noted that these three above studies focused only on optimizing the setting of prvs jowitt and xu 1990 vairavamoorthy and lumbers 1998 and isolation valves savić and walters 1995 and ignored emphasizing on the optimum locations for their placement in a water distribution network reis et al 1997 became the pioneers in simultaneously handling the problems of optimal location and regulation of prvs these researchers used the ga to propose the prv locations within the network and the linear programming embedded in the ga to determine the optimal prv settings however reis et al 1997 limited their analysis only to the single period simulation of water distribution networks this limitation was overcome later by araujo et al 2006 by presenting a ga based optimization model over an extended period their optimization approach followed a two phase methodology with the first phase dealing with choosing the number of locations of prvs and the second dealing with their setting in every time step dissimilar to this two phase methodology of araujo et al 2006 a multi objective approach for determining the positions and settings of prvs by minimizing the leakage volume and the number of prvs in a water distribution network was proposed by magini et al 2007 these researchers considered leakages a pressure driven demand through the emitter function of epanet 2 0 rossman 2000 they adopted the multi objective ga with a pareto based approach to derive optimal solutions later liberatore and sechi 2009 proposed a two phase optimization approach that involved a weighted multi objective function considering the cost of inserting valves and the penalty when the pressure exceeds the maximum allowable value the first phase of this approach identifies the candidate sets pipes for the location of prvs based on hydraulic analysis the second phase employs the meta heuristic scatter search routines to obtain the optimal positions and setpoints of the prvs at the same time nicolini and zovatto 2009 presented an entirely different optimization approach for the same purposes as liberatore and sechi 2009 the researchers applied multi objective non dominated sorting ga nsga to minimize the two mutually independent and conflicting objectives total number of installed prvs and total leakage volume far along creaco and pezzinga 2015 proposed an optimization model that employs a multi objective function with ga to determine prv locations and identify isolation valves to be closed a linear programming based model was employed for determining the optimal prv settings at the same time as creaco and pezzinga 2015 ali 2015 presented a knowledge based optimization model for minimizing leakage in distribution networks through optimizing the positions and setpoints of prvs this approach incorporated the physical knowledge of the wds into the optimization model solved using ga to improve the efficiency in arriving at the optimal solutions the applicability of ga in deciding the positions and settings of a predefined number of prvs was further explored in several recent studies covelli et al 2016 gupta et al 2018 covelli et al 2016 proposed a procedure that coupled a ga based optimization model with hydraulic modeling of pressure dependent leakages through pipes by showing the proposed model applicability on a small network example covelli et al 2016 reported an approximate 26 reduction in the background water losses dissimilar to covelli et al 2016 a hybrid pressure reduction model for leakage reduction was proposed by gupta et al 2018 in which both structural and non structural optimizing tank storage level management options were considered the structural options considered were deciding the positions and settings of prvs and nsga ii was applied to make optimal selections besides those mentioned above several other computing techniques were also employed for prvs position and setpoint optimization one example is the study by de paola et al 2017 this study demonstrated the applicability and computational efficiency of the harmony search method to optimize the locations and settings of a predefined number of prvs another standalone study in this research area was reported by pecci et al 2019 in attempt to optimally decide prvs position in distribution networks a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming model was formulated and solved using the branch and bound method by relaxing the nonconvex hydraulic constraints price and ostfeld 2022 recently presented a prv positioning algorithm for pressure management and subsequent leakage control by combining the graph theory with epanet 2 2 rossman et al 2020 this algorithm identifies the pipe with the maximum potential for downstream pressure reduction after each algorithm run a prv assigned with the adequate setting value determined by model equations is added to the hydraulic model each further run of the algorithm recommends the position and setting of the next prv to be installed the number of algorithm runs is controlled by the number of prvs to be installed in the network price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm was found computationally fast compared to ga and the outcomes were on par with that obtained using ga however they used the number of the downstream nodes and their pressure from a particular pipe location to quantize the prv effect on the downstream network assuming the leakage occurs at pipe junctions this assumption may be valid for a small network with many interconnecting junctions relative to the pipe length such as house plumbing or industrial plumbing though for real world wds most leaks are from pipe breaks and bursts along the pipes thus the pipe length becomes a better option to quantify the effect of a prv besides counting nodes in a hydraulic model might lead to misinterpretation of the natural layout of the network a hydraulic model can connect a single node to any number of pipes nevertheless only three pipes are naturally connected at a single node in real world wds therefore two t junctions in the actual case are typically represented as a four pipe junction in a hydraulic model fig 1 due to this dissimilarity routinely ignored in hydraulic modeling of wds which price and ostfeld 2022 also overlooked their valve positioning algorithm has restrictions in offering pressure management solutions applicable on field for minimizing the water losses via leakages in wds the present paper is inspired by the limitations of the existing prvs positioning algorithms specifically from the limitations of the valve positioning algorithm of price and ostfeld 2022 proposed by two authors of the present work to the author s understanding the use of pipe length gives a better conceptual interpretation of the leakages in a water distribution network this could expand the previously used method of counting nodes in the hydraulic model and offer pragmatic field applicable solutions for pressure management in wds and minimizing leakage losses 3 valve positioning algorithm the proposed algorithm fig 2 presumes that prvs should be placed in wds at locations with the highest potential for pressure reduction on the downstream subareas water leakage mainly occurs along pipes and predominantly at pipe joints thus pipes leading to an extended downstream network with pressures above the minimum required service pressure are considered ideal sites for prv placement the exact effect of a prv in a looped network is challenging to anticipate without using a brute force approach of running the hydraulic model with a prv installed on each of the network pipes testing all pressure settings the presented algorithm assumes a direct connection between the effects of locating a prv at a specific pipe location and the amount of water supplied to downstream nodes from that location in a looped network flow direction change occurs after a prv is installed utilizing flow routes bypassing the prv but with increased head loss and this lowers downstream pressures the proposed valve positioning algorithm employs a hydraulic model solved using epanet 2 2 to determine the flow rates and pressures throughout the system for every examined hydraulic time step the downstream network supplied by water flowing out of every pipe in the network is established using the depth first search algorithm utilizing the flow directions as a directed graph three values are explicitly defined for every pipe for each time step a the total length of downstream pipes b the critical downstream node with the minimum pressure and its value and c the relative count of the number of downstream nodes the critical downstream node is the downstream node from a pipe with minimal pressure such a node is determined for each pipe in the network for each pipe employing the flow directions as a directed graph the depth first search algorithm demarcates the path originating from the terminate node of the pipe leading to all the connected downstream nodes once all the connected downstream nodes are defined for every pipe the downstream node with the minimum pressure is determined the relative downstream node count for a pipe is estimated by summing the fraction of water flow entering each downstream node along the branches originating from the pipe for example let us assume that a certain pipe supplies a chain of three downstream nodes following each other in quick succession if the network is branched and all the downstream nodes are supplied only from the examined pipe fig 3 a meaning that 100 of the water supplied to each of the nodes originates from the upstream pipe the relative node count will be 3 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 or 300 the effect of the examined pipe becomes weak if the network is looped and half of the flow to each of the three nodes is coming from an alternate supply source fig 3b in such a case the relative supply from the examined pipe to the first second and third node would be 50 25 and 12 5 respectively as the effect from the origin pipe is diluted the total relative node count would then become 0 875 0 50 0 25 0 125 or 87 5 thus it is definite that in the branched configuration the pipe strongly affects the three nodes however under the looped configuration the effect is weakened the mathematical equations applied in the algorithm for estimating the relative node count are defined as eqs 1 3 1 l s u m e t i j e e l e e e t t 2 p m i n i m u m e t min j e e p j t e e t t 3 n r e l a t i v e e t i j e e q i j t q j t n r e l a t

e l a t i v e e t relative node count downstream of pipe e n r e l a t i v e j t relative node count upstream of node j refer to fig 3 and the explanation provided above q i j t flow entering node j

time step t l e length of pipe e and l s u m e t sum of pipe lengths downstream of pipe e at time step t e e t is found for each time step t using the depth first search algorithm starting at the end node j of pipe e using the flow directions in the pipes at time step t as a directed graph a node may be a member of several e e t sets for all pipes e located upstream of the node under consideration the allowable pressure reduction is specified as the difference between the pressure at the critical demand node and the minimum required service pressure once the allowable pressure reduction is estimated the pressure reduction potential for a pipe for every time step is computed by multiplying the length of the downstream pipes with the allowable pressure reduction and the relative node count the mathematical expressions for calculating the allowable pressure reduction and pressure reduction potential are defined as eqs 4 and 5 4 p a l l o w a b l e e t p m i n i m u m e t p s e r v i c e e p t t 5 p p o t e n t i a l e t p a l l o w a b l e e t l s u m e t n r e l a t i v e e t e p t t where p a l l o w a b l e e t allowable pressure reduction downstream from pipe e at time step t with the unit for example kpa p s e r v i c e minimum service pressure with the unit for example kpa and p p o t e n t i a l e t pressure reduction potential downstream from pipe e at time step t with the unit kpa m the proposed algorithm assumes the same pipe condition for all the pipes in the network also the leakage distribution is directly and solely associated with the pressure distribution suppose an examined system consists of old pipes vulnerable to water losses or it is known to cover known areas with a higher leakage potential the pipes may be allocated a correction factor to prioritize them the pressure reduction score for every pipe is calculated as the sum of the pressure reduction potentials for each time step eq 6 6 s e t p p o t e n t i a l e t e p t t where s e pressure reduction score for pipe e the pipe with the highest pressure reduction score s is selected as the recommended location for prv placement and is marked with an index e once the prv placement location is finalized its setpoint value for each time step dynamic in nature is assessed as the difference between the prevailing pressure at the end of the pipe prior to the prv installation and the acceptable downstream pressure reduction eq 7 7 p r v s e t p o i n t e t p e t p a l l o w a b l e e t t t where e index of pipe for which the prv is to be installed and p e t pressure at the end node of pipe e at time step t after adding the prv to the hydraulic model and inputting the necessary setpoint values the algorithm is re run to determine the optimal location for placing the next prv in the network a simplified example of the proposed valve positioning algorithm is demonstrated using fig 4 the given example fig 4a signifies a section of a looped wds the demand nodes d e f and g are supplied from pipes ad bd and ce respectively for a specific time step t it is assumed that each pipe is 1 m long and the value of p s e r v i c e is 200 kpa fig 4b exhibits the effect of prv placement in pipe bd pipe bd contributes to flow into node d the relative effect of pipe bd on node d can be estimated as 15 m3h 18 m3 h 100 83 3 consequently the relative supply from pipe bd into node e becomes 59 5 i e 5 m3h 7 m3 h 83 3 similarly the relative supply from pipe bd into node f becomes 83 3 3 m3h 3 m3 h 83 3 and the relative supply from pipe bd into node g becomes 71 4 2 m3h 4 m3 h 83 3 2 m3h 4 m3 h 59 5 thus the total effect of pipe bd is calculated as 83 3 83 3 71 4 59 5 267 5 in other words it may be said that pipe bd affects 2 675 downstream nodes the critical node is identified as node f with a pressure value of 240 kpa the following values are calculated for the parameters l s u m b d t 4 m p m i n i m u m b d t 240 kpa n r e l a t i v e b d t 2 675 p a l l o w a b l e b d t 240 200 kpa 40 kpa p p o t e n t i a l b d t 40 kpa 4 m 2 675 428 kpa m and s b d 428 kpa m fig 4c demonstrates the effect of placing a prv in pipe ce the relative supply from pipe ce into node e is 28 5 2 m3h 7 m3 h 100 the relative supply from pipe ce into node g is 14 3 2 m3h 4 m3 h 28 5 therefore the total effect of pipe ce is 42 8 in other words pipe ce affects 0 428 downstream nodes the critical node is identified as node g with a pressure value of 340 kpa the following values of the parameters are determined l s u m c e t 2 m p m i n i m u m c e t 340 kpa n r e l a t i v e c e t 0 428 p a l l o w a b l e c e t 340 200 kpa 140 kpa p p o t e n t i a l c e t 140 kpa 2 m 0 428 120 kpa m and s c e 120 kpa m as seen in fig 4 pipes bd and ce received 428 kpa m and 120 kpa m pressure reduction scores respectively therefore pipe bd with a higher relative score between these examined pipes becomes a preferable location for prv placement however from the perspective of pressure reduction prv placed in pipe ce can be found capable of allowing a pressure reduction of 140 kpa compared to just 40 kpa reduction by the prv placed in pipe bd however prv placed in pipe bd can affect more pipes than pipe ce hence it receives a comparatively higher pressure reduction score for the prv placed in pipe bd the prv set point at t can be estimated as p r v s e t p o i n t b d t p d t p a l l o w a b l e b d t 540 40 kpa 500 kpa 4 case studies the goal of the proposed algorithm is to optimally place an increasing number of prvs in the network to reduce the water pressures along the long pipe sections four case studies with increasing complexity are selected to demonstrate the algorithm the first case study selected is the synthetice network first introduced by price and ostfeld 2022 consisting of 25 consumer nodes supplied by a single reservoir node fig 5 a the synthetice network has a unique elevation profile such that the nodal elevation slopes away from the reservoir in the direction of a high pressure area in the network s bottom left corner each node has one of two demand patterns each pattern with 168 timesteps the minimum service pressure is 25 m above ground level the second case study is a network used by jowitt and xu 1990 based on sterling and bargiela 1984 the schematic of the network is illustrated in fig 6 this network is a well known benchmark for leakage reduction using prv positioning it has 25 nodes 37 pipes and three reservoirs with four 24 h patterns defining the water demand at the nodes and the water levels at each reservoir the minimum service pressure is 30 m the prv locations suggested for the network by the previous publications were ignored for analysis the third one selected is the wolf cordera ranch benchmark network deuerlein et al 2014 fig 7 it consists of 1782 nodes six pumping units and four reservoirs the elevation descends towards the bottom of the network creating a high pressure zone that moves away from the reservoir the minimum service pressure is 35 psi 24 m 24 h simulation period is considered in this paper for the wolf cordera ranch case study the fourth case study is the virtrome network sitzenfrei et al 2020 fig 8 this is a semi real model of the city of rome which includes 150 630 nodes and 157 044 pipes the supply to the city is by four reservoirs the network s elevation is sloped towards the tiber river with a high pressure area created along the river the service pressure is 10 m and a single time step simulation is examined in this study the algorithm was run using lenovo 20kes0aa00 intel core i7 8650u cpu 1 90 ghz 2112 mhz 4 core s 8 logical processors 5 results and discussion 5 1 synthetice network for the synthetice network case study the algorithm was run successively to find the best prv positions within the network with the prvs added to the epanet 2 2 model one after the other when each algorithm run was completed the prv positions the order in which they were added and the setpoint values selected are explained in fig 5b as can be seen five prvs were added to the network however more prvs could have been added but we subjectively chose to restrict the count to five to make a cost benefit tradeoff the parameter corresponding to the arithmetic sum of nodal pressures over the entire simulation period denoted as n j t p with n j is the number of network nodes and p is the water pressure was selected to demonstrate the effects of prv placement in the overall pressure management strategy as illustrated in fig 9 a n j t p has the same unit as water pressure for the initial conditions considered the value of n j t p was calculated as 365 135 7 m with the maximum average and minimum nodal pressure values as 108 8 m 86 4 m and 59 9 m fig 9b the maximum water pressure was estimated at the node with id a5 which is linked to the reservoir on the first algorithm run the single pipe delivering water from the reservoir to node a5 and subsequently to the pipe loop was chosen as the ideal location for the first prv fig 5b intriguingly the addition of this prv reduced the n j t p value to 171 692 2 m fig 9a and the overall pressure within the network by 52 98 the maximum pressure in the network dropped from 108 8 m to 55 1 m which was the setpoint value selected for the first prv the minimum pressure within the network was maintained as the minimum service pressure and the average pressure in the 25 consumer nodes dropped to 40 6 m fig 9b interestingly due to the peculiar elevation pattern of the consumer locations of the synthetice network the proposed algorithm determined the following prv positions towards the left side of the network fig 5b however as seen in fig 9a no significant reduction in the overall pressure within the network was achieved by placing the next four prvs though it is not distinguishable from fig 9a the placement of the second prv reduced the n j t p value from 171 692 2 m to 171 657 8 m by a mere 0 01 as well no changes were obtained for the maximum average and minimum nodal pressure values fig 9b although a slight increase in the pressure reduction to 0 02 was obtained with the placement of the third and the fourth prvs this was deemed trivial considering the network configuration none of the four prvs after the first placement was found pertinent to pressure management comparing the obtained results with those reported in price and ostfeld 2022 sheds light on the advantages of the proposed algorithm figs 10 and 11 the proposed valve positioning algorithm results fig 10 signify that the pressure within the synthetice network can be managed ideally with just one prv placed at the downstream end of the pipe connecting to the reservoir the results illustrated in fig 11 also confirm the capability of the obtained solution of placing a single prv in managing the nodal pressures in five demand nodes c1 c2 c3 e1 and e5 interestingly the reduction in overall pressure attained after placing four additional prvs was only 0 05 on the contrary in the results obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm a stage wise reduction in the overall pressure with prv placement was apparent fig 10b the overall pressure reduction attained by placing one prv in the price and ostfeld 2022 solution was 40 39 however subsequent placement of prvs effectuated significant pressure control and after placing five prvs the n j t p value dropped from 365 135 7 m to 181 033 0 m compared with the current solution the n j t p value after placing five prvs obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm was 5 3 higher from a detailed analysis of results the mean values of the nodal pressures over the 168 h simulation period obtained after placing five prvs using the proposed algorithm were estimated as 45 08 m 44 87 m 35 17 m 54 74 m and 24 94 m respectively the corresponding standard deviation values were 0 084 m 0 023 m 0 123 m 0 067 m and 0 003 m the mean values of the nodal pressures in the five nodes after placing five prvs employing the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm were estimated as 49 15 m 48 73 m 39 60 m 44 84 m and 29 26 m although the proposed algorithm delivered relatively lower pressure values in four out of five demand nodes considered the pressure values obtained in node e1 were higher than that obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm fig 11d and i this may be attributed to the dissimilarities in the prv positions between the solutions of the proposed algorithm and that of price and ostfeld 2022 fig 10a the price and ostfeld 2022 solution identified the positions of the third fourth and fifth prvs towards the bottom left corner of the distribution network on the other hand in the current solution only the fourth prv was placed in the bottom left corner segment the standard deviations of the nodal pressure values 2 791 m 2 792 m 2 841 m 0 089 m and 2 889 m estimated with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm were higher than that of the current solution these results specify that the proposed algorithm can effectuate relatively consistent nodal pressure heads compared to the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm fig 11 this improvement is attributed to the proposed algorithm using remotely controlled prvs therefore the prv setpoint values dynamically change to maintain the minimum required service pressure eq 7 instead the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm considered locally controlled prvs that maintain a particular fixed setpoint value to offer the minimum required service pressure at the critical time step and a relatively higher pressures at every other time step altogether the synthetice network case study results signify the capability of the proposed valve positing algorithm in offering optimal pressure management solution and its advance over the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm the overall pressure reduction effectuated by a single prv in the proposed solution was higher than that of five prvs in the price and ostfeld 2022 solution fig 10b nevertheless the pressure reduction in all the demand nodes for the proposed solution was not on par with that of the price and ostfeld 2022 solution fig 11 at specific nodes for example node e1 the pressure values obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 solution were better than that of the proposed solution however on the whole the proposed algorithm was found superior to the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm in delivering optimal positions and setpoints of prvs for reducing pressures in a wds 5 2 jowitt and xu network for the second case study the value of n j t p without the placement of any prvs within the network was obtained as 21 487 7 m fig 12 a and the average nodal pressure was found as 39 1 m the maximum and minimum pressures of 47 0 m and 30 6 m were obtained at consumer nodes with ids junction 17 at time step 05 00 and junction 13 at timestep 17 00 respectively fig 6 from the algorithm run the pipe connecting junctions 12 and 13 with id pipe 30 evolved as the optimal location for the first prv placement as expected placing the first prv achieved a significant overall pressure reduction with around a 13 decline in the n j t p values the maximum average and minimum pressure values dropped to 38 1 m 34 and 30 m respectively fig 12b the pipe pipe 27 connecting reservoir 25 with junction 16 evolved as the location of the second prv placement while the algorithm determined the location for the third in pipe 32 fig 6 the pipe connecting junction 12 and junction 15 pipe 31 was determined to be the optimal location for the fourth prv nevertheless the placement of the second third and fourth prvs within the network did not deliver a similar reduction in the overall network pressure compared to the first fig 12 however intriguingly a steady increase in the pressure reduction was observed with the second third and fourth prv placement the stage wise reduction in total network pressure has increased from the lowest value of 0 02 to 0 08 with the third prv placement and subsequently increased to 0 13 with the placement of the fourth prv though no noticeable variations in the maximum average and minimum nodal pressures were observed fig 12b with the placement of the fifth prv in pipe 20 connecting junction 16 and junction 17 an unexpected drop in the n j t p value was observed fig 12a the overall system pressure decline was estimated to be 1 81 which was more significant than what was observed with placing the three predecessors interestingly no change was obtained in the values of the maximum average and minimum pressures at the consumer nodes fig 12b however it should be noted that the minimum pressure at the consumer nodes was maintained at 30 m and was not allowed to decline below the minimum service pressure level from a concise analysis of the results five can be summarized as the ideal number of prvs for pressure management within the jowitt and xu 1990 network case study however we have previously stated that the number of algorithm runs was arbitrarily chosen therefore we can only assume that more efficient pressure management may arrive if the algorithm is run many times and more prv locations are defined the cost of prv installation and operation may need to be accounted for to arrive at the optimal number of prvs which is beyond the present study s scope 5 3 wolf cordera ranch benchmark network unlike the two case studies previously discussed the number of algorithm runs was selected as 20 considering the complexity of the wolf cordera ranch network case study fig 13 schematically illustrates the prv locations after the 20 algorithm runs and the five pressure zones marked i to v resulting from their placement fig 14 and table 1 consolidate the results obtained from the 20 algorithm runs it may be noted that the initial condition for the wolf cordera ranch benchmark case study already includes four prvs at predefined locations fig 7 with such an initial condition the n j t p value for the network was obtained as 4 483 382 1 m the average nodal pressure 73 7 m was much greater than the minimum service pressure fig 14b and in 1081 out of 1782 nodes the water pressure was found to be higher than the average value remarkably in 99 of the nodes the water pressure exceeded two times the minimum service pressure table 1 the initial run of the algorithm recommended the position of prv in a pipe with id 7137 of length 3651 72 m just downstream of one of the four reservoirs in the network the placement of the first prv succeeded in bringing down the value of n j t p to 3 702 805 9 m i e by 17 4 fig 14 the average pressure also dropped to 60 9 m however no considerable change was obtained for the maximum nodal pressure nevertheless the number of nodes exceeding two times the minimum service pressure suddenly declined to 75 8 table 1 although no considerable changes in the n j t p values were observed from the subsequent 15 runs of the algorithm a gradual decline in the overall pressure with the successive addition of prvs was virtually evident fig 14a intriguingly a very trivial increase in the n j t p value from 2 596 161 4 m to 2 596 393 2 m was obtained with the placement of the twelfth prv within the network such a 0 01 increase may be attributed to the complex configuration and elevation pattern of the wolf cordera ranch network the nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure and exceeding twice the minimum service pressure remained comparable over these 15 runs table 1 an immediate drop in the n j t p value was observed in the seventeenth algorithm run corresponding to the assignment of the seventeenth prv within the network fig 14a the decline in overall pressure increased from 0 06 during the sixteenth run to 1 94 after placing 17 prvs furthermore the percentage number of nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure and exceeding twice the minimum service pressure decreased significantly from 57 to 48 and 76 to 65 respectively table 1 surprisingly no uniqueness to the position of the seventeenth prv could be distinguished the unusual development observed could only be attributed to the exclusive characteristics of the distribution network considered therefore drawing a general picture from these results would be illogical increasing the number of additional prvs to the network from 17 to 20 failed to contribute many changes to the pressure distribution within the pipe network as evident from fig 14 the overall water pressure at the consumer nodes remained virtually similar during the successive addition of the eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth prv although a gradual decline in the pressure was apparent from close observation this is inconsequential considering the complexity of the case study analyzed the obvious question from the analysis of the results would be on the required number of prvs for the wolf cordera ranch for effective water pressure management at the consumer nodes the choice of one prv or 17 prvs can be arrived at only by making a suitable tradeoff between the cost and the following benefits 5 4 virtrome network the virtrome network remained the most complex out of the four case studies analyzed the network did not include any prvs for the initial conditions considered from the epanet 2 2 demand driven analysis dda the value of n j t p was calculated as 11 757 408 4 m the average nodal pressure was calculated as 78 1 m and the nodal water pressure exceeded this value in around 52 of the demand nodes the nodal water pressure transcended two times the minimum service pressure in 150 006 out of 150 630 nodes the first algorithm run optimally decided the prv location on the downstream end of a pipe originating from one reservoir id 150631 out of the four in the virtrome network fig 8 the prv setpoint value was determined as 87 8 m the placement of this prv effectuated reducing the overall pressure within the network by 0 19 the corresponding drop in the average nodal pressure was 0 26 i e from 78 1 m to 77 9 m no significant decline in the maximum nodal pressure was visible fig 15 b expectedly the minimum nodal pressure also did not drop as it was equal to the minimum service pressure even with no prvs within the network however the prv placement succeeded in reducing the nodal pressure in six consumer nodes to a value lower than 20 m compared to the previous case with no prvs as evident from fig 15 no significant effect was observed until the placement of the fifth prv within the network the fifth prv with a setpoint value of 89 4 m increased the percentage of overall pressure reduction from 0 001 to 0 01 although these numerals are small the effects this has on a system as large as the virtrome network could be deemed consequential the number of nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure of 77 9 m dropped from 78925 to 78259 with the increase in the number of prvs from one to five a similar effect as that of the fifth prv was not evident till the ninth prv placement however a gradual rise in the stage wise reduction in the pressure was observable from the sixth to the ninth algorithm run fig 15a the placement of the ninth prv reduced the pressure below 77 9 m i e the average nodal pressure in just 40 nodes increasing the number of prvs from nine to 12 increased this number from 40 to 91 even though the twelfth prv placement effectuated the highest stage wise pressure reduction after the first its overall effect on the system pressure management remained relatively negligible intriguingly the effect reduced beyond the twelfth run and an increase was not visible until the fifteenth prv placement fascinatingly the algorithm identified the locations of all the fifteen prvs along the distribution line starting from the reservoir with id 150631 fig 8 this could be attributed to the most significant elevation drop occurring along this line the algorithm thus recognizes this network section to have the maximum pressure reduction potential after placing 15 prvs within the network the value of n j t p value was estimated as 11 726 559 2 m the aggregate decline in the overall pressure compared to the initial condition with no prvs was only 0 26 compared with the previous three case studies this figure is comparatively lower and is explicitly connected with the network configuration the virtrome network is more extensive than the other three and possibly many more prvs might be required to effectuate pressure management to a similar degree as stated before recognizing the ideal number of prvs is beyond the scope of this study hence the algorithm runs were stopped at fifteen and were not explored further 6 conclusions in this paper we demonstrated the development and application of an algorithm for identifying the critical nodes in a distribution network and optimally determining the positions and setpoints of prvs in a wds the proposed algorithm operates epanet 2 2 for deriving the hydraulic solution of a wds as a directed graph established on the flow directions it applies the depth first search algorithm to develop the downstream network supplied by water flowing out of every pipe in the network based on three factors a the total length of downstream pipes b the critical downstream node with the minimum pressure and its value and c the relative count of the number of downstream nodes the algorithm identifies the network edge with the highest potential for pressure reduction as the potential location for placing a prv the prvs are added and the dynamic setpoints are defined while maintaining the minimum service pressure requirements at every consumer node of the wds the algorithm was applied to four studies with varying complexities the synthetice network 25 nodes and 168 h simulation period a well tested jowitt and xu 1990 network 25 nodes and 24 h simulation period the medium sized wolf cordera ranch benchmark network 1782 nodes and 24 h simulation period and the elaborate virtrome network 150 630 nodes and single period simulation the number of algorithm runs was arbitrarily chosen as 5 5 20 and 15 for the four case studies to make a cost benefit tradeoff between pressure reduction and prv costs the solution time for prv positioning was in the order of seconds for the first three networks and several minutes for the quite elaborate virtrome case study the results obtained from the four case study applications are summarized as follows 1 the algorithm pinpoints the network location with the most increased potential for pressure control on the downstream subareas the pipes supplying water to an extended system grid with pressures exceeding the minimum mandated service pressure is determined as the perfect locations for prv placement 2 the algorithm identified the downstream end of the pipe connecting to the single reservoir as the ideal location for the first prv in the synthetice network the positions of the remaining four prvs were identified along the left side of the synthetice network due to the specific elevation profile of its consumer nodes apart from the first prv none of the successive four prvs significantly reduced the overall pressure within the network 3 the synthetice network case study results established the advantages of the proposed valve positing algorithm in offering optimal pressure management solutions over the existing price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm owing to the application of remotely controlled prvs the proposed algorithm solution effectuated in maintaining almost steady pressure heads at nodes and attained a more significant overall pressure reduction than price and ostfeld 2022 4 for the second case study five were recognized as the ideal number of prvs for pressure management the algorithm maintained the minimum pressure at the consumer nodes at the minimum service pressure level and attained an overall pressure reduction of 14 7 5 in the wolf cordera ranch benchmark case study the particular characteristics of the elevation profile of the distribution network were consequential in determining the overall pressure management capability of the prvs the placement of 20 additional prvs brought down the number of nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure and the number of nodes transcending twice the minimum service pressure from 1081 to 861 and 1760 to 1162 respectively 6 for the virtrome network the algorithm recognized a distribution line starting from one of the four reservoirs with the most significant elevation drop as the network location with the maximum pressure reduction potential therefore all the positions of the 15 prvs were identified sequentially along this line owing to the complexity of the virtrome network the placement of 15 prvs attained only a 0 26 decline in overall pressure 7 the monetary expenses of prv installation and its operation are the deciding factors for the number of prvs and algorithm runs however this was not considered in the current study future investigations aim to incorporate the cost benefit aspects into the valve positioning decision making framework the algorithm focuses on pressure reduction as a means to reduce leakage indirectly the leakage was not directly modeled as this would require assumptions or calibration of the leakage coefficients throughout the system the scoring method based on summing the length of downstream pipes can be expanded to consider additional aspects involved in prv positioning such as pipe age and leakage coefficients which could be added as weights to the pipe lengths dda was used and not pressure driven analysis pda because we assumed that the minimum required service pressure is to maintain adequate pressure on the consumers so as not to affect the water consumption pda use in simulation requires defining a threshold below which the demand is reduced which is not known financial support this research was supported by the israel science foundation grant no 555 18 declaration of competing interest the authors declare they have no actual or potential

15343,optimal pressure management is a standard strategy for water loss minimization in water distribution systems wds a pragmatic solution to regulating water pressures and leakage is introducing pressure reducing valves prvs this paper presents a valve positioning algorithm for optimally deciding the positions and setpoints of prvs in a wds the algorithm derives the hydraulic solution of a wds as a directed graph established on the flow directions using epanet 2 2 and develops the downstream network supplied by water flowing out of every pipe in the network by applying the depth first search method the algorithm later recognizes the pipes leading to the most extended downstream networks with pressures above the minimum required service pressure and prioritizes them as the ideal locations for prv placement in this way the proposed algorithm overcomes the limitations of the state of the art in realistically conceptualizing the leakage reduction for optimally positioning the prvs in wds four studies with varying complexities were selected to demonstrate the algorithm s applicability for deriving pressure management solutions the solution time for prv positioning was in seconds for the first three networks and several minutes for the extensive fourth case study the results corroborate the algorithm s ability to pinpoint the critical nodes with the most increased potential for downstream pressure control and for maintaining the pressure at the least required service pressure level through optimally allocating the prvs with acceptable setpoint values within the pipe network graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pressure reducing valve prv valve positioning pressure management leakage reduction water distribution system optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water losses via leakages in water distribution systems wds are directly attributable to the challenging management of its components extreme water losses can cause service disruption and energy losses and may proliferate the probability of contaminant intrusion in pipes due to low negative pressure conditions colombo and karney 2005 puust et al 2010 sadiq et al 2006 therefore minimizing background leakages and pipe bursts is critical for improving the reliability competence and overall performance of wds several strategies leak detection annual rehabilitation and pressure management have been proposed in this regard el zahab and zayed 2019 gupta and kulat 2018 lambert 2002 out of them optimal pressure management is widely recognized as the classic and most effective water loss minimization strategy for wds awwa american water works association 2003 lambert 2003 vicente et al 2016 apart from leakage reduction pressure management also has benefits such as prolonging the life of wds components by decreasing new pipe breaks and bursts and saving water through the lessening of consumption lambert and fantozzi 2010 water pressures in wds are dynamic and it varies diurnally owing to the fluctuations in the water demands at the consumer ends generally the water demands are at their peak and the water pressures are typically at their lowest levels during the mid day due to the increased head losses inside pipes alternatively during minimum water demands typically during nighttime the water pressures would be at their highest levels the excessive pressures may be controlled by operating the pumps however the pumps are generally positioned at the headworks and thus scheduling their operations only provides an option for managing the overall pressure at definite distribution network zones comparable to pump scheduling adapting the operations of the water tank would also induce only insignificant effects on the downstream pressure reduction because of the narrow bandwidth between the high and low operational tank water levels however introducing pressure reducing valves prvs at specific network locations reduces the water pressures supplied to downstream subareas suffering from excess pressures and effectively delivers better pressure management countless studies in the literature signify the importance of placing prvs in wds for pressure management ali 2015 araujo et al 2006 covelli et al 2016 creaco and pezzinga 2015 de paola et al 2017 gupta et al 2018 jowitt and xu 1990 liberatore and sechi 2009 magini et al 2007 nicolini and zovatto 2009 pecci et al 2019 price and ostfeld 2022 reis et al 1997 vairavamoorthy and lumbers 1998 placing a prv in wds aims to make the water pressure at any network location customarily critical demand node closer to the least required service pressure once positioned prvs may be controlled locally with a hydraulic actuator or remotely by employing a communication network between the valve and a controller in both cases the setpoints need to be chosen to constantly maintain definite water pressures at critical network locations over the entire day in a previous work price and ostfeld 2022 two authors of this paper have demonstrated the development and application of an algorithm dealing with locating the critical nodes and determining the optimal positions of prvs in wds in their methodology price and ostfeld 2022 employed the epanet 2 2 rossman et al 2020 solution of a hydraulic model as a directed graph established on the flow directions to determine the most effective pipes and the optimal locations of locally controlled prvs based on two criteria the number of downstream nodes and the pressure reduction potential price and ostfeld 2022 selected the criterion of the number of downstream nodes in their algorithm because the pressures in epanet 2 2 are measured at the nodes and not along the pipes however such a simplification made the leakage estimations using this algorithm partly unrealistic because in real world networks the leakage losses are determined principally by the number of pipe joints controlled entirely by the pipe lengths and not by the number of consumer locations in this paper we attempt to overcome this drawback of the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm a new algorithm that considers the downstream pipe length and conceptualizes the leakage reduction in a improved way is considered for optimally positioning the prvs in wds the rest of the paper is organized as follows a brief literature review an explanation of the methodology a demonstration of the algorithm in four case studies and conclusions 2 literature review numerous mathematical modeling studies focusing on applying a multitude of computing techniques and algorithms for deciding the positions and settings of prvs for pressure management and subsequent leakage reduction can be found in the literature one of the pioneering works in this area was reported by jowitt and xu 1990 in this paper jowitt and xu 1990 determined the settings of the prvs already placed at predefined locations by solving a linear program model that minimizes leakage the researchers employed the linear theory method and linearized the non linear equations describing the head flow relationships in the water distribution network later vairavamoorthy and lumbers 1998 improved the linear program model of jowitt and xu 1990 and made prv setting optimization model more robust and efficient by using non linear programming these researchers solved the non linear equations describing the head flow relationships in the water distribution network by adopting the sequential quadratic programming method dissimilar to the two studies mentioned above the attempt by savić and walters 1995 for optimally deciding the settings of isolating valves for pressure management in water distribution networks involved the application of the principles of evolutionary design and genetic algorithms ga this was also one of the first applications of the evolution program in wds engineering however it may be noted that these three above studies focused only on optimizing the setting of prvs jowitt and xu 1990 vairavamoorthy and lumbers 1998 and isolation valves savić and walters 1995 and ignored emphasizing on the optimum locations for their placement in a water distribution network reis et al 1997 became the pioneers in simultaneously handling the problems of optimal location and regulation of prvs these researchers used the ga to propose the prv locations within the network and the linear programming embedded in the ga to determine the optimal prv settings however reis et al 1997 limited their analysis only to the single period simulation of water distribution networks this limitation was overcome later by araujo et al 2006 by presenting a ga based optimization model over an extended period their optimization approach followed a two phase methodology with the first phase dealing with choosing the number of locations of prvs and the second dealing with their setting in every time step dissimilar to this two phase methodology of araujo et al 2006 a multi objective approach for determining the positions and settings of prvs by minimizing the leakage volume and the number of prvs in a water distribution network was proposed by magini et al 2007 these researchers considered leakages a pressure driven demand through the emitter function of epanet 2 0 rossman 2000 they adopted the multi objective ga with a pareto based approach to derive optimal solutions later liberatore and sechi 2009 proposed a two phase optimization approach that involved a weighted multi objective function considering the cost of inserting valves and the penalty when the pressure exceeds the maximum allowable value the first phase of this approach identifies the candidate sets pipes for the location of prvs based on hydraulic analysis the second phase employs the meta heuristic scatter search routines to obtain the optimal positions and setpoints of the prvs at the same time nicolini and zovatto 2009 presented an entirely different optimization approach for the same purposes as liberatore and sechi 2009 the researchers applied multi objective non dominated sorting ga nsga to minimize the two mutually independent and conflicting objectives total number of installed prvs and total leakage volume far along creaco and pezzinga 2015 proposed an optimization model that employs a multi objective function with ga to determine prv locations and identify isolation valves to be closed a linear programming based model was employed for determining the optimal prv settings at the same time as creaco and pezzinga 2015 ali 2015 presented a knowledge based optimization model for minimizing leakage in distribution networks through optimizing the positions and setpoints of prvs this approach incorporated the physical knowledge of the wds into the optimization model solved using ga to improve the efficiency in arriving at the optimal solutions the applicability of ga in deciding the positions and settings of a predefined number of prvs was further explored in several recent studies covelli et al 2016 gupta et al 2018 covelli et al 2016 proposed a procedure that coupled a ga based optimization model with hydraulic modeling of pressure dependent leakages through pipes by showing the proposed model applicability on a small network example covelli et al 2016 reported an approximate 26 reduction in the background water losses dissimilar to covelli et al 2016 a hybrid pressure reduction model for leakage reduction was proposed by gupta et al 2018 in which both structural and non structural optimizing tank storage level management options were considered the structural options considered were deciding the positions and settings of prvs and nsga ii was applied to make optimal selections besides those mentioned above several other computing techniques were also employed for prvs position and setpoint optimization one example is the study by de paola et al 2017 this study demonstrated the applicability and computational efficiency of the harmony search method to optimize the locations and settings of a predefined number of prvs another standalone study in this research area was reported by pecci et al 2019 in attempt to optimally decide prvs position in distribution networks a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming model was formulated and solved using the branch and bound method by relaxing the nonconvex hydraulic constraints price and ostfeld 2022 recently presented a prv positioning algorithm for pressure management and subsequent leakage control by combining the graph theory with epanet 2 2 rossman et al 2020 this algorithm identifies the pipe with the maximum potential for downstream pressure reduction after each algorithm run a prv assigned with the adequate setting value determined by model equations is added to the hydraulic model each further run of the algorithm recommends the position and setting of the next prv to be installed the number of algorithm runs is controlled by the number of prvs to be installed in the network price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm was found computationally fast compared to ga and the outcomes were on par with that obtained using ga however they used the number of the downstream nodes and their pressure from a particular pipe location to quantize the prv effect on the downstream network assuming the leakage occurs at pipe junctions this assumption may be valid for a small network with many interconnecting junctions relative to the pipe length such as house plumbing or industrial plumbing though for real world wds most leaks are from pipe breaks and bursts along the pipes thus the pipe length becomes a better option to quantify the effect of a prv besides counting nodes in a hydraulic model might lead to misinterpretation of the natural layout of the network a hydraulic model can connect a single node to any number of pipes nevertheless only three pipes are naturally connected at a single node in real world wds therefore two t junctions in the actual case are typically represented as a four pipe junction in a hydraulic model fig 1 due to this dissimilarity routinely ignored in hydraulic modeling of wds which price and ostfeld 2022 also overlooked their valve positioning algorithm has restrictions in offering pressure management solutions applicable on field for minimizing the water losses via leakages in wds the present paper is inspired by the limitations of the existing prvs positioning algorithms specifically from the limitations of the valve positioning algorithm of price and ostfeld 2022 proposed by two authors of the present work to the author s understanding the use of pipe length gives a better conceptual interpretation of the leakages in a water distribution network this could expand the previously used method of counting nodes in the hydraulic model and offer pragmatic field applicable solutions for pressure management in wds and minimizing leakage losses 3 valve positioning algorithm the proposed algorithm fig 2 presumes that prvs should be placed in wds at locations with the highest potential for pressure reduction on the downstream subareas water leakage mainly occurs along pipes and predominantly at pipe joints thus pipes leading to an extended downstream network with pressures above the minimum required service pressure are considered ideal sites for prv placement the exact effect of a prv in a looped network is challenging to anticipate without using a brute force approach of running the hydraulic model with a prv installed on each of the network pipes testing all pressure settings the presented algorithm assumes a direct connection between the effects of locating a prv at a specific pipe location and the amount of water supplied to downstream nodes from that location in a looped network flow direction change occurs after a prv is installed utilizing flow routes bypassing the prv but with increased head loss and this lowers downstream pressures the proposed valve positioning algorithm employs a hydraulic model solved using epanet 2 2 to determine the flow rates and pressures throughout the system for every examined hydraulic time step the downstream network supplied by water flowing out of every pipe in the network is established using the depth first search algorithm utilizing the flow directions as a directed graph three values are explicitly defined for every pipe for each time step a the total length of downstream pipes b the critical downstream node with the minimum pressure and its value and c the relative count of the number of downstream nodes the critical downstream node is the downstream node from a pipe with minimal pressure such a node is determined for each pipe in the network for each pipe employing the flow directions as a directed graph the depth first search algorithm demarcates the path originating from the terminate node of the pipe leading to all the connected downstream nodes once all the connected downstream nodes are defined for every pipe the downstream node with the minimum pressure is determined the relative downstream node count for a pipe is estimated by summing the fraction of water flow entering each downstream node along the branches originating from the pipe for example let us assume that a certain pipe supplies a chain of three downstream nodes following each other in quick succession if the network is branched and all the downstream nodes are supplied only from the examined pipe fig 3 a meaning that 100 of the water supplied to each of the nodes originates from the upstream pipe the relative node count will be 3 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 or 300 the effect of the examined pipe becomes weak if the network is looped and half of the flow to each of the three nodes is coming from an alternate supply source fig 3b in such a case the relative supply from the examined pipe to the first second and third node would be 50 25 and 12 5 respectively as the effect from the origin pipe is diluted the total relative node count would then become 0 875 0 50 0 25 0 125 or 87 5 thus it is definite that in the branched configuration the pipe strongly affects the three nodes however under the looped configuration the effect is weakened the mathematical equations applied in the algorithm for estimating the relative node count are defined as eqs 1 3 1 l s u m e t i j e e l e e e t t 2 p m i n i m u m e t min j e e p j t e e t t 3 n r e l a t i v e e t i j e e q i j t q j t n r e l a t

node j of pipe e using the flow directions in the pipes at time step t as a directed graph a node may be a member of several e e t sets for all pipes e located upstream of the node under consideration the allowable pressure reduction is specified as the difference between the pressure at the critical demand node and the minimum required service pressure once the allowable pressure reduction is estimated the pressure reduction potential for a pipe for every time step is computed by multiplying the length of the downstream pipes with the allowable pressure reduction and the relative node count the mathematical expressions for calculating the allowable pressure reduction and pressure reduction potential are defined as eqs 4 and 5 4 p a l l o w a b l e e t p m i n i m u m e t p s e r v i c e e p t t 5 p p o t e n t i a l e t p a l l o w a b l e e t l s u m e t n r e l a t i v e e t e p t t where p a l l o w a b l e e t allowable pressure reduction downstream from pipe e at time step t with the unit for example kpa p s e r v i c e minimum service pressure with the unit for example kpa and p p o t e n t i a l e t pressure reduction potential downstream from pipe e at time step t with the unit kpa m the proposed algorithm assumes the same pipe condition for all the pipes in the network also the leakage distribution is directly and solely associated with the pressure distribution suppose an examined system consists of old pipes vulnerable to water losses or it is known to cover known areas with a higher leakage potential the pipes may be allocated a correction factor to prioritize them the pressure reduction score for every pipe is calculated as the sum of the pressure reduction potentials for each time step eq 6 6 s e t p p o t e n t i a l e t e p t t where s e pressure reduction score for pipe e the pipe with the highest pressure reduction score s is selected as the recommended location for prv placement and is marked with an index e once the prv placement location is finalized its setpoint value for each time step dynamic in nature is assessed as the difference between the prevailing pressure at the end of the pipe prior to the prv installation and the acceptable downstream pressure reduction eq 7 7 p r v s e t p o i n t e t p e t p a l l o w a b l e e t t t where e index of pipe for which the prv is to be installed and p e t pressure at the end node of pipe e at time step t after adding the prv to the hydraulic model and inputting the necessary setpoint values the algorithm is re run to determine the optimal location for placing the next prv in the network a simplified example of the proposed valve positioning algorithm is demonstrated using fig 4 the given example fig 4a signifies a section of a looped wds the demand nodes d e f and g are supplied from pipes ad bd and ce respectively for a specific time step t it is assumed that each pipe is 1 m long and the value of p s e r v i c e is 200 kpa fig 4b exhibits the effect of prv placement in pipe bd pipe bd contributes to flow into node d the relative effect of pipe bd on node d can be estimated as 15 m3h 18 m3 h 100 83 3 consequently the relative supply from pipe bd into node e becomes 59 5 i e 5 m3h 7 m3 h 83 3 similarly the relative supply from pipe bd into node f becomes 83 3 3 m3h 3 m3 h 83 3 and the relative supply from pipe bd into node g becomes 71 4 2 m3h 4 m3 h 83 3 2 m3h 4 m3 h 59 5 thus the total effect of pipe bd is calculated as 83 3 83 3 71 4 59 5 267 5 in other words it may be said that pipe bd affects 2 675 downstream nodes the critical

120 kpa m pressure reduction scores respectively therefore pipe bd with a higher relative score between these examined pipes becomes a preferable location for prv placement however from the perspective of pressure reduction prv placed in pipe ce can be found capable of allowing a pressure reduction of 140 kpa compared to just 40 kpa reduction by the prv placed in pipe bd however prv placed in pipe bd can affect more pipes than pipe ce hence it receives a comparatively higher pressure reduction score for the prv placed in pipe bd the prv set point at t can be estimated as p r v s

water pressures along the long pipe sections four case studies with increasing complexity are selected to demonstrate the algorithm the first case study selected is the synthetice network first introduced by price and ostfeld 2022 consisting of 25 consumer nodes supplied by a single reservoir node fig 5 a the synthetice network has a unique elevation profile such that the nodal elevation slopes away from the reservoir in the direction of a high pressure area in the network s bottom left corner each node has one of two demand patterns each pattern with 168 timesteps the minimum service pressure is 25 m above ground level the second case study is a network used by jowitt and xu 1990 based on sterling and bargiela 1984 the schematic of the network is illustrated in fig 6 this network is a well known benchmark for leakage reduction using prv positioning it has 25 nodes 37 pipes and three reservoirs with four 24 h patterns defining the water demand at the nodes and the water levels at each reservoir the minimum service pressure is 30 m the prv locations suggested for the network by the previous publications were ignored for analysis the third one selected is the wolf cordera ranch benchmark network deuerlein et al 2014 fig 7 it consists of 1782 nodes six pumping units and four reservoirs the elevation descends towards the bottom of the network creating a high pressure zone that moves away from the reservoir the minimum service pressure is 35 psi 24 m 24 h simulation period is considered in this paper for the wolf cordera ranch case study the fourth case study is the virtrome network sitzenfrei et al 2020 fig 8 this is a semi real model of the city of rome which includes 150 630 nodes and 157 044 pipes the supply to the city is by four reservoirs the network s elevation is sloped towards the tiber river with a high pressure area created along the river the service pressure is 10 m and a single time step simulation is examined in this study the algorithm was run using lenovo 20kes0aa00 intel core i7 8650u cpu 1 90 ghz 2112 mhz 4 core s 8 logical processors 5 results and discussion 5 1 synthetice network for the synthetice network case study the algorithm was run successively to find the best prv positions within the network with the prvs added to the epanet 2 2 model one after the other when each algorithm run was completed the prv positions the order in which they were added and the setpoint values selected are explained in fig 5b as can be seen five prvs were added to the network however more prvs could have been added but we subjectively chose to restrict the count to five to make a cost benefit tradeoff the parameter corresponding to the arithmetic sum of nodal pressures over the entire simulation period denoted as n j t p with n j is the number of network nodes and p is the water pressure was selected to demonstrate the effects of prv placement in the overall pressure management strategy as illustrated in fig 9 a n j t p has the same unit as water pressure for the initial conditions considered the value of n j t p was calculated as 365 135 7 m with the maximum average and minimum nodal pressure values as 108 8 m 86 4 m and 59 9 m fig 9b the maximum water pressure was estimated at the node with id a5 which is linked to the reservoir on the first algorithm run the single pipe delivering water from the reservoir to node a5 and subsequently to the pipe loop was chosen as the ideal location for the first prv fig 5b intriguingly the addition of this prv reduced the n j t p value to 171 692 2 m fig 9a and the overall pressure within the network by 52 98 the maximum pressure in the network dropped from 108 8 m to 55 1 m which was the setpoint value selected for the first prv the minimum pressure within the network was maintained as the minimum service pressure and the average pressure in the 25 consumer nodes dropped to 40 6 m fig 9b interestingly due to the peculiar elevation pattern of the consumer locations of the synthetice network the proposed algorithm determined the following prv positions towards the left side of the network fig 5b however as seen in fig 9a no significant reduction in the overall pressure within the network was achieved by placing the next four prvs though it is not distinguishable from fig 9a the placement of the second prv reduced the n j t p value from 171 692 2 m to 171 657 8 m by a mere 0 01 as well no changes were obtained for the maximum average and minimum nodal pressure values fig 9b although a slight increase in the pressure reduction to 0 02 was obtained with the placement of the third and the fourth prvs this was deemed trivial considering the network configuration none of the four prvs after the first placement was found pertinent to pressure management comparing the obtained results with those reported in price and ostfeld 2022 sheds light on the advantages of the proposed algorithm figs 10 and 11 the proposed valve positioning algorithm results fig 10 signify that the pressure within the synthetice network can be managed ideally with just one prv placed at the downstream end of the pipe connecting to the reservoir the results illustrated in fig 11 also confirm the capability of the obtained solution of placing a single prv in managing the nodal pressures in five demand nodes c1 c2 c3 e1 and e5 interestingly the reduction in overall pressure attained after placing four additional prvs was only 0 05 on the contrary in the results obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm a stage wise reduction in the overall pressure with prv placement was apparent fig 10b the overall pressure reduction attained by placing one prv in the price and ostfeld 2022 solution was 40 39 however subsequent placement of prvs effectuated significant pressure control and after placing five prvs the n j t p value dropped from 365 135 7 m to 181 033 0 m compared with the current solution the n j t p value after placing five prvs obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm was 5 3 higher from a detailed analysis of results the mean values of the nodal pressures over the 168 h simulation period obtained after placing five prvs using the proposed algorithm were estimated as 45 08 m 44 87 m 35 17 m 54 74 m and 24 94 m respectively the corresponding standard deviation values were 0 084 m 0 023 m 0 123 m 0 067 m and 0 003 m the mean values of the nodal pressures in the five nodes after placing five prvs employing the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm were estimated as 49 15 m 48 73 m 39 60 m 44 84 m and 29 26 m although the proposed algorithm delivered relatively lower pressure values in four out of five demand nodes considered the pressure values obtained in node e1 were higher than that obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm fig 11d and i this may be attributed to the dissimilarities in the prv positions between the solutions of the proposed algorithm and that of price and ostfeld 2022 fig 10a the price and ostfeld 2022 solution identified the positions of the third fourth and fifth prvs towards the bottom left corner of the distribution network on the other hand in the current solution only the fourth prv was placed in the bottom left corner segment the standard deviations of the nodal pressure values 2 791 m 2 792 m 2 841 m 0 089 m and 2 889 m estimated with the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm were higher than that of the current solution these results specify that the proposed algorithm can effectuate relatively consistent nodal pressure heads compared to the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm fig 11 this improvement is attributed to the proposed algorithm using remotely controlled prvs therefore the prv setpoint values dynamically change to maintain the minimum required service pressure eq 7 instead the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm considered locally controlled prvs that maintain a particular fixed setpoint value to offer the minimum required service pressure at the critical time step and a relatively higher pressures at every other time step altogether the synthetice network case study results signify the capability of the proposed valve positing algorithm in offering optimal pressure management solution and its advance over the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm the overall pressure reduction effectuated by a single prv in the proposed solution was higher than that of five prvs in the price and ostfeld 2022 solution fig 10b nevertheless the pressure reduction in all the demand nodes for the proposed solution was not on par with that of the price and ostfeld 2022 solution fig 11 at specific nodes for example node e1 the pressure values obtained with the price and ostfeld 2022 solution were better than that of the proposed solution however on the whole the proposed algorithm was found superior to the price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm in delivering optimal positions and setpoints of prvs for reducing pressures in a wds 5 2 jowitt and xu network for the second case study the value of n j t p without the placement of any prvs within the network was obtained as 21 487 7 m fig 12 a and the average nodal pressure was found as 39 1 m the maximum and minimum pressures of 47 0 m and 30 6 m were obtained at consumer nodes with ids junction 17 at time step 05 00 and junction 13 at timestep 17 00 respectively fig 6 from the algorithm run the pipe connecting junctions 12 and 13 with id pipe 30 evolved as the optimal location for the first prv placement as expected placing the first prv achieved a significant overall pressure reduction with around a 13 decline in the n j t p values the maximum average and minimum pressure values dropped to 38 1 m 34 and 30 m respectively fig 12b the pipe pipe 27 connecting reservoir 25 with junction 16 evolved as the location of the second prv placement while the algorithm determined the location for the third in pipe 32 fig 6 the pipe connecting junction 12 and junction 15 pipe 31 was determined to be the optimal location for the fourth prv nevertheless the placement of the second third and fourth prvs within the network did not deliver a similar reduction in the overall network pressure compared to the first fig 12 however intriguingly a steady increase in the pressure reduction was observed with the second third and fourth prv placement the stage wise reduction in total network pressure has increased from the lowest value of 0 02 to 0 08 with the third prv placement and subsequently increased to 0 13 with the placement of the fourth prv though no noticeable variations in the maximum average and minimum nodal pressures were observed fig 12b with the placement of the fifth prv in pipe 20 connecting junction 16 and junction 17 an unexpected drop in the n j t p value was observed fig 12a the overall system pressure decline was estimated to be 1 81 which was more significant than what was observed with placing the three predecessors interestingly no change was obtained in the values of the maximum average and minimum pressures at the consumer nodes fig 12b however it should be noted that the minimum pressure at the consumer nodes was maintained at 30 m and was not allowed to decline below the minimum service pressure level from a concise analysis of the results five can be summarized as the ideal number of prvs for pressure management within the jowitt and xu 1990 network case study however we have previously stated that the number of algorithm runs was arbitrarily chosen therefore we can only assume that more efficient pressure management may arrive if the algorithm is run many times and more prv locations are defined the cost of prv installation and operation may need to be accounted for to arrive at the optimal number of prvs which is beyond the present study s scope 5 3 wolf cordera ranch benchmark network unlike the two case studies previously discussed the number of algorithm runs was selected as 20 considering the complexity of the wolf cordera ranch network case study fig 13 schematically illustrates the prv locations after the 20 algorithm runs and the five pressure zones marked i to v resulting from their placement fig 14 and table 1 consolidate the results obtained from the 20 algorithm runs it may be noted that the initial condition for the wolf cordera ranch benchmark case study already includes four prvs at predefined locations fig 7 with such an initial condition the n j t p value for the network was obtained as 4 483 382 1 m the average nodal pressure 73 7 m was much greater than the minimum service pressure fig 14b and in 1081 out of 1782 nodes the water pressure was found to be higher than the average value remarkably in 99 of the nodes the water pressure exceeded two times the minimum service pressure table 1 the initial run of the algorithm recommended the position of prv in a pipe with id 7137 of length 3651 72 m just downstream of one of the four reservoirs in the network the placement of the first prv succeeded in bringing down the value of n j t p to 3 702 805 9 m i e by 17 4 fig 14 the average pressure also dropped to 60 9 m however no considerable change was obtained for the maximum nodal pressure nevertheless the number of nodes exceeding two times the minimum service pressure suddenly declined to 75 8 table 1 although no considerable changes in the n j t p values were observed from the subsequent 15 runs of the algorithm a gradual decline in the overall pressure with the successive addition of prvs was virtually evident fig 14a intriguingly a very trivial increase in the n j t p value from 2 596 161 4 m to 2 596 393 2 m was obtained with the placement of the twelfth prv within the network such a 0 01 increase may be attributed to the complex configuration and elevation pattern of the wolf cordera ranch network the nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure and exceeding twice the minimum service pressure remained comparable over these 15 runs table 1 an immediate drop in the n j t p value was observed in the seventeenth algorithm run corresponding to the assignment of the seventeenth prv within the network fig 14a the decline in overall pressure increased from 0 06 during the sixteenth run to 1 94 after placing 17 prvs furthermore the percentage number of nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure and exceeding twice the minimum service pressure decreased significantly from 57 to 48 and 76 to 65 respectively table 1 surprisingly no uniqueness to the position of the seventeenth prv could be distinguished the unusual development observed could only be attributed to the exclusive characteristics of the distribution network considered therefore drawing a general picture from these results would be illogical increasing the number of additional prvs to the network from 17 to 20 failed to contribute many changes to the pressure distribution within the pipe network as evident from fig 14 the overall water pressure at the consumer nodes remained virtually similar during the successive addition of the eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth prv although a gradual decline in the pressure was apparent from close observation this is inconsequential considering the complexity of the case study analyzed the obvious question from the analysis of the results would be on the required number of prvs for the wolf cordera ranch for effective water pressure management at the consumer nodes the choice of one prv or 17 prvs can be arrived at only by making a suitable tradeoff between the cost and the following benefits 5 4 virtrome network the virtrome network remained the most complex out of the four case studies analyzed the network did not include any prvs for the initial conditions considered from the epanet 2 2 demand driven analysis dda the value of n j t p was calculated as 11 757 408 4 m the average nodal pressure was calculated as 78 1 m and the nodal water pressure exceeded this value in around 52 of the demand nodes the nodal water pressure transcended two times the minimum service pressure in 150 006 out of 150 630 nodes the first algorithm run optimally decided the prv location on the downstream end of a pipe originating from one reservoir id 150631 out of the four in the virtrome network fig 8 the prv setpoint value was determined as 87 8 m the placement of this prv effectuated reducing the overall pressure within the network by 0 19 the corresponding drop in the average nodal pressure was 0 26 i e from 78 1 m to 77 9 m no significant decline in the maximum nodal pressure was visible fig 15 b expectedly the minimum nodal pressure also did not drop as it was equal to the minimum service pressure even with no prvs within the network however the prv placement succeeded in reducing the nodal pressure in six consumer nodes to a value lower than 20 m compared to the previous case with no prvs as evident from fig 15 no significant effect was observed until the placement of the fifth prv within the network the fifth prv with a setpoint value of 89 4 m increased the percentage of overall pressure reduction from 0 001 to 0 01 although these numerals are small the effects this has on a system as large as the virtrome network could be deemed consequential the number of nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure of 77 9 m dropped from 78925 to 78259 with the increase in the number of prvs from one to five a similar effect as that of the fifth prv was not evident till the ninth prv placement however a gradual rise in the stage wise reduction in the pressure was observable from the sixth to the ninth algorithm run fig 15a the placement of the ninth prv reduced the pressure below 77 9 m i e the average nodal pressure in just 40 nodes increasing the number of prvs from nine to 12 increased this number from 40 to 91 even though the twelfth prv placement effectuated the highest stage wise pressure reduction after the first its overall effect on the system pressure management remained relatively negligible intriguingly the effect reduced beyond the twelfth run and an increase was not visible until the fifteenth prv placement fascinatingly the algorithm identified the locations of all the fifteen prvs along the distribution line starting from the reservoir with id 150631 fig 8 this could be attributed to the most significant elevation drop occurring along this line the algorithm thus recognizes this network section to have the maximum pressure reduction potential after placing 15 prvs within the network the value of n j t p value was estimated as 11 726 559 2 m the aggregate decline in the overall pressure compared to the initial condition with no prvs was only 0 26 compared with the previous three case studies this figure is comparatively lower and is explicitly connected with the network configuration the virtrome network is more extensive than the other three and possibly many more prvs might be required to effectuate pressure management to a similar degree as stated before recognizing the ideal number of prvs is beyond the scope of this study hence the algorithm runs were stopped at fifteen and were not explored further 6 conclusions in this paper we demonstrated the development and application of an algorithm for identifying the critical nodes in a distribution network and optimally determining the positions and setpoints of prvs in a wds the proposed algorithm operates epanet 2 2 for deriving the hydraulic solution of a wds as a directed graph established on the flow directions it applies the depth first search algorithm to develop the downstream network supplied by water flowing out of every pipe in the network based on three factors a the total length of downstream pipes b the critical downstream node with the minimum pressure and its value and c the relative count of the number of downstream nodes the algorithm identifies the network edge with the highest potential for pressure reduction as the potential location for placing a prv the prvs are added and the dynamic setpoints are defined while maintaining the minimum service pressure requirements at every consumer node of the wds the algorithm was applied to four studies with varying complexities the synthetice network 25 nodes and 168 h simulation period a well tested jowitt and xu 1990 network 25 nodes and 24 h simulation period the medium sized wolf cordera ranch benchmark network 1782 nodes and 24 h simulation period and the elaborate virtrome network 150 630 nodes and single period simulation the number of algorithm runs was arbitrarily chosen as 5 5 20 and 15 for the four case studies to make a cost benefit tradeoff between pressure reduction and prv costs the solution time for prv positioning was in the order of seconds for the first three networks and several minutes for the quite elaborate virtrome case study the results obtained from the four case study applications are summarized as follows 1 the algorithm pinpoints the network location with the most increased potential for pressure control on the downstream subareas the pipes supplying water to an extended system grid with pressures exceeding the minimum mandated service pressure is determined as the perfect locations for prv placement 2 the algorithm identified the downstream end of the pipe connecting to the single reservoir as the ideal location for the first prv in the synthetice network the positions of the remaining four prvs were identified along the left side of the synthetice network due to the specific elevation profile of its consumer nodes apart from the first prv none of the successive four prvs significantly reduced the overall pressure within the network 3 the synthetice network case study results established the advantages of the proposed valve positing algorithm in offering optimal pressure management solutions over the existing price and ostfeld 2022 algorithm owing to the application of remotely controlled prvs the proposed algorithm solution effectuated in maintaining almost steady pressure heads at nodes and attained a more significant overall pressure reduction than price and ostfeld 2022 4 for the second case study five were recognized as the ideal number of prvs for pressure management the algorithm maintained the minimum pressure at the consumer nodes at the minimum service pressure level and attained an overall pressure reduction of 14 7 5 in the wolf cordera ranch benchmark case study the particular characteristics of the elevation profile of the distribution network were consequential in determining the overall pressure management capability of the prvs the placement of 20 additional prvs brought down the number of nodes exceeding the average nodal pressure and the number of nodes transcending twice the minimum service pressure from 1081 to 861 and 1760 to 1162 respectively 6 for the virtrome network the algorithm recognized a distribution line starting from one of the four reservoirs with the most significant elevation drop as the network location with the maximum pressure reduction potential therefore all the positions of the 15 prvs were identified sequentially along this line owing to the complexity of the virtrome network the placement of 15 prvs attained only a 0 26 decline in overall pressure 7 the monetary expenses of prv installation and its operation are the deciding factors for the number of prvs and algorithm runs however this was not considered in the current study future investigations aim to incorporate the cost benefit aspects into the valve positioning decision making framework the algorithm focuses on pressure reduction as a means to reduce leakage indirectly the leakage was not directly modeled as this would require assumptions or calibration of the leakage coefficients throughout the system the scoring method based on summing the length of downstream pipes can be expanded to consider additional aspects involved in prv positioning such as pipe age and leakage coefficients which could be added as weights to the pipe lengths dda was used and not pressure driven analysis pda because we assumed that the minimum required service pressure is to maintain adequate pressure on the consumers so as not to affect the water consumption pda use in simulation requires defining a threshold below which the demand is reduced which

15344,estuaries are important ecosystems providing irreplaceable services for humankind and in turn are extensively influenced by human activities and climate changes microbial processes which are largely controlled by viruses are always responsible for the ecological function and environmental problems in estuaries however we know little about the ecology and importance of viruses in estuarine systems here we investigated viral ecological dynamics in estuarine systems on local four largest estuaries in china in different seasons and global scales viral production varied by almost 20 fold in chinese estuaries with significant seasonality being responsible for the removal of 1 41 21 45 of the bacterioplankton standing stock each day and contributed directly to the organic carbon pool by releasing an average of 3 57 µg of cellular carbon per liter per day by compiling data from 21 estuaries across the world we found for the first time that viral population size peaked at mid latitude and viral production increased towards the equator in estuarine ecosystems the results indicated the higher viral impact on microbial mortality and dissolved organic matter cycling in tropical estuaries our field investigation and global synthesized analysis provide compelling evidence of spatiotemporal variations in estuarine viral dynamics the global view of viral impacts on estuarine microbial mortality offers important insight for incorporating viruses into ecological models and understanding the environmental implications of the tropicalization of temperate aquatic ecosystems under a scenario of climate warming graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords virioplankton viral activity organic matter pool estuary global patterns data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuaries are the most productive natural habitats and important sites for human populations and activities elliott and whitfield 2011 the ecological productivity function and service of estuaries significantly impact the world s commerce and development however most of the estuaries are facing increasingly impacts by human activities and climate changes leading to serious environmental problems such as eutrophication harmful alga bloom hypoxia and anoxia howarth et al 2011 pinckney et al 2001 many of these problems are strongly linked with ecological processes mediated by microorganisms chen et al 2021 zanaroli et al 2015 changes in microbial activity can cascade the cycling of materials through the entire marine food web and affect ecosystem function in estuaries viruses the most abundant and possibly the most enigmatic biological entities on earth are responsible for nearly half of global microbial mortality breitbart et al 2018 dion et al 2020 suttle 2005 2007 in addition to causing microbial death viruses play substantial roles in microbial regulation and biogeochemical cycling by metabolically reprogramming their hosts and short circuiting the flow of organic matter through viral infection and cell lysis suttle 2007 the ecological dynamics of viruses which constantly fluctuate temporally and spatially determine the degree to which viruses control microbial communities and influence ecosystem function despite their ecological significance the dynamics of viral assemblages in estuarine ecosystems are poorly understood especially on a global scale the estuaries along the coast of china cover a region from 5 to 55 n latitude ranging from tropical to cold temperate climate zones about 5 10 of global freshwater runoff and 15 20 of global continental sediments are delivered to the ocean through chinese estuaries zhang 2002 over the past 50 years most chinese estuaries have been receiving increased amounts of nutrients from river networks because of population expansion and urbanization this has been coupled with concomitant issues such as estuarine eutrophication and the development of hypoxic zones which have both regional and global impacts on marine biogeochemistry he et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however little is currently known about the ecological dynamics and the quantitative importance of viruses across chinese estuarine systems therefore in this study we firstly focused on the four largest and most anthropogenically influenced estuarine systems in china specifically we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of viruses and picoplankton determined the covariance between viral and microbial communities and quantified the impacts of viral lysis on microbial communities and organic matter cycling we then conducted a synthesis of 643 experimental observations from 21 estuaries across the world to explore the ecology of viruses in global estuarine ecosystems together the investigation is important for understanding the role of viruses as ecological mediators in the control of estuarine microorganisms and ecosystem function under changing conditions including local spatiotemporal dynamics and global climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling area field studies were conducted at four major estuaries along the coast of china fig 1 these estuaries were characterized by different physicochemical gradients such as turbidity freshwater discharge and sediment load the yangtze river changjiang is the longest river in asia and ranks globally as the fourth and fifth largest river in terms of water and sediment discharge accordingly it plays a major role in the flux of terrestrial materials from the chinese mainland to the western pacific ocean wang et al 2008 the yangtze river and qiantang river which are two major rivers in the yangtze delta flow into the east china sea and have an associated load of 4 86 108 and 6 59 106 tons respectively yang et al 2012 the pearl river zhujiang is the second largest in china in terms of freshwater discharge 3338 108 m3 yr this is less than the yangtze river 9513 108 m3 yr and five times more than that of the yellow river huanghe 661 108 m3 yr tao et al 2020 the yellow river is known for having high levels of suspended sediment wang et al 2015 indeed as the largest turbid river in the world the yellow river has twice the sediment discharge carried by only 6 of the yangtze river s water discharge shen et al 2010 2 2 field sampling surface waters in the mesohaline salinity ca 10 and polyhaline salinity ca 25 zones of four estuaries were sampled in winter january 2016 and summer september 2016 fig 1 water temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ using a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter ysi incorporated usa approximately 5 liters of surface water were collected from each site into acid cleaned and in situ water rinsed polycarbonate bottles water samples were pre filtered through 20 µm mesh to remove large particles and zooplankton incubation experiments for viral production and viral decay determination were set up immediately fig s1 for microbial enumeration triplicate 2 ml samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 0 5 at 4 c for 15 min after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen the samples were stored at 80 c until analysis 2 3 microbial enumeration viral and prokaryotic abundances were determined by flow cytometry fcm using the method described by bruaassrd brussaard 2004 briefly the fixed frozen samples

and prochlorococcus were enumerated directly without staining and distinguished based on their positions in the cytometric plots jiao et al 2014 the analyses of microbial abundance by fcm for each sample were repeated twice data were analyzed using the expotm32 multicomp software beckman coulter usa 2 4 viral production the dilution method was used for the direct measurement of viral production fig s1 weinbauer et al 2010 this method relies on the dilution of virus infected prokaryotes with virus free water which minimizes the influence of new viral infections and the impact of protozoa grazing on prokaryotes the increase in virus number during incubation was measured and used to calculate viral production briefly approximately 600 ml of water were filtered using tangential flow filtration tff with a 0 22 µm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride cartridge millipore usa to generate a 50 ml bacterial concentrate and ca 500 ml of filtrate virus free water was further obtained using a tff 30 kda polysulfone cartridge millipore from the 0 22 µm filtrate cai et al 2015 the 50 ml bacterial concentrate was promptly mixed with 250 ml of 30 kda filtered virus free water and then aliquoted into three replicates 50 ml each the 50 ml subsamples were subsequently incubated at in situ temperature in dry bath incubators mk 20 hangzhou allsheng china under dark conditions li et al 2014 triplicate 1 ml subsamples were collected for bacterial and viral counts every 3 h for 15 h incubation which can minimize the possible occurrence of bacterial growth and new viral infections weinbauer et al 2010 bacterial and viral counts were conducted by fcm as described above viral production was calculated using the online program vipcal luef et al 2009 http www univie ac at nuhag php vipcal for triplicate incubations virus turnover rates were determined by dividing the viral abundance by the viral production 2 5 viral decay the viral decay rate was measured based on the size fractionation approach described by noble and fuhrman fig s1 noble and fuhrman 1997 water samples were filtered by tff with a 0 22 µm pore size cartridge to generate virus containing filtrate with most bacteria being removed triplicate 50 ml samples of the filtrate were then incubated at in situ temperature in dry bath incubators mk 20 hangzhou allsheng china under dark conditions li et al 2014 triplicate 1 ml subsamples were taken every 3 h during the 15 h incubation for viral enumeration viral decay was calculated as the slope of the linear regression fitted to the natural logarithm of the viral abundance plotted versus time viral decay was not investigated in qiantang estuary during winter due to equipment limitations 2 6 virus mediated prokaryotic mortality and cellular contents released by viral lysis the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality was calculated by dividing the viral production by burst size the number of viral particles released from each cell upon lysis of 50 wilhelm et al 2002 winget et al 2011 the percentage of bacteria lysed was estimated by dividing the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality by the prokaryotic abundance the amount of carbon released by viral lysis was estimated by multiplying the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality by the average bacterial cell carbon content 20 fg c cell 1 lee and fuhrman 1987 the amount of nitrogen released by viral lysis was estimated by multiplying the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality by the average bacterial cell nitrogen content 5 fg n cell 1 lee and fuhrman 1987 2 7 public data collection we aggregated peer reviewed studies measuring viral dynamics including viral abundance viral production viral decay and viral impacts on the prokaryotic community i e the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality percentages of prokaryotes lysed by viruses and bacterial production supported by viral lysate in estuarine environments this aggregation was finalized in may of 2022 the original data were retrieved from the papers or acquired from the corresponding authors the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality was calculated by dividing the viral production by burst sizes given in the study for studies that did not investigate burst size the commonly accepted burst size of 50 was used the percentage of bacterial production supported by viral lysis was calculated by dividing the amount of carbon released by viral lysis by the bacterial production assuming 20 fg of c needed per cell and multiplied by 100 estuaries are typically divided into four salinity zones oligohaline 0 5 4 9 mesohaline 5 0 17 9 polyhaline 18 0 29 9 and euryhaline 30 0 35 9 only data from water with salinity levels ranging from 0 5 to 35 9 were used for analysis in this study since there could be variations in samples from different depths we only included samples within the top 10 m of the water column to avoid possible biases finally the dataset covered 21 estuaries and contained a total of 643 data points of which 415 were for viral abundance 155 for viral production 41 for viral decay and 32 for virus mediated bacterial mortality associated information regarding the sampling sites such as latitude longitude sampling depth sampling date prokaryotic abundance prokaryotic production temperature salinity and chlorophyll a level was also collected when available 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r v4 1 2 r development core team data were reported as the mean the standard error of the mean paired t tests were used to test differences in the values of measured environmental and microbial variables between chinese estuaries because virus mediated prokaryotic mortality and carbon nitrogen released by viral lysis were calculated from viral production in chinese estuaries the statistical results of these parameters were identical to those of viral production correlations between environmental and microbial parameters were performed using spearman s rank correlations a p value of 0 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance multiple linear regression was used to identify correlations between viral dynamics and environmental variables 3 results 3 1 microbial abundances in chinese and global estuaries surface waters within different salinity regions mesohaline and polyhaline zones were collected from four chinese estuaries during winter and summer fig 1 table s1 during the sampling period the water temperature ranged from 0 1 c to 18 4 c in winter and 24 6 c to 29 7 c in summer the ph values ranged from 7 44 to 8 60 with higher values being observed during summer p 0 05 and in polyhaline zones p 0 05 the dissolved oxygen varied from 4 24 to 12 52 mg l with significantly higher values being observed in winter p 0 05 viral abundance among the four estuaries varied by nearly 34 fold from 7 14 105 to 2 45 107 viruses ml 1 and prokaryotic abundance varied by about 8 fold from 6 30 105 to 4 82 106 cells ml 1 fig 2 a and b table s1 indicating the spatial temporal variations of microbes in the estuarine areas the viral and prokaryotic abundances reflected the expected seasonal differences with significantly higher abundances observed in summer fig 2 additionally viral and prokaryotic abundances were positively correlated with temperature p 0 01 fig s2 viral abundance showed significantly higher values in polyhaline zones than in mesohaline zones p 0 05 while no significant differences p 0 05 were observed in prokaryotic abundance between regions with different salinities fig 2 the virus to prokaryote ratio vpr varied from 0 92 to 11 63 with significantly higher values detected in winter p 0 05 fig 2c the vpr values observed in chinese estuaries were comparable with previously published values for other estuarine waters table s2 the abundances of autotrophic picoplankton synechococcus prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes were higher in summer p 0 05 while there were no significant differences between regions with different salinities table s1 fig s2 the significant positive relationship found between viral and prokaryotic abundance p 0 01 in the four investigated estuaries confirmed the common notion that viral abundance is strongly dependent on prokaryote hosts the significant positive correlation between viral abundance and the abundance of picoeukaryotes p 0 01 indicated that autotrophs were also important host communities for estuarine viruses we collected publicly available data from 21 estuaries worldwide spanning four continents fig 3 table s2 viral abundance ranged from 7 14 105 viruses ml 1 to 5 90 108 viruses ml 1 across global estuarine environments with the lowest average viral abundance occurring in a cold estuary yenisei river estuary and the highest in a temperate estuary chesapeake bay fig 4 a significant differences were found among climate regions cold temperate subtropical and tropical zones fig 4b there was also an expected significant positive linear correlation observed between viral abundance and prokaryotic abundance with an average vpr of 15 74 supporting the tight coupling of the biogeographical distribution of viruses and that of prokaryotes fig 4c specifically we found that estuarine viral abundance peaked at an intermediate latitude around 40 n fig 4d 3 2 lytic viral production and viral decay in chinese and global estuaries the average viral production in four large chinese estuaries was 3 72 0 57 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 with a range of 0 41 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the mesohaline zone of the yellow river estuary in winter to 7 85 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the polyhaline zone of the pearl river estuary in summer fig 2d table s1 viral production values in chinese estuarine systems were within the range and generally at the lower end of previously detected values fig 4a the seasonal and spatial variations in viral production were significant with higher viral production detected in summer p 0 01 and polyhaline zones p 0 01 fig 2d meanwhile viral production showed a latitudinal trend decreasing from the low latitude pearl river estuary to the high latitude yellow river estuary with a clearer pattern in winter table s1 viral production was significantly positively related to viral abundance prokaryotic abundance the abundances of prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes and temperature p 0 01 fig s2 based on virus standing stock and viral production the virus turnover rate ranged from 1 64 to 9 00 h 1 total average 4 73 0 52 h 1 fig 2e corresponding to the viral turnover time of 0 46 to 2 55 days total average 1 10 0 15 days on the global scale viral production varied by as much as five orders of magnitudes in estuarine ecosystems with the lowest value of 8 50 102 viruses ml 1 h 1 observed in the cold yenisei river estuary kopylov et al 2019 and the highest value of 1 04 107 viruses ml 1 h 1 reported in the subtropical chesapeake bay winget et al 2011 the wide range of viral production indicated the great dynamics of viral activity within estuarine ecosystems significant differences in viral production were found among different climate regions fig 4b unlike viral population size which showed a peak at mid latitude we found a linear decrease in viral production with an increase in absolute latitude r2 0 54 fig 4e globally estuarine viral production was positively correlated with temperature r2 0 50 fig 4f the average viral decay in four large chinese estuaries was 1 43 0 41 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 ranging from 0 26 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the mesohaline zone of the yellow river estuary in winter to 5 86 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the polyhaline zone of the yangtze river estuary in summer fig 2f table s1 although slightly higher viral decay values were generally recorded in subtropical estuaries than in temperate estuaries yellow river estuary no significant differences were observed among estuaries similar to viral production viral decay in chinese estuaries was higher in summer p 0 001 and in higher salinity zones p 0 01 fig 2f viral decay correlated significantly with viral abundance prokaryotic abundance the abundances of prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes viral production and temperature fig s2 to date viral decay has only been investigated in a few estuaries globally with a range of 2 55 104 viruses ml 1 h 1 to 6 19 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 table s2 3 3 impacts of viral lysis on prokaryotic community in chinese and global estuaries based on the widely used burst size of 50 wilhelm et al 2002 winget et al 2011 the estimated virus mediated mortality of prokaryotes ranged from 1 98 104 cells ml 1 d 1 to 3 77 105 cells ml 1 d 1 in chinese estuarine ecosystems fig 2g viral lysis was responsible for the loss of an average of 10 03 1 57 of the bacterial standing stock per day ranging from 1 41 at the polyhaline zone of the yellow river estuary in summer to 21 45 at the polyhaline zone of the qiantang river estuary in winter fig 2h with mean cellular biomass of 20 fg c cell 1 and 5 fg n cell 1 for prokaryotic assemblages in the aquatic systems lee and fuhrman 1987 the carbon and nitrogen released by viral lysis in the studied estuaries ranged from 0 40 to 7 53 µg c l 1 d 1 average 3 57 0 55 µg c l 1 d 1 and 0 10 to 1 88 µg n l 1 d 1 average 0 89 0 14 µg n l 1 d 1 respectively the spatial and seasonal changes in viral production resulted in cascading effects on prokaryote mortality and the cycling of dissolved organic matter fig 2g and i virus mediated mortality of prokaryotes and the carbon nitrogen released by viral lysis of prokaryotes displayed significant salinity related differences with values in polyhaline zones being double those in mesohaline zones although significantly lower virus mediated mortality of prokaryotic cells was observed in winter p 0 05 the percentage of cells lysed by viruses in winter was almost double that in summer because of the lower number of bacteria standing stock in winter fig 2h in global estuaries the estimated virus mediated mortality of prokaryotes ranged from 3 40 104 cells ml 1 d 1 in the cold yenisei river estuary to 7 97 106 cells ml 1 d 1 in the tropical cochin estuary average 9 82 1 19 105 cells ml 1 d 1 resulting in the carbon released by viral lysis ranging from 0 07 to 148 29 µg c l 1 d 1 average 23 18 2 99 µg c l 1 d 1 significant first order linear regression was observed between virus mediated mortality and absolute latitude r2 0 46 p 0 001 n 134 as well as between virus mediated mortality and temperature r2 0 36 p 0 001 n 66 fig s3 viral lysis was responsible for the loss of an average of 65 73 9 84 of bacterial standing stock per day with values in tropical zone significantly higher than those in other climate zones table s2 fig s4 globally the average percentage of prokaryotic production supported by viral lysis was 83 77 13 62 table s2 4 discussion only a few studies have examined seasonal viral ecological dynamics in estuarine systems and none have compared the patterns in viral dynamics and viral impacts on hosts across estuaries to our knowledge this is the first field investigation of cross estuary spatiotemporal viral ecology we investigated four large chinese estuaries during two seasons using a consistent methodology additionally we synthesized viral parameters from 21 estuaries around the world for the first time which provided a comprehensive insight into the ecology of estuarine viruses on a global scale compilation of the global data revealed that the average viral abundance in estuarine ecosystems 5 96 107 viruses ml 1 is higher than that in coastal waters and surface open oceans 3 61 107 viruses ml 1 and 0 73 107 viruses ml 1 respectively xie et al 2021 similarly the average viral production in estuarine ecosystems 1 55 106 viruses ml 1 h 1 was found to be higher than that in global oceans 0 99 106 viruses ml 1 h 1 xie et al 2021 microbial mortality caused by viral infection is mainly controlled by the contact rate between viruses and hosts i e their density and their activity the high viral population size and viral activity in estuaries suggest strong modulation of picoplankton and eventually an important effect on ecosystem function our field observations in four chinese estuaries and previous studies in the temperate chesapeake bay winget et al 2011 and tropical cochin estuary jasna et al 2019 revealed that viral abundance and production in estuarine ecosystems were generally characterized by significant seasonal variations with higher values being observed in summer the higher viral abundance viral production and dissolved organic matter released by viruses indicate a higher flux of nutrients through the viral shunt and the greater role of viruses as drivers in the biogeochemical cycling of estuarine ecosystems in the warm season than in the cold season in contrast despite the lower viral abundance and production the higher percentages of cells lysed by viruses in cold waters than in warm waters suggest that viruses play a relatively larger role as regulators in structuring the whole estuarine microbial community in winter when grazing pressure declines these findings are consistent with those of other environments with low grazer abundance which results in viral lysis becoming a leading factor governing microbial mortality danovaro et al 2008 latitudinal trends in species number and diversity have captivated biologists for decades and are a key focus of ecological research an increase in the population number from the poles toward the equator has become a widely recognized pattern for a wide range of terrestrial and marine macro organisms mittelbach et al 2007 willig et al 2003 however current knowledge regarding the global trends in the number and diversity of marine picoplankton particularly virioplankton remains highly limited and uncertain the latitudinal diversity gradient of marine viruses was only recently described in two studies based on the tara oceans global expedition gregory et al 2019 ibarbalz et al 2019 in the present study we show a mid latitude maximum of virus population size and an equatorward increase in viral production and virus mediated microbial mortality in global estuarine ecosystems providing important information for a better understanding of global viral ecology at any spatiotemporal point in the environment viral population size reflects the balance between the replenishment production of viruses through host lysis and losses through viral decay both viral production and decay increase with temperature across global estuaries thus there may be temperature dependent trade offs between virus production and decay that lead to the mid latitude peak in virus population size global patterns in estuarine viral ecological dynamics demonstrated that warm tropical ecoregions showed higher viral production and viral impacts on the prokaryotic community than temperate and cold ecoregions figs 4 s4 the observed latitudinal variations in estuarine viral ecology could result from variability in host and viral assemblage compositions which are mainly driven by spatiotemporal variations in environmental parameters in our study we found that temperature is of crucial importance in explaining viral ecological dynamics on both local and global scales a significant negative correlation between latitude and viral production was detected in chinese estuaries during winter but not in summer this was likely because of the greater temperature differences that occurred in winter up to 18 5 c than in summer 5 1 c globally the nearly equally strong correlations of viral production with absolute latitude and temperature fig 4 reflect the latitudinal gradient in viral production as a result of latitudinal differences in temperature this global scale relationship between viral production and temperature agrees with the findings at smaller scales including those from chinese estuaries in this study and from other studies jasna et al 2019 winget et al 2011 it is assumed that more viruses are produced when conditions favor the host growth mojica and brussaard 2014 warm water favors the growth of hosts and thereby supports the higher productivity of viruses additionally increasing viral production and thus increasing prokaryotic cell lysis will release cellular components that are known to significantly contribute to viral decay mojica and brussaard 2014 nucleases proteases high molecular weight organic compounds and cell debris will be released into environments causing increased removal of viral particles in addition the activity of enzymes was found to increase with temperature which might enhance the viral decay noble and fuhrman 1997 wei et al 2018 wommack and colwell 2000 given the anticipated increase in ocean temperature and the tropicalization of temperate ecosystems because of global warming overall viral production and decay are expected to increase in high latitude regions this may have important consequences for the regulation of microbial populations and subsequent ecological processes salinity has been described as another important environmental regulator for viral ecology this is because salt concentrations influence both prokaryotic community composition and eukaryotic grazing pressure on prokaryotes which influence prokaryotic abundance and in turn virus infection junger et al 2018 in chinese estuarine ecosystems higher viral abundance was observed in the polyhaline zone possibly because of the higher metabolic activity and production of hosts in such saline conditions almeida et al 2001 li et al 2019 our cross transplant study revealed that the productions of riverine and marine viruses were both inhibited when transferring into brackish water with stronger inhibition being observed for riverine viruses wei et al 2019 this may partially explain the relatively lower viral production that was observed in mesohaline than in polyhaline zones because mesohaline zones are freshwater dominated and polyhaline zones are seawater rich according to the kill the winner theory bacteria lysed by viruses are the winners of the competition for resources in an ecosystem thingstad 2000 thingstad and lignell 1997 viruses can suppress blooms of certain microorganisms through this top down effect and provide nutrients and living space to other microorganisms in the pearl river estuary viruses were found to reduce host abundance and productivity while stimulating bacterial diversity and altering bacterial community structure to maintain a relatively stable microbial ecosystem under different trophic levels zhang et al 2007 virus induced lysis releases labile organic matter into the environment which could support the growth of non infected bacteria fuhrman 1999 weinbauer 2004 in estuarine ecosystems organic carbon released because of viral lysis comprises less than 1 of the total organic carbon although this percentage is not high viral lysis products are mostly labile and easily utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 therefore a significant portion of heterotrophic bacterial activity production and respiration is directly or indirectly supported by viral lysis for example viral lysis sustained almost 84 of bacterial production in the global estuarine systems table s2 this is the bottom up ecological effect of viruses on bacterial activity which subsequently impacts the population size diversity and community composition of bacterioplankton in estuaries in addition viral lysis diverts cell biomass into the dissolved organic matter pool and away from higher trophic levels in a process known as viral shunt which directly and indirectly affects microbial community diversity and ecosystem production proctor and fuhrman 1990 suttle 2005 wommack and colwell 2000 winget et al hypothesized that the fate of organic matter shunted by viruses including direction quantity and quality would affect the efficiency of the estuarine biological pump and in turn the environmental conditions of the estuary such as the hypoxia winget et al 2011 therefore additional studies are needed to elucidate the role of viruses in the formation of hypoxic zones in estuarine ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in ecological dynamics and the quantitative importance of estuarine viruses on both local and global scales providing important information for a better understanding of estuarine viral ecology globally latitudinal patterns of viral population size and production were observed which may be mainly driven by spatiotemporal variation in temperature however this does not exclude the possible impact of estuary specific parameters such as freshwater discharge sediment load and turbidity on viral ecology in addition it is expected that viral ecological dynamics will be coupled with their microbial hosts as shown in our previous bacterial and viral community composition investigation in pre li et al 2021 detailed studies with higher spatial and temporal sampling resolution as well as more complete biotic and abiotic environmental parameters are needed to understand the mechanisms shaping estuarine viral ecology on the local scale nevertheless our data showed that the average viral population size and activity in global estuaries were higher than those in coastal waters and open oceans suggesting strong viral modulation of picoplankton and dissolved organic matter cycling in estuarine ecosystems viral lysis was responsible for the loss of an average of 66 of the bacterioplankton standing stock and contributed directly to the organic carbon pool that can support on average 84 of bacterial production each day in global estuaries the results suggest that the investigation of ecological parameters influencing estuarine ecosystems would not be complete without consideration of the control of microorganisms by viruses incorporating both top down and bottom up effects of viruses on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton into ecological models and quantifying the role of viruses in organic matter cycling would facilitate our understanding of estuarine ecosystems and

15344,estuaries are important ecosystems providing irreplaceable services for humankind and in turn are extensively influenced by human activities and climate changes microbial processes which are largely controlled by viruses are always responsible for the ecological function and environmental problems in estuaries however we know little about the ecology and importance of viruses in estuarine systems here we investigated viral ecological dynamics in estuarine systems on local four largest estuaries in china in different seasons and global scales viral production varied by almost 20 fold in chinese estuaries with significant seasonality being responsible for the removal of 1 41 21 45 of the bacterioplankton standing stock each day and contributed directly to the organic carbon pool by releasing an average of 3 57 µg of cellular carbon per liter per day by compiling data from 21 estuaries across the world we found for the first time that viral population size peaked at mid latitude and viral production increased towards the equator in estuarine ecosystems the results indicated the higher viral impact on microbial mortality and dissolved organic matter cycling in tropical estuaries our field investigation and global synthesized analysis provide compelling evidence of spatiotemporal variations in estuarine viral dynamics the global view of viral impacts on estuarine microbial mortality offers important insight for incorporating viruses into ecological models and understanding the environmental implications of the tropicalization of temperate aquatic ecosystems under a scenario of climate warming graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords virioplankton viral activity organic matter pool estuary global patterns data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuaries are the most productive natural habitats and important sites for human populations and activities elliott and whitfield 2011 the ecological productivity function and service of estuaries significantly impact the world s commerce and development however most of the estuaries are facing increasingly impacts by human activities and climate changes leading to serious environmental problems such as eutrophication harmful alga bloom hypoxia and anoxia howarth et al 2011 pinckney et al 2001 many of these problems are strongly linked with ecological processes mediated by microorganisms chen et al 2021 zanaroli et al 2015 changes in microbial activity can cascade the cycling of materials through the entire marine food web and affect ecosystem function in estuaries viruses the most abundant and possibly the most enigmatic biological entities on earth are responsible for nearly half of global microbial mortality breitbart et al 2018 dion et al 2020 suttle 2005 2007 in addition to causing microbial death viruses play substantial roles in microbial regulation and biogeochemical cycling by metabolically reprogramming their hosts and short circuiting the flow of organic matter through viral infection and cell lysis suttle 2007 the ecological dynamics of viruses which constantly fluctuate temporally and spatially determine the degree to which viruses control microbial communities and influence ecosystem function despite their ecological significance the dynamics of viral assemblages in estuarine ecosystems are poorly understood especially on a global scale the estuaries along the coast of china cover a region from 5 to 55 n latitude ranging from tropical to cold temperate climate zones about 5 10 of global freshwater runoff and 15 20 of global continental sediments are delivered to the ocean through chinese estuaries zhang 2002 over the past 50 years most chinese estuaries have been receiving increased amounts of nutrients from river networks because of population expansion and urbanization this has been coupled with concomitant issues such as estuarine eutrophication and the development of hypoxic zones which have both regional and global impacts on marine biogeochemistry he et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however little is currently known about the ecological dynamics and the quantitative importance of viruses across chinese estuarine systems therefore in this study we firstly focused on the four largest and most anthropogenically influenced estuarine systems in china specifically we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of viruses and picoplankton determined the covariance between viral and microbial communities and quantified the impacts of viral lysis on microbial communities and organic matter cycling we then conducted a synthesis of 643 experimental observations from 21 estuaries across the world to explore the ecology of viruses in global estuarine ecosystems together the investigation is important for understanding the role of viruses as ecological mediators in the control of estuarine microorganisms and ecosystem function under changing conditions including local spatiotemporal dynamics and global climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling area field studies were conducted at four major estuaries along the coast of china fig 1 these estuaries were characterized by different physicochemical gradients such as turbidity freshwater discharge and sediment load the yangtze river changjiang is the longest river in asia and ranks globally as the fourth and fifth largest river in terms of water and sediment discharge accordingly it plays a major role in the flux of terrestrial materials from the chinese mainland to the western pacific ocean wang et al 2008 the yangtze river and qiantang river which are two major rivers in the yangtze delta flow into the east china sea and have an associated load of 4 86 108 and 6 59 106 tons respectively yang et al 2012 the pearl river zhujiang is the second largest in china in terms of freshwater discharge 3338 108 m3 yr this is less than the yangtze river 9513 108 m3 yr and five times more than that of the yellow river huanghe 661 108 m3 yr tao et al 2020 the yellow river is known for having high levels of suspended sediment wang et al 2015 indeed as the largest turbid river in the world the yellow river has twice the sediment discharge carried by only 6 of the yangtze river s water discharge shen et al 2010 2 2 field sampling surface waters in the mesohaline salinity ca 10 and polyhaline salinity ca 25 zones of four estuaries were sampled in winter january 2016 and summer september 2016 fig 1 water temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ using a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter ysi incorporated usa approximately 5 liters of surface water were collected from each site into acid cleaned and in situ water rinsed polycarbonate bottles water samples were pre filtered through 20 µm mesh to remove large particles and zooplankton incubation experiments for viral production and viral decay determination were set up immediately fig s1 for microbial enumeration triplicate 2 ml samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 0 5 at 4 c for 15 min after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen the samples were stored at 80 c until analysis 2 3 microbial enumeration viral and prokaryotic abundances were determined by flow cytometry fcm using the method described by bruaassrd brussaard 2004 briefly the fixed frozen samples were thawed at room temperature and stained with sybr green i invitrogen the stained particles were then enumerated using a flow cytometer epics altra ii beckman coulter usa at event rates of 50 200 particles s bacteria or 100 300 particles s virus fluorescent beads molecular probes with a diameter of 1 µm were added as internal standard the autotrophic picoplankton picoeukaryotes synechococcus and prochlorococcus were enumerated directly without staining and distinguished based on their positions in the cytometric plots jiao et al 2014 the analyses of microbial abundance by fcm for each sample were repeated twice data were analyzed using the expotm32 multicomp software beckman coulter usa 2 4 viral production the dilution method was used for the direct measurement of viral production fig s1 weinbauer et al 2010 this method relies on the dilution of virus infected prokaryotes with virus free water which minimizes the influence of new viral infections and the impact of protozoa grazing on prokaryotes the increase in virus number during incubation was measured and used to calculate viral production briefly approximately 600 ml of water were filtered using tangential flow filtration tff with a 0 22 µm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride cartridge millipore usa to generate a 50 ml bacterial concentrate and ca 500 ml of filtrate virus free water was further obtained using a tff 30 kda polysulfone cartridge millipore from the 0 22 µm filtrate cai et al 2015 the 50 ml bacterial concentrate was promptly mixed with 250 ml of 30 kda filtered virus free water and then aliquoted into three replicates 50 ml each the 50 ml subsamples were subsequently incubated at in situ temperature in dry bath incubators mk 20 hangzhou allsheng china under dark conditions li et al 2014 triplicate 1 ml subsamples were collected for bacterial and viral counts every 3 h for 15 h incubation which can minimize the possible occurrence of bacterial growth and new viral infections weinbauer et al 2010 bacterial and viral counts were conducted by fcm as described above viral production was calculated using the online program vipcal luef et al 2009 http www univie ac at nuhag php vipcal for triplicate incubations virus turnover rates were determined by dividing the viral abundance by the viral production 2 5 viral decay the viral decay rate was measured based on the size fractionation approach described by noble and fuhrman fig s1 noble and fuhrman 1997 water samples were filtered by tff with a 0 22 µm pore size cartridge to generate virus containing filtrate with most bacteria being removed triplicate 50 ml samples of the filtrate were then incubated at in situ temperature in dry bath incubators mk 20 hangzhou allsheng china under dark conditions li et al 2014 triplicate 1 ml subsamples were taken every 3 h during the 15 h incubation for viral enumeration viral decay was calculated as the slope of the linear regression fitted to the natural logarithm of the viral abundance plotted versus time viral decay was not investigated in qiantang estuary during winter due to equipment limitations 2 6 virus mediated prokaryotic mortality and cellular contents released by viral lysis the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality was calculated by dividing the viral production by burst size the number of viral particles released from each cell upon lysis of 50 wilhelm et al 2002 winget et al 2011 the percentage of bacteria lysed was estimated by dividing the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality by the prokaryotic abundance the amount of carbon released by viral lysis was estimated by multiplying the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality by the average bacterial cell carbon content 20 fg c cell 1 lee and fuhrman 1987 the amount of nitrogen released by viral lysis was estimated by multiplying the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality by the average bacterial cell nitrogen content 5 fg n cell 1 lee and fuhrman 1987 2 7 public data collection we aggregated peer reviewed studies measuring viral dynamics including viral abundance viral production viral decay and viral impacts on the prokaryotic community i e the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality percentages of prokaryotes lysed by viruses and bacterial production supported by viral lysate in estuarine environments this aggregation was finalized in may of 2022 the original data were retrieved from the papers or acquired from the corresponding authors the virus mediated prokaryotic mortality was calculated by dividing the viral production by burst sizes given in the study for studies that did not investigate burst size the commonly accepted burst size of 50 was used the percentage of bacterial production supported by viral lysis was calculated by dividing the amount of carbon released by viral lysis by the bacterial production assuming 20 fg of c needed per cell and multiplied by 100 estuaries are typically divided into four salinity zones oligohaline 0 5 4 9 mesohaline 5 0 17 9 polyhaline 18 0 29 9 and euryhaline 30 0 35 9 only data from water with salinity levels ranging from 0 5 to 35 9 were used for analysis in this study since there could be variations in samples from different depths we only included samples within the top 10 m of the water column to avoid possible biases finally the dataset covered 21 estuaries and contained a total of 643 data points of which 415 were for viral abundance 155 for viral production 41 for viral decay and 32 for virus mediated bacterial mortality associated information regarding the sampling sites such as latitude longitude sampling depth sampling date prokaryotic abundance prokaryotic production temperature salinity and chlorophyll a level was also collected when available 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r v4 1 2 r development core team data were reported as the mean the standard error of the mean paired t tests were used to test differences in the values of measured environmental and microbial variables between chinese estuaries because virus mediated prokaryotic mortality and carbon nitrogen released by viral lysis were calculated from viral production in chinese estuaries the statistical results of these parameters were identical to those of viral production correlations between environmental and microbial parameters were performed using spearman s rank correlations a p value of 0 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance multiple linear regression was used to identify correlations between viral dynamics and environmental variables 3 results 3 1 microbial abundances in chinese and global estuaries surface waters within different salinity regions mesohaline and polyhaline zones were collected from four chinese estuaries during winter and summer fig 1 table s1 during the sampling period the water temperature ranged from 0 1 c to 18 4 c in winter and 24 6 c to 29 7 c in summer the ph values ranged from 7 44 to 8 60 with higher values being observed during summer p 0 05 and in polyhaline zones p 0 05 the dissolved oxygen varied from 4 24 to 12 52 mg l with significantly higher values being observed in winter p 0 05 viral abundance among the four estuaries varied by nearly 34 fold from 7 14 105 to 2 45 107 viruses ml 1 and prokaryotic abundance varied by about 8 fold from 6 30 105 to 4 82 106 cells ml 1 fig 2 a and b table s1 indicating the spatial temporal variations of microbes in the estuarine areas the viral and prokaryotic abundances reflected the expected seasonal differences with significantly higher abundances observed in summer fig 2 additionally viral and prokaryotic abundances were positively correlated with temperature p 0 01 fig s2 viral abundance showed significantly higher values in polyhaline zones than in mesohaline zones p 0 05 while no significant differences p 0 05 were observed in prokaryotic abundance between regions with different salinities fig 2 the virus to prokaryote ratio vpr varied from 0 92 to 11 63 with significantly higher values detected in winter p 0 05 fig 2c the vpr values observed in chinese estuaries were comparable with previously published values for other estuarine waters table s2 the abundances of autotrophic picoplankton synechococcus prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes were higher in summer p 0 05 while there were no significant differences between regions with different salinities table s1 fig s2 the significant positive relationship found between viral and prokaryotic abundance p 0 01 in the four investigated estuaries confirmed the common notion that viral abundance is strongly dependent on prokaryote hosts the significant positive correlation between viral abundance and the abundance of picoeukaryotes p 0 01 indicated that autotrophs were also important host communities for estuarine viruses we collected publicly available data from 21 estuaries worldwide spanning four continents fig 3 table s2 viral abundance ranged from 7 14 105 viruses ml 1 to 5 90 108 viruses ml 1 across global estuarine environments with the lowest average viral abundance occurring in a cold estuary yenisei river estuary and the highest in a temperate estuary chesapeake bay fig 4 a significant differences were found among climate regions cold temperate subtropical and tropical zones fig 4b there was also an expected significant positive linear correlation observed between viral abundance and prokaryotic abundance with an average vpr of 15 74 supporting the tight coupling of the biogeographical distribution of viruses and that of prokaryotes fig 4c specifically we found that estuarine viral abundance peaked at an intermediate latitude around 40 n fig 4d 3 2 lytic viral production and viral decay in chinese and global estuaries the average viral production in four large chinese estuaries was 3 72 0 57 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 with a range of 0 41 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the mesohaline zone of the yellow river estuary in winter to 7 85 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the polyhaline zone of the pearl river estuary in summer fig 2d table s1 viral production values in chinese estuarine systems were within the range and generally at the lower end of previously detected values fig 4a the seasonal and spatial variations in viral production were significant with higher viral production detected in summer p 0 01 and polyhaline zones p 0 01 fig 2d meanwhile viral production showed a latitudinal trend decreasing from the low latitude pearl river estuary to the high latitude yellow river estuary with a clearer pattern in winter table s1 viral production was significantly positively related to viral abundance prokaryotic abundance the abundances of prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes and temperature p 0 01 fig s2 based on virus standing stock and viral production the virus turnover rate ranged from 1 64 to 9 00 h 1 total average 4 73 0 52 h 1 fig 2e corresponding to the viral turnover time of 0 46 to 2 55 days total average 1 10 0 15 days on the global scale viral production varied by as much as five orders of magnitudes in estuarine ecosystems with the lowest value of 8 50 102 viruses ml 1 h 1 observed in the cold yenisei river estuary kopylov et al 2019 and the highest value of 1 04 107 viruses ml 1 h 1 reported in the subtropical chesapeake bay winget et al 2011 the wide range of viral production indicated the great dynamics of viral activity within estuarine ecosystems significant differences in viral production were found among different climate regions fig 4b unlike viral population size which showed a peak at mid latitude we found a linear decrease in viral production with an increase in absolute latitude r2 0 54 fig 4e globally estuarine viral production was positively correlated with temperature r2 0 50 fig 4f the average viral decay in four large chinese estuaries was 1 43 0 41 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 ranging from 0 26 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the mesohaline zone of the yellow river estuary in winter to 5 86 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 at the polyhaline zone of the yangtze river estuary in summer fig 2f table s1 although slightly higher viral decay values were generally recorded in subtropical estuaries than in temperate estuaries yellow river estuary no significant differences were observed among estuaries similar to viral production viral decay in chinese estuaries was higher in summer p 0 001 and in higher salinity zones p 0 01 fig 2f viral decay correlated significantly with viral abundance prokaryotic abundance the abundances of prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes viral production and temperature fig s2 to date viral decay has only been investigated in a few estuaries globally with a range of 2 55 104 viruses ml 1 h 1 to 6 19 105 viruses ml 1 h 1 table s2 3 3 impacts of viral lysis on prokaryotic community in chinese and global estuaries based on the widely used burst size of 50 wilhelm et al 2002 winget et al 2011 the estimated virus mediated mortality of prokaryotes ranged from 1 98 104 cells ml 1 d 1 to 3 77 105 cells ml 1 d 1 in chinese estuarine ecosystems fig 2g viral lysis was responsible for the loss of an average of 10 03 1 57 of the bacterial standing stock per day ranging from 1 41 at the polyhaline zone of the yellow river estuary in summer to 21 45 at the polyhaline zone of the qiantang river estuary in winter fig 2h with mean cellular biomass of 20 fg c cell 1 and 5 fg n cell 1 for prokaryotic assemblages in the aquatic systems lee and fuhrman 1987 the carbon and nitrogen released by viral lysis in the studied estuaries ranged from 0 40 to 7 53 µg c l 1 d 1 average 3 57 0 55 µg c l 1 d 1 and 0 10 to 1 88 µg n l 1 d 1 average 0 89 0 14 µg n l 1 d 1 respectively the spatial and seasonal changes in viral production resulted in cascading effects on prokaryote mortality and the cycling of dissolved organic matter fig 2g and i virus mediated mortality of prokaryotes and the carbon nitrogen released by viral lysis of prokaryotes displayed significant salinity related differences with values in polyhaline zones being double those in mesohaline zones although significantly lower virus mediated mortality of prokaryotic cells was observed in winter p 0 05 the percentage of cells lysed by viruses in winter was almost double that in summer because of the lower number of bacteria standing stock in winter fig 2h in global estuaries the estimated virus mediated mortality of prokaryotes ranged from 3 40 104 cells ml 1 d 1 in the cold yenisei river estuary to 7 97 106 cells ml 1 d 1 in the tropical cochin estuary average 9 82 1 19 105 cells ml 1 d 1 resulting in the carbon released by viral lysis ranging from 0 07 to 148 29 µg c l 1 d 1 average 23 18 2 99 µg c l 1 d 1 significant first order linear regression was observed between virus mediated mortality and absolute latitude r2 0 46 p 0 001 n 134 as well as between virus mediated mortality and temperature r2 0 36 p 0 001 n 66 fig s3 viral lysis was responsible for the loss of an average of 65 73 9 84 of bacterial standing stock per day with values in tropical zone significantly higher than those in other climate zones table s2 fig s4 globally the average percentage of prokaryotic production supported by viral lysis was 83 77 13 62 table s2 4 discussion only a few studies have examined seasonal viral ecological dynamics in estuarine systems and none have compared the patterns in viral dynamics and viral impacts on hosts across estuaries to our knowledge this is the first field investigation of cross estuary spatiotemporal viral ecology we investigated four large chinese estuaries during two seasons using a consistent methodology additionally we synthesized viral parameters from 21 estuaries around the world for the first time which provided a comprehensive insight into the ecology of estuarine viruses on a global scale compilation of the global data revealed that the average viral abundance in estuarine ecosystems 5 96 107 viruses ml 1 is higher than that in coastal waters and surface open oceans 3 61 107 viruses ml 1 and 0 73 107 viruses ml 1 respectively xie et al 2021 similarly the average viral production in estuarine ecosystems 1 55 106 viruses ml 1 h 1 was found to be higher than that in global oceans 0 99 106 viruses ml 1 h 1 xie et al 2021 microbial mortality caused by viral infection is mainly controlled by the contact rate between viruses and hosts i e their density and their activity the high viral population size and viral activity in estuaries suggest strong modulation of picoplankton and eventually an important effect on ecosystem function our field observations in four chinese estuaries and previous studies in the temperate chesapeake bay winget et al 2011 and tropical cochin estuary jasna et al 2019 revealed that viral abundance and production in estuarine ecosystems were generally characterized by significant seasonal variations with higher values being observed in summer the higher viral abundance viral production and dissolved organic matter released by viruses indicate a higher flux of nutrients through the viral shunt and the greater role of viruses as drivers in the biogeochemical cycling of estuarine ecosystems in the warm season than in the cold season in contrast despite the lower viral abundance and production the higher percentages of cells lysed by viruses in cold waters than in warm waters suggest that viruses play a relatively larger role as regulators in structuring the whole estuarine microbial community in winter when grazing pressure declines these findings are consistent with those of other environments with low grazer abundance which results in viral lysis becoming a leading factor governing microbial mortality danovaro et al 2008 latitudinal trends in species number and diversity have captivated biologists for decades and are a key focus of ecological research an increase in the population number from the poles toward the equator has become a widely recognized pattern for a wide range of terrestrial and marine macro organisms mittelbach et al 2007 willig et al 2003 however current knowledge regarding the global trends in the number and diversity of marine picoplankton particularly virioplankton remains highly limited and uncertain the latitudinal diversity gradient of marine viruses was only recently described in two studies based on the tara oceans global expedition gregory et al 2019 ibarbalz et al 2019 in the present study we show a mid latitude maximum of virus population size and an equatorward increase in viral production and virus mediated microbial mortality in global estuarine ecosystems providing important information for a better understanding of global viral ecology at any spatiotemporal point in the environment viral population size reflects the balance between the replenishment production of viruses through host lysis and losses through viral decay both viral production and decay increase with temperature across global estuaries thus there may be temperature dependent trade offs between virus production and decay that lead to the mid latitude peak in virus population size global patterns in estuarine viral ecological dynamics demonstrated that warm tropical ecoregions showed higher viral production and viral impacts on the prokaryotic community than temperate and cold ecoregions figs 4 s4 the observed latitudinal variations in estuarine viral ecology could result from variability in host and viral assemblage compositions which are mainly driven by spatiotemporal variations in environmental parameters in our study we found that temperature is of crucial importance in explaining viral ecological dynamics on both local and global scales a significant negative correlation between latitude and viral production was detected in chinese estuaries during winter but not in summer this was likely because of the greater temperature differences that occurred in winter up to 18 5 c than in summer 5 1 c globally the nearly equally strong correlations of viral production with absolute latitude and temperature fig 4 reflect the latitudinal gradient in viral production as a result of latitudinal differences in temperature this global scale relationship between viral production and temperature agrees with the findings at smaller scales including those from chinese estuaries in this study and from other studies jasna et al 2019 winget et al 2011 it is assumed that more viruses are produced when conditions favor the host growth mojica and brussaard 2014 warm water favors the growth of hosts and thereby supports the higher productivity of viruses additionally increasing viral production and thus increasing prokaryotic cell lysis will release cellular components that are known to significantly contribute to viral decay mojica and brussaard 2014 nucleases proteases high molecular weight organic compounds and cell debris will be released into environments causing increased removal of viral particles in addition the activity of enzymes was found to increase with temperature which might enhance the viral decay noble and fuhrman 1997 wei et al 2018 wommack and colwell 2000 given the anticipated increase in ocean temperature and the tropicalization of temperate ecosystems because of global warming overall viral production and decay are expected to increase in high latitude regions this may have important consequences for the regulation of microbial populations and subsequent ecological processes salinity has been described as another important environmental regulator for viral ecology this is because salt concentrations influence both prokaryotic community composition and eukaryotic grazing pressure on prokaryotes which influence prokaryotic abundance and in turn virus infection junger et al 2018 in chinese estuarine ecosystems higher viral abundance was observed in the polyhaline zone possibly because of the higher metabolic activity and production of hosts in such saline conditions almeida et al 2001 li et al 2019 our cross transplant study revealed that the productions of riverine and marine viruses were both inhibited when transferring into brackish water with stronger inhibition being observed for riverine viruses wei et al 2019 this may partially explain the relatively lower viral production that was observed in mesohaline than in polyhaline zones because mesohaline zones are freshwater dominated and polyhaline zones are seawater rich according to the kill the winner theory bacteria lysed by viruses are the winners of the competition for resources in an ecosystem thingstad 2000 thingstad and lignell 1997 viruses can suppress blooms of certain microorganisms through this top down effect and provide nutrients and living space to other microorganisms in the pearl river estuary viruses were found to reduce host abundance and productivity while stimulating bacterial diversity and altering bacterial community structure to maintain a relatively stable microbial ecosystem under different trophic levels zhang et al 2007 virus induced lysis releases labile organic matter into the environment which could support the growth of non infected bacteria fuhrman 1999 weinbauer 2004 in estuarine ecosystems organic carbon released because of viral lysis comprises less than 1 of the total organic carbon although this percentage is not high viral lysis products are mostly labile and easily utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 therefore a significant portion of heterotrophic bacterial activity production and respiration is directly or indirectly supported by viral lysis for example viral lysis sustained almost 84 of bacterial production in the global estuarine systems table s2 this is the bottom up ecological effect of viruses on bacterial activity which subsequently impacts the population size diversity and community composition of bacterioplankton in estuaries in addition viral lysis diverts cell biomass into the dissolved organic matter pool and away from higher trophic levels in a process known as viral shunt which directly and indirectly affects microbial community diversity and ecosystem production proctor and fuhrman 1990 suttle 2005 wommack and colwell 2000 winget et al hypothesized that the fate of organic matter shunted by viruses including direction quantity and quality would affect the efficiency of the estuarine biological pump and in turn the environmental conditions of the estuary such as the hypoxia winget et al 2011 therefore additional studies are needed to elucidate the role of viruses in the formation of hypoxic zones in estuarine ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in ecological dynamics and the quantitative importance of estuarine viruses on both local and global scales providing important information for a better understanding of estuarine viral ecology globally latitudinal patterns of viral population size and production were observed which may be mainly driven by spatiotemporal variation in temperature however this does not exclude the possible impact of estuary specific parameters such as freshwater discharge sediment load and turbidity on viral ecology in addition it is expected that viral ecological dynamics will be coupled with their microbial hosts as shown in our previous bacterial and viral community composition investigation in pre li et al 2021 detailed studies with higher spatial and temporal sampling resolution as well as more complete biotic and abiotic environmental parameters are needed to understand the mechanisms shaping estuarine viral ecology on the local scale nevertheless our data showed that the average viral population size and activity in global estuaries were higher than those in coastal waters and open oceans suggesting strong viral modulation of picoplankton and dissolved organic matter cycling in estuarine ecosystems viral lysis was responsible for the loss of an average of 66 of the bacterioplankton standing stock and contributed directly to the organic carbon pool that can support on average 84 of bacterial production each day in global estuaries the results suggest that the investigation of ecological parameters influencing estuarine ecosystems would not be complete without consideration of the control of microorganisms by viruses incorporating both top down and bottom up effects of viruses on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton into ecological models and quantifying the role of viruses in organic matter cycling would facilitate our understanding of estuarine ecosystems and
