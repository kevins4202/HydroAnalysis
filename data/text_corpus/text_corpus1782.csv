8910,cropping pattern determines the agricultural water use requirement and efficiency as well as economic benefits of crop production agricultural water resources include blue water irrigation water and green water soil moisture from precipitation which have different shadow prices the virtual water vw flow embedded in the interregional food trade causes burden shifts of water resources pressures in space however these intertwined economic and social effects have been neglected in regional cropping structure management using the case of the yellow river basin in china here we propose a two stage multi objective cropping pattern optimization scheme to maximize crop economic output while minimize blue water scarcities the first stage and considered the criteria of maximum economic benefits of the interprovincial crop related vw flows based on the shadow prices of crop green and blue water use the second stage results show considerable differences in shadow prices of crop water use by colures crops and location with the optimized cropping pattern which appropriately expands the planting scale of vegetables with higher water shadow price and comparative advantage and reduces the crop planting with lower water shadow price and intensive blue water consumption e g soybean and wheat blue water scarcity can be alleviated by 20 combined with a 5 increase in crop economic output and up to 3 800 million usd higher benefits of vw flows the premise to achieve above goals is to improve crop water resources utilization efficiency and break down the barriers of dietary preferences and trade policy keywords multi objective optimization crop production shadow price virtual water flow water footprint data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture accounts for 92 of the global freshwater consumption and is expected to continue to grow in the future hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the competitive use of water resources in agriculture and other sectors has intensified water scarcity in many places around the world factors such as population growth urbanization diet changes and climate changes have exacerbated water pressures in certain water scarce regions mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 rodell et al 2018 tove a larsen et al 2016 tuninetti et al 2022 vörösmarty et al 2000 due to the spatial heterogeneity of crop water productivity regional cropping pattern should be optimized and water resource management across sectors should be coordinated to alleviate regional water pressures chouchane et al 2020 cropping pattern optimization should comprehensively consider the pressure of water resources food production and economic benefits yao et al 2020 ren et al 2021 moreover with increased interregional crop trade and logistics the optimization of cropping patterns could alleviate local physical water scarcities and change the virtual water vw flow patterns embedded in crop trades across the regional boundaries to bring social and economic benefits ye et al 2018 to quantify the benefits of vw flow it is vital to assess the economic value of water used to produce the traded crops which can be measured by the shadow price of crop water use bierkens et al 2019 the crop water shadow price indicates the marginal benefits obtained by using an additional cubic meter of water for crop production and reflects the scarcity of resources angulo et al 2014 liu et al 2009 quantifying the specific value of the crop water shadow price is conducive to a more rational allocation of agricultural water resources and alleviate local water shortage novo et al 2009 grammatikopoulou et al 2020 numerous studies have investigated regional cropping pattern optimization with increasingly comprehensive optimization objectives and diverse methods in terms of optimization objectives maximum crop production or crop economic benefits and minimum irrigation water consumption are traditional objectives e g davis et al 2017 márquez et al 2011 morankar et al 2013 osama et al 2017 varade and patel 2019 with improvements in knowledges of integrations between crop production water resources and human societal sustainability more factors related to environment and society have been incorporated in the cropping pattern optimization program for instance environmental factors such as crop water

and green water consumed during crop growth period hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 therefore the minimizing crop water footprint has been placed in the cropping pattern optimization targets balezentis et al 2020 chouchane et al 2020 liu et al 2022 liu et al 2021b sedghamiz et al 2018 wang et al 2021 wen and chen 2023 chouchane et al 2020 and liu et al 2021b carried out a global and chinese crop redistribution scheme with minimal blue water scarcity and minimum blue water footprint as one of the optimization objectives respectively some studies took the maximum proportion of crop green water footprint as objective liu et al 2022 sedghamiz et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 in terms of methods table 1 existing methods include linear programming balezentis et al 2020 wang et al 2022 xie et al 2023 fuzzy programming morankar et al 2013 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 two layer optimization liu et al 2022 however these algorithms have drawbacks such as computational complexity and strong subjectivity in the process of solving the optimal solution sedghamiz et al 2018 recently evolutionary algorithms have received widespread attention such as genetic algorithm deb et al 2002 ant colony algorithm shaikh et al 2015 and particle swarm algorithm jain et al 2021 the second generation genetic algorithm nsga ii with the advantages of fast non dominated sorting process elite strategy non parameter and effective constraint processing methods has been widely applied in research cases of multi objective cropping pattern optimization ma et al 2022 márquez et al 2011 sedghamiz et al 2018 zhang et al 2023 however even though it has been acknowledged that the interregional vw flow is an indispensable part of the hydrological cycle under the influence of human activities in the context of open economy and society d odorico et al 2019 the existing scheme of regional cropping pattern optimization still focuses on local impacts from producer aspects largely ignoring remote economic and environmental impacts driven by traders and consumers table 1 another visible defect is that most of the current optimization schemes focus on environmental and economic impacts and the social aspects are largely ignored several studies have shown that vw flows bring benefits in terms of water saving chapagain et al 2006 economic return oki et al 2017 and social equity xin et al 2022 mainly in recipiant regions however other studies have highlighted the negative effects of vw flows on the origin regions which forego their water resources but retain environmental pollutions due to the production excess products for export zhao et al 2015 dalin et al 2017 it is essential to incorporate the benefits and negative effects of vw flows into the cropping pattern optimization framework to ensure the efficiency and fairness of regional agricultural water resources utilization currently the water price of crop production rarely reflects its real economic value and scarcity due to various reasons such as insufficient water rights governmental price protection one of the main methods to evaluate the real value of water is to assess its shadow price i e the marginal value generated by water resources which is related to the optimal allocation of resources the benefit of vw flow is the combination of the shadow price of unit water resource and interregional vw flow which can effectively reflect the equity and benefit i e social impact of water resource redistribution therefore considering the benefits of vw flow in the optimization of cropping pattern helps broaden the scope of current concerns enrolling social impact and involving the new perspective on traders and consumers the current study aims to coordinate multiple trade offs among resources economy and society in regional cropping patterns by proposing a two stage multi objective cropping pattern optimization scheme that incorporates the benefits of crop related vw flows using the yellow river basin yrb china over 2004 2014 as a case study the cropping pattern was optimized at provincial scale considering two goals maximum crop economic output while minimum blue water scarcities the first stage and then the optimal cropping scheme was obtained by considering the maximum benefits of the interprovincial crop related vw flows based on the shadow prices of crop green and blue water use the second stage this study provides two contributions first this is the first analysis to consider the impact of vw flow trade in the cropping pattern optimization which is conducive to formulating optimization strategies from a more comprehensive and systematic perspective second social impacts are considered in the optimization scheme we considered ten crops i e apple cabbage cotton groundnut maize potato rapeseed soybean tomato and wheat that are mainly cultivated in the watershed while other staple crops e g rice in other regions outside the yrb were excluded the optimization objectives were set based on the estimation and evaluation of shadow prices of green and blue water consumed in crop production in time and space by crops in the yrb covering all provinces of shanxi inner mongolia shandong henan sichuan shaanxi gansu qinghai and ningxia finally in order to fully consider the environmental economic and social effects and potential of cropping pattern optimization we selected and compared the optimization results under three typical hydrological years of the yrb dry year 2006 normal year 2010 and wet year 2012 the yrb was selected as a case study for three reasons first the yrb produces 13 of china s food with only 2 of blue water resource in the country yrcc 2013 the mismatch between water and land for crop production led to moderate or severer water scarcity omer et al 2020 ringler et al 2010 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 second the interprovincial crop related vw flows have become intensive in the basin and over 40 of the water used for crop production is currently embedded in traded crops liu et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 zhuo et al 2022 third there are visible spatial heterogeneities in the harvested area and cropping structure among provinces within the yrb fig 1 2 methods and data the cropping pattern in the yrb was optimized by a two stage optimization in the first stage the evolutionary algorithm was used to coordinate the trade offs between natural and economic impacts caused by crop production and a set of optimal solutions was obtained in the second stage the economic effect was considered as criteria to screen the optimal cropping pattern from the optimal solution set the flow chart of this study is shown in fig 2 2 1 two stage optimization of cropping patterns in the yrb the first stage was a nonlinear optimization for two objectives based on the nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 which is an efficient multi objective evolutionary algorithm and has been widely used in the optimization of crop spatial redistribution abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 liu et al 2021b márquez et al 2011 sedghamiz et al 2018 in the multi objective optimization of this study the crop harvested areas were taken as decision variables totaling 180 decision variables i e the harvested area of each crop totaling ten crops in each province totaling nine provinces under irrigated or rain fed conditions is a decision variable additionally the harvested area of all the ten crops and the production of grain crops wheat and maize were the constraints and the cropping structure of the 180 decision variables was optimized for the three hydrological years i e dry year 2006 normal year 2010 and wet year 2012 which were identified by sorting frequency on the recent 30 years of annual precipitation within yrb to measure the optimization potential of different hydrological years the first objective was to minimize the scarcity of blue water of the yrb blue water scarcity bws is defined as the ratio of blue water consumption to blue water availability in the yrb the water consumption of the agricultural sector was determined by the unit blue water footprint of specific crop crop production i e the yield multiplied harvested area of each crop under irrigated environment 1 min bws n 1 3 d n i c a ir i c y ir i c ubwf i c bwa where bws is the overall blue water scarcity degree of the yrb dimensionless d n n 1 2 3 is the water consumption of household industry and environment respectively m 3 i 1 2 9 are the nine provinces in the yrb c 1 2 10 are the ten crops in the yrb a ir i c in ha and y ir i c in t ha are the area and yield of crop c in province i under irrigation respectively u bwf i c is the blue water footprint per unit yield m 3 t bwa is the blue water resources availability in the yrb m 3 the methodology of u bwf i c was used according to zhuo et al 2016 the second objective was the maximum economic output of crops in the yrb that is the product of crop market price and crop production 2 max economic output i c pric e i c p i c where e c o n o m i c o u t p u t is the economic output obtained by selling crops at the local market price usd pric e i c indicates the market price of crop c in province i within the yrb usd t and p i c is crop production of crop c in province i including irrigated and rain fed conditions t we selected crop production rather than crop sales as produced crops have economic value regardless of their subsequent use e g self consumption loss waste seeds storage etc we created constraints from two aspects harvested area and crop production of grain crops wheat maize to solve the above two objective functions 2 1 1 1 constraints on harvested area of each crop for the crop harvested area the total cropping area in the yrb could not exceed that before optimization moreover the rain fed or irrigated area of crops in the basin was allowed to expand but it could not exceed the maximum allowable area expansion coefficient α expressed as the maximum ratio of the irrigated or rain fed area of a crop in specific province after optimization to the area before optimization we here took the value of α as 1 3 following the settings in the previous relevant literature by chouchane et al 2020 we created similar constraints for any crop c 3 i c a rf i c i c a ir i c a ref i c a rf i c α i c a ref rf i c i c a ir i c α i c a ref ir i c c i a rf i c α i a rf ref i c c i a ir i c α i a ir ref i c where a ref is sum of harvested areas of each crop in the yrb before optimization ha a rf i c and a ir i c are rain fed and irrigated areas after optimization for crop c in province i ha and α is the upper threshold of area expansion coefficient which was mainly used to avoid excessive expansion of crop irrigated or rain fed areas and ensure the changes within a reasonable range 2 1 2 2 constraints on production of grain crops given the importance of grain crops wheat maize for food security in the basin this study further limited that the optimized production of wheat and maize could not be lower than the previous figure 4 i p i wheat i p i wheat ref i p i maize i p i maize ref where p i in t is the production of wheat or maize in province i within the yrb which was obtained from the product of crop harvested area and unit yield the second stage was to quantify the social benefits caused by vw flow specifically the maximum benefits of crop related vw flows based on water shadow price was taken as the criteria to screen the optimal solution set i e cropping pattern in the sections 2 2 and 2 3 more details on the methods of quantifying crop water shadow price and benefits of crop related vw flows based on water shadow price would be introduced respectively 2 2 quantification of crop water shadow price the shadow price of water reflects the value of crops that can be produced by a marginal unit of water consumption bierkens et al 2019 for better management water resources are usually divided into blue including surface water and groundwater and green water resources water from rainfall stored in unsaturated soil and utilized by plants falkenmark and rockström 2010 rockström et al 2009 owing to the heterogeneity of provinces in terms of water resources and crop structures the blue and green water shadow price of ten crops in the nine provinces in the yrb were quantified separately which was divided into the following three main steps first the contribution of blue and green water to crop production under irrigated and rain fed conditions was distinguished following zhuo et al 2022 and shang et al 2021 5 p b y ir y rf y ir p ir p g p g ir p rf p g ir p ir p b where p b and p g are the crop production contributed by blue water and green water respectively t y ir and y rf are the crop yield per unit area under irrigated and rain fed conditions respectively t ha p ir and p rf refer to the crop production under irrigated and rain fed conditions respectively t and p g ir is the crop production attributed to green water footprint under irrigated condition t second the cobb douglas production function was used for the regression analysis to obtain the regression coefficient β 0 β 1 the exponential and natural logarithm forms of cobb douglas production function used in this study were as follows 6 p g β 0 a β a x β x gw β gw p b β 1 a β a x β x bw β bw ln p g ln β 0 β a ln a β x ln x β gw ln gw ln p b ln β 1 β a ln a β x ln x β bw ln bw where a is the cropping area ha x is the market input including x 1 x 2 x 3 which are raw material labor force and land input respectively gw and bw are the green and blue water footprint m 3 y β gw and β bw is the regression coefficient for the green and blue water footprint third the blue and green water shadow price of crops was calculated 7 mp green β gw p gw mp blue β bw p bw sp green price mp green sp blue price mp blue where mp blue and mp green are the marginal productivity of blue water and green water respectively t m 3 price is the price corresponding to the crop per unit yield usd t sp blue and sp green are the shadow prices of blue and green water respectively usd m 3 2 3 estimation of associated benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows based on crop water shadow price the associated benefits of crop related inter provincial vw flows of the yrb evw in usd y were quantified according to the weighted water shadow price of crops in the basin after the optimization of cropping pattern which was determined by the product of crop related inter provincial vw flows and crop water shadow prices here we assumed the overall crop trade structure of the yrb remained unchanged before and after the optimization 8 evw c vw c sp c where vw c is the vw flow of crop c m 3 sp c is the weighted water shadow price of specific crop c in the yrb usd m 3 vw c was obtained from the trade volume multiplying crop unit water footprint specifically we first simulated the crop trade relationship among 31 provinces in china and then downscaled the trade volume of the nine provinces within yrb the crop trade volume among 31 provinces within china was quantified by the linear optimization algorithm proposed by dalin et al 2014 which was established on the principles of minimum trade cost and supply demand relationship 9 min cost c i 1 j 1 i 31 j 31 t i j c cost i j c j 1 j 31 t i j c s i c i 1

transporting unit crops from province i to province j usd t s i c is the quantity of crop c used for export producing in province i t y d j c is the total demand for crop c in province j t y after obtaining the trade volume of crops among 31 provinces in china we acquired the trade relations of province complete located in the yrb only ningxia then for provinces partly located in the yrb other eight provinces the trade data were scaled down according to the proportion of the population within the basin and the whole province following zhuo et al 2020 finally we multiplied the trade data by the unit production water footprint of the producing province to obtain the vw flows pattern of ten crops in the nine provinces in the yrb 2 4 data sources the data on population crop yield and harvested area of the nine provinces in the yrb were obtained from the national bureau of statistics cnki 2022 data on rainfall domestic industrial and environmental water were obtained from the water resources bulletin mwrc 2022 and data on material input labor force and land used to calculate the shadow price of crop blue and green water were collected from china agricultural statistical yearbook cnki 2022 the market price of each crop came from the compilation of costs and benefits of agricultural products cnki 2022 the agricultural production data such as the effective irrigation area of crops and the irrigation area of irrigation mode at the provincial level were derived from the yearbook of china s agricultural machinery industry cnki 2022 for provinces only partially located in the yrb the yield and crop harvested area were aggregated within the basin scale based on grid data the consumption data were distributed to the yrb based on the grid scale population distribution proportion of the yrb the 2 5 grid unit resolution population distribution in the yrb was obtained from the nasa socio economic data and application center se dac nasa 2022 and the distribution proportion of irrigation area and rain fed area of each crop grid scale was taken from mirca2000 database portmann et al 2010 to ensure comparability and avoid the impact of price changes economic related data were converted to constant prices based on the initial year of this study in 2004 3 results 3 1 blue and green water shadow price in crop production the blue and green water shadow prices of ten crops in nine provinces of the yrb from 2004 to 2014 are shown in fig 3 overall the shadow prices of blue and green water of staple food crops with larger production scale were markedly lower than those of cash crops the blue and green water shadow prices of maize wheat and soybean were less than 1 usd in all provinces while the blue and green water shadow prices in vegetables including cabbage potato and tomato were two orders of magnitude higher than those of staple food crops this can be explained as vegetables have higher water use efficiency and market price than wheat and maize as the shadow price of blue water for apple and rapeseed was 0 blue water could not be the restriction for these two crops therefore we focused on their green water shadow price the multi year average green water shadow price of apple in shandong province was the highest 8 4 usd m3 since shandong province belongs to the northern region with less rainfall while the market price of apple was higher than that of other crops this result indicates that the additional green water resources will bring more marginal benefits to apple production in shandong province the multi year average green water shadow price of rapeseed was much lower than that of apple the largest is 0 2 usd m3 in sichuan province which implied that the economic benefits of rapeseed selection will be less when both crops can be planted we selected representative crops from three categories staple foods oils and vegetables for further analyze the multi year average blue and green water shadow price of wheat were the highest in henan 0 3 and 0 4 usd m3 for blue and green water respectively fig 3a henan as the main wheat producing area has natural resource endowment and advanced production technology e g advanced agricultural mechanization and field management the multi year average blue water shadow price of soybean was the highest in inner mongolia 0 1 usd m3 for blue or green water as inner mongolia has hetao irrigation area the largest designed irrigation area in china with advanced irrigation technology additional investment in irrigation in these areas can produce higher economic returns the multi year average green water shadow price of soybean in shandong was the highest 0 1 usd m3 which was caused by the scarcity of green water in shandong fig 3b the multi year average shadow price of blue and green water of chinese cabbage in qinghai province was much higher than that in the other eight provinces where the shadow price of green water exceeded 160 usd m3 while most provinces were less than 16 usd m3 as qinghai province has the lowest annual average temperature of the yrb which is conducive to the production of chinese cabbage 3 2 multi objective cropping structure optimization results and benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows fig 4 shows the pareto optimal solution set of optimizations of cropping pattern in the yrb based on nsga ii algorithm in dry year 2006 normal year 2010 and wet year 2012 the optimized blue water scarcity in dry normal and wet year decreased by 14 1 15 6 16 0 16 8 and 24 8 25 4 respectively while the economic output increased by 1 1 7 3 2 2 8 7 and 1 1 7 2 respectively in addition the optimized crop harvested area decreased by 0 1 5 4 fig 4 this phenomenon proved the possibility of adjusting cropping pattern by using multi objective optimization algorithm to reduce the shortage of blue water and achieve economic outputs without the limitation of crop area expansion compared with the value before optimization the optimized benefits of vw flow of crops in the yrb based on the water shadow price surged in different hydrological years fig 5 the benefits of crop vw flow in dry normal and wet year increased by 1 6 2 8 2 6 3 1 and 1 4 2 8 respectively the sum of maximum benefits of vw flow of the crops after optimization was 12 53 26 06 and 23 39 billion usd respectively in the three years the benefit of vw flow decreased slightly in wet year as the planting proportion of staple crops wheat and maize with relatively low water shadow prices increased in wet year the benefits of crop vw flow in the yrb in the normal year increased by 800 million usd after optimization demonstrating that the benefits of vw trade in the whole yrb could be increased by adjusting the current cropping pattern we compared the provincial crop harvested area before fig s1 and after fig 6 optimization and the benefits based on the vw flows shaanxi and henan had the largest wheat production areas and were the main wheat export provinces the benefits of wheat vw exported by shaanxi to sichuan during wet year were up to 337 million usd after optimization inner mongolia shanxi and sichuan were the provinces with the largest decline in wheat harvested area decreasing by 77 72 and 61 respectively in wet year whereas henan shandong and gansu increased slightly after optimization the maize harvested area in qinghai sichuan and inner mongolia decreased by 50 whereas that in gansu ningxia and shanxi increased by 25 after optimization shaanxi and henan had become the largest contributors of maize vw import in sichuan the benefits of maize related vw flow in wet year reached 503 and 230 million usd respectively inner mongolia shifted from a province mainly exporting maize to a self sufficient province which alleviates its pressure on blue water resource scarcity 3 3 redistribution scheme of cropping patterns of the yrb incorporating benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows fig 7 illustrates blue water scarcity economic output harvested area and crop production under before optimization and optimized solutions with the greatest benefit of vw flow in different hydrological years compared with that before optimization the optimized blue water scarcity and harvested area in the yrb dropped sharply especially the blue water scarcity and harvested area in the wet year decreased by 25 3 and 4 3 respectively fig 7a and fig 7c economic output and crop production showed the opposite trend increasing by 7 2 and 9 2 respectively in normal year fig 7b and fig 7d furthermore more information on optimized irrigation rain fed areas and crop production of each crop was observed in terms of the irrigation mode and specific crops table 2 the overall characteristics of the optimized irrigation and rain fed area in different hydrological years were similar the recommended strategy is to reduce the irrigation area and appropriately expand the rain fed harvested area especially the crops with low water shadow price furthermore the irrigation area of soybean 63 should be substantially reduced in dry year as its water shadow price was relatively low table 2 the water resources saved by reducing soybean production could be used to slightly expand the irrigation area of maize 2 and potato 18 in dry year as these crops have higher crop yield appropriately expanding their irrigation area could increase their production by 2 and 26 respectively which is conducive to meeting the restriction that no reduction for the total crop production in the yrb although the optimized irrigation area of wheat in dry year was only 17 lower than that before optimization wheat has the largest reduction in irrigation area 516 thousand ha due to its largest irrigation area base from dry year to wet year the most remarkable characteristic was that the cropping pattern shifted to expanding grain crops wheat and maize and compressed cash crops with the increase in rainfall the irrigation areas of maize and wheat increased markedly 119 and 35 thousand ha respectively with the increased rainfall accordingly crop production increased by 7 and 1 million tons respectively another visible change was that the irrigation scale of cash crops in the wet year was considerably lower than that in the dry year for instance the irrigated areas of cotton apple and peanut decreased by 113 55 57 53 and 32 48 thousand ha respectively in the wet year compared with the dry year table 3 further exhibits the changes in the harvested area of crops in different hydrological years in specific province before and after the optimization based on the maximum benefit of vw flow we found that the harvested area of the dominant producing areas of each crop expand after optimization in contrast provinces with low productivity showed compress the harvest area for instance the major apple producing areas in shaanxi and gansu increased by 148 31 and 55 24 thousand ha respectively after the optimization in the normal water year in dry year the harvested area of potatoes in inner mongolia increased by 154 33 thousand ha due to the higher water productivity while that in shanxi decreased by 112 83 thousand ha more details on optimized crop harvested area are given in tables s2 s4 fig 8 depicts the spatial distributions of the percentage changes in the blue water footprint and economic output of grain crops wheat and maize based the maximum benefit of vw flow in different hydrological years spatial analysis showed that multi objective optimization considerably reduced the crop blue water footprint in water scarce provinces shanxi inner mongolia and ningxia province had the substantial reductions 1309 2 1004 1 and 767 7 million m3 respectively in wheat blue water footprint after optimization in the dry year a consistent trend was also observed in normal year and wet year on the contrary the blue water footprint of henan and shandong province increased by 657 1 and 570 0 million m3 respectively in the dry year this was caused by the differences in wheat economic productivity per unit of water resources in these provinces the increase in the wheat blue water footprint in henan was only half the reduction in shanxi while the economic output of wheat in henan 450 million usd was 1 5 fold higher than that of shanxi 300 million usd however the opposite trend was observed for maize the blue water footprint of shanxi in different hydrological years increased by 135 5 167 1 and 57 9 million m3 respectively compared to that before optimization with these increases the corresponding crop economic output increased by 250 400 and 240 million usd respectively indicating that shanxi province had a comparative advantage in maize production inner mongolia a province with water scarce also showed the maximum potential of 700 million m3 for reducing the blue water footprint of grain crops 4 discussion in the current study we considered the maximum crop economic output while minimum blue water scarcities we employed nsga ⅱ to optimize the cropping patterns of ten crops in nine provinces within the yrb in different hydrological years especially considering the maximum benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows based on crop water shadow price to evaluate the optimized solutions for the first time the results demonstrate that the yrb can realize multiple environmental economic and social benefits without expanding the existing cultivated land area through the optimization of cropping structure we found an evident trade off between reducing blue water scarcity and increasing crop economic output nevertheless the optimization of cropping pattern in the yrb can alleviate the shortage of blue water by 20 and increase crop related economic output by 5 compared with the current crop production pattern these findings support previous research results on the benefit of crop redistribution on blue water savings crop production and economic output increase at different scales davis et al 2017 liu et al 2021b liu et al 2022 xie et al 2023 as such regional cropping pattern optimization can serve as a potential supplementary solution to bridge the gap between technology and yield in crop production which requires significant financial expenditures davis et al 2017 however this study has insufficient advantages in terms of crop production and economic output compared to previous studies mainly for two reasons first the optimization area of this study is limited to the basin scale and the spatial heterogeneity of agricultural production within the basin is smaller than that in global and national scale secondly and more importantly this study incorporated vw flows into the regional cropping pattern optimization scheme by considering the benefits of crop related inter provincial vw flows based on the crop water shadow price considering the benefits of vw flows it may weaken the performance of other objectives in the current study the benefits of vw flows showed that the adjustment of cropping mode could increase the benefit related to vw flows of up to 800 million us dollars 3 in the yrb which provides a new possibility for alleviating regional water pressure and improving the benefits related to crop trade through vw trade these potential benefits can be realized owing to the spatial heterogeneity of crop characteristics water or land resource endowment and agricultural technology in terms of crops the principal change before and after optimization is that wheat is greatly converted from irrigation to rain fed cultivation and the harvested area of potato and apple with high water use efficiency is appropriately expanded these changes not only ensure food security but also maximize benefits spatially gansu and ningxia have significantly lower water use efficiency than other provinces within the yrb due to relatively backward production technology and higher crop evapotranspiration in contrast henan shandong and inner mongolia have comparative advantages in wheat and maize production as the better land light and heat resource endowments and technical advantages brought about intensive production table 4 the dominant strategy to reduce the blue water scarcity and increase crop economic output is to substantially reduce the irrigation area of most crops while accordingly expand the rain fed area which is similar to the results obtained by chouchane et al 2020 on a global scale especially in dry year as the huge heterogeneity of crop water shadow prices in different crops and regions the recommended measures are reduction of the irrigation area of crops with relatively low shadow price of blue water e g rapeseed and soybean and use the saved blue water to produce crops with higher benefits or unit yield e g maize or potato such a shift means that feasible dynamic adjustment of cropping pattern is also a measure worthy of consideration in addition the wheat harvested area in the yrb has been compressed in recent years while the production scale of cash crops apples cotton and peanuts is growing annually although this will certainly alleviate the shortage of blue water and bring higher economic outputs it may undermine regional food security therefore it is imperative to consider the multiple trade offs between blue water shortage economic interests and food security into account spatial analysis demonstrated that the specific optimization strategy of cropping patterns has regional heterogeneity for instance it is recommended that shanxi province which has water scarcity should shift the current pattern of wheat production to maize which would reduce the blue water consumption of the province furthermore the increase in maize production in shanxi could effectively alleviate the increasing crisis of feed crop self sufficiency under the general trend of transformation to meat of dietary structure in china liu et al 2021b note that not all provinces benefit equally after optimization wheat production in henan province and shandong province is not only dominant in the yrb but in the whole china however the optimized results show that the blue water footprint of wheat production in henan province has increased by 657 1 and 570 0 million m3 compared with that before optimization which is closely related to the higher water and the economic productivity in henan province it is necessary to expand the harvested area as much as possible in the provinces with higher crop productivity as the optimal solution set on the premise of the maximum benefit of vw flow the water economic productivity of wheat in henan province is much higher than that of other provinces optimization brought considerable benefits but resulted in a remarkable increase in the blue water footprint of henan province several realistic factors should be considered to achieve the above objectives previous studies have shown that agricultural production and trade policies agricultural infrastructure development and human capital may be more crucial restrictive factors affecting cropping patterns and vw trade than water or soil resources endowments chouchane et al 2020 huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 the possibility of achieving the dual objectives of resource conservation and social benefits has been proved to be technologically feasible however the constraint condition of this study only included the two factors of cultivated land area and crop production while crop distribution is also affected by natural resource endowment climate conditions local culture regional dietary preference labor force technology capital and other factors abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 davis et al 2017 reed et al 2013 smilovic et al 2019 which will hinder the realization of the goal of this study for instance we found that transformation from wheat to maize production in shanxi province can effectively alleviate the shortage of blue water and increase the benefits of vw flow however the optimization scheme is probably blocked by historical background of diet as shanxi is a typical flour based province therefore actual cropping pattern adjustment needs to consider more dimensional factors to ensure its feasibility this study had three major limitations first this study took the provincial scale of the yrb as the basic spatial research unit which is limited by data availability and computing cost however crop productivity has spatial heterogeneity within provinces which was not considered in this study additionally blue water scarcity was based on the provincial unit which would mask the water shortage in specific space or time in the province mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 nevertheless the provincial level information provided in this study is effective because this would be as the fundamental decision making unit on crop structure redistribution or vw trade second this study took the yrb as a whole when considering the benefits of vw flow and assumed that the trade pattern between the basin and the outside basin remains unchanged before and after optimization such assumptions slightly increase the uncertainty in estimating the benefits of the vw flow however this assumption was conducive to capturing the dynamic information of cropping structure adjustment of provinces within the basin and in favor of the direct comparison of the results before and after optimization third the resource effect of this study only considers the blue water ignoring the impact of green water and grey water water quality green water contributes 60 of the water used for global crop production schyns et al 2019 and water quality is closely related to human activities hansen et al 2021 and should thus be considered in future research however the major findings of the current study are still of policy significance studies focusing on the optimization of cropping pattern at a smaller scale is highly recommended and more sensible objectives and constraints need to be incorporated to ensure the feasibility of the optimization scheme in the future research 5 conclusion this study established a two stage optimization scheme of regional cropping pattern of ten crops in nine provinces within the yrb which reconciled three goals for maximum crop economic output while minimum blue water scarcities the first stage and evaluated the optimal scheme by the maximum benefits of the interprovincial crop related vw flows based on the shadow prices of crop green and blue water use the second stage the results showed that the shadow price of crop blue and green water is affected by crop types natural resource endowment and market prices there is a huge heterogeneity across crops and regions compared with the current cropping pattern the optimized scheme can alleviate blue water scarcity by 20 increase the crop related economic output by 5 and increased the benefit of crop vw flow up to 800 million us dollars to achieve these goals the key pathway is to transform irrigation area of water intensive crops while lowering water shadow price to rain fed production we suggest appropriately expanding the production scale of vegetable crops with higher water shadow price and comparative advantage in the yrb such as cabbage potato and tomato and reducing the harvested area of crops with lower shadow price of blue water and more water consumption such as soybean and wheat to simultaneously consider regional water resources security and higher economic outputs future research will consider more optimization objectives and verify the practical effects of these optimization schemes on different spatial scales to ensure the stability and feasibility of optimization

8910,cropping pattern determines the agricultural water use requirement and efficiency as well as economic benefits of crop production agricultural water resources include blue water irrigation water and green water soil moisture from precipitation which have different shadow prices the virtual water vw flow embedded in the interregional food trade causes burden shifts of water resources pressures in space however these intertwined economic and social effects have been neglected in regional cropping structure management using the case of the yellow river basin in china here we propose a two stage multi objective cropping pattern optimization scheme to maximize crop economic output while minimize blue water scarcities the first stage and considered the criteria of maximum economic benefits of the interprovincial crop related vw flows based on the shadow prices of crop green and blue water use the second stage results show considerable differences in shadow prices of crop water use by colures crops and location with the optimized cropping pattern which appropriately expands the planting scale of vegetables with higher water shadow price and comparative advantage and reduces the crop planting with lower water shadow price and intensive blue water consumption e g soybean and wheat blue water scarcity can be alleviated by 20 combined with a 5 increase in crop economic output and up to 3 800 million usd higher benefits of vw flows the premise to achieve above goals is to improve crop water resources utilization efficiency and break down the barriers of dietary preferences and trade policy keywords multi objective optimization crop production shadow price virtual water flow water footprint data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture accounts for 92 of the global freshwater consumption and is expected to continue to grow in the future hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the competitive use of water resources in agriculture and other sectors has intensified water scarcity in many places around the world factors such as population growth urbanization diet changes and climate changes have exacerbated water pressures in certain water scarce regions mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 rodell et al 2018 tove a larsen et al 2016 tuninetti et al 2022 vörösmarty et al 2000 due to the spatial heterogeneity of crop water productivity regional cropping pattern should be optimized and water resource management across sectors should be coordinated to alleviate regional water pressures chouchane et al 2020 cropping pattern optimization should comprehensively consider the pressure of water resources food production and economic benefits yao et al 2020 ren et al 2021 moreover with increased interregional crop trade and logistics the optimization of cropping patterns could alleviate local physical water scarcities and change the virtual water vw flow patterns embedded in crop trades across the regional boundaries to bring social and economic benefits ye et al 2018 to quantify the benefits of vw flow it is vital to assess the economic value of water used to produce the traded crops which can be measured by the shadow price of crop water use bierkens et al 2019 the crop water shadow price indicates the marginal benefits obtained by using an additional cubic meter of water for crop production and reflects the scarcity of resources angulo et al 2014 liu et al 2009 quantifying the specific value of the crop water shadow price is conducive to a more rational allocation of agricultural water resources and alleviate local water shortage novo et al 2009 grammatikopoulou et al 2020 numerous studies have investigated regional cropping pattern optimization with increasingly comprehensive optimization objectives and diverse methods in terms of optimization objectives maximum crop production or crop economic benefits and minimum irrigation water consumption are traditional objectives e g davis et al 2017 márquez et al 2011 morankar et al 2013 osama et al 2017 varade and patel 2019 with improvements in knowledges of integrations between crop production water resources and human societal sustainability more factors related to environment and society have been incorporated in the cropping pattern optimization program for instance environmental factors such as crop water productivity fan et al 2021 ren et al 2019 water resource carrying capacity he et al 2021 groundwater extraction ma et al 2022 varade and patel 2019 fertilizer use jain et al 2021 wang et al 2022 xie et al 2023 carbon emissions li et al 2023 wang et al 2022 xie et al 2023 and biodiversity wen and chen 2023 water footprint of crop production has the advantage of distinguishing between blue water and green water consumed during crop growth period hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 therefore the minimizing crop water footprint has been placed in the cropping pattern optimization targets balezentis et al 2020 chouchane et al 2020 liu et al 2022 liu et al 2021b sedghamiz et al 2018 wang et al 2021 wen and chen 2023 chouchane et al 2020 and liu et al 2021b carried out a global and chinese crop redistribution scheme with minimal blue water scarcity and minimum blue water footprint as one of the optimization objectives respectively some studies took the maximum proportion of crop green water footprint as objective liu et al 2022 sedghamiz et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 in terms of methods table 1 existing methods include linear programming balezentis et al 2020 wang et al 2022 xie et al 2023 fuzzy programming morankar et al 2013 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 two layer optimization liu et al 2022 however these algorithms have drawbacks such as computational complexity and strong subjectivity in the process of solving the optimal solution sedghamiz et al 2018 recently evolutionary algorithms have received widespread attention such as genetic algorithm deb et al 2002 ant colony algorithm shaikh et al 2015 and particle swarm algorithm jain et al 2021 the second generation genetic algorithm nsga ii with the advantages of fast non dominated sorting process elite strategy non parameter and effective constraint processing methods has been widely applied in research cases of multi objective cropping pattern optimization ma et al 2022 márquez et al 2011 sedghamiz et al 2018 zhang et al 2023 however even though it has been acknowledged that the interregional vw flow is an indispensable part of the hydrological cycle under the influence of human activities in the context of open economy and society d odorico et al 2019 the existing scheme of regional cropping pattern optimization still focuses on local impacts from producer aspects largely ignoring remote economic and environmental impacts driven by traders and consumers table 1 another visible defect is that most of the current optimization schemes focus on environmental and economic impacts and the social aspects are largely ignored several studies have shown that vw flows bring benefits in terms of water saving chapagain et al 2006 economic return oki et al 2017 and social equity xin et al 2022 mainly in recipiant regions however other studies have highlighted the negative effects of vw flows on the origin regions which forego their water resources but retain environmental pollutions due to the production excess products for export zhao et al 2015 dalin et al 2017 it is essential to incorporate the benefits and negative effects of vw flows into the cropping pattern optimization framework to ensure the efficiency and fairness of regional agricultural water resources utilization currently the water price of crop production rarely reflects its real economic value and scarcity due to various reasons such as insufficient water rights governmental price protection one of the main methods to evaluate the real value of water is to assess its shadow price i e the marginal value generated by water resources which is related to the optimal allocation of resources the benefit of vw flow is the combination of the shadow price of unit water resource and interregional vw flow which can effectively reflect the equity and benefit i e social impact of water resource redistribution therefore considering the benefits of vw flow in the optimization of cropping pattern helps broaden the scope of current concerns enrolling social impact and involving the new perspective on traders and consumers the current study aims to coordinate multiple trade offs among resources economy and society in regional cropping patterns by proposing a two stage multi objective cropping pattern optimization scheme that incorporates the benefits of crop related vw flows using the yellow river basin yrb china over 2004 2014 as a case study the cropping pattern was optimized at provincial scale considering two goals maximum crop economic output while minimum blue water scarcities the first stage and then the optimal cropping scheme was obtained by considering the maximum benefits of the interprovincial crop related vw flows based on the shadow prices of crop green and blue water use the second stage this study provides two contributions first this is the first analysis to consider the impact of vw flow trade in the cropping pattern optimization which is conducive to formulating optimization strategies from a more comprehensive and systematic perspective second social impacts are considered in the optimization scheme we considered ten crops i e apple cabbage cotton groundnut maize potato rapeseed soybean tomato and wheat that are mainly cultivated in the watershed while other staple crops e g rice in other regions outside the yrb were excluded the optimization objectives were set based on the estimation and evaluation of shadow prices of green and blue water consumed in crop production in time and space by crops in the yrb covering all provinces of shanxi inner mongolia shandong henan sichuan shaanxi gansu qinghai and ningxia finally in order to fully consider the environmental economic and social effects and potential of cropping pattern optimization we selected and compared the optimization results under three typical hydrological years of the yrb dry year 2006 normal year 2010 and wet year 2012 the yrb was selected as a case study for three reasons first the yrb produces 13 of china s food with only 2 of blue water resource in the country yrcc 2013 the mismatch between water and land for crop production led to moderate or severer water scarcity omer et al 2020 ringler et al 2010 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 second the interprovincial crop related vw flows have become intensive in the basin and over 40 of the water used for crop production is currently embedded in traded crops liu et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 zhuo et al 2022 third there are visible spatial heterogeneities in the harvested area and cropping structure among provinces within the yrb fig 1 2 methods and data the cropping pattern in the yrb was optimized by a two stage optimization in the first stage the evolutionary algorithm was used to coordinate the trade offs between natural and economic impacts caused by crop production and a set of optimal solutions was obtained in the second stage the economic effect was considered as criteria to screen the optimal cropping pattern from the optimal solution set the flow chart of this study is shown in fig 2 2 1 two stage optimization of cropping patterns in the yrb the first stage was a nonlinear optimization for two objectives based on the nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2002 which is an efficient multi objective evolutionary algorithm and has been widely used in the optimization of crop spatial redistribution abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 liu et al 2021b márquez et al 2011 sedghamiz et al 2018 in the multi objective optimization of this study the crop harvested areas were taken as decision variables totaling 180 decision variables i e the harvested area of each crop totaling ten crops in each province totaling nine provinces under irrigated or rain fed conditions is a decision variable additionally the harvested area of all the ten crops and the production of grain crops wheat and maize were the constraints and the cropping structure of the 180 decision variables was optimized for the three hydrological years i e dry year 2006 normal year 2010 and wet year 2012 which were identified by sorting frequency on the recent 30 years of annual precipitation within yrb to measure the optimization potential of different hydrological years the first objective was to minimize the scarcity of blue water of the yrb blue water scarcity bws is defined as the ratio of blue water consumption to blue water availability in the yrb the water consumption of the agricultural sector was determined by the unit blue water footprint of specific crop crop production i e the yield multiplied harvested area of each crop under irrigated environment 1 min bws n 1 3 d n i c a ir i c y ir i c ubwf i c bwa where bws is the overall blue water scarcity degree of the yrb dimensionless d n n 1 2 3 is the water consumption of household industry and environment respectively m 3 i 1 2 9 are the nine provinces in the yrb c 1 2 10 are the ten crops in the yrb a ir i c in ha and y ir i c in t ha are the area and yield of crop c in province i under irrigation respectively u bwf i c is the blue water footprint per unit yield m 3 t bwa is the blue water resources availability in the yrb m 3 the methodology of u bwf i c was used according to zhuo et al 2016 the second objective was the maximum economic output of crops in the yrb that is the product of crop market price and crop production 2 max economic output i c pric e i c p i c where e c o n o m i c o u t p u t is the economic output obtained by selling crops at the local market price usd pric e i c indicates the market price of crop c in province i within the yrb usd t and p i c is crop production of crop c in province i including irrigated and rain fed conditions t we selected crop production rather than crop sales as produced crops have economic value regardless of their subsequent use e g self consumption loss waste seeds storage etc we created constraints from two aspects harvested area and crop production of grain crops wheat maize to solve the above two objective functions 2 1 1 1 constraints on harvested area of each crop for the crop harvested area the total cropping area in the yrb could not exceed that before optimization moreover the rain fed or irrigated area of crops in the basin was allowed to expand but it could not exceed the maximum allowable area expansion coefficient α expressed as the maximum ratio of the irrigated or rain fed area of a crop in specific province after optimization to the area before optimization we here took the value of α as 1 3 following the settings in the previous relevant literature by chouchane et al 2020 we created similar constraints for any crop c 3 i c a rf i c i c a ir i c a ref i c a rf i c α i c a ref rf i c i c a ir i c α i c a ref ir i c c i a rf i c α i a rf ref i c c i a ir i c α i a ir ref i c where a ref is sum of harvested areas of each crop in the yrb before optimization ha a rf i c and a ir i c are rain fed and irrigated areas after optimization for crop c in province i ha and α is the upper threshold of area expansion coefficient which was mainly used to avoid excessive expansion of crop irrigated or rain fed areas and ensure the changes within a reasonable range 2 1 2 2 constraints on production of grain crops given the importance of grain crops wheat maize for food security in the basin this study further limited that the optimized production of wheat and maize could not be lower than the previous figure 4 i p i wheat i p i wheat ref i p i maize i p i maize ref where p i in t is the production of wheat or maize in province i within the yrb which was obtained from the product of crop harvested area and unit yield the second stage was to quantify the social benefits caused by vw flow specifically the maximum benefits of crop related vw flows based on water shadow price was taken as the criteria to screen the optimal solution set i e cropping pattern in the sections 2 2 and 2 3 more details on the methods of quantifying crop water shadow price and benefits of crop related vw flows based on water shadow price would be introduced respectively 2 2 quantification of crop water shadow price the shadow price of water reflects the value of crops that can be produced by a marginal unit of water consumption bierkens et al 2019 for better management water resources are usually divided into blue including surface water and groundwater and green water resources water from rainfall stored in unsaturated soil and utilized by plants falkenmark and rockström 2010 rockström et al 2009 owing to the heterogeneity of provinces in terms of water resources and crop structures the blue and green water shadow price of ten crops in the nine provinces in the yrb were quantified separately which was divided into the following three main steps first the contribution of blue and green water to crop production under irrigated and rain fed conditions was distinguished following zhuo et al 2022 and shang et al 2021 5 p b y ir y rf y ir p ir p g p g ir p rf p g ir p ir p b where p b and p g are the crop production contributed by blue water and green water respectively t y ir and y rf are the crop yield per unit area under irrigated and rain fed conditions respectively t ha p ir and p rf refer to the crop production under irrigated and rain fed conditions respectively t and p g ir is the crop production attributed to green water footprint under irrigated condition t second the cobb douglas production function was used for the regression analysis to obtain the regression coefficient β 0 β 1 the exponential and natural logarithm forms of cobb douglas production function used in this study were as follows 6 p g β 0 a β a x β x gw β gw p b β 1 a β a x β x bw β bw ln p g ln β 0 β a ln a β x ln x β gw ln gw ln p b ln β 1 β a ln a β x ln x β bw ln bw where a is the cropping area ha x is the market input including x 1 x 2 x 3 which are raw material labor force and land input respectively gw and bw are the green and blue water footprint m 3 y β gw and β bw is the regression coefficient for the green and blue water footprint third the blue and green water shadow price of crops was calculated 7 mp green β gw p gw mp blue β bw p bw sp green price mp green sp blue price mp blue where mp blue and mp green are the marginal productivity of blue water and green water respectively t m 3 price is the price corresponding to the crop per unit yield usd t sp blue and sp green are the shadow prices of blue and green water respectively usd m 3 2 3 estimation of associated benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows based on crop water shadow price the associated benefits of crop related inter provincial vw flows of the yrb evw in usd y were quantified according to the weighted water shadow price of crops in the basin after the optimization of cropping pattern which was determined by the product of crop related inter provincial vw flows and crop water shadow prices here we assumed the overall crop trade structure of the yrb remained unchanged before and after the optimization 8 evw c vw c sp c where vw c is the vw flow of crop c m 3 sp c is the weighted water shadow price of specific crop c in the yrb usd m 3 vw c was obtained from the trade volume multiplying crop unit water footprint specifically we first simulated the crop trade relationship among 31 provinces in china and then downscaled the trade volume of the nine provinces within yrb the crop trade volume among 31 provinces within china was quantified by the linear optimization algorithm proposed by dalin et al 2014 which was established on the principles of minimum trade cost and supply demand relationship 9 min cost c i 1 j 1 i 31 j 31 t i j c cost i j c j 1 j 31 t i j c s i c i 1 31 i 1 i 31 t i j c d j c j 1 31 t i j c 0 where cost c is the total trade cost of crop c usd t i j c is the crop trade volume transported from province i to province j t y cost i j c is the cost of transporting unit crops from province i to province j usd t s i c is the quantity of crop c used for export producing in province i t y d j c is the total demand for crop c in province j t y after obtaining the trade volume of crops among 31 provinces in china we acquired the trade relations of province complete located in the yrb only ningxia then for provinces partly located in the yrb other eight provinces the trade data were scaled down according to the proportion of the population within the basin and the whole province following zhuo et al 2020 finally we multiplied the trade data by the unit production water footprint of the producing province to obtain the vw flows pattern of ten crops in the nine provinces in the yrb 2 4 data sources the data on population crop yield and harvested area of the nine provinces in the yrb were obtained from the national bureau of statistics cnki 2022 data on rainfall domestic industrial and environmental water were obtained from the water resources bulletin mwrc 2022 and data on material input labor force and land used to calculate the shadow price of crop blue and green water were collected from china agricultural statistical yearbook cnki 2022 the market price of each crop came from the compilation of costs and benefits of agricultural products cnki 2022 the agricultural production data such as the effective irrigation area of crops and the irrigation area of irrigation mode at the provincial level were derived from the yearbook of china s agricultural machinery industry cnki 2022 for provinces only partially located in the yrb the yield and crop harvested area were aggregated within the basin scale based on grid data the consumption data were distributed to the yrb based on the grid scale population distribution proportion of the yrb the 2 5 grid unit resolution population distribution in the yrb was obtained from the nasa socio economic data and application center se dac nasa 2022 and the distribution proportion of irrigation area and rain fed area of each crop grid scale was taken from mirca2000 database portmann et al 2010 to ensure comparability and avoid the impact of price changes economic related data were converted to constant prices based on the initial year of this study in 2004 3 results 3 1 blue and green water shadow price in crop production the blue and green water shadow prices of ten crops in nine provinces of the yrb from 2004 to 2014 are shown in fig 3 overall the shadow prices of blue and green water of staple food crops with larger production scale were markedly lower than those of cash crops the blue and green water shadow prices of maize wheat and soybean were less than 1 usd in all provinces while the blue and green water shadow prices in vegetables including cabbage potato and tomato were two orders of magnitude higher than those of staple food crops this can be explained as vegetables have higher water use efficiency and market price than wheat and maize as the shadow price of blue water for apple and rapeseed was 0 blue water could not be the restriction for these two crops therefore we focused on their green water shadow price the multi year average green water shadow price of apple in shandong province was the highest 8 4 usd m3 since shandong province belongs to the northern region with less rainfall while the market price of apple was higher than that of other crops this result indicates that the additional green water resources will bring more marginal benefits to apple production in shandong province the multi year average green water shadow price of rapeseed was much lower than that of apple the largest is 0 2 usd m3 in sichuan province which implied that the economic benefits of rapeseed selection will be less when both crops can be planted we selected representative crops from three categories staple foods oils and vegetables for further analyze the multi year average blue and green water shadow price of wheat were the highest in henan 0 3 and 0 4 usd m3 for blue and green water respectively fig 3a henan as the main wheat producing area has natural resource endowment and advanced production technology e g advanced agricultural mechanization and field management the multi year average blue water shadow price of soybean was the highest in inner mongolia 0 1 usd m3 for blue or green water as inner mongolia has hetao irrigation area the largest designed irrigation area in china with advanced irrigation technology additional investment in irrigation in these areas can produce higher economic returns the multi year average green water shadow price of soybean in shandong was the highest 0 1 usd m3 which was caused by the scarcity of green water in shandong fig 3b the multi year average shadow price of blue and green water of chinese cabbage in qinghai province was much higher than that in the other eight provinces where the shadow price of green water exceeded 160 usd m3 while most provinces were less than 16 usd m3 as qinghai province has the lowest annual average temperature of the yrb which is conducive to the production of chinese cabbage 3 2 multi objective cropping structure optimization results and benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows fig 4 shows the pareto optimal solution set of optimizations of cropping pattern in the yrb based on nsga ii algorithm in dry year 2006 normal year 2010 and wet year 2012 the optimized blue water scarcity in dry normal and wet year decreased by 14 1 15 6 16 0 16 8 and 24 8 25 4 respectively while the economic output increased by 1 1 7 3 2 2 8 7 and 1 1 7 2 respectively in addition the optimized crop harvested area decreased by 0 1 5 4 fig 4 this phenomenon proved the possibility of adjusting cropping pattern by using multi objective optimization algorithm to reduce the shortage of blue water and achieve economic outputs without the limitation of crop area expansion compared with the value before optimization the optimized benefits of vw flow of crops in the yrb based on the water shadow price surged in different hydrological years fig 5 the benefits of crop vw flow in dry normal and wet year increased by 1 6 2 8 2 6 3 1 and 1 4 2 8 respectively the sum of maximum benefits of vw flow of the crops after optimization was 12 53 26 06 and 23 39 billion usd respectively in the three years the benefit of vw flow decreased slightly in wet year as the planting proportion of staple crops wheat and maize with relatively low water shadow prices increased in wet year the benefits of crop vw flow in the yrb in the normal year increased by 800 million usd after optimization demonstrating that the benefits of vw trade in the whole yrb could be increased by adjusting the current cropping pattern we compared the provincial crop harvested area before fig s1 and after fig 6 optimization and the benefits based on the vw flows shaanxi and henan had the largest wheat production areas and were the main wheat export provinces the benefits of wheat vw exported by shaanxi to sichuan during wet year were up to 337 million usd after optimization inner mongolia shanxi and sichuan were the provinces with the largest decline in wheat harvested area decreasing by 77 72 and 61 respectively in wet year whereas henan shandong and gansu increased slightly after optimization the maize harvested area in qinghai sichuan and inner mongolia decreased by 50 whereas that in gansu ningxia and shanxi increased by 25 after optimization shaanxi and henan had become the largest contributors of maize vw import in sichuan the benefits of maize related vw flow in wet year reached 503 and 230 million usd respectively inner mongolia shifted from a province mainly exporting maize to a self sufficient province which alleviates its pressure on blue water resource scarcity 3 3 redistribution scheme of cropping patterns of the yrb incorporating benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows fig 7 illustrates blue water scarcity economic output harvested area and crop production under before optimization and optimized solutions with the greatest benefit of vw flow in different hydrological years compared with that before optimization the optimized blue water scarcity and harvested area in the yrb dropped sharply especially the blue water scarcity and harvested area in the wet year decreased by 25 3 and 4 3 respectively fig 7a and fig 7c economic output and crop production showed the opposite trend increasing by 7 2 and 9 2 respectively in normal year fig 7b and fig 7d furthermore more information on optimized irrigation rain fed areas and crop production of each crop was observed in terms of the irrigation mode and specific crops table 2 the overall characteristics of the optimized irrigation and rain fed area in different hydrological years were similar the recommended strategy is to reduce the irrigation area and appropriately expand the rain fed harvested area especially the crops with low water shadow price furthermore the irrigation area of soybean 63 should be substantially reduced in dry year as its water shadow price was relatively low table 2 the water resources saved by reducing soybean production could be used to slightly expand the irrigation area of maize 2 and potato 18 in dry year as these crops have higher crop yield appropriately expanding their irrigation area could increase their production by 2 and 26 respectively which is conducive to meeting the restriction that no reduction for the total crop production in the yrb although the optimized irrigation area of wheat in dry year was only 17 lower than that before optimization wheat has the largest reduction in irrigation area 516 thousand ha due to its largest irrigation area base from dry year to wet year the most remarkable characteristic was that the cropping pattern shifted to expanding grain crops wheat and maize and compressed cash crops with the increase in rainfall the irrigation areas of maize and wheat increased markedly 119 and 35 thousand ha respectively with the increased rainfall accordingly crop production increased by 7 and 1 million tons respectively another visible change was that the irrigation scale of cash crops in the wet year was considerably lower than that in the dry year for instance the irrigated areas of cotton apple and peanut decreased by 113 55 57 53 and 32 48 thousand ha respectively in the wet year compared with the dry year table 3 further exhibits the changes in the harvested area of crops in different hydrological years in specific province before and after the optimization based on the maximum benefit of vw flow we found that the harvested area of the dominant producing areas of each crop expand after optimization in contrast provinces with low productivity showed compress the harvest area for instance the major apple producing areas in shaanxi and gansu increased by 148 31 and 55 24 thousand ha respectively after the optimization in the normal water year in dry year the harvested area of potatoes in inner mongolia increased by 154 33 thousand ha due to the higher water productivity while that in shanxi decreased by 112 83 thousand ha more details on optimized crop harvested area are given in tables s2 s4 fig 8 depicts the spatial distributions of the percentage changes in the blue water footprint and economic output of grain crops wheat and maize based the maximum benefit of vw flow in different hydrological years spatial analysis showed that multi objective optimization considerably reduced the crop blue water footprint in water scarce provinces shanxi inner mongolia and ningxia province had the substantial reductions 1309 2 1004 1 and 767 7 million m3 respectively in wheat blue water footprint after optimization in the dry year a consistent trend was also observed in normal year and wet year on the contrary the blue water footprint of henan and shandong province increased by 657 1 and 570 0 million m3 respectively in the dry year this was caused by the differences in wheat economic productivity per unit of water resources in these provinces the increase in the wheat blue water footprint in henan was only half the reduction in shanxi while the economic output of wheat in henan 450 million usd was 1 5 fold higher than that of shanxi 300 million usd however the opposite trend was observed for maize the blue water footprint of shanxi in different hydrological years increased by 135 5 167 1 and 57 9 million m3 respectively compared to that before optimization with these increases the corresponding crop economic output increased by 250 400 and 240 million usd respectively indicating that shanxi province had a comparative advantage in maize production inner mongolia a province with water scarce also showed the maximum potential of 700 million m3 for reducing the blue water footprint of grain crops 4 discussion in the current study we considered the maximum crop economic output while minimum blue water scarcities we employed nsga ⅱ to optimize the cropping patterns of ten crops in nine provinces within the yrb in different hydrological years especially considering the maximum benefits of crop related interprovincial vw flows based on crop water shadow price to evaluate the optimized solutions for the first time the results demonstrate that the yrb can realize multiple environmental economic and social benefits without expanding the existing cultivated land area through the optimization of cropping structure we found an evident trade off between reducing blue water scarcity and increasing crop economic output nevertheless the optimization of cropping pattern in the yrb can alleviate the shortage of blue water by 20 and increase crop related economic output by 5 compared with the current crop production pattern these findings support previous research results on the benefit of crop redistribution on blue water savings crop production and economic output increase at different scales davis et al 2017 liu et al 2021b liu et al 2022 xie et al 2023 as such regional cropping pattern optimization can serve as a potential supplementary solution to bridge the gap between technology and yield in crop production which requires significant financial expenditures davis et al 2017 however this study has insufficient advantages in terms of crop production and economic output compared to previous studies mainly for two reasons first the optimization area of this study is limited to the basin scale and the spatial heterogeneity of agricultural production within the basin is smaller than that in global and national scale secondly and more importantly this study incorporated vw flows into the regional cropping pattern optimization scheme by considering the benefits of crop related inter provincial vw flows based on the crop water shadow price considering the benefits of vw flows it may weaken the performance of other objectives in the current study the benefits of vw flows showed that the adjustment of cropping mode could increase the benefit related to vw flows of up to 800 million us dollars 3 in the yrb which provides a new possibility for alleviating regional water pressure and improving the benefits related to crop trade through vw trade these potential benefits can be realized owing to the spatial heterogeneity of crop characteristics water or land resource endowment and agricultural technology in terms of crops the principal change before and after optimization is that wheat is greatly converted from irrigation to rain fed cultivation and the harvested area of potato and apple with high water use efficiency is appropriately expanded these changes not only ensure food security but also maximize benefits spatially gansu and ningxia have significantly lower water use efficiency than other provinces within the yrb due to relatively backward production technology and higher crop evapotranspiration in contrast henan shandong and inner mongolia have comparative advantages in wheat and maize production as the better land light and heat resource endowments and technical advantages brought about intensive production table 4 the dominant strategy to reduce the blue water scarcity and increase crop economic output is to substantially reduce the irrigation area of most crops while accordingly expand the rain fed area which is similar to the results obtained by chouchane et al 2020 on a global scale especially in dry year as the huge heterogeneity of crop water shadow prices in different crops and regions the recommended measures are reduction of the irrigation area of crops with relatively low shadow price of blue water e g rapeseed and soybean and use the saved blue water to produce crops with higher benefits or unit yield e g maize or potato such a shift means that feasible dynamic adjustment of cropping pattern is also a measure worthy of consideration in addition the wheat harvested area in the yrb has been compressed in recent years while the production scale of cash crops apples cotton and peanuts is growing annually although this will certainly alleviate the shortage of blue water and bring higher economic outputs it may undermine regional food security therefore it is imperative to consider the multiple trade offs between blue water shortage economic interests and food security into account spatial analysis demonstrated that the specific optimization strategy of cropping patterns has regional heterogeneity for instance it is recommended that shanxi province which has water scarcity should shift the current pattern of wheat production to maize which would reduce the blue water consumption of the province furthermore the increase in maize production in shanxi could effectively alleviate the increasing crisis of feed crop self sufficiency under the general trend of transformation to meat of dietary structure in china liu et al 2021b note that not all provinces benefit equally after optimization wheat production in henan province and shandong province is not only dominant in the yrb but in the whole china however the optimized results show that the blue water footprint of wheat production in henan province has increased by 657 1 and 570 0 million m3 compared with that before optimization which is closely related to the higher water and the economic productivity in henan province it is necessary to expand the harvested area as much as possible in the provinces with higher crop productivity as the optimal solution set on the premise of the maximum benefit of vw flow the water economic productivity of wheat in henan province is much higher than that of other provinces optimization brought considerable benefits but resulted in a remarkable increase in the blue water footprint of henan province several realistic factors should be considered to achieve the above objectives previous studies have shown that agricultural production and trade policies agricultural infrastructure development and human capital may be more crucial restrictive factors affecting cropping patterns and vw trade than water or soil resources endowments chouchane et al 2020 huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 the possibility of achieving the dual objectives of resource conservation and social benefits has been proved to be technologically feasible however the constraint condition of this study only included the two factors of cultivated land area and crop production while crop distribution is also affected by natural resource endowment climate conditions local culture regional dietary preference labor force technology capital and other factors abdelkader and elshorbagy 2021 davis et al 2017 reed et al 2013 smilovic et al 2019 which will hinder the realization of the goal of this study for instance we found that transformation from wheat to maize production in shanxi province can effectively alleviate the shortage of blue water and increase the benefits of vw flow however the optimization scheme is probably blocked by historical background of diet as shanxi is a typical flour based province therefore actual cropping pattern adjustment needs to consider more dimensional factors to ensure its feasibility this study had three major limitations first this study took the provincial scale of the yrb as the basic spatial research unit which is limited by data availability and computing cost however crop productivity has spatial heterogeneity within provinces which was not considered in this study additionally blue water scarcity was based on the provincial unit which would mask the water shortage in specific space or time in the province mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 nevertheless the provincial level information provided in this study is effective because this would be as the fundamental decision making unit on crop structure redistribution or vw trade second this study took the yrb as a whole when considering the benefits of vw flow and assumed that the trade pattern between the basin and the outside basin remains unchanged before and after optimization such assumptions slightly increase the uncertainty in estimating the benefits of the vw flow however this assumption was conducive to capturing the dynamic information of cropping structure adjustment of provinces within the basin and in favor of the direct comparison of the results before and after optimization third the resource effect of this study only considers the blue water ignoring the impact of green water and grey water water quality green water contributes 60 of the water used for global crop production schyns et al 2019 and water quality is closely related to human activities hansen et al 2021 and should thus be considered in future research however the major findings of the current study are still of policy significance studies focusing on the optimization of cropping pattern at a smaller scale is highly recommended and more sensible objectives and constraints need to be incorporated to ensure the feasibility of the optimization scheme in the future research 5 conclusion this study established a two stage optimization scheme of regional cropping pattern of ten crops in nine provinces within the yrb which reconciled three goals for maximum crop economic output while minimum blue water scarcities the first stage and evaluated the optimal scheme by the maximum benefits of the interprovincial crop related vw flows based on the shadow prices of crop green and blue water use the second stage the results showed that the shadow price of crop blue and green water is affected by crop types natural resource endowment and market prices there is a huge heterogeneity across crops and regions compared with the current cropping pattern the optimized scheme can alleviate blue water scarcity by 20 increase the crop related economic output by 5 and increased the benefit of crop vw flow up to 800 million us dollars to achieve these goals the key pathway is to transform irrigation area of water intensive crops while lowering water shadow price to rain fed production we suggest appropriately expanding the production scale of vegetable crops with higher water shadow price and comparative advantage in the yrb such as cabbage potato and tomato and reducing the harvested area of crops with lower shadow price of blue water and more water consumption such as soybean and wheat to simultaneously consider regional water resources security and higher economic outputs future research will consider more optimization objectives and verify the practical effects of these optimization schemes on different spatial scales to ensure the stability and feasibility of optimization

8911,the metric energy balance model requires the temperature of a hot dry bare agricultural soil and cold fully transpiring crop surfaces for the internal calibration and estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc a previous study indicated that because of the limited field of view of uas based imagery the application of unmanned aerial systems uas based metric could not guarantee the availability of representative hot and cold pixels in the field of view of the flight mission even if the pixels were manually chosen a study was conducted for two years 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the suitability of various artificial and portable hot dry red mulch dry terra cotta saucer plate coconut fiber wheat straw and cold surface of water wet terra cotta saucer plate green sponge and white granite tile on top of polystyrene foam floating on water artificial surfaces for use in the calibration of the uas metric model the temperature of the surfaces was measured with a thermal infrared sensor mounted on a ground vehicle with a retractable mast up to 7 m facing downward to capture images at around the nadir hours 11 am to 3 pm the results showed that a green sponge floating in a water tray and a dry terra cotta saucer plate full of water best matched rwet sponge 0 93 rwet saucer 0 86 the temperature dynamics of fully irrigated short grass dry red mulch and a dry terra cotta saucer plate best matched rdry red mulch 0 98 rdry saucer 0 97 the temperature dynamics of bare and dry agricultural soil these artificial hot and cold reference surfaces were then located within a field of view of nine different uas flight missions over a spearmint field during the summer of 2021 although the temperatures of the cold artificial surfaces correlated well with fully irrigated short grass planted near the spearmint field they were 1 9 8 3 c warmer than the taller spearmint crop canopy the temperature of a dry red mulch wet sponge and dry wet terra cotta saucer plate used as artificial hot cold anchor temperatures for et estimation by the uas metric model resulted in overestimating the etc obtained using field hot cold pixels dry bare soil fully irrigated spearmint or the etc estimation based on a soil water balance measured by neutron probe and teros 10 sensors the best hot cold temperatures for internal calibration of the uas based imagery et model are from dry soil and a fully irrigated canopy located in the field of view in the absence of dry bare soil within the image the use of dry red mulch is suggested additional research is needed to find artificial cold surfaces with temperatures closer to the temperature of fully irrigated canopies which can be conveniently located for auto selection within the images in the meantime for farm scale applications maintaining a field section guaranteed to be well irrigated is recommended keywords evapotranspiration unmanned aerial systems imagery remote sensing metric energy balance site specific irrigation

crop evapotranspiration etc is becoming increasingly popular for site specific irrigation management bhatti et al 2020 chandel et al 2020a feng et al 2022 mokhtar et al 2022 mokhtari et al 2021 peddinti and kisekka 2022 uas based energy balance models are modified versions of satellite based energy balance models like mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a 2007b and spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi geli and neale 2012 neale et al 2012 bhatti et al 2020 that can be used for estimating etc at higher spatial resolution chandel et al 2020 2021 originally users of metric manually selected hot and cold pixels within the satellite imagery whose temperatures were used as anchor for the internal calibration of the model pixels from dry bare agricultural soil hot anchor temperature and fully irrigated vegetation cold anchor temperature were selected based on their normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and temperature allen et al 2007a 2007b however manually selecting these anchor temperatures was time consuming and required experienced users having a good background of the energy balance and radiation physics and vegetation indices allen et al 2011 and variation between practitioners caused large uncertainties to the et estimation allen et al 2011 long et al 2011 therefore the auto selection of hot and cold pixels with the cimec calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions processes was introduced into the metric model by allen et al 2013 however this resulted in a 10 20 lower accuracy of et estimation compared to the manual selection of the extreme anchor pixels by experienced operators choi et al 2009 paul et al 2013 allen et al 2013 the uas metric model named as uasm 2 by chandel et al chandel et al 2020a is an adapted version of the landsat based metric model that modified some functions of the water r package an implementation of the metric model olmedo et al 2016 et estimation with uas based imagery compared with satellite based imagery for irrigated spearmint potatoes and alfalfa using the metric methods resulted in a root mean square error rmse in a range of 0 2 2 7 mm day 1 chandel et al 2020a 2021 this difference is based on the comparison between the output of the landsat metric and the uas metric model which has been explained by the poor selection of hot and cold anchor pixels for the uas based metric model chandel et al 2020a these studies chandel et al 2020b 2021 used the auto selection of hot and cold pixels for the internal calibration of the model however in the case of uas metric the auto selection of reliable hot and cold pixels is problematic in the limited field of view of the imagery molaei et al 2022 choi et al 2009 also expressed the difficulty finding hot anchor pixels from a bare agricultural soil in humid regions within satellite imagery that similarly caused problems for accurate et estimation given the uncertainties associated with the selection of cold and hot pixels for uas based etc estimation this study aimed to 1 test various artificial hot and cold reference surfaces that can represent the temperature dynamics of a dry bare soil and fully transpiring ryegrass and 2 test the effect of the application of these artificial surfaces within the uas based imagery for improving et estimation instead of conventional auto selection of adequate field hot and cold pixels which are not always available 2 materials and methods 2 1 determining artificial reference surfaces 2 1 1 stationary study site the first phase of this research was conducted for two years 2017 and 2018 at the irrigated agriculture research and extension center iarec of washington state university wsu in prosser washington 46 15 09 3 n 119 44 16 7 w prosser is in the semiarid region of washington with an average annual precipitation of 155 9 mm based on historical data 2002 2022 an experiment was set up in august 2017 for 16 continuous days to find portable and artificial hot and cold reference surfaces to include within the limited field of view of uas based imagery and represent the temperature dynamics of dry bare soil and fully irrigated and fully transpiring ryegrass in 2018 the experimental measurements were made on 15 random days from may to october to test the experiment over a wide range of weather conditions the location of this experiment was chosen away from shadows and away from obstacles to the wind even though alfalfa is the et reference crop etr for scaling the instantaneous to daily et in the metric model planting and growing alfalfa in a portable tray as a fully irrigated healthy crop for the whole of the growing season was difficult so fully irrigated healthy ryegrass was used in this experiment to find the representative artificial cold reference surfaces short grass is also a commonly used reference crop for estimating evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 and it was used in this study for ease of growth potential transportability and comparison when compared to alfalfa this idea was supported by a previous study in bushland texas where the pixels of a grass reference surface was used as the coldest pixel with the highest ndvi value for et estimation of a cotton field at the high resolution airborne imagery paul et al 2013 therefore in both years of the experiment ryegrass sod was planted in 0 5 0 36 m plastic trays and was fully irrigated fi for use as a natural cold reference surface also a tray full of bare dry agricultural soil was used as the hot reference surface ds four types of artificial cold surfaces were studied in 2017 these included clear water in the box c1 a 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 05 m sponge floating in a plastic tray full of water c2 a white granite tile on top of polystyrene foam that was floating in the box full of water c3 and a terra cotta pottery saucer plate 20 cm in diameter full of water depth in it c4 for the artificial hot reference surfaces three trays of the same size were filled with dry wheat straw h1 one tray of grass was left to fully dry as a non transpiring grass h2 dry red mulch h3 a 0 4 m 0 3 m piece of black rubber h4 coconut fiber mat h5 and a dry terra cotta saucer h6 were used fig 1 b few more reference surfaces were added to the experiment in 2018 such as a light green sponge c2 with the dimension of 0 3 m 0 4 m 0 05 m and a larger 31 cm diameter terra cotta saucer c4 were used while the references c1 and c3 were the same as in the first year of the study to simulate a plant s leaf two pieces of light c5 and dark green c6 cotton fabric were sandwiched between round wooden embroidery hoops 0 25 m diameter and were stabilized above the ground using wooden sticks water was sprayed on the fabric regularly during data collection in addition to the hot reference surfaces of the first year of the study a wooden tile h7 and the same artificial dry leaves in dark green h8 and light green h9 cotton fabric were created fig 1 c but they were not sprayed with water 2 1 2 thermal imaging acquisition in both years an infrared radiometric thermal imaging sensor tau 2 640 flir systems wilsonville or usa with the resolution of 640 512 pixels was used to monitor the temperature of these reference surfaces this thermal imager sensor was set up to collect images at one minute intervals and it was powered with a portable charger power bank ravpower china model rp pb19 and capacity of 16000 mah the imager sensor was faced directly downward in a nadir and it was mounted on the agricultural utility vehicle auv with a rectangular mast floatograph em series usa that could go up to eight meters above the ground fig 1 a as uas based thermal imagery for water stress detection is usually conducted at solar noon 1 00 pm the thermal images were captured from 11 00 am to 3 00 pm solar noon 2 h since the area of study is largely vegetated and included well irrigated crops an average emissivity of 0 97 was set within the thermal camera configurations for retrieving closer to actual surface temperature the selected value is based on the literature reporting that the emissivity for a well irrigated vegetation tends towards unity while that for the non arid type soils are between 0 96 and 0 98 jin and liang 2006 with a maximum possible variation within 10 in addition metric has a minimal dependency on actual emissivity and it negates any systematic uncertainty in surface temperature retrieval through its internal calibration process allen et al 2007a 2007b 2 1 3 image processing thermal imagery data were preprocessed with the thermoviewer software version 2 1 4 teax technology wilnsdorf germany to extract image frames from tmc to csv format from each day of data collection nine image frames at 30 min intervals were extracted from the captured images a custom algorithm was developed in matlab r2018a mathworks inc natick ma usa for reformatting the selected image from csv to tiff the thermal image and blue band were imported into quantum geographic information systems qgis version 2 18 4 for georeferencing and resampling the gis thermal raster layer was georeferenced with the blue band of the multispectral image each thermal raster was calibrated steps explained in section 2 2 3 then two sized rectangular shapefile layers were created as regions of interest roi to use for feature extraction of the pixels within the rois the average temperature withing the roi of each object was extracted using the zonal statistics tool in qgis 2 2 application of artificial reference surfaces for small uas 2 2 1 field site to test the selected artificial hot and cold reference surfaces an experiment was set up at a field 46 15 4 n 119 44 18 w in wsu iarec prosser washington usa for the 2021 growing season the crop under this experiment was a 3 year old native spearmint this study site was located next to an agweathernet station prosser site agweathernet washington state university wa usa this field was irrigated by a linear move irrigation system valley 8000 series model valley ne usa moving north to south and irrigating with two spans fig 2 the native spearmint under this study was irrigated with the eastern span that was equipped with low elevation spray application lesa having nozzles 1 5 m apart from each other and 0 3 m distance above the ground level to avoid wind drift and evaporation of water the experimental design was split blocks with 6 blocks in which three irrigation levels were applied north to south as the main variable and 5 nitrogen levels were applied from east to west as the subplot variables so each block was divided into 15 plots 9 m by 6 m different nozzle sizes were used to apply different irrigation levels nelson usa 3nv 19 for 125 17 for 100 and 14 for 75 irrigation levels to each block the nitrogen levels include 4 application rates of ammonium sulfate ams nh4 2so4 at 150 7

treatment and after grass root development they were irrigated with the linear move system at the same rates as the spearmint crop fig 2 to observe changes in soil water content neutron access probes were installed in the middle of each plot of grass 2 2 2 small uas based image acquisition campaigns a small uas ati agbot aerial technology international or usa was used with different onboard sensors table 1 the flight mission was configured at an altitude of 60 m above the ground level agl and image capturing at 85 and 80 front and side overlaps respectively the geospatial resolutions of the multispectral and thermal infrared images were obtained at 4 cm pixel 1 and 7 cm pixel 1 respectively white alphabetically labeled cardboard and rectangular aluminum pieces were used as ground sample points gsp to mark different treatment plots in the field for image preprocessing fig 2 on each day of uas data acquisition the selected reference surfaces from the experiment in section 2 1 wet sponge floating in the water terra cotta saucer full of water as cold surfaces and dry terra cotta saucer plate dry red mulch as the hot reference surfaces were carried out to the field 1 h before data acquisition to allow temperature stabilization of the reference materials with the environment fig 2c after image acquisition from the whole field the uas hovered approximately 10 meter over the reference surfaces to capture a few images for generating a thermal orthomosaic fig 2d 2 2 3 calibration of thermal infrared imaging sensor both thermal imaging sensors flir tau 2 used in the study of section 2 1 and flir pro duo r were calibrated using a blackbody instrument omega engineering hot cold blackbody calibration source model bb701 norwalk ct usa the thermal imaging sensor was mounted on the tripod facing horizontally at a 10 meter distance from the blackbody fig 3 the temperature of the blackbody was changed from 0 to 60 c and then from 60 to 0 c in 5 c intervals three images were captured from the blackbody surface at each setting temperature thermal images were analyzed to extract the temperature of the blackbody from each image at each set temperature to create the linear equation of the radiometric calibration plot the calibration equations for the flir tau 2 were y 1 15x 6 77 and for the flir pro duo r was y 1 197x 2 22 where x was the mean sensed temperature from the image and y was the black body temperature these linear equations from the calibration plot were input into the raster calculator to correct the sensed temperature for each pixel to generate the calibrated raster of thermal infrared sensed temperatures 2 2 4 aerial imagery preprocessing and data preparation image preprocessing steps like image stitching georeferencing and resampling are described in the previous publication of chandel et al 2020a in addition to these the calibrated thermal infrared images were created following the step described in section 2 2 3 for each day of uas imagery a dataset with surface temperature orthomiosaic and five surface reflectance orthomosaics b g r nir re was created at the ground sampling distance gsd of 3 9 cm pixel 1 a digital elevation

data acquisition in the summer june to september 2021 two sizes of rectangular rois were created to extract mean pixel temperature of the artificial reference surfaces for use with the uas imagery data these were compared with the temperatures of grasses at the southern side of the field and with dry bare soil 2 2 5 uas metric implementation nine days of uas imagery datasets collected in the summer of 2021 june 7th and 17th july 21st august 5th 12th 18th 20th 24th and 26th were used for generating uas metric maps with different modifications the uas based metric model is explained in detail in the previous publication by chandel et al chandel et al 2020b and illustrated in fig 4 this model was adapted from the satellite based metric allen et al 2007a 2007b and is modified to make it applicable for high resolution imagery fig 4 shows different methods of selecting hot and cold pixels discussed by allen et al 2007a 2007b for satellite based metric m1 auto selection of hot and cold pixels m2 allen et al 2013 and auto selection of hot and cold pixels in water r package m3 olmedo et al 2016 chandel et al 2020b in this paper the generated etc maps with the m3 method are named autocalibration for the first implementation of the uas metric model in this paper m4 fig 4 pixel temperature of artificial hot and cold reference surfaces was used to create a csv file which contains the x y coordinates of 5 10 pixels of the selected hot and cold reference surfaces and the temperature of the representative pixels in degrees kelvin to extract the features of the different hot and cold pixels a point shapefile layer was created over the selected hot and cold anchor surfaces of the thermal raster then using the vector toolbar regular points in qgis one point was created over each pixel using geometry attribute and point sampling tools the coordinates and temperature of the desired pixels were then extracted for each day of imagery acquisition six csv files were created each file contains pixel information of one source of the hot reference surfaces dry red mulch dry bare soil dry terra cotta saucer plate and one source of cold reference surfaces sponge floating in water wet terra cotta saucer plate water in the canal and canopy of over irrigated spearmint 125 plots at western side of the field the current version of the uas metric model chandel et al 2020a 2021 molaei et al 2022 based on the landsat metric model allen et al 2007a 2007b assumes that the evapotranspiration of the cold pixel etc cold is 5 greater than alfalfa based reference evapotranspiration etr as calculated by on the ground weather data allen et al 2007a 2007b tasumi 2003 tasumi et al 2005 for each day of uas aerial imagery the uas metric model was run for seven different scenarios with different methods of selection of hot and cold pixels therefore for 9 days of uas aerial imagery from the summer of 2021 63 different et maps were generated only one of the scenarios from each day used the auto selection of hot and cold pixel for the internal calibration of the model the others used deliberately selected hot and cold reference pixels fig 5 shows all 19 different generated et maps for just one day of uas imagery 2 2 6 evaluating the performance of etc estimation using the artificial reference surfaces the estimated etc from the uas metric model runs were evaluated against actual etc from two independent methods in one approach etc was acquired using a soil water balance based on soil moisture sensors and monitored changes in the soil water content within 24 h of the time the uas imagery was taken these 24 hour soil water balance data had a lot of inherent variability but without weighing lysimeter data available in research field this data was used for doing this comparison as a second method the actual etc of uas metric was generated by manually selecting field existing hot and cold pixels dry bare agricultural soil and a full crop canopy growing without soil moisture limitations in the study area to approximate the etc as validated by other researchers chandel et al 2021 this estimated etc using field existing hot and cold pixels that were at the desired reference conditions and was compared with the etc based on different artificial hot and cold pixels changes in the soil water content within 24 h were measured by installing two soil moisture sensors teros10 meter group pullman wa usa at a depth of 15 cm and 60 cm in the same location block 3 in the 100 irrigation level treatments the period of measuring changes in soil water content with these sensors was from 0 00 am of the day with uas data imagery to 23 59 pm of the same day this period of measuring soil water content overlapped with the period of extrapolated instantaneous to daily et the installed deep soil moisture sensor was also used for assuring there is no water movement to deep percolation during etc estimation period by soil water balance swb fig 2 as a second method of measuring soil water content an on site calibrated neutron moisture probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobe instrotek inc nc usa was also used for estimating swb etc an access tube was installed in each irrigation treatment of the 100 ams nitrogen treatment of all six blocks fig 2 neutron readings were done at the depths of 15 30 46 and 61 cm the soil moisture measurements were taken in block 3 of the 100 irrigation treatments from 10 00 am of the day that uas imagery was collected at solar noon to 10 00 am of the next day 24 h after the first measurement although this period was not completely over lapped with the period of extrapolation of et by uas metric model it covers the majority of the time that crop evapotranspiration is high etc at nighttime is negligible and we can observe changes in the soil water content actual et was estimated as 1 et c swb i p swc ro dp where etc swb is the evapotranspiration mm day 1 of spearmint during a 24 hour period on the day that the uas imagery was collected i is the depth of irrigation mm p is the precipitation mm ro is the runoff of water mm dp is deep percolation mm and δswc is the change in soil water content during the period of measurement all uas imagery data acquisition was done 2 3 days after the last irrigation event so the irrigation and precipitation were zero during the 24 h of measurement deep percolation was considered to be zero since irrigation was managed to replace less than the depleted soil moisture the installed teros 10 sensors below the root zone showed no soil water content increase indicating no deep percolation runoff was zero even during the irrigation events since water was applied at a rate lower than the infiltration rate of the soil 2 3 statistical analysis of outputs the extracted temperatures of the different hot and cold reference surfaces were compared with temperature of dry bare soil and fully irrigated grass section 2 1 3 using the pearson s correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 for all generated uas metric maps rois were selected over the spearmint crop around the installed neutron probe access tubes at block 3 100 irrigation treatment the average etc from the uas metric model was extracted using the zonal statistics tool and was compared with the etc swb using root mean squared error rmse 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of artificial hot and cold reference surfaces the results showed that the temperature of fully irrigated grass had the strongest pearson correlation coefficient r 0 93 with the temperature of the green sponge floating in a plastic tray full of water fig 5 a the coefficients for the shallow free water surface wet terra cotta saucer plate wet light green fabric and dry dark green fabric were 0 9 0 86 0 85 and 0 81 respectively the temperature of the white tile floating on wet polystyrene had the weakest correlation r 0 77 with the temperature of reference grass fig 5 d the dry red mulch and the wooden tile temperatures had the strongest correlation r 0 98 with the reference dry bare soil fig 6 the second best correlation was obtained with the dry terra cotta saucer plate and the non transpiring dry grass r 0 97 the other materials tested as artificial hot surfaces including dry straw black rubber coconut fiber light green and dark green fabric suspended above the ground were not well correlated with the dry bare soil 3 2 application of artificial hot and cold reference surfaces for small uas imagery the best artificial reference surfaces cold sponge floating in a water and terra cotta saucer plate full of water hot dry red mulch and dry terra cotta saucer plate selected from the 2017 18 experiments were placed within the field of view of the uas imagery of the spearmint field in 2021 in the 2021 experiment the temperature of the grass planted in the field and irrigated at the 100 etc rate had a strong correlation with the temperature of the saucer plate full of water r 0 91 and the wet sponge floating on the water tray r 0 91 for the of the entire season fig 7 within the image some soil was always dry and some was periodically wetted by the irrigation the temperature of the dry terra cotta saucer plate and dry red mulch was compared to the temperatures of these various bare soil surfaces within the uas imagery fig 7 table 2 results indicated that non irrigated soil had a strong correlation with the dry terra cotta saucer r 0 97 and the dry red mulch r 0 96 however the artificial reference surfaces were significantly cooler than the non irrigated soil fig 7 table 2 this might be explained by the fact that artificial hot and cold reference surfaces were placed on the top of damp soil which was irrigated at 125 of etc for the whole season near the spearmint crop fig 2 c and thus were in a microclimate with air that was cooled from evaporating soil and crops for the 2017 2018 experiments at the stationary site the tray of bare soil tray full of dry red mulch and dry saucer plate were placed on top of dry soil for the entire season 3 3 temperature comparisons of the selected hot and cold pixels fig 8 shows the average pixel temperatures of the manually selected hot and cold pixels used for the internal calibration of uas metric model among three sources of manually selected hot pixels non irrigated soil had the highest temperatures for all 9 days of this study although a dry saucer plate and dry red mulch were representative of hot artificial reference surfaces in 2017 2018 locating them on the damp soil near the spearmint field made them slightly cooler than dry bare soil among the four different manually selected cold pixels used the average temperature of artificial cold surfaces was 1 9 8 3 c warmer than the fully irrigated and fully transpiring spearmint canopy fig 8 this difference in temperature may be partially due to the taller height of the spearmint canopy allowing for additional cooling and evaporation of the canopy by air movements around the leaves while the artificial references were more sheltered also the tested artificial cold surfaces correlated well with irrigated grass that is known to use water at a significantly lower rate than well developed spearmint canopy the average temperature of the open water surface in the canal was cooler than the fully irrigated spearmint canopy and fully irrigated grass planted in the field fig 8 3 4 etc mapping using the various artificial reference surfaces compared to etc swb figs 9 and 10 show that the manual selection of field hot dry bare soil and cold fully irrigated spearmint canopy anchor temperatures resulted in higher estimation of etc r 0 96 0 94 and rmse 1 62 2 09 compared to the etc swb estimation by the neutron probe and teros 10 respectively etc maps generated using artificial hot and cold anchor pixels resulted in overestimation of etc when using dry saucer wet saucer r 0 96 0 95 and rmse 3 85 3 58 and dry red mulch wet sponge floating on the water r 0 95 0 94 and rmse 4 0 3 66 compared to the etc swb estimation by neutron probe and teros 10 respectively this overestimation of etc generated by the uas metric model is due to the higher temperature of the artificial cold surfaces wet saucer plate and wet sponge floating on the water respectively compared to the temperature of the fully irrigated spearmint canopy figs 8 and 9 using the temperature of the water in the canal as the cold anchor temperature caused underestimation of etc compared with etc swb whether the hot anchor temperature was from dry bare soil or dry red mulch there are uncertainties in et estimation based on neutron probe and the teros 10 soil water measurements which affect the magnitude of rmses reported fig 10 3 5 comparing uas metric etc using artificial and field selected anchor temperatures when using artificial cold and hot anchor temperatures from a wet sponge floating on water and from a dry red mulch respectively or from wet and dry saucer plates the etc is overestimated compared to using manually selected field anchor temperatures spearmint canopy and non irrigated soil fig 11 a b in these two cases the rmses are the highest although the linear correlations are better than the other two the lowest rmse was found when dry red mulch was used as the artificial hot reference temperature fig 11 d application of the dry red mulch in the absence of dry bare soil in the field of view of uas based imagery can resolve the difficulty of finding hot anchor pixels from a bare agricultural soil molaei et al 2022 this difficulty of identifying reliable hot pixel within the satellite imagery from a humid region was also discussed by choi et al 2009 for the et estimation using the metric and sebal models the results of our study were not comparable to previous research studies that used the cimec approach suggested by allen et al 2013 or the exhaustive search algorithm esa method bhattarai et al 2017 dhungel and barber 2018 peddinti and kisekka 2022 wagner wolff et al 2022 this is because these methods rely on finding hot and cold pixels based on the ndvi albedo and surface temperature ts within the extent of the image however within the field of view of uas based imagery this methods cannot guarantee locating the appropriate hot and cold pixels at the required reference conditions molaei et al 2022 mokhtari et al 2021 suggested a multi sensor data fusion approach msdf et that eliminated the need for the uas based thermal imagery and the step of selection of hot and cold pixels for et estimation by sharpening the modis lst products to landsat resolution however our study found that the artificial reference surfaces used in this study particularly the cold surfaces were not suitable for estimating etc using uas metric therefore more research studies are needed to identify artificial cold reference surfaces with temperatures closer to the fully irrigated crop canopies 4 summary and conclusions because of the limited field of view of uas based images the inclusion of hot and cold pixels at the required reference conditions cannot be guaranteed this paper is an attempt to investigate a potential solution for this using artificial hot and cold reference surfaces for the internal calibration of the uas metric model in this study a variety of different reference surfaces were tested and compared with fully irrigated short ryegrass and dry bare agricultural soil the results of a two year experiment 2017 2018 showed that the temperatures of a green sponge 0 05 m thickness floating in a plastic tray full of water and of a terra cotta saucer plate full of water were strongly correlated with the temperature of fully irrigated ryegrass in addition a dry terra cotta saucer plate and dry red mulch were highly correlated with non irrigated bare soil in 2021 these artificial hot and cold reference surfaces were placed in the field of view of uas collected imagery in a native spearmint field along with planted patches of short ryegrass the artificial hot reference surfaces were cooler compared to the non irrigated soil surfaces likely due to the placement of the artificial hot reference surfaces on the top of moist irrigated soil during the growing season the artificial cold reference surfaces in the spearmint field were between 1 9 and 8 3 c warmer than the fully irrigated non stressed spearmint canopy using a dry red mulch hot pixel with a wet sponge cold pixel and a dry terra cotta saucer plate hot pixel with a terra cotta saucer plate with shallow water in it cold pixel as artificial surfaces for internal calibration of the uas metric model resulted in overestimating etc compared to using the temperatures of manually selected dry bare soil and a fully irrigated spearmint canopy from the field as the hot cold pixels ideal approach or when compared with etc estimations based on the soil water balance measured by neutron probe and teros 10 sensors therefore the artificial reference surfaces in this study especially the cold surfaces were not suitable for estimation of etc using uas metric additional research is needed to identify artificial cold reference surfaces with temperatures closer to the fully irrigated crop canopies in the meantime maintaining a well irrigated section of the field for use as the cold anchor temperature and a dry bare soil as the hot anchor pixel is recommended funding this project was supported in part by the united state department of agriculture national institute of food and

8911,the metric energy balance model requires the temperature of a hot dry bare agricultural soil and cold fully transpiring crop surfaces for the internal calibration and estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc a previous study indicated that because of the limited field of view of uas based imagery the application of unmanned aerial systems uas based metric could not guarantee the availability of representative hot and cold pixels in the field of view of the flight mission even if the pixels were manually chosen a study was conducted for two years 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the suitability of various artificial and portable hot dry red mulch dry terra cotta saucer plate coconut fiber wheat straw and cold surface of water wet terra cotta saucer plate green sponge and white granite tile on top of polystyrene foam floating on water artificial surfaces for use in the calibration of the uas metric model the temperature of the surfaces was measured with a thermal infrared sensor mounted on a ground vehicle with a retractable mast up to 7 m facing downward to capture images at around the nadir hours 11 am to 3 pm the results showed that a green sponge floating in a water tray and a dry terra cotta saucer plate full of water best matched rwet sponge 0 93 rwet saucer 0 86 the temperature dynamics of fully irrigated short grass dry red mulch and a dry terra cotta saucer plate best matched rdry red mulch 0 98 rdry saucer 0 97 the temperature dynamics of bare and dry agricultural soil these artificial hot and cold reference surfaces were then located within a field of view of nine different uas flight missions over a spearmint field during the summer of 2021 although the temperatures of the cold artificial surfaces correlated well with fully irrigated short grass planted near the spearmint field they were 1 9 8 3 c warmer than the taller spearmint crop canopy the temperature of a dry red mulch wet sponge and dry wet terra cotta saucer plate used as artificial hot cold anchor temperatures for et estimation by the uas metric model resulted in overestimating the etc obtained using field hot cold pixels dry bare soil fully irrigated spearmint or the etc estimation based on a soil water balance measured by neutron probe and teros 10 sensors the best hot cold temperatures for internal calibration of the uas based imagery et model are from dry soil and a fully irrigated canopy located in the field of view in the absence of dry bare soil within the image the use of dry red mulch is suggested additional research is needed to find artificial cold surfaces with temperatures closer to the temperature of fully irrigated canopies which can be conveniently located for auto selection within the images in the meantime for farm scale applications

peddinti and kisekka 2022 uas based energy balance models are modified versions of satellite based energy balance models like mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a 2007b and spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi geli and neale 2012 neale et al 2012 bhatti et al 2020 that can be used for estimating etc at higher spatial resolution chandel et al 2020 2021 originally users of metric manually selected hot and cold pixels within the satellite imagery whose temperatures were used as anchor for the internal calibration of the model pixels from dry bare agricultural soil hot anchor temperature and fully irrigated vegetation cold anchor temperature were selected based on their normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and temperature allen et al 2007a 2007b however manually selecting these anchor temperatures was time consuming and required experienced users having a good background of the energy balance and radiation physics and vegetation indices allen et al 2011 and variation between practitioners caused large uncertainties to the et estimation allen et al 2011 long et al 2011 therefore the auto selection of hot and cold pixels with the cimec calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions processes was introduced into the metric model by allen et al 2013 however this resulted in a 10 20 lower accuracy of et estimation compared to the manual selection of the extreme anchor pixels by experienced operators choi et al 2009 paul et al 2013 allen et al 2013 the uas metric model named as uasm 2 by chandel et al chandel et al 2020a is an adapted version of the landsat based metric model that modified some functions of the water r package an implementation of the metric model olmedo et al 2016 et estimation with uas based imagery compared with satellite based imagery for irrigated spearmint potatoes and alfalfa using the metric methods resulted in a root mean square error rmse in a range of 0 2 2 7 mm day 1 chandel et al 2020a 2021 this difference is based on the comparison between the output of the landsat metric and the uas metric model which has been explained by the poor selection of hot and cold anchor pixels for the uas based metric model chandel et al 2020a these studies chandel et al 2020b 2021 used the auto selection of hot and cold pixels for the internal calibration of the model however in the case of uas metric the auto selection of reliable hot and cold pixels is problematic in the limited field of view of the imagery molaei et al 2022 choi et al 2009 also expressed the difficulty finding hot anchor pixels from a bare agricultural soil in humid regions within satellite imagery that similarly caused problems for accurate et estimation given the uncertainties associated with the selection of cold and hot pixels for uas based etc estimation this study aimed to 1 test various artificial hot and cold reference surfaces that can represent the temperature dynamics of a dry bare soil and fully transpiring ryegrass and 2 test the effect of the application of these artificial surfaces within the uas based imagery for improving et estimation instead of conventional auto selection of adequate field hot and cold pixels which are not always available 2 materials and methods 2 1 determining artificial reference surfaces 2 1 1 stationary study site the first phase of this research was conducted for two years 2017 and 2018 at the irrigated agriculture research and extension center iarec of washington state university wsu in prosser washington 46 15 09 3 n 119 44 16 7 w prosser is in the semiarid region of washington with an average annual precipitation of 155 9 mm based on historical data 2002 2022 an experiment was set up in august 2017 for 16 continuous days to find portable and artificial hot and cold reference surfaces to include within the limited field of view of uas based imagery and represent the temperature dynamics of dry bare soil and fully irrigated and fully transpiring ryegrass in 2018 the experimental measurements were made on 15 random days from may to october to test the experiment over a wide range of weather conditions the location of this experiment was chosen away from shadows and away from obstacles to the wind even though alfalfa is the et reference crop etr for scaling the instantaneous to daily et in the metric model planting and growing alfalfa in a portable tray as a fully irrigated healthy crop for the whole of the growing season was difficult so fully irrigated healthy ryegrass was used in this experiment to find the representative artificial cold reference surfaces short grass is also a commonly used reference crop for estimating evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 and it was used in this study for ease of growth potential transportability and comparison when compared to alfalfa this idea was supported by a previous study in bushland texas where the pixels of a grass reference surface was used as the coldest pixel with the highest ndvi value for et estimation of a cotton field at the high resolution airborne imagery paul et al 2013 therefore in both years of the experiment ryegrass sod was planted in 0 5 0 36 m plastic trays and was fully irrigated fi for use as a natural cold reference surface also a tray full of bare dry agricultural soil was used as the hot reference surface ds four types of artificial cold surfaces were studied in 2017 these included clear water in the box c1 a 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 05 m sponge floating in a plastic tray full of water c2 a white granite tile on top of polystyrene foam that was floating in the box full of water c3 and a terra cotta pottery saucer plate 20 cm in diameter full of water depth in it c4 for the artificial hot reference surfaces three trays of the same size were filled with dry wheat straw h1 one tray of grass was left to fully dry as a non transpiring grass h2 dry red mulch h3 a 0 4 m 0 3 m piece of black rubber h4 coconut fiber mat h5 and a dry terra cotta saucer h6 were used fig 1 b few more reference surfaces were added to the experiment in 2018 such as a light green sponge c2 with the dimension of 0 3 m 0 4 m 0 05 m and a larger 31 cm diameter terra cotta saucer c4 were used while the references c1 and c3 were the same as in the first year of the study to simulate a plant s leaf two pieces of light c5 and dark green c6 cotton fabric were sandwiched between round wooden embroidery hoops 0 25 m diameter and were stabilized above the ground using wooden sticks water was sprayed on the fabric regularly during data collection in addition to the hot reference surfaces of the first year of the study a wooden tile h7 and the same artificial dry leaves in dark green h8 and light green h9 cotton fabric were created fig 1 c but they were not sprayed with water 2 1 2 thermal imaging acquisition in both years an infrared radiometric thermal imaging sensor tau 2 640 flir systems wilsonville or usa with the resolution of 640 512 pixels was used to monitor the temperature of these reference surfaces this thermal imager sensor was set up to collect images at one minute intervals and it was powered with a portable charger power bank ravpower china model rp pb19 and capacity of 16000 mah the imager sensor was faced directly downward in a nadir and it was mounted on the agricultural utility vehicle auv with a rectangular mast floatograph em series usa that could go up to eight meters above the ground fig 1 a as uas based thermal imagery for water stress detection is usually conducted at solar noon 1 00 pm the thermal images were captured from 11 00 am to 3 00 pm solar noon 2 h since the area of study is largely vegetated and included well irrigated crops an average emissivity of 0 97 was set within the thermal camera configurations for retrieving closer to actual surface temperature the selected value is based on the literature reporting that the emissivity for a well irrigated vegetation tends towards unity while that for the non arid type soils are between 0 96 and 0 98 jin and liang 2006 with a maximum possible variation within 10 in addition metric has a minimal dependency on actual emissivity and it negates any systematic uncertainty in surface temperature retrieval through its internal calibration process allen et al 2007a 2007b 2 1 3 image processing thermal imagery data were preprocessed with the thermoviewer software version 2 1 4 teax technology wilnsdorf germany to extract image frames from tmc to csv format from each day of data collection nine image frames at 30 min intervals were extracted from the captured images a custom algorithm was developed in matlab r2018a mathworks inc natick ma usa for reformatting the selected image from csv to tiff the thermal image and blue band were imported into quantum geographic information systems qgis version 2 18 4 for georeferencing and resampling the gis thermal raster layer was georeferenced with the blue band of the multispectral image each thermal raster was calibrated steps explained in section 2 2 3 then two sized rectangular shapefile layers were created as regions of interest roi to use for feature extraction of the pixels within the rois the average temperature withing the roi of each object was extracted using the zonal statistics tool in qgis 2 2 application of artificial reference surfaces for small uas 2 2 1 field site to test the selected artificial hot and cold reference surfaces an experiment was set up at a field 46 15 4 n 119 44 18 w in wsu iarec prosser washington usa for the 2021 growing season the crop under this experiment was a 3 year old native spearmint this study site was located next to an agweathernet station prosser site agweathernet washington state university wa usa this field was irrigated by a linear move irrigation system valley 8000 series model valley ne usa moving north to south and irrigating with two spans fig 2 the native spearmint under this study was irrigated with the eastern span that was equipped with low elevation spray application lesa having nozzles 1 5 m apart from each other and 0 3 m distance above the ground level to avoid wind drift and evaporation of water the experimental design was split blocks with 6 blocks in which three irrigation levels were applied north to south as the main variable and 5 nitrogen levels were applied from east to west as the subplot variables so each block was divided into 15 plots 9 m by 6 m different nozzle sizes were used to apply different irrigation levels nelson usa 3nv 19 for 125 17 for 100 and 14 for 75 irrigation levels to each block the nitrogen levels include 4 application rates of ammonium sulfate ams nh4 2so4 at 150 7 kg ha 67 225 kg ha 100 254 25 kg ha 133 375 75 kg ha 167 and one level of urea ch4n2o at 225 kg ha 100 actual nitrogen on the south side of the field ryegrass sod was planted under each irrigation treatment and after grass root development they were irrigated with the linear move system at the same rates as the spearmint crop fig 2 to observe changes in soil water content neutron access probes were installed in the middle of each plot of grass 2 2 2 small uas based image acquisition campaigns a small uas ati agbot aerial technology international or usa was used with different onboard sensors table 1 the flight mission was configured at an altitude of 60 m above the ground level agl and image capturing at 85 and 80 front and side overlaps respectively the geospatial resolutions of the multispectral and thermal infrared images were obtained at 4 cm pixel 1 and 7 cm pixel 1 respectively white alphabetically labeled cardboard and rectangular aluminum pieces were used as ground sample points gsp to mark different treatment plots in the field for image preprocessing fig 2 on each day of uas data acquisition the selected reference surfaces from the experiment in section 2 1 wet sponge floating in the water terra cotta saucer full of water as cold surfaces and dry terra cotta saucer plate dry red mulch as the hot reference surfaces were carried out to the field 1 h before data acquisition to allow temperature stabilization of the reference materials with the environment fig 2c after image acquisition from the whole field the uas hovered approximately 10 meter over the reference surfaces to capture a few images for generating a thermal orthomosaic fig 2d 2 2 3 calibration of thermal infrared imaging sensor both thermal imaging sensors flir tau 2 used in the study of section 2 1 and flir pro duo r were calibrated using a blackbody instrument omega engineering hot cold blackbody calibration source model bb701 norwalk ct usa the thermal imaging sensor was mounted on the tripod facing horizontally at a 10 meter distance from the blackbody fig 3 the temperature of the blackbody was changed from 0 to 60 c and then from 60 to 0 c in 5 c intervals three images were captured from the blackbody surface at each setting temperature thermal images were analyzed to extract the temperature of the blackbody from each image at each set temperature to create the linear equation of the radiometric calibration plot the calibration equations for the flir tau 2 were y 1 15x 6 77 and for the flir pro duo r was y 1 197x 2 22 where x was the mean sensed temperature from the image and y was the black body temperature these linear equations from the calibration plot were input into the raster calculator to correct the sensed temperature for each pixel to generate the calibrated raster of thermal infrared sensed temperatures 2 2 4 aerial imagery preprocessing and data preparation image preprocessing steps like image stitching georeferencing and resampling are described in the previous publication of chandel et al 2020a in addition to these the calibrated thermal infrared images were created following the step described in section 2 2 3 for each day of uas imagery a dataset with surface temperature orthomiosaic and five surface reflectance orthomosaics b g r nir re was created at the ground sampling distance gsd of 3 9 cm pixel 1 a digital elevation model dem was generated based on multispectral imagery to consider variable elevation slope and aspect per pixel also a csv file with weather parameters solar radiation rs w m 2 wind speed m s 1 relative humidity rh air temperature c and precipitation mm at 15 min intervals within 24 h of the uas imagery collection was created from the prosser site agweathernet station next to the field this data was used in the uas metric model to estimate hourly alfalfa based reference evapotranspiration etr mm day 1 allen et al 2005 for scaling the instantaneous etinst to daily et24 h for 14 days of data acquisition in the summer june to september 2021 two sizes of rectangular rois were created to extract mean pixel temperature of the artificial reference surfaces for use with the uas imagery data these were compared with the temperatures of grasses at the southern side of the field and with dry bare soil 2 2 5 uas metric implementation nine days of uas imagery datasets collected in the summer of 2021 june 7th and 17th july 21st august 5th 12th 18th 20th 24th and 26th were used for generating uas metric maps with different modifications the uas based metric model is explained in detail in the previous publication by chandel et al chandel et al 2020b and illustrated in fig 4 this model was adapted from the satellite based metric allen et al 2007a 2007b and is modified to make it applicable for high resolution imagery fig 4 shows different methods of selecting hot and cold pixels discussed by allen et al 2007a 2007b for satellite based metric m1 auto selection of hot and cold pixels m2 allen et al 2013 and auto selection of hot and cold pixels in water r package m3 olmedo et al 2016 chandel et al 2020b in this paper the generated etc maps with the m3 method are named autocalibration for the first implementation of the uas metric model in this paper m4 fig 4 pixel temperature of artificial hot and cold reference surfaces was used to create a csv file which contains the x y coordinates of 5 10 pixels of the selected hot and cold reference surfaces and the temperature of the representative pixels in degrees kelvin to extract the features of the different hot and cold pixels a point shapefile layer was created over the selected hot and cold anchor surfaces of the thermal raster then using the vector toolbar regular points in qgis one point was created over each pixel using geometry attribute and point sampling tools the coordinates and temperature of the desired pixels were then extracted for each day of imagery acquisition six csv files were created each file contains pixel information of one source of the hot reference surfaces dry red mulch dry bare soil dry terra cotta saucer plate and one source of cold reference surfaces sponge floating in water wet terra cotta saucer plate water in the canal and canopy of over irrigated spearmint 125 plots at western side of the field the current version of the uas metric model chandel et al 2020a 2021 molaei et al 2022 based on the landsat metric model allen et al 2007a 2007b assumes that the evapotranspiration of the cold pixel etc cold is 5 greater than alfalfa based reference evapotranspiration etr as calculated by on the ground weather data allen et al 2007a 2007b tasumi 2003 tasumi et al 2005 for each day of uas aerial imagery the uas metric model was run for seven different scenarios with different methods of selection of hot and cold pixels therefore for 9 days of uas aerial imagery from the summer of 2021 63 different et maps were generated only one of the scenarios from each day used the auto selection of hot and cold pixel for the internal calibration of the model the others used deliberately selected hot and cold reference pixels fig 5 shows all 19 different generated et maps for just one day of uas imagery 2 2 6 evaluating the performance of etc estimation using the artificial reference surfaces the estimated etc from the uas metric model runs were evaluated against actual etc from two independent methods in one approach etc was acquired using a soil water balance based on soil moisture sensors and monitored changes in the soil water content within 24 h of the time the uas imagery was taken these 24 hour soil water balance data had a lot of inherent variability but without weighing lysimeter data available in research field this data was used for doing this comparison as a second method the actual etc of uas metric was generated by manually selecting field existing hot and cold pixels dry bare agricultural soil and a full crop canopy growing without soil moisture limitations in the study area to approximate the etc as validated by other researchers chandel et al 2021 this estimated etc using field existing hot and cold pixels that were at the desired reference conditions and was compared with the etc based on different artificial hot and cold pixels changes in the soil water content within 24 h were measured by installing two soil moisture sensors teros10 meter group pullman wa usa at a depth of 15 cm and 60 cm in the same location block 3 in the 100 irrigation level treatments the period of measuring changes in soil water content with these sensors was from 0 00 am of the day with uas data imagery to 23 59 pm of the same day this period of measuring soil water content overlapped with the period of extrapolated instantaneous to daily et the installed deep soil moisture sensor was also used for assuring there is no water movement to deep percolation during etc estimation period by soil water balance swb fig 2 as a second method of measuring soil water content an on site calibrated neutron moisture probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobe instrotek inc nc usa was also used for estimating swb etc an access tube was installed in each irrigation treatment of the 100 ams nitrogen treatment of all six blocks fig 2 neutron readings were done at the depths of 15 30 46 and 61 cm the soil moisture measurements were taken in block 3 of the 100 irrigation treatments from 10 00 am of the day that uas imagery was collected at solar noon to 10 00 am of the next day 24 h after the first measurement although this period was not completely over lapped with the period of extrapolation of et by uas metric model it covers the majority of the time that crop evapotranspiration is high etc at nighttime is negligible and we can observe changes in the soil water content actual et was estimated as 1 et c swb i p swc ro dp where etc swb is the evapotranspiration mm day 1 of spearmint during a 24 hour period on the day that the uas imagery was collected i is the depth of irrigation mm p is the precipitation mm ro is the runoff of water mm dp is deep percolation mm and δswc is the change in soil water content during the period of measurement all uas imagery data acquisition was done 2 3 days after the last irrigation event so the irrigation and precipitation were zero during the 24 h of measurement deep percolation was considered to be zero since irrigation was managed to replace less than the depleted soil moisture the installed teros 10 sensors below the root zone showed no soil water content increase indicating no deep percolation runoff was zero even during the irrigation events since water was applied at a rate lower than the infiltration rate of the soil 2 3 statistical analysis of outputs the extracted temperatures of the different hot and cold reference surfaces were compared with temperature of dry bare soil and fully irrigated grass section 2 1 3 using the pearson s correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 for all generated uas metric maps rois were selected over the spearmint crop around the installed neutron probe access tubes at block 3 100 irrigation treatment the average etc from the uas metric model was extracted using the zonal statistics tool and was compared with the etc swb using root mean squared error rmse 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of artificial hot and cold reference surfaces the results showed that the temperature of fully irrigated grass had the strongest pearson correlation coefficient r 0 93 with the temperature of the green sponge floating in a plastic tray full of water fig 5 a the coefficients for the shallow free water surface wet terra cotta saucer plate wet light green fabric and dry dark green fabric were 0 9 0 86 0 85 and 0 81 respectively the temperature of the white tile floating on wet polystyrene had the weakest correlation r 0 77 with the temperature of reference grass fig 5 d the dry red mulch and the wooden tile temperatures had the strongest correlation r 0 98 with the reference dry bare soil fig 6 the second best correlation was obtained with the dry terra cotta saucer plate and the non transpiring dry grass r 0 97 the other materials tested as artificial hot surfaces including dry straw black rubber coconut fiber light green and dark green fabric suspended above the ground were not well correlated with the dry bare soil 3 2 application of artificial hot and cold reference surfaces for small uas imagery the best artificial reference surfaces cold sponge floating in a water and terra cotta saucer plate full of water hot dry red mulch and dry terra cotta saucer plate selected from the 2017 18 experiments were placed within the field of view of the uas imagery of the spearmint field in 2021 in the 2021 experiment the temperature of the grass planted in the field and irrigated at the 100 etc rate had a strong correlation with the temperature of the saucer plate full of water r 0 91 and the wet sponge floating on the water tray r 0 91 for the of the entire season fig 7 within the image some soil was always dry and some was periodically wetted by the irrigation the temperature of the dry terra cotta saucer plate and dry red mulch was compared to the temperatures of these various bare soil surfaces within the uas imagery fig 7 table 2 results indicated that non irrigated soil had a strong correlation with the dry terra cotta saucer r 0 97 and the dry red mulch r 0 96 however the artificial reference surfaces were significantly cooler than the non irrigated soil fig 7 table 2 this might be explained by the fact that artificial hot and cold reference surfaces were placed on the top of damp soil which was irrigated at 125 of etc for the whole season near the spearmint crop fig 2 c and thus were in a microclimate with air that was cooled from evaporating soil and crops for the 2017 2018 experiments at the stationary site the tray of bare soil tray full of dry red mulch and dry saucer plate were placed on top of dry soil for the entire season 3 3 temperature comparisons of the selected hot and cold pixels fig 8 shows the average pixel temperatures of the manually selected hot and cold pixels used for the internal calibration of uas metric model among three sources of manually selected hot pixels non irrigated soil had the highest temperatures for all 9 days of this study although a dry saucer plate and dry red mulch were representative of hot artificial reference surfaces in 2017 2018 locating them on the damp soil near the spearmint field made them slightly cooler than dry bare soil among the four different manually selected cold pixels used the average temperature of artificial cold surfaces was 1 9 8 3 c warmer than the fully irrigated and fully transpiring spearmint canopy fig 8 this difference in temperature may be partially due to the taller height of the spearmint canopy allowing for additional cooling and evaporation of the canopy by air movements around the leaves while the artificial references were more sheltered also the tested artificial cold surfaces correlated well with irrigated grass that is known to use water at a significantly lower rate than well developed spearmint canopy the average temperature of the open water surface in the canal was cooler than the fully irrigated spearmint canopy and fully irrigated grass planted in the field fig 8 3 4 etc mapping using the various artificial reference surfaces compared to etc swb figs 9 and 10 show that the manual selection of field hot dry bare soil and cold fully irrigated spearmint canopy anchor temperatures resulted in higher estimation of etc r 0 96 0 94 and rmse 1 62 2 09 compared to the etc swb estimation by the neutron probe and teros 10 respectively etc maps generated using artificial hot and cold anchor pixels resulted in overestimation of etc when using dry saucer wet saucer r 0 96 0 95 and rmse 3 85 3 58 and dry red mulch wet sponge floating on the water r 0 95 0 94 and rmse 4 0 3 66 compared to the etc swb estimation by neutron probe and teros 10 respectively this overestimation of etc generated by the uas metric model is due to the higher temperature of the artificial cold surfaces wet saucer plate and wet sponge floating on the water respectively compared to the temperature of the fully irrigated spearmint canopy figs 8 and 9 using the temperature of the water in the canal as the cold anchor temperature caused underestimation of etc compared with etc swb whether the hot anchor temperature was from dry bare soil or dry red mulch there are uncertainties in et estimation based on neutron probe and the teros 10 soil water measurements which affect the magnitude of rmses reported fig 10 3 5 comparing uas metric etc using artificial and field selected anchor temperatures when using artificial cold and hot anchor temperatures from a wet sponge floating on water and from a dry red mulch respectively or from wet and dry saucer plates the etc is overestimated compared to using manually selected field anchor temperatures spearmint canopy and non irrigated soil fig 11 a b in these two cases the rmses are the highest although the linear correlations are better than the other two the lowest rmse was found when dry red mulch was used as the artificial hot reference temperature fig 11 d application of the dry red mulch in the absence of dry bare soil in the field of view of uas based imagery can resolve the difficulty of finding hot anchor pixels from a bare agricultural soil molaei et al 2022 this difficulty of identifying reliable hot pixel within the satellite imagery from a humid region was also discussed by choi et al 2009 for the et estimation using the metric and sebal models the results of our study were not comparable to previous research studies that used the cimec approach suggested by allen et al 2013 or the exhaustive search algorithm esa method bhattarai et al 2017 dhungel and barber 2018 peddinti and kisekka 2022 wagner wolff et al 2022 this is because these methods rely on finding hot and cold pixels based on the ndvi albedo and surface temperature ts within the extent of the image however within the field of view of uas based imagery this methods cannot guarantee locating the appropriate hot and cold pixels at the required reference conditions molaei et al 2022 mokhtari et al 2021 suggested a multi sensor data fusion approach msdf et that eliminated the need for the uas based thermal imagery and the step of selection of hot and cold pixels for et estimation by sharpening the modis lst products to landsat resolution however our study found that the artificial reference surfaces used in this study particularly the cold surfaces were not suitable for estimating etc using uas metric therefore more research studies are needed to identify artificial cold reference surfaces with temperatures closer to the fully irrigated crop canopies 4 summary and conclusions because of the limited field of view of uas based images the inclusion of hot and cold pixels at the required reference conditions cannot be guaranteed this paper is an attempt to investigate a potential solution for this using artificial hot and cold reference surfaces for the internal calibration of the uas metric model in this study a variety of different reference surfaces were tested and compared with fully irrigated short ryegrass and dry bare agricultural soil the results of a two year experiment 2017 2018 showed that the temperatures of a green sponge 0 05 m thickness floating in a plastic tray full of water and of a terra cotta saucer plate full of water were strongly correlated with the temperature of fully irrigated ryegrass in addition a dry terra cotta saucer plate and dry red mulch were highly correlated with non irrigated bare soil in 2021 these artificial hot and cold reference surfaces were placed in the field of view of uas collected imagery in a native spearmint field along with planted patches of short ryegrass the artificial hot reference surfaces were cooler compared to the non irrigated soil surfaces likely due to the placement of the artificial hot reference surfaces on the top of moist irrigated soil during the growing season the artificial cold reference surfaces in the spearmint field were between 1 9 and 8 3 c warmer than the fully irrigated non stressed spearmint canopy using a dry red mulch hot pixel with a wet sponge cold pixel and a dry terra cotta saucer plate hot pixel with a terra cotta saucer plate with shallow water in it cold pixel as artificial surfaces for internal calibration of the uas metric model resulted in overestimating etc compared to using the temperatures of manually selected dry bare soil and a fully irrigated spearmint canopy from the field as the hot cold pixels ideal approach or when compared with etc estimations based on the soil water balance measured by neutron probe and teros 10 sensors therefore the artificial reference surfaces in this study especially the cold surfaces were not suitable for estimation of etc using uas metric additional research is needed to identify artificial cold reference surfaces with temperatures closer to the fully irrigated crop canopies in the meantime maintaining a well irrigated section of the field for use as the cold anchor temperature and a dry bare soil as the hot anchor pixel is recommended funding this project was supported in part by the united state department of agriculture national institute of food and

8912,in this study a simulation based multi objective two level optimization decision making approach is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation improving irrigation water productivity and controlling regional accumulated salts techniques of multi objective programming two level programming and simulation model of water and salt physical movement process are incorporated into the modeling framework the simulated processes are parameterized and calibrated with field experimental data while the optimization model is used to generate optimal solutions though predefined objectives and the associated constraints this model is applied to a case study on irrigation water allocation in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in hetao irrigation district northwest china firstly the study area is delineated into several homogeneous irrigation decision making units idmus for better characterizing their spatial variability because it s spatially heterogeneous afterwards decomposition coordination algorithm is introduced to solve such an integrated simulation based multi objective two level optimization model finally optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation for different crops during crop growth periods in different idmus can be obtained for supporting sustainable strategies of irrigation the results can achieve balanced tradeoffs between different stakeholders i e the upper level decision makers and the lower level farmers and between conflicting economic objectives and environmental objectives moreover optimal solutions have a slight increase in economic returns over the baseline scenario i e status quo but the irrigation water productivity is increased by nearly 60 due to less irrigation water used regional accumulated salts can be controlled because the soil salinity is constrained within the predetermined salt accumulation constraint therefore these findings can provide evidence for efficient use of irrigation water resources and further support of sustainable irrigated agriculture keywords irrigation decision making unit different stakeholders two level programming decomposition and coordination algorithm simulated process irrigated agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest water user consuming 70 of the world s total water use elliott et al 2014 qin et al 2019 liu et al 2022 especially in arid or semi arid regions where agriculture is the dominant sector in the northwest arid region of china agricultural irrigation accounts for more than 90 of the total agricultural water consumption zhou et al 2020 improving irrigation water productivity is a vital priority to ensure water resources and food security and promote sustainable agricultural development kang et al 2017 therefore how to improve irrigation water productivity and further effectively allocate irrigation water resources is a major concern for policy makers li et al 2019 besides unreasonable irrigation water management have already resulted in water wastage non uniform irrigation and irrigation induced soil salinization therefore it is necessary to consider economic returns and environment related objective simultaneously when optimizing irrigation water allocation in previous studies optimal agricultural water allocation models have mostly taken crop yields or economic returns from agricultural production as their study objectives shangguan et al 2002 sethi et al 2006 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2018a b yao et al 2019 luo et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2023 in fact optimization of agricultural water resources is a complex multi objective problem that requires to weigh the competing relationships among economic social and environmental objectives if only a single objective is considered it will inevitably lead to unbalanced irrigation decisions therefore multi objective programming can be used to achieve a desirable balance regarding agricultural economic and environmental concerns within the modeling framework however whether mathematical technique is single objective or multi objective model the structure of the model and decision making usually aggregate the different decision makers into a single layered manner and sequential decisions among decision objectives are ignored chen et al 2020 when solving the multi objective problems the priority of each objective is generally judged by the selected weights which naturally gives rise to subjective discrepancy in practice the decision making objectives of the agricultural systems with conflicting desired goals such as economic benefits and environmental objectives which originate from different stakeholders and require to make decision in a sequential manner from the upper level to lower level therefore these different stakeholders can be characterized as the leader and follower and layered programming can address the tradeoffs among different stakeholders shivaie and ameli 2015 many studies have focused on two level programming or multi level programming to reflect hierarchical structure for the problems of water resources management li et al 2015 agricultural production planning zhang et al 2019a agricultural planting strategy formulation zhang et al 2019b and sustainable agricultural water management zhang et al 2019c although the above methods can address conflicting objectives and deal with tradeoffs among different stakeholders previous optimization models seldom consider the spatial variability and physical processes of agricultural hydrological cycle components singh and panda 2012 generally agricultural hydrological process models were used to describe detailed soil water salt movement processes that have been driving crop yields and irrigation water productivity li et al 2020 this is because crop yield is closely related to crop evapotranspiration which is directly determined by the two main factors including soil water content and salinity in the crop root zone without considering the effects of pests diseases and ferritization on crop growth these interactions in turn affect the soil water and salt balance in the crop root zone combining the dynamic processes associated with crop growth and their interactions into the optimization models can more accurately characterize the changes of hydrological elements within the optimized results liu et al 2019 therefore integrated simulation optimization model is a potential method for addressed these issues darshana et al 2012 dehghanipour et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2022 in general both conceptual water balance model and numerical simulation model e g swat arnold et al 2012 swap van dam 2000 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 can be incorporated into the optimization models to tackle the dynamic responses of physical process and make management strategy decisions furthermore for regional scale irrigation water optimization studies there is inherently spatial heterogeneity in regional crop planting pattern and hydrological elements e g soil types and texture groundwater depth soil water content cibin and chaubey 2015 jiang et al 2021 how to combine the above spatial distribution information with the hydrological process of farmland into the optimization model for optimal irrigation water allocation is a worthwhile problem nevertheless few studies have been undertaken on the integrations of multiple objectives layered programming and physical processes considering spatial variability in response to above issues this study presents a simulation based multi objective two level optimization model for irrigation water allocation for major crops in arid agricultural zone it s developed through integrating optimization module of multi objective programming and two level programming and simulation module of hydrological processes of water and salt movement thus it has the following advantages in 1 balancing tradeoff between different stakeholders i e the upper level and the lower and between conflicting economic objectives and environmental objective 2 illustrating physical variations of water and salt movement in different idmus 3 generating optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation in a comprehensive and hierarchical manner and 4 achieving regional salt control at harvest through pre determined salt accumulation constraint the integrated simulation optimization model is then applied to a case study in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in hetao irrigation district northwest china for supporting optimal irrigation water allocation decomposition coordination algorithm is introduced to solve it to generate optimal solutions this study aims at allocating irrigation water improving irrigation water productivity and controlling regional accumulated salts through optimal strategies finally the results of the study are expected to contribute to formulate irrigation water allocation solutions to promote sustainable irrigated agriculture the remainder of this paper is organized below section 2 presents the study system including overview of the study area delineation of idmus and model structure analysis section 3 introduces model formulation and application that includes the mathematical expressions of the developed model model solution and data preparation in section 4 optimal solutions are presented analyzed and further discussed section 5 concludes the main findings of this paper 2 study system 2 1 overview of the study area hetao irrigation district hid is one of the three major irrigation districts in china 106 20 109 19 e 40 19 41 18 n it s located in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region and the upper reaches of the yellow river basin it is about 270 km long from east to west and 40 75 km wide from north to south with a total area of 11900 km2 of which the arable land is 5700 km2 the hid is an arid zone with an average annual precipitation of less than 200 mm and an annual potential evaporation of 2100 mm the region has abundant land light and heat resources and it s an important national production base for grain and edible oil water from the yellow river is the basic source for agricultural development in the region and irrigation plays a crucial role in supporting agricultural production and improving the agro ecological environment in this study the jiefangzha irrigation subarea is selected as the study area and its controlled irrigation area is 1420 km2 see fig 1 the annual amount of water diverted by the study area is approximately 1 2 109 m3 the topography of the study area is relatively flat with a slight slope of about 0 02 there are three main canals under public control namely wulahe yangjiahe and huangji 13 sub trunk canals and three main drainage ditches traditional irrigation methods are mainly used so the phenomenon of water seepage in the process of irrigation and water diversion is serious resulting in shallow groundwater depth that has fluctuated between 1 4 and 2 4 m for a long time the study area is suitable for planting high quality agricultural products due to its climatic conditions spring wheat maize and sunflower are the main crops accounts for more than 85 of the total sown area in this study only the above three crops are considered and other crops are analyzed approximately fig 2 shows the land use types and crop spatial distribution of jiefangzha irrigation subarea based on remote sensing data 30 m 30 m in fact the contribution of groundwater recharge to crop water requirements and crop growth cannot be ignored in the arid irrigation area with shallow groundwater this is because the water movement processes of irrigation water soil water groundwater and crop water consumption are frequently occurring and soil water and salt in the crop root zone are subject to their joint interactions these dynamic processes directly affect the soil water and salt conditions in the crop root zone which in turn affects crop growth and crop yield accordingly the process of soil water salt movement in the crop root zone affects the state of groundwater water salt balance conversely changes in the groundwater depth continue to affect the soil water salt variability in the crop root zone the water cycle process as an important part of the optimal allocation of irrigation water directly determines optimal allocation plans and restricts the feasibility of the decision solutions therefore it is essential to integrate the water movement processes into optimization allocation of irrigation water 2 2 delineation of idmus firstly the jiefangzha irrigation subarea is defined as an irrigation system and then the study area is delineated into 44 idmus by arcgis spatial analysis based on the spatial distributions and controlled areas of the main canals second level canals idmus from number 1 9 10 21 and 22 28 29 44 are controlled by wula river yangjia river canal qinghui sub canal and huangji canal respectively therefore these idmus are considered as the basic units for irrigation water management see fig 1 in other words this way of delineating idmus reflects the spatial distribution characteristics of the study system thus making the results more realistic also the crop area of the idmu extracted from fig 2 is shown in table 1 2 3 model structure analysis this study attempts to determine optimal decision solutions of irrigation water allocation for different crops during the crop growth period by integrating sequential decision from irrigation area to each idmu the whole study area is considered as a system that includes with various idmus and each idmu is independent that contains farmlands with different crops controlled irrigation water sources and soil types in general an irrigation system is dominated by a main canal and several idmus that are controlled by the corresponding sub canals jiang et al 2016 thus two layered optimization regarding different stakeholders can be conceptualized as irrigation management for different idmus and different crops in each idmu in terms of the modeling framework the upper level decision makers and the lower level farmers are considered as different stakeholders whose decisions are sequentially made specifically decision makers are more concerned with environmental goals such as minimal water seepage or low pollution emissions but farmers are more mindful of greater economic returns the desired goals of the upper level and the lower level are in competition for example minimal water seepage of canal systems means that the least possible amount of irrigation water is delivered from water inlet to agricultural farmland understandably farmers expect to irrigate more water for higher crop yields and economic benefits decision variables regarding the water seepage are related to the environmental sector at the upper level objective and decision variables regarding economic benefits are determined by the economic sector at the lower level objective these decisions are readily made by the layered model i e two level programming by using the amount of water allocated for irrigation in each idmu as the coordination variables of the model the whole system is coordinated through these variables in other words the upper level decision makers provide some information to the lower level stakeholders and then lower level stakeholders make decisions according to its own individual interests or preferences based on this information thus the upper layer decision makers make final decisions in the global interest based on this feedback in addition there is now a requirement for higher irrigation water productivity and thus the model has multiple competing objective functions such a model becomes structured as a hierarchical decision with multiple objectives at the upper and lower levels furthermore to optimize the allocation of irrigation water resources for irrigation system with several idmus it is thus a multi objective allocation problem because multiple conflicting factors need to be considered environmental economic and other factors are integrated into the model framework in a comprehensive and hierarchical manner instead of aggregating them into a single objective function or grouping them to the same level of decision making therefore through integration of simulation of water and salt movement processes the modeling framework of simulation based multi objective two level programming for the irrigation water allocation is illustrated in fig 3 3 model formulation and application the detailed description of the developed model is presented below 3 1 upper level scheduling model the study area is irrigated by diverting yellow river water to the fields through canal systems the canal systems are divided into multi level sub canals and the total length of the whole canal systems is relatively long thus a considerable proportion of irrigation water is lost due to seepage in the canal systems during water conveyance here the environmental concern is considered as the upper level model through minimizing the amount of canal seepage of the whole irrigation system 1 m i n f q l o s s n 1 n σ n l n q n g n maincanalseepage n 1 n q n g n 1 η n z q n g n η n z 1 η n d q n g n η n z η n d 1 η n f sub

optimal allocation of irrigation water among the three major crops and at different stages of crop growth these objectives are more concerned with issues of economic benefits and irrigation water productivity which are of immediate interest to farmers 1 maximum economic benefits for each idmu 2 max f 1 j 1 j n b j y m j 1 k y j 1 e t n j e t m n j a n j c w j 1 j t 1 t i w n j t a n j n 2

relationship between water resources input and output and it is an important indicator that is used to balance the need to alleviate water shortages and maintain high agricultural yields table 3 shows

precipitation groundwater rise and deep percolation groundwater water salt balance module includes groundwater rise deep percolation drainage and canal seepage canal conveyance losses are an important water loss item in the irrigation process and a major source of groundwater recharge the water salt balance calculation process for each crop under each idmu is presented as follows 7 w n j t 1 w n j

salinity concentration varies within the main fluctuation range of the groundwater table for groundwater salts enter the groundwater with water seepage from the root zone while salt export is due to drainage and evaporation therefore salt balance of soil body and groundwater aquifers is expressed as 18 r s t 1 r s t i w t s y e t g t s g t r e t s c t 19 g s t 1 g s t e t g t d e t s g t r e t s

decompose the complex system into several associated idmus according to the objective forming a recursive structure each idmu selects the optimal one and then adjusts the feedback information according to the overall goal layer by layer and finally obtains the global optimal solution thus the model can accommodate both global and individual interests the detail solution steps are summarized as follows 1 the amount of water diverted for irrigation in the idmu q m n is set as intermediate variable between upper and lower level models it s pre determined from the upper level decision makers to solve the model the initial values of q m n is taken as water flow of the canal which is determined from canal flows monitoring data during the study period afterwards by solving the lower level model through nsga ii algorithm and multi objective fuzzy preference method see appendix a optimal water allocation solutions i m n j t o p t for different crops and growth stages and objective function values f 1 n and f 2 n for different idmus can be firstly obtained and the first solution is initialized if the constraint is not satisfied then adjust the constraint until a feasible solution is available 2 the optimized results of the lower level objectives are passed to the upper level model to calculate its objective function values calculate the allocated water for each idmu for the upper level irrigation system and feedback to the lower level objectives as updated irrigation availability constraints at this point the algorithm introduce variability to explore new solutions 3 then determine whether the new solution set meets the following convergence criteria 24 f q m m 1 f q m m f q m m δ where m denotes the times of iterations f q m m 1 and f q m m are the optimized objective values of the upper level mode at m 1 and m iterations δ is the maximum tolerance between two iterations and it s set to 0 01 in this study 4 if the stopping criteria is reached stop if not repeat the above steps the flow chart of solution process can be seen in fig 4 3 5 model parameters and data preparation the meteorological data is obtained from the national meteorological station since there is only one meteorological unit in the entire study area the meteorological data for each idmu is the same during optimization three main crops including spring wheat maize and sunflower are considered the growing periods of spring wheat maize and sunflower are march 25 july 15 april 21 september 15 and may 19 september 15 respectively thus the study period is set from march to september covering the entire growth period of all crops the field capacity of soil water wilting point initial soil water content and initial soil electrical conductivity for each idmu are obtained from measured data these data are obtained by using the measured data from 22 soil water and salt sampling points in the study area its value at each idmu is determined separately by spatial analysis on arcgis crop prices are determined based on market surveys and farmer visits and water prices are based on data provided by management departments table 5 lists basic parameters of canal systems and drainage which are referred to the results of liu et al 2020 tables 6 7 present input parameters for the model and some initial values to drive the model the current irrigation schedule of each crop is shown in table 8 and it was also considered as the baseline scenario in this study canal operation data seepage loss coefficients of main and sub trunk canals are collected from administrative departments 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation by solving the developed simulation based multi objective two level optimization model optimal results of irrigation water allocation at the whole irrigation system and each idmu are obtained fig 5 shows optimal results of water allocation at 44 idmus optimal solutions show that the water allocation for each idmu is lower than allowable water diversion which means that the total allocated water is within the allowable canal diversion limits thus the allocation solution is feasible and practical in actual operation it is noted that the irrigation water allocation of some idmus is still available from the maximum allowable diversion especially at idmus 19 and 21 therefore to further improve irrigation economic benefits and irrigation water productivity the canals shall be used effectively to increase their water delivery capacity with modification or expansion figs 6 and 7 present the optimized total irrigation amount for different crops at each idmu and optimal monthly irrigation amount for each crop at each idmu respectively the results show that the total irrigation amount at each idmu is lower than that of the current irrigation conditions i e baseline scenario 0 this is because the upper level scheduling model focuses on environmental concern through minimizing the amount of canal seepage of the whole irrigation system clearly optimal solutions can provide water managers with pathways to water savings potential for different idmus there are large differences in irrigation water volumes for different months for the three main crops within each idmu which are mainly due to the spatial distribution of soil and canal systems the different soil parameters groundwater depth and canal water supply capacity in each idmu therefore optimal solution of irrigation water allocation can provide decision support based on the tradeoffs between the upper level managers and the lower level farmers for making irrigation planning strategies moreover table 9 lists the water allocation of the corresponding four sub trunk canals in the study area the overall water allocation in the irrigation area throughout the crop growth stage is 516 106 m3 which is 27 less than the total water diversion of 705 106 m3 in the study area during the whole crop growth period from march to september for each sub trunk canals the results show that the percentage of water savings ranges between 24 and 30 compared with the baseline scenario indicating that optimal solutions allow for a reduction in the amount of water diverted while ensuring that the crop yield does not suffer a significant yield reduction 4 2 optimal economic benefits and irrigation water productivity fig 8a compares the economic benefits of the 44 idmus from the developed model and baseline scenario the results show that the total economic benefits of the whole irrigation system are not greatly increased through optimizing irrigation water allocation and the economic benefits of 1 755 109 yuan are slightly larger than the current situation of 1 732 109 yuan with a relative change of 1 3 specifically the idmu with the highest economic benefits in the irrigation area are located in the northern yangjiahe canal and downstream of the huangji canal idmus 21 41 and 42 in general there is a direct relationship between crop yield and crop water requirement however there is no significant correlation between crop water requirements and economic benefits in these areas based on the crop distribution from fig 2 there are probably two reasons the first one is that these idmus are the three largest area in all idmus i e 12 144 ha 6554 ha and 6286 ha the second is the larger area of sunflower cultivation as economic crop within these idmus i e 1798 ha 2509 ha and 2107 ha sunflower has been grown within the study area because of its higher salt tolerance and one third of the local farmers income comes from sunflower cultivations fig 8b illustrates the irrigation water productivity of the idmus for the optimized and current situations the maximum value of irrigation water productivity obtained by the developed model is 3 85 kg m3 idmu 43 and the minimum value is 1 22 kg m3 idmu 7 while the mean value is 1 80 kg m3 in contrast the maximum value of irrigation water productivity under the current situation is 1 59 kg m3 idmu 44 and the minimum value and mean value are 0 84 kg m3 idmu 21 and 1 12 kg m3 respectively the results show that the optimized irrigation water productivity has improved significantly with the average value increasing from 1 12 kg m3 to 1 80 kg m3 a relative increase of 60 7 in addition the spatial variability of irrigation water productivity under the current conditions is not significant that is almost 70 of the idmus have results in the range of 1 0 1 5 kg m3 however these optimized results varied significantly across idmus due to the spatial variability of the irrigation allocation solutions obtained by the model based on above analysis optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation show that these results can reduce water diversions for irrigation and improve irrigation water productivity while ensuring that crop yields are not greatly reduced the pareto front solutions for the two lower level objectives are shown in fig 9 the x axis shows optimal objective values of irrigation water productivity while the y axis shows of optimal objective values of economic benefits these optimal solutions are non dominated to each other but are superior to the rest of solutions in the search space fig 9 shows that this curve is characterized by an inverse proportional function indicating that each solution includes one objective inferior to another solution in pareto set although both objectives are superior to others in the rest of decision space specifically the two objectives of the pareto solution set present a game relationship the closer the solution to the x axis irrigation water productivity objective is superior while the closer the solution to the y axis presents the better for the economic benefits this is also consistent with the actual situation for example the pursuit of maximum economic benefits will inevitably increase the amount of irrigation water use which will lead to a decrease in irrigation water productivity conversely if irrigation water productivity is maximized economic benefits will be impaired while irrigation water utilization is reduced moreover excessive pursuit of irrigation water productivity will restrain crop growth and seriously affect food production in addition the results show that economic benefits are stabilized after irrigation water productivity is greater than 10 kg m3 therefore the above analysis shows that the results can balance these conflicting objectives 4 3 variation of groundwater depth and soil salinization fig 10 shows the changes of groundwater depth during the whole crop growth period a negative change in groundwater depth indicates a decrease in groundwater level at the end of the crop growth period compared to the beginning of growth and an increase in groundwater depth and vice versa in areas with shallow groundwater the groundwater table is a key factor in controlling soil salinity declining groundwater levels are directly related to the accumulation of soil salts under the optimal irrigation allocation scheme the groundwater level decreases significantly due to less irrigation amount and thus salt in the crop root zone cannot be leached into groundwater aquifers leading to a higher degree of soil salinity accumulation on the contrary the groundwater level generally increased under the baseline scenario and the degree of soil salinity accumulation becomes low from the fig 10 the change of spatial distribution of groundwater depth in the idmu under the optimized scheme is basically the same as the baseline scenario however the groundwater depth increases based on optimized schemes while the groundwater depth decreases under the baseline scenario this is due to the large amount of irrigation water under the baseline scenario and the large amount of canal seepage and deep percolation which largely recharges the groundwater and causes the groundwater level to increase fig 11 illustrates the results of soil salinity accumulation in the whole study area when soil salinity accumulation is greater than 0 which indicates an increase in salinity during crop growth period otherwise the opposite from the results the soil salinity accumulation under the optimized scheme although within the constraints is more severe than the baseline scenario with about 60 of the idmus at 0 03 0 06 g kg of salinity accumulation under the baseline scenario due to the severe local soil salinity large irrigation quota with high amount of irrigation water is generally employed to mitigate the negative effects of soil salinity on crop growth but this also causes problems of increased groundwater mineralization and wasted water resources in addition the results show that soil salinity cannot satisfy the pre given constraint of soil salinity accumulation in the southwestern part of the study area which can be explained by that these places are close to the drainage ditches and groundwater mineralization is relatively high in summary the results can be weighed against the problem of positive and negative effects in terms of soil salinization irrigation water usage and economic benefits that is the positive effect is the increase of economic benefits and saving of irrigation water and the negative effect is the problem of soil salinization caused by the accumulation of accumulated soil salts 4 4 discussion the results of irrigation water optimization in jiefangzha irrigation subarea under shallow groundwater environments show that the developed simulation based multi objective two level optimization decision making approach is an effective and practical method for managing irrigation water improving irrigation water productivity and controlling salt accumulation there are three advantages in handing such a complex difficulty firstly through delineating the study area into homogeneous idmus based on the spatial distributions and controlled areas of the main canals second level canals then each idmu is considered as the basic units for irrigation management which can better reflect spatial variability secondly water and salt movement processes among irrigation water soil water and groundwater are incorporated into the optimization model to enhance its applicability which can generate dynamic decisions considering their physical interactions thirdly three objectives associated with environmental and economic objectives and different stakeholders i e the upper level decision makers and the lower level farmers can effectively reduce the complexity of regional optimization problems in this model each level is solved independently but their interaction between subsystems the lower level and irrigation system the upper level is considered through coordination variables in the optimization process compared with previous studies the application of the above method is not only flexible in calculation but also can better consider the coordination of interests among different levels in the irrigation system and the impact of various environmental factors this study optimizes irrigation water allocation to different crop growth stages within different idmus using the baseline scenario as a comparison the solving efficiency is high with almost no computational burden because the model has few objective functions and solving method has logical solution steps in terms of input data they are collected from government reports websites and published literatures and the data are reliable the initial values of the model are obtained from the measured data however there are still some uncertainties to be noted for example uncertainties mainly arise from simplifications in the model conceptualization such as resampling of crop spatial distribution delineation of idmu limited by meteorological data these simplifications may have affected the accuracy of results in some regions furthermore other factors including irrigation method total planted area crop type and canal water loss are assumed to be unchanged in this study at each optimization consequently future work will focus on obtaining spatial distribution information of crops soil type groundwater and salinity with high temp spatial resolution to acquire more accurate model data and ensure the validity of simulation models and reliability of optimized results 5 conclusion a simulation based multi objective two level optimization irrigation water allocation model has been developed for managing irrigation water resources techniques of multi objective programming two level programming and simulation model of agricultural hydrological process are incorporated into the general modeling framework the structure of the model is such that the upper and lower levels have their own objective functions and constraints it s capable of optimizing irrigation water allocation spatially and temporally for major crops because the study area is delineated into 44 uniform idmus through decomposition coordination algorithm optimal solutions for each idmu can be readily generated therefore the results will enable the allocation of irrigation water to different crop growth stages within the idmu under the rigid water resources constraints thus effectively supporting balanced irrigation water management among multiple objectives and upper and lower levels this study has the following findings 1 optimal irrigation water allocation for each idmu is less than the baseline scenario while the economic benefits are slightly increased and irrigation water productivity is obviously improved 2 the average percentage of canal seepage for different idmus is nearly 40 and the amount of canal seepage is related to the area of idmu 3 most of groundwater depths of idmus under optimized scenario show a negative growth trend but groundwater depth in the baseline scenario is basically becoming shallower 4 it is noted that approximately 86 of the idmus have soil salinity accumulation of less than 0 1 g kg and soil salinization is within controllable limits this study attempts to solve the issues of multi objective different stakeholders and hydrological processes based on the integrated simulation optimization modeling framework without losing generality the model is more applicable to arid agricultural areas in terms of sustainable development of irrigated agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

number 52009133 and 52130902 the authors are grateful to the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions for the improvement the paper appendix a in this study the nsga ii algorithm is used to solve the model and optimal solution sets are obtained instead of a single optimal solution which can provide more choices for decision making therefore how to make best decisions in the set of feasible solutions is also the core problem in the study of optimal allocation of agricultural water resources the fuzzy preference method is used to investigate the superiority and inferiority of decision making by combining fuzzy set theory the basis of multi objective fuzzy preference is to establish the objective systems and determine their weights and fuzzy membership function in fuzzy set theory can be used as a bridge to link the objective systems and optimal solutions the calculation of fuzzy membership function is used to judge the degree of merit of different solutions thus quantifying the fuzzy information then the purpose of converting the multi objective problem into a comprehensive single objective problem is achieved finally optimal solutions can be determined after the comprehensive single objective comparison the detailed steps are presented as follows for a problem with preference if there are n solutions in the objective systems forming the set of solutions d d 1 d 2 d n and multi objective sets are g g 1 g 2 g n the attribute value of solution d i for objective g i is x i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m and matrix x x i j denotes the feature matrix of m objectives for n solutions 25 x x i j x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n when standardizing the objective systems the following equations should be used for the calculation of objectives whose attributes are benefit based and risk based respectively 26 w h e n i t s a b e n e f i t b a s e d o b j e c t i v e r i j x i j min x i j max x i j min x i j j 27 w h e n i t s a r i s k b a s e d o b j e c t i v e r i j max x i j x i j max x i j min x i j j then the feature matrix can be transformed into the corresponding relative membership matrix by standardization 28 r r i j r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n if the maximum and minimum values of each row in matrix 28 are extracted separately they can be expressed as the ideal optimal solution and ideal worst solution 29 r g r g 1 r g 2 r g m max r 1 i max r 2 i max r m i 1 1 1 30 r b r b 1 r b 2 r b m min r 1 i min r 2 i min r m i 0 0 0 each solution to be preferred has a certain affiliation to optimal or worst one the more optimal solution is called the superiority degree denoted by u g i and the more inferior solution is called the inferiority degree denoted by u b i in multi objective preference each objective has different attributes and different importance for the preference so it is necessary to assign weights to the objectives ω i it s expressed as 31 ω ω 1 ω 2 ω m t 32 i 1 m ω i 1 moreover for any objective the vector of relative superiority values s h for each level h from level 1 to level c is defined 33 s s h c h c 1 1 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 1 0 thus the full form of the multi objective multi level fuzzy preference model is presented 34 μ h j 0 1 k 1 c i 1 m w i r i j s h 2 i 1 m w i r i j s k 2 1 where j 1 2 n and h 1 2 c using the above eq 34 optimal relative membership matrix for the set of solutions attributed to each level can be obtained 35 u u h j u 11 u 12 u 1 n u 21 u 22 u 2 n u c 1 u c 2 u c n h 1 2 c j 1 2 n then the vector of h at each level is used to prefer the set of solutions 36 h 1 2 c u h j h 1 h 2 h n finally h min min h j is selected as the most optimal solutions from multi objective decision solutions it is worth noting that when performing the preference calculation the level c 2 is required in this study to improve the accuracy of the preference decision c 5 is chosen 
8912,in this study a simulation based multi objective two level optimization decision making approach is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation improving irrigation water productivity and controlling regional accumulated salts techniques of multi objective programming two level programming and simulation model of water and salt physical movement process are incorporated into the modeling framework the simulated processes are parameterized and calibrated with field experimental data while the optimization model is used to generate optimal solutions though predefined objectives and the associated constraints this model is applied to a case study on irrigation water allocation in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in hetao irrigation district northwest china firstly the study area is delineated into several homogeneous irrigation decision making units idmus for better characterizing their spatial variability because it s spatially heterogeneous afterwards decomposition coordination algorithm is introduced to solve such an integrated simulation based multi objective two level optimization model finally optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation for different crops during crop growth periods in different idmus can be obtained for supporting sustainable strategies of irrigation the results can achieve balanced tradeoffs between different stakeholders i e the upper level decision makers and the lower level farmers and between conflicting economic objectives and environmental objectives moreover optimal solutions have a slight increase in economic returns over the baseline scenario i e status quo but the irrigation water productivity is increased by nearly 60 due to less irrigation water used regional accumulated salts can be controlled because the soil salinity is constrained within the predetermined salt accumulation constraint therefore these findings can provide evidence for efficient use of irrigation water resources and further support of sustainable irrigated agriculture keywords irrigation decision making unit different stakeholders two level programming decomposition and coordination algorithm simulated process irrigated agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest water user consuming 70 of the world s total water use elliott et al 2014 qin et al 2019 liu et al 2022 especially in arid or semi arid regions where agriculture is the dominant sector in the northwest arid region of china agricultural irrigation accounts for more than 90 of the total agricultural water consumption zhou et al 2020 improving irrigation water productivity is a vital priority to ensure water resources and food security and promote sustainable agricultural development kang et al 2017 therefore how to improve irrigation water productivity and further effectively allocate irrigation water resources is a major concern for policy makers li et al 2019 besides unreasonable irrigation water management have already resulted in water wastage non uniform irrigation and irrigation induced soil salinization therefore it is necessary to consider economic returns and environment related objective simultaneously when optimizing irrigation water allocation in previous studies optimal agricultural water allocation models have mostly taken crop yields or economic returns from agricultural production as their study objectives shangguan et al 2002 sethi et al 2006 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2018a b yao et al 2019 luo et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2023 in fact optimization of agricultural water resources is a complex multi objective problem that requires to weigh the competing relationships among economic social and environmental objectives if only a single objective is considered it will inevitably lead to unbalanced irrigation decisions therefore multi objective programming can be used to achieve a desirable balance regarding agricultural economic and environmental concerns within the modeling framework however whether mathematical technique is single objective or multi objective model the structure of the model and decision making usually aggregate the different decision makers into a single layered manner and sequential decisions among decision objectives are ignored chen et al 2020 when solving the multi objective problems the priority of each objective is generally judged by the selected weights which naturally gives rise to subjective discrepancy in practice the decision making objectives of the agricultural systems with conflicting desired goals such as economic benefits and environmental objectives which originate from different stakeholders and require to make decision in a sequential manner from the upper level to lower level therefore these different stakeholders can be characterized as the leader and follower and layered programming can address the tradeoffs among different stakeholders shivaie and ameli 2015 many studies have focused on two level programming or multi level programming to reflect hierarchical structure for the problems of water resources management li et al 2015 agricultural production planning zhang et al 2019a agricultural planting strategy formulation zhang et al 2019b and sustainable agricultural water management zhang et al 2019c although the above methods can address conflicting objectives and deal with tradeoffs among different stakeholders previous optimization models seldom consider the spatial variability and physical processes of agricultural hydrological cycle components singh and panda 2012 generally agricultural hydrological process models were used to describe detailed soil water salt movement processes that have been driving crop yields and irrigation water productivity li et al 2020 this is because crop yield is closely related to crop evapotranspiration which is directly determined by the two main factors including soil water content and salinity in the crop root zone without considering the effects of pests diseases and ferritization on crop growth these interactions in turn affect the soil water and salt balance in the crop root zone combining the dynamic processes associated with crop growth and their interactions into the optimization models can more accurately characterize the changes of hydrological elements within the optimized results liu et al 2019 therefore integrated simulation optimization model is a potential method for addressed these issues darshana et al 2012 dehghanipour et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2022 in general both conceptual water balance model and numerical simulation model e g swat arnold et al 2012 swap van dam 2000 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 can be incorporated into the optimization models to tackle the dynamic responses of physical process and make management strategy decisions furthermore for regional scale irrigation water optimization studies there is inherently spatial heterogeneity in regional crop planting pattern and hydrological elements e g soil types and texture groundwater depth soil water content cibin and chaubey 2015 jiang et al 2021 how to combine the above spatial distribution information with the hydrological process of farmland into the optimization model for optimal irrigation water allocation is a worthwhile problem nevertheless few studies have been undertaken on the integrations of multiple objectives layered programming and physical processes considering spatial variability in response to above issues this study presents a simulation based multi objective two level optimization model for irrigation water allocation for major crops in arid agricultural zone it s developed through integrating optimization module of multi objective programming and two level programming and simulation module of hydrological processes of water and salt movement thus it has the following advantages in 1 balancing tradeoff between different stakeholders i e the upper level and the lower and between conflicting economic objectives and environmental objective 2 illustrating physical variations of water and salt movement in different idmus 3 generating optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation in a comprehensive and hierarchical manner and 4 achieving regional salt control at harvest through pre determined salt accumulation constraint the integrated simulation optimization model is then applied to a case study in the jiefangzha irrigation subarea in hetao irrigation district northwest china for supporting optimal irrigation water allocation decomposition coordination algorithm is introduced to solve it to generate optimal solutions this study aims at allocating irrigation water improving irrigation water productivity and controlling regional accumulated salts through optimal strategies finally the results of the study are expected to contribute to formulate irrigation water allocation solutions to promote sustainable irrigated agriculture the remainder of this paper is organized below section 2 presents the study system including overview of the study area delineation of idmus and model structure analysis section 3 introduces model formulation and application that includes the mathematical expressions of the developed model model solution and data preparation in section 4 optimal solutions are presented analyzed and further discussed section 5 concludes the main findings of this paper 2 study system 2 1 overview of the study area hetao irrigation district hid is one of the three major irrigation districts in china 106 20 109 19 e 40 19 41 18 n it s located in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region and the upper reaches of the yellow river basin it is about 270 km long from east to west and 40 75 km wide from north to south with a total area of 11900 km2 of which the arable land is 5700 km2 the hid is an arid zone with an average annual precipitation of less than 200 mm and an annual potential evaporation of 2100 mm the region has abundant land light and heat resources and it s an important national production base for grain and edible oil water from the yellow river is the basic source for agricultural development in the region and irrigation plays a crucial role in supporting agricultural production and improving the agro ecological environment in this study the jiefangzha irrigation subarea is selected as the study area and its controlled irrigation area is 1420 km2 see fig 1 the annual amount of water diverted by the study area is approximately 1 2 109 m3 the topography of the study area is relatively flat with a slight slope of about 0 02 there are three main canals under public control namely wulahe yangjiahe and huangji 13 sub trunk canals and three main drainage ditches traditional irrigation methods are mainly used so the phenomenon of water seepage in the process of irrigation and water diversion is serious resulting in shallow groundwater depth that has fluctuated between 1 4 and 2 4 m for a long time the study area is suitable for planting high quality agricultural products due to its climatic conditions spring wheat maize and sunflower are the main crops accounts for more than 85 of the total sown area in this study only the above three crops are considered and other crops are analyzed approximately fig 2 shows the land use types and crop spatial distribution of jiefangzha irrigation subarea based on remote sensing data 30 m 30 m in fact the contribution of groundwater recharge to crop water requirements and crop growth cannot be ignored in the arid irrigation area with shallow groundwater this is because the water movement processes of irrigation water soil water groundwater and crop water consumption are frequently occurring and soil water and salt in the crop root zone are subject to their joint interactions these dynamic processes directly affect the soil water and salt conditions in the crop root zone which in turn affects crop growth and crop yield accordingly the process of soil water salt movement in the crop root zone affects the state of groundwater water salt balance conversely changes in the groundwater depth continue to affect the soil water salt variability in the crop root zone the water cycle process as an important part of the optimal allocation of irrigation water directly determines optimal allocation plans and restricts the feasibility of the decision solutions therefore it is essential to integrate the water movement processes into optimization allocation of irrigation water 2 2 delineation of idmus firstly the jiefangzha irrigation subarea is defined as an irrigation system and then the study area is delineated into 44 idmus by arcgis spatial analysis based on the spatial distributions and controlled areas of the main canals second level canals idmus from number 1 9 10 21 and 22 28 29 44 are controlled by wula river yangjia river canal qinghui sub canal and huangji canal respectively therefore these idmus are considered as the basic units for irrigation water management see fig 1 in other words this way of delineating idmus reflects the spatial distribution characteristics of the study system thus making the results more realistic also the crop area of the idmu extracted from fig 2 is shown in table 1 2 3 model structure analysis this study attempts to determine optimal decision solutions of irrigation water allocation for different crops during the crop growth period by integrating sequential decision from irrigation area to each idmu the whole study area is considered as a system that includes with various idmus and each idmu is independent that contains farmlands with different crops controlled irrigation water sources and soil types in general an irrigation system is dominated by a main canal and several idmus that are controlled by the corresponding sub canals jiang et al 2016 thus two layered optimization regarding different stakeholders can be conceptualized as irrigation management for different idmus and different crops in each idmu in terms of the modeling framework the upper level decision makers and the lower level farmers are considered as different stakeholders whose decisions are sequentially made specifically decision makers are more concerned with environmental goals such as minimal water seepage or low pollution emissions but farmers are more mindful of greater economic returns the desired goals of the upper level and the lower level are in competition for example minimal water seepage of canal systems means that the least possible amount of irrigation water is delivered from water inlet to agricultural farmland understandably farmers expect to irrigate more water for higher crop yields and economic benefits decision variables regarding the water seepage are related to the environmental sector at the upper level objective and decision variables regarding economic benefits are determined by the economic sector at the lower level objective these decisions are readily made by the layered model i e two level programming by using the amount of water allocated for irrigation in each idmu as the coordination variables of the model the whole system is coordinated through these variables in other words the upper level decision makers provide some information to the lower level stakeholders and then lower level stakeholders make decisions according to its own individual interests or preferences based on this information thus the upper layer decision makers make final decisions in the global interest based on this feedback in addition there is now a requirement for higher irrigation water productivity and thus the model has multiple competing objective functions such a model becomes structured as a hierarchical decision with multiple objectives at the upper and lower levels furthermore to optimize the allocation of irrigation water resources for irrigation system with several idmus it is thus a multi objective allocation problem because multiple conflicting factors need to be considered environmental economic and other factors are integrated into the model framework in a comprehensive and hierarchical manner instead of aggregating them into a single objective function or grouping them to the same level of decision making therefore through integration of simulation of water and salt movement processes the modeling framework of simulation based multi objective two level programming for the irrigation water allocation is illustrated in fig 3 3 model formulation and application the detailed description of the developed model is presented below 3 1 upper level scheduling model the study area is irrigated by diverting yellow river water to the fields through canal systems the canal systems are divided into multi level sub canals and the total length of the whole canal systems is relatively long thus a considerable proportion of irrigation water is lost due to seepage in the canal systems during water conveyance here the environmental concern is considered as the upper level model through minimizing the amount of canal seepage of the whole irrigation system 1 m i n f q l o s s n 1 n σ n l n q n g n maincanalseepage n 1 n q n g n 1 η n z q n g n η n z 1 η n d q n g n η n z η n d 1 η n f sub

optimal allocation of irrigation water among the three major crops and at different stages of crop growth these objectives are more concerned with issues of economic benefits and irrigation water

simulation based processes are incorporated into the modeling framework to facilitate dynamic decision of irrigation water allocation 6 crop water demand constraints 21 e t a t e t a m t t 7 constraint of salt accumulation in the root zone it is assumed that salt accumulation should not exceed 0 64 g l during the crop growth period under sustainable agricultural development 22 s c n i t e n d s c i n i 0 64 8 non negative constraint 23 i m n j t 0 n j t the allocated irrigation water should be non negative 3 4 model solution the decomposition coordination algorithm is introduced to decompose the complex system into several associated idmus according to the objective forming a recursive structure each idmu selects the optimal one and then adjusts the feedback information according to the overall goal layer by layer and finally obtains the global optimal solution thus the model can accommodate both global and individual interests the detail solution steps are summarized as follows 1 the amount of water diverted for irrigation in the idmu q m n is set as intermediate variable between upper and lower level models it s pre determined from the upper level decision makers to solve the model the initial values of q m n is taken as water flow of the canal which is determined from canal flows monitoring data during the study period afterwards by solving the lower level model through nsga ii algorithm and multi objective fuzzy preference method see appendix a optimal water allocation solutions i m n j t o p t for different crops and growth stages and objective function values f 1 n and f 2 n for different idmus can be firstly obtained and the first solution is initialized if the constraint is not satisfied then adjust the constraint until a feasible solution is available 2 the optimized results of the lower level objectives are passed to the upper level model to calculate its objective function values calculate the allocated water for each idmu for the upper level irrigation system and feedback to the lower level objectives as updated irrigation availability constraints at this point the algorithm introduce variability to explore new solutions 3 then determine whether the new solution set meets the following convergence criteria 24 f q m m 1 f q m m f q m m δ where m denotes the times of iterations f q m m 1 and f q m m are the optimized objective values of the upper level mode at m 1 and m iterations δ is the maximum tolerance between two iterations and it s set to 0 01 in this study 4 if the stopping criteria is reached stop if not repeat the above steps the flow chart of solution process can be seen in fig 4 3 5 model parameters and data preparation the meteorological data is obtained from the national meteorological station since there is only one meteorological unit in the entire study area the meteorological data for each idmu is the same during optimization three main crops including spring wheat maize and sunflower are considered the growing periods of spring wheat maize and sunflower are march 25 july 15 april 21 september 15 and may 19 september 15 respectively thus the study period is set from march to september covering the entire growth period of all crops the field capacity of soil water wilting point initial soil water content and initial soil electrical conductivity for each idmu are obtained from measured data these data are obtained by using the measured data from 22 soil water and salt sampling points in the study area its value at each idmu is determined separately by spatial analysis on arcgis crop prices are determined based on market surveys and farmer visits and water prices are based on data provided by management departments table 5 lists basic parameters of canal systems and drainage which are referred to the results of liu et al 2020 tables 6 7 present input parameters for the model and some initial values to drive the model the current irrigation schedule of each crop is shown in table 8 and it was also considered as the baseline scenario in this study canal operation data seepage loss coefficients of main and sub trunk canals are collected from administrative departments 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation by solving the developed simulation based multi objective two level optimization model optimal results of irrigation water allocation at the whole irrigation system and each idmu are obtained fig 5 shows optimal results of water allocation at 44 idmus optimal solutions show that the water allocation for each idmu is lower than allowable water diversion which means that the total allocated water is within the allowable canal diversion limits thus the allocation solution is feasible and practical in actual operation it is noted that the irrigation water allocation of some idmus is still available from the maximum allowable diversion especially at idmus 19 and 21 therefore to further improve irrigation economic benefits and irrigation water productivity the canals shall be used effectively to increase their water delivery capacity with modification or expansion figs 6 and 7 present the optimized total irrigation amount for different crops at each idmu and optimal monthly irrigation amount for each crop at each idmu respectively the results show that the total irrigation amount at each idmu is lower than that of the current irrigation conditions i e baseline scenario 0 this is because the upper level scheduling model focuses on environmental concern through minimizing the amount of canal seepage of the whole irrigation system clearly optimal solutions can provide water managers with pathways to water savings potential for different idmus there are large differences in irrigation water volumes for different months for the three main crops within each idmu which are mainly due to the spatial distribution of soil and canal systems the different soil parameters groundwater depth and canal water supply capacity in each idmu therefore optimal solution of irrigation water allocation can provide decision support based on the tradeoffs between the upper level managers and the lower level farmers for making irrigation planning strategies moreover table 9 lists the water allocation of the corresponding four sub trunk canals in the study area the overall water allocation in the irrigation area throughout the crop growth stage is 516 106 m3 which is 27 less than the total water diversion of 705 106 m3 in the study area during the whole crop growth period from march to september for each sub trunk canals the results show that the percentage of water savings ranges between 24 and 30 compared with the baseline scenario indicating that optimal solutions allow for a reduction in the amount of water diverted while ensuring that the crop yield does not suffer a significant yield reduction 4 2 optimal economic benefits and irrigation water productivity fig 8a compares the economic benefits of the 44 idmus from the developed model and baseline scenario the results show that the total economic benefits of the whole irrigation system are not greatly increased through optimizing irrigation water allocation and the economic benefits of 1 755 109 yuan are slightly larger than the current situation of 1 732 109 yuan with a relative change of 1 3 specifically the idmu with the highest economic benefits in the irrigation area are located in the northern yangjiahe canal and downstream of the huangji canal idmus 21 41 and 42 in general there is a direct relationship between crop yield and crop water requirement however there is no significant correlation between crop water requirements and economic benefits in these areas based on the crop distribution from fig 2 there are probably two reasons the first one is that these idmus are the three largest area in all idmus i e 12 144 ha 6554 ha and 6286 ha the second is the larger area of sunflower cultivation as economic crop within these idmus i e 1798 ha 2509 ha and 2107 ha sunflower has been grown within the study area because of its higher salt tolerance and one third of the local farmers income comes from sunflower cultivations fig 8b illustrates the irrigation water productivity of the idmus for the optimized and current situations the maximum value of irrigation water productivity obtained by the developed model is 3 85 kg m3 idmu 43 and the minimum value is 1 22 kg m3 idmu 7 while the mean value is 1 80 kg m3 in contrast the maximum value of irrigation water productivity under the current situation is 1 59 kg m3 idmu 44 and the minimum value and mean value are 0 84 kg m3 idmu 21 and 1 12 kg m3 respectively the results show that the optimized irrigation water productivity has improved significantly with the average value increasing from 1 12 kg m3 to 1 80 kg m3 a relative increase of 60 7 in addition the spatial variability of irrigation water productivity under the current conditions is not significant that is almost 70 of the idmus have results in the range of 1 0 1 5 kg m3 however these optimized results varied significantly across idmus due to the spatial variability of the irrigation allocation solutions obtained by the model based on above analysis optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation show that these results can reduce water diversions for irrigation and improve irrigation water productivity while ensuring that crop yields are not greatly reduced the pareto front solutions for the two lower level objectives are shown in fig 9 the x axis shows optimal objective values of irrigation water productivity while the y axis shows of optimal objective values of economic benefits these optimal solutions are non dominated to each other but are superior to the rest of solutions in the search space fig 9 shows that this curve is characterized by an inverse proportional function indicating that each solution includes one objective inferior to another solution in pareto set although both objectives are superior to others in the rest of decision space specifically the two objectives of the pareto solution set present a game relationship the closer the solution to the x axis irrigation water productivity objective is superior while the closer the solution to the y axis presents the better for the economic benefits this is also consistent with the actual situation for example the pursuit of maximum economic benefits will inevitably increase the amount of irrigation water use which will lead to a decrease in irrigation water productivity conversely if irrigation water productivity is maximized economic benefits will be impaired while irrigation water utilization is reduced moreover excessive pursuit of irrigation water productivity will restrain crop growth and seriously affect food production in addition the results show that economic benefits are stabilized after irrigation water productivity is greater than 10 kg m3 therefore the above analysis shows that the results can balance these conflicting objectives 4 3 variation of groundwater depth and soil salinization fig 10 shows the changes of groundwater depth during the whole crop growth period a negative change in groundwater depth indicates a decrease in groundwater level at the end of the crop growth period compared to the beginning of growth and an increase in groundwater depth and vice versa in areas with shallow groundwater the groundwater table is a key factor in controlling soil salinity declining groundwater levels are directly related to the accumulation of soil salts under the optimal irrigation allocation scheme the groundwater level decreases significantly due to less irrigation amount and thus salt in the crop root zone cannot be leached into groundwater aquifers leading to a higher degree of soil salinity accumulation on the contrary the groundwater level generally increased under the baseline scenario and the degree of soil salinity accumulation becomes low from the fig 10 the change of spatial distribution of groundwater depth in the idmu under the optimized scheme is basically the same as the baseline scenario however the groundwater depth increases based on optimized schemes while the groundwater depth decreases under the baseline scenario this is due to the large amount of irrigation water under the baseline scenario and the large amount of canal seepage and deep percolation which largely recharges the groundwater and causes the groundwater level to increase fig 11 illustrates the results of soil salinity accumulation in the whole study area when soil salinity accumulation is greater than 0 which indicates an increase in salinity during crop growth period otherwise the opposite from the results the soil salinity accumulation under the optimized scheme although within the constraints is more severe than the baseline scenario with about 60 of the idmus at 0 03 0 06 g kg of salinity accumulation under the baseline scenario due to the severe local soil salinity large irrigation quota with high amount of irrigation water is generally employed to mitigate the negative effects of soil salinity on crop growth but this also causes problems of increased groundwater mineralization and wasted water resources in addition the results show that soil salinity cannot satisfy the pre given constraint of soil salinity accumulation in the southwestern part of the study area which can be explained by that these places are close to the drainage ditches and groundwater mineralization is relatively high in summary the results can be weighed against the problem of positive and negative effects in terms of soil salinization irrigation water usage and economic benefits that is the positive effect is the increase of economic benefits and saving of irrigation water and the negative effect is the problem of soil salinization caused by the accumulation of accumulated soil salts 4 4 discussion the results of irrigation water optimization in jiefangzha irrigation subarea under shallow groundwater environments show that the developed simulation based multi objective two level optimization decision making approach is an effective and practical method for managing irrigation water improving irrigation water productivity and controlling salt accumulation there are three advantages in handing such a complex difficulty firstly through delineating the study area into homogeneous idmus based on the spatial distributions and controlled areas of the main canals second level canals then each idmu is considered as the basic units for irrigation management which can better reflect spatial variability secondly water and salt movement processes among irrigation water soil water and groundwater are incorporated into the optimization model to enhance its applicability which can generate dynamic decisions considering their physical interactions thirdly three objectives associated with environmental and economic objectives and different stakeholders i e the upper level decision makers and the lower level farmers can effectively reduce the complexity of regional optimization problems in this model each level is solved independently but their interaction between subsystems the lower level and irrigation system the upper level is considered through coordination variables in the optimization process compared with previous studies the application of the above method is not only flexible in calculation but also can better consider the coordination of interests among different levels in the irrigation system and the impact of various environmental factors this study optimizes irrigation water allocation to different crop growth stages within different idmus using the baseline scenario as a comparison the solving efficiency is high with almost no computational burden because the model has few objective functions and solving method has logical solution steps in terms of input data they are collected from government reports websites and published literatures and the data are reliable the initial values of the model are obtained from the measured data however there are still some uncertainties to be noted for example uncertainties mainly arise from simplifications in the model conceptualization such as resampling of crop spatial distribution delineation of idmu limited by meteorological data these simplifications may have affected the accuracy of results in some regions furthermore other factors including irrigation method total planted area crop type and canal water loss are assumed to be unchanged in this study at each optimization consequently future work will focus on obtaining spatial distribution information of crops soil type groundwater and salinity with high temp spatial resolution to acquire more accurate model data and ensure the validity of simulation models and reliability of optimized results 5 conclusion a simulation based multi objective two level optimization irrigation water allocation model has been developed for managing irrigation water resources techniques of multi objective programming two level programming and simulation model of agricultural hydrological process are incorporated into the general modeling framework the structure of the model is such that the upper and lower levels have their own objective functions and constraints it s capable of optimizing irrigation water allocation spatially and temporally for major crops because the study area is delineated into 44 uniform idmus through decomposition coordination algorithm optimal solutions for each idmu can be readily generated therefore the results will enable the allocation of irrigation water to different crop growth stages within the idmu under the rigid water resources constraints thus effectively supporting balanced irrigation water management among multiple objectives and upper and lower levels this study has the following findings 1 optimal irrigation water allocation for each idmu is less than the baseline scenario while the economic benefits are slightly increased and irrigation water productivity is obviously improved 2 the average percentage of canal seepage for different idmus is nearly 40 and the amount of canal seepage is related to the area of idmu 3 most of groundwater depths of idmus under optimized scenario show a negative growth trend but groundwater depth in the baseline scenario is basically becoming shallower 4 it is noted that approximately 86 of the idmus have soil salinity accumulation of less than 0 1 g kg and soil salinization is within controllable limits this study attempts to solve the issues of multi objective different stakeholders and hydrological processes based on the integrated simulation optimization modeling framework without losing generality the model is more applicable to arid agricultural areas in terms of sustainable development of irrigated agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was jointly supported by the national science foundation of china grant number 52009133 and 52130902 the authors are grateful to the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions for the improvement the paper appendix a in this study the nsga ii algorithm is used to solve the model and optimal solution sets are obtained instead of a single optimal solution which can provide more choices for decision making therefore how to make best decisions in the set of feasible solutions is also the core problem in the study of optimal allocation of agricultural water resources the fuzzy preference method is used to investigate the superiority and inferiority of decision making by combining fuzzy set theory the basis of multi objective fuzzy preference is to establish the objective systems and determine their weights and fuzzy membership function in fuzzy set theory can be used as a bridge to link the objective systems and optimal solutions the calculation of fuzzy membership function is used to judge the degree of merit of different solutions thus quantifying the fuzzy information then the purpose of converting the multi objective problem into a comprehensive single objective problem is achieved finally optimal solutions can be determined after the comprehensive single objective comparison the detailed steps are presented as follows for a problem with preference if there are n solutions in the objective systems forming the set of solutions d d 1 d 2 d n and multi objective sets are g g 1 g 2 g n the attribute value of solution d i for objective g i is x i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m and matrix x x i j denotes the feature matrix of m objectives for n solutions 25 x x i j x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n when standardizing the objective systems the following equations should be used for the calculation of objectives whose attributes are benefit based and risk based respectively 26 w h e n i t s a b e n e f i t b a s e d o b j e c t i v e r i j x i j min x i j max x i j min x i j j 27 w h e n i t s a r i s k b a s e d o b j e c t i v e r i j max x i j x i j max x i j min x i j j then the feature matrix can be transformed into the corresponding relative membership matrix by standardization 28 r r i j r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n if the maximum and minimum values of each row in matrix 28 are extracted separately they can be expressed as the ideal optimal solution and ideal worst solution 29 r g r g 1 r g 2 r g m max r 1 i max r 2 i max r m i 1 1 1 30 r b r b 1 r b 2 r b m min r 1 i min r 2 i min r m i 0 0 0 each solution to be preferred has a certain affiliation to optimal or worst one the more optimal solution is called the superiority degree denoted by u g i and the more inferior solution is called the inferiority degree denoted by u b i in multi objective preference each objective has different attributes and different importance for the preference so it is necessary to assign weights to the objectives ω i it s expressed as 31 ω ω 1 ω 2 ω m t 32 i 1 m ω i 1 moreover for any objective the vector of relative superiority values s h for each level h from level 1 to level c is defined 33 s s h c h c 1 1 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 1 0 thus the full form of the multi objective multi level fuzzy preference model is presented 34 μ h j 0 1 k 1 c i 1 m w i r i j s h 2 i 1 m w i r i j s k 2 1 where j 1 2 n and h 1 2 c using the above eq 34 optimal relative membership matrix for the set of solutions attributed to each level can be obtained 35 u u h j u 11 u 12 u 1 n u 21 u 22 u 2 n u c 1 u c 2 u c n h 1 2 c j 1 2 n then the vector of h at each level is used to prefer the set of solutions 36 h 1 2 c u h j h 1 h 2 h n finally h min min h j is selected as the most optimal solutions from multi objective decision solutions it is worth noting that when performing the preference calculation the level c 2 is required in this study to improve the accuracy of the preference decision c 5 is chosen 
8913,actual crop evapotranspiration etc is not only essential for irrigation management but also difficult to estimate and measure the classical two step approach of etc estimation using the reference evapotranspiration eto and the crop coefficient kc is utilised worldwide in this study we aimed to evaluate the potential of artificial neural networks ann for etc estimations in closed soilless culture systems tomato cv duru plants were grown in two substrates perlite and coco fibre in an unheated plastic greenhouse during the growing seasons 2 spring and fall periods each daily climatic values etc and kc were determined fao penman monteith pm was used as the general approach for etc estimation in addition to hargreaves hg for limited data conditions ann models were generated with 4 data sets 1 all inputs 2 without radiation rs 3 without kc kc and 4 minimum data rs kc and all were compared implementing pm and hg equations the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient e was used to assess the predictive skill of the models average kc values of 0 40 1 31 0 61 and 0 40 1 76 0 77 were obtained for perlite and coco fibre respectively the ann models for all input conditions produced successful results improving estimation accuracy over traditional equations for all data sets the average rmse and model efficiency values rmse 0 540 mm day 1 and e 0 817 of ann models for

forecasting ability to assist irrigation management keywords et modelling irrigation crop coefficient penman monteith perlite coco fibre data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is one of today s major global problems and the demand has recently been increasing at a rate of 1 per year wwdr 2018 agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater hence the water requirement for agriculture will continue to increase boretti and rosa 2019 while fulfilling the need for food and agricultural products in intensive agriculture the efficient use of freshwater sources and minimizing pollution through waste management are crucial issues for sustainability irrigation scheduling aims to maintain the optimum water level in the root zone minimizing loss of nutrients vulnerability to diseases and operation costs while maximizing yield in soilless culture systems where nutrients are applied with irrigation water the importance of precision in irrigation scheduling increases thus accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc is crucial in soilless culture systems ghiat et al 2021 pardossi and incrocci 2011 wang et al 2021 kc was first introduced by jensen 1968 for traditional open field production and is influenced by many variables in a soilless culture system hence the classical two step approach of etc estimation with reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc contains inefficacies for soilless cultivation in addition to greenhouse climate factors e g temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and plant characteristics e g growth phase plant type and leaf area the type of soilless culture growing medium characteristics and container size should also be considered for etc estimations in soilless culture systems bacci et al 2011 ghiat et al 2021 nikolaou et al 2019 annandale and stockle 1994 stated kc values fluctuated with weather elements especially for taller crops and estimating etc by comparing it to another crop eto with different parameters generates errors when kc is extrapolated in time and space these errors will increase within daily operations of soilless culture systems since kc varies marginally in greenhouse conditions ghiat et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 in addition in closed systems where drainage water is fully recovered and returned to circulation the effect of incrementally increasing salinity due to nutrient build up is hard to express in a mathematical form ahn and son 2019 moon et al 2020 several authors modified pm equation incorporating crop terms such as lai and stomatal conductance to calculate etc directly which generally classified as one step approach due to the deficiencies of two step approach in soilless culture baille et al 1994 carmassi et al 2007 stanghellini 1987 however these models require calibrations for site crop specific conditions and require lai measurements during a minimum of two growing cycles kocian et al 2023 each type of greenhouse provides different climate conditions which effect the physical process of etc yan et al 2021 effective farmer friendly management methods and tools are required to ensure irrigation is optimal for the crop specific and site specific conditions in greenhouse production incrocci et al 2020 crop evapotranspiration is dependent on multiple factors interacting with one another and is generally described as a complex nonlinear process artificial neural networks ann are capable of representing the interactions between multiple factors and providing good solutions to the problem without the necessity of defining the complexity in mathematical form elbeltagi et al 2022 kelley and pardyjak 2019 instead of solving problems with formulas ann learns by example ann have been used for applications related to various agricultural activities several researchers utilized ann to predict climatic conditions inside a greenhouse dariouchy et al 2009 jung et al 2020 moon et al 2020 trained ann to forecast root zone ec of nutrient solutions in closed soilless culture systems ann also utilized to predict eto in addition to the classical techniques e g penman monteith hargreaves kumar et al 2011 determined anns could be better for estimating lysimeter obtained eto than the penman monteith pm equation khoob 2008 developed ann models with temperature and pan evaporation measurements and obtained better results for eto without the need for pan coefficient wind speed and humidity data trajkovic 2010 and traore et al 2010 evaluated the eto forecasting ability of ann models and found the results to be promising several researchers choi et al 2018 dimitriadou and nikolakopoulos 2022 elbeltagi et al 2022 eng and genaidy 2020 gao et al 2021 yamaç 2021 obtained better results for eto estimation than conventional methods with limited climate data however when all climate data is available training requirements for ann should be taken into consideration as pm is global and accurate for reference evapotranspiration sudheer et al 2003 developed ann models to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of rice acquired from a lysimeter and stated that etc can be estimated successfully with ann models even with limited climate data kelley and pardyjak 2019 installed and colocated eddy covariance sensors with on farm weather stations for two different field crops and trained anns to estimate etc by incorporating climate parameters they observed that anns were able to estimate etc robustly with an important limitation the trained ann is only valid under similar environmental and crop conditions within the training period studies also showed ann estimating etc successfully in greenhouse conditions ge et al 2022 pandorfi et al 2016 rice et al 2017 wang et al 2017 however research for ann etc estimation accuracy in soilless culture systems is very limited nam et al 2017 utilized ann to estimate etc of hydroponically grown sweet pepper and concluded ann can be efficiently applied to soilless culture systems for etc estimations later on they trained anns for etc estimation of paprika grown in a soilless culture greenhouse in addition to climate parameters they included leaf area index substrate temperature ec and ph as inputs to ann and subsequently compared results by weighing lysimeter etc the results indicated ann showed high accuracies and could be used for developing irrigation strategies for crops grown in soilless culture recently kocian et al 2023 utilized a dynamic bayesian network to predict etc in soilless culture with temperature radiation and crop weight they observed that their network outperformed the competing one step baile model without using lai as input in this study we aimed to evaluate the potential of ann models to produce accurate etc estimation with simple data sets which does not require expensive sensors or time consuming measurements kc rs or lai and to develop a proposal that benefits efficiency in irrigation management in closed soilless culture systems 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the study was conducted in a twin tunnel greenhouse within ege university in izmir türkiye 38 27 17 n 27 14 17 e plastic pots with 75 23 16 cm dimensions were used as containers containers were filled with 18 liters of growing substrate and 3 seedlings were planted per container perlite and coco fibre were used as growing substrates for duru f1 tomato plants drainage holes were drilled into the lower legs of the containers to collect excess water and deliver it back to the irrigation water tanks the tanks were refilled to the same water level every early morning and the deficit volume was recorded along with the daily irrigation volume for each subject crop evapotranspiration was determined daily from the refilled volume which was the only deficit in the water balance of the closed system water meters with pulse mechanisms and dataloggers gp1 delta t devices were installed to record irrigation and refill volumes the climate conditions were continuously measured with a climate station located in the center of the greenhouse solar radiation rs was measured by a pyranometer sp 212 apogee at 2 m height above ground an integrated relative humidity rh and temperature t sensor rht2 delta t devices was used at 2 m height above ground to measure temperature and relative humidity values all values were recorded by a data logger gp1 delta t devices every 15 min during the experiment wind speed for the greenhouse interior was accepted as 0 5 m s 1 to improve the estimation accuracy of the fao penman monteith equation under very low wind speed conditions allen et al 1998 the experiment was conducted for a total of 525 days which consisted of 2 fall and 2 spring growing periods days without any missing data were considered verified for model analysis and 510 verified data were acquired dates period lengths and average climate conditions of the greenhouse are presented in table 1 2 2 et estimation the fao penman monteith pm equation was used as the standard for eto calculation the hargreaves hg equation which is the recommended method when solar radiation data is not available was calibrated and used for eto to represent limited climate data conditions according to allen et al 1998 the pm equation is eq 1 1 et o

ease of automation the success of ann in forecasting the next day s etc with the data of the day ann 1 was also examined generated ann models were generated compared with pm and hg equations generalization is the ability to accurately generate outputs from inputs that are new to ann lack of generalization is caused by over fitting or over training the network to maintain the generalization ability of ann the dataset was divided into 3 subsets for training validation and testing khoob 2008 therefore 510 days of verified experiment data were randomly divided into 3 subsets and 68 of the data was used for training 16 for validation and the remaining 16 for testing the models were evaluated based on the performance with test data in this study multilayer perceptron mlp

nash sutcliffe efficiency is commonly used to assess the predictive skills of hydrological models indicating how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007

perlite and 248 9 432 7 mm with an average of 324 7 in coco fibre fig 2 the results are comparable to previous studies in a similar study of tomatoes in perlite tuzel et al 2006 observed the etc of tomato plants ranged between 229 and 371 mm gong et al 2020 conducted a 3 year experiment with tomatoes in a greenhouse where mean daily temperatures was 23 4 c and mean rh was 75 3 their results indicated seasonal etc for tomato was 310 350 mm a surplus of nutrient solution was applied to avoid salination in soilless systems nikolaou et al 2019 where a leaching ratio of 30 50 was maintained in all growing periods the water consumption of tomatoes grown in coco fibre was higher than perlite this can be related to the physical characteristics of substrates and particularly due to the content of easily available water fields et al 2014 gohardoust et al 2020 gruda et al 2013 rouphael et al 2005 wang et al 2021 the highest crop evapotranspiration occurred in the 3rd growing period

and coco fibre and the length and timing of the peak stages for every growing period varied significantly with greenhouse conditions similar to previous studies further analysis of kc curves constructed for 2 substrates and 4 growing periods demonstrated higher kc values in the fall growing season schuch and burger 1997 stated kc values were artificially high and failed to correspond to plant low water use in the fall and winter periods yang et al 2022 studied tomatoes in a sunken chinese solar greenhouse during 3 winter periods and observed kc values varying between 0 7 and 2 0 the average kc values in the measurement period were 1 06 1 11 and 0 99 in 2018 2019 and 2020 seasons respectively the comparison of daily observed values and daily values produced from the kc curves indicated 0 6444 and 0 7235 relations for perlite and coco fibre respectively fig 5 validating the transferability inadequacy of the kc especially for operations like soilless cultures for a farmer utilizing kc values from the literature pm estimations will be more inaccurate than estimations obtained in this research crop coefficients derived from the kc curves were used to calculate etc with pm and hg equations and compared using observed etc values fig 6 both equations performed better for coco fibre with e 0 784 and e 0 696 efficiency for pm and hargreaves respectively even though rmse

conducted to determine whether the xgbr model was overfitting and a conclusion was reached indicating that xgbr overfits when all variables are used as inputs suggesting fewer inputs for xgbr models pandorfi et al 2016 constructed ann models with climate data rh t rs and wind speed to estimate etc of soil grown greenhouse sweet pepper ann model estimated lysimeter measured etc with r2 0 91 nam et al 2019 studied ann for etc estimation of paprika grown in rockwool they measured irrigation and drainage weight with load cells and calculated etc using the water balance method in addition to climate parameters leaf area index substrate temperature ec and ph were included in ann as inputs they reported that the accuracy of the ann model was higher with r2 0 88 than pm with r2 0 79 in comparison the c ann full model achieved r2 0 864 over pm r2 804 even though c ann full did not utilize lai and substrate temperature as inputs a similar performance was achieved the ann rs models were constructed as suitable comparisons to the hargreaves equation the ann rs models estimated etc with e 0 905 and e 0 775 efficiency significantly improving hargreaves efficiency of e 0696 30 and e 0 620 25 for coco fibre and perlite respectively the measured errors of models were also reduced significantly from 0 860 to 0 472 45 1 mm day 1 for coco fibre and 0 727 0 512 29 6 mm day 1 for perlite although solar radiation is a very important factor on etc due to their structure ann models were able to detect the influence of rs through inputs such as day of the year doy the day after planting dap and extra terrestrial radiation ra nam et al 2019 also studied various input conditions and concluded that the ann showed higher accuracy when root zone data were used as input the estimation accuracy of ann in soilless cultures could be increased when various environmental factors were included in the training inputs like doy dap and ra do not require sensors or measurements and could be beneficial in further model studies with ann considering the difficulties of obtaining site specific kc data and the inadequacy of transferability ann kc models were constructed to evaluate ann performance without kc ann kc model estimated etc with the model efficiency of e 0 764 in perlite and e 0 830 in coco fibre c ann kc was the least efficient ann model for coco fibre however even with lower performance than other ann models c ann kc still showed more improvement over pm 5 9 efficiency 11 4 rmse etc estimation models known as one step are good comparisons for ann kc models constructed in this study nam et al 2017 constructed ann model utilizing radiation temperature relative humidity leaf area index and time as inputs and compared with a modified penman

summarize the artificial neural network model results c ann rs and p ann rs models can be used in high tech greenhouses due to their precision in etc estimation c ann rs kc and p ann rs kc models stands out due to their ease of use ann models can run with temperature and humidity sensors and outperform widely used classical methods climate sensors like pyranometers are expensive require

working time data required to train ann models can also be gathered via renting required equipment seasonally training an ann for similar material size cultivation technique low and mid tech greenhouses in the same region implementing cheap temperature and humidity sensors with iot integration can help multiple farmers with irrigation management 4 conclusions in this study we aimed to evaluate the potential of ann models to produce accurate etc estimation with simple data sets which does not require expensive sensors or time consuming measurements kc rs or lai and to develop a proposal that benefits efficiency in irrigation management in closed soilless culture systems tomato plants were grown in unheated greenhouse conditions during fall and spring seasons in perlite and

8913,actual crop evapotranspiration etc is not only essential for irrigation management but also difficult to estimate and measure the classical two step approach of etc estimation using the reference evapotranspiration eto and the crop coefficient kc is utilised worldwide in this study we aimed to evaluate the potential of artificial neural networks ann for etc estimations in closed soilless culture systems tomato cv duru plants were grown in two substrates perlite and coco fibre in an unheated plastic greenhouse during the growing seasons 2 spring and fall periods each daily climatic values etc and kc were determined fao penman monteith pm was used as the general approach for etc estimation in addition to hargreaves hg for limited data conditions ann models were generated with 4

forecasting ability to assist irrigation management keywords et modelling irrigation crop coefficient penman monteith perlite coco fibre data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is one of today s major global problems and the demand has recently been increasing at a rate of 1 per year wwdr 2018 agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater hence the water requirement for agriculture will continue to increase boretti and rosa 2019 while fulfilling the need for food and agricultural products in intensive agriculture the efficient use of freshwater sources and minimizing pollution through waste management are crucial issues for sustainability irrigation scheduling aims to maintain the optimum water level in the root zone minimizing loss of nutrients vulnerability to diseases and operation costs while maximizing yield in soilless culture systems where nutrients are applied with irrigation water the importance of precision in irrigation scheduling increases thus accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc is crucial in soilless culture systems ghiat et al 2021 pardossi and incrocci 2011 wang et al 2021 kc was first introduced by jensen 1968 for traditional open field production and is influenced by many variables in a soilless culture system hence the classical two step approach of etc estimation with reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc contains inefficacies for soilless cultivation in addition to greenhouse climate factors e g temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and plant characteristics e g growth phase plant type and leaf area the type of soilless culture growing medium characteristics and container size should also be considered for etc estimations in soilless culture systems bacci et al 2011 ghiat et al 2021 nikolaou et al 2019 annandale and stockle 1994 stated kc values fluctuated with weather elements especially for taller crops and estimating etc by comparing it to another crop eto with different parameters generates errors when kc is extrapolated in time and space these errors will increase within daily operations of soilless culture systems since kc varies marginally in greenhouse conditions ghiat et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 in addition in closed systems where drainage water is fully recovered and returned to circulation the effect of incrementally increasing salinity due to nutrient build up is hard to express in a mathematical form ahn and son 2019 moon et al 2020 several authors modified pm equation incorporating crop terms such as lai and stomatal conductance to calculate etc directly which generally classified as one step approach due to the deficiencies of two step approach in soilless culture baille et al 1994 carmassi et al 2007 stanghellini 1987 however these models require calibrations for site crop specific conditions and require lai measurements during a minimum of two growing cycles kocian et al 2023 each type of greenhouse provides different climate conditions which effect the physical process of etc yan et al 2021 effective farmer friendly management methods and tools are required to ensure irrigation is optimal for the crop specific and site specific conditions in greenhouse production incrocci et al 2020 crop evapotranspiration is dependent on multiple factors interacting with one another and is generally described as a complex nonlinear process artificial neural networks ann are capable of representing the interactions between multiple factors and providing good solutions to the problem without the necessity of defining the complexity in mathematical form elbeltagi et al 2022 kelley and pardyjak 2019 instead of solving problems with formulas ann learns by example ann have been used for applications related to various agricultural activities several researchers utilized ann to predict climatic conditions inside a greenhouse dariouchy et al 2009 jung et al 2020 moon et al 2020 trained ann to forecast root zone ec of nutrient solutions in closed soilless culture systems ann also utilized to predict eto in addition to the classical techniques e g penman monteith hargreaves kumar et al 2011 determined anns could be better for estimating lysimeter obtained eto than the penman monteith pm equation khoob 2008 developed ann models with temperature and pan evaporation measurements and obtained better results for eto without the need for pan coefficient wind speed and humidity data trajkovic 2010 and traore et al 2010 evaluated the eto forecasting ability of ann models and found the results to be promising several researchers choi et al 2018 dimitriadou and nikolakopoulos 2022 elbeltagi et al 2022 eng and genaidy 2020 gao et al 2021 yamaç 2021 obtained better results for eto estimation than conventional methods with limited climate data however when all climate data is available training requirements for ann should be taken into consideration as pm is global and accurate for reference evapotranspiration sudheer et al 2003 developed ann models to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of rice acquired from a lysimeter and stated that etc can be estimated successfully with ann models even with limited climate data kelley and pardyjak 2019 installed and colocated eddy covariance sensors with on farm weather stations for two different field crops and trained anns to estimate etc by incorporating climate parameters they observed that anns were able to estimate etc robustly with an important limitation the trained ann is only valid under similar environmental and crop conditions within the training period studies also showed ann estimating etc successfully in greenhouse conditions ge et al 2022 pandorfi et al 2016 rice et al 2017 wang et al 2017 however research for ann etc estimation accuracy in soilless culture systems is very limited nam et al 2017 utilized ann to estimate etc of hydroponically grown sweet pepper and concluded ann can be efficiently applied to soilless culture systems for etc estimations later on they trained anns for etc estimation of paprika grown in a soilless culture greenhouse in addition to climate parameters they included leaf area index substrate temperature ec and ph as inputs to ann and subsequently compared results by weighing lysimeter etc the results indicated ann showed high accuracies and could be used for developing irrigation strategies for crops grown in soilless culture recently kocian et al 2023 utilized a dynamic bayesian network to predict etc in soilless culture with temperature radiation and crop weight they observed that their network outperformed the competing one step baile model without using lai as input in this study we aimed to evaluate the potential of ann models to produce accurate etc estimation with simple data sets which does not require expensive sensors or time consuming measurements kc rs or lai and to develop a proposal that benefits efficiency in irrigation management in closed soilless culture systems 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the study was conducted in a twin tunnel greenhouse within ege university in izmir türkiye 38 27 17 n 27 14 17 e plastic pots with 75 23 16 cm dimensions were used as containers containers were filled with 18 liters of growing substrate and 3 seedlings were planted per container perlite and coco fibre were used as growing substrates for duru f1 tomato plants drainage holes were drilled into the lower legs of the containers to collect excess water and deliver it back to the irrigation water tanks the tanks were refilled to the same water level every early morning and the deficit volume was recorded along with the daily irrigation volume for each subject crop evapotranspiration was determined daily from the refilled volume which was the only deficit in the water balance of the closed system water meters with pulse mechanisms and dataloggers gp1 delta t devices were installed to record irrigation and refill volumes the climate conditions were continuously measured with a climate station located in the center of the greenhouse solar radiation rs was measured by a pyranometer sp 212 apogee at 2 m height above ground an integrated relative humidity rh and temperature t sensor rht2 delta t devices was used at 2 m height above ground to measure temperature and relative humidity values all values were recorded by a data logger gp1 delta t devices every 15 min during the experiment wind speed for the greenhouse interior was accepted as 0 5 m s 1 to improve the estimation accuracy of the fao penman monteith equation under very low wind speed conditions allen et al 1998 the experiment was conducted for a total of 525 days which consisted of 2 fall and 2 spring growing periods days without any missing data were considered verified for model analysis and 510 verified data were acquired dates period lengths and average climate conditions of the greenhouse are presented in table 1 2 2 et estimation the fao penman monteith pm equation was used as the standard for eto calculation the hargreaves hg equation which is the recommended method when solar radiation data is not available was calibrated and used for eto to represent limited climate data conditions according to allen et al 1998 the pm equation is eq 1 1 et o

crop coefficients were calculated with eq 4 and to maintain the generalization ability of pm and hg equations kc curves allen et al 1998 were constructed and used instead of measured daily

generalization is the ability to accurately generate outputs from inputs that are new to ann lack of generalization is caused by over fitting or over training the network to maintain the generalization ability of ann the dataset was divided into 3 subsets for training validation and testing khoob 2008 therefore 510 days of verified experiment data were randomly divided into 3 subsets

average kc values in the measurement period were 1 06 1 11 and 0 99 in 2018 2019 and 2020 seasons respectively the comparison of daily observed values and daily values produced from the kc curves indicated 0 6444 and 0 7235 relations for perlite and coco fibre respectively fig 5 validating the transferability inadequacy of the kc especially for operations like soilless cultures for a farmer utilizing kc values from the literature pm estimations will be more inaccurate than estimations obtained in this research crop coefficients derived from the kc curves were used to calculate etc with pm and hg equations and compared using observed etc values fig 6 both equations performed better for coco fibre with e 0 784 and e 0 696 efficiency for pm and hargreaves respectively even though rmse

growing substrates as expected the efficiency of the pm equation was e 0 784 in coco fibre and e 0 733 in perlite meanwhile hg equation estimated with e 0 696 and e 0 620 efficiency in coco fibre and

conducted to determine whether the xgbr model was overfitting and a conclusion was reached indicating that xgbr overfits when all variables are used as inputs suggesting fewer inputs for xgbr models pandorfi et al 2016 constructed ann models with climate data rh t rs and wind speed to estimate etc of soil grown greenhouse sweet pepper ann model estimated lysimeter measured etc with r2 0 91 nam et al 2019 studied ann for etc estimation of paprika grown in rockwool they measured irrigation and drainage weight with load cells and calculated etc using the water balance method in addition to climate parameters leaf area index substrate temperature ec and ph were included in ann as inputs they reported that the accuracy of the ann model was higher with r2 0 88 than pm with r2 0 79 in comparison the c ann full model achieved r2 0 864 over pm r2 804 even though c ann full did not utilize lai and substrate temperature as inputs a similar performance was achieved the ann rs models were constructed as suitable comparisons to the hargreaves equation the ann rs models estimated etc with e 0 905 and e 0 775 efficiency significantly improving hargreaves efficiency of e 0696 30 and e 0 620 25 for coco fibre and perlite respectively the measured errors of models were also reduced significantly from 0 860 to 0 472 45 1 mm day 1 for coco fibre and 0 727 0 512 29 6 mm day 1 for perlite although solar radiation is a very important factor on etc due to their structure ann models were able to detect the influence of rs through inputs such as day of the year doy the day after planting dap and extra terrestrial radiation ra nam et al 2019 also studied various input conditions and concluded that the ann showed higher accuracy when root zone data were used as input the estimation accuracy of ann in soilless cultures could be increased when various environmental factors were included in the training inputs like doy dap and ra do not require sensors or measurements and could be beneficial in further model studies with ann considering the difficulties of obtaining site specific kc data and the inadequacy of transferability ann kc models were constructed to evaluate ann performance without kc ann kc model estimated etc with the model efficiency of e 0 764 in perlite and e 0 830 in coco fibre c ann kc was the least efficient ann model for coco fibre

excellent results ann rs kc models only utilized temperature and humidity data the other inputs dap doy ra did not require sensors or measurements the ann rs kc models estimated etc with e 0 873 and 0

summarize the artificial neural network model results c ann rs and p ann rs models can be used in high tech greenhouses due to their precision in etc estimation c ann rs kc and p ann rs kc models stands out due to their ease of use ann models can run with temperature and humidity sensors and outperform widely used classical methods climate sensors like pyranometers are expensive require maintenance and have a lifespan ann provide opportunity to continue effective irrigation management without acquiring new sensors by constructing ann models with the data collected during their working time data required to train ann models can also be gathered via renting required equipment seasonally training an ann for similar material size cultivation technique low and mid tech greenhouses in the same region implementing cheap temperature and humidity sensors with iot integration can help multiple farmers with irrigation management 4 conclusions in this study we aimed to evaluate the potential of ann models to produce accurate etc estimation with simple data sets which does not require expensive sensors or time consuming measurements kc rs or lai and to develop a proposal that benefits efficiency in irrigation management in closed soilless culture systems tomato plants were grown in unheated greenhouse conditions during fall and spring seasons in perlite and

8914,approximately half of tunisia s irrigated area suffers from soil salinization due to arid and semi arid conditions irrigation with low quality water shallow and saline groundwater and poor drainage to manage salt affected soils efficient assessment methods are needed to map soil salinity in irrigated lands and to evaluate the performance of crop water and soil management strategies in this study apparent soil electrical conductivity eca data were collected using a non invasive electromagnetic induction emi instrument em38 at different dipole orientations and heights from the soil surface across the large agricultural area of fatnassa saharan an oasis in southern tunisia using a quasi 3d q 3d inversion algorithm the spatial distribution of true soil electrical conductivity σ was estimated and the potential for prediction of the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract ece from inverted eca data was evaluated by establishing a linear regression lr between σ and ece collected at 51 reference points the results indicate that the q 3d inversion of eca measured at 0 and 0 2 m heights gives the best coefficient of determination r2 between σ and ece r2 0 61 calibration procedure was performed afterward to develop a single calibration equation and an independent validation dataset to evaluate the robustness of the obtained calibration model the calibration validation procedure shows moderate strength r2 0 56 good accuracy with the root mean square error rmse of 2 94 ds m small bias with mean error me of 0 56 ds m and an acceptable lin s concordance correlation coefficient lccc of 0 80 our study reveals the applicability of using the proposed methodology based on inversion of eca data collected at multiple heights and orientations to develop a single regional calibration and to efficiently estimate ece at any depth across the irrigation district also in the absence of recent devolved multicoil emi instruments eca data measured using a single coil instrument but at different heights can provide sufficient data required for inversion modelling and quantitative investigation of soil properties the prediction results reveal that the soil of the oasis is moderately to severely saline which may adversely affect agricultural productivity and the sustainability of crop production keywords electromagnetic induction tunisian oasis multi heights eca measurements quasi 3d inversion 3d soil salinity mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the semi arid areas of tunisia account for two thirds of the country with the remaining one third being arid ben boubaker 2016 to supplement the meagre rainfall irrigation is used however of the potential water resources available approximately half i e 52 of the groundwater has a total dissolved salt tds between 1 5 and 3 g l and two thirds of deep aquifers are of higher salinity i e tds 3 g l khanfir 2017 while irrigation improved productivity in the short term the use of low quality irrigation water has led to about half of the total irrigated area in tunisia 435 000 ha suffering from soil salinization dgacta 2007 bouksila 2011 which negatively affects natural resources and crop production bouksila 2011 to limit further degradation an understanding of the spatial extent of areas of soil salinity is essential to improve soil water and crop management and maintain agriculture productivity bouksila et al 2013 therefore information about the measured soil electrical conductivity of a saturated soil paste extract ece ds m as an indicator of soil salinity is necessary specifically the spatial extent of non 0 2 ds m slightly 2 4 ds m moderately 4 8 ds m highly 8 16 ds m and extremely saline 16 32 ds m areas barrett lennard et al 2008 this information aims to identify areas requiring management and also to select moderately tolerant 3 6 ds m and tolerant 6 10 ds m crops to salinity the laboratory measurement of soil ece is time prohibitive owing for the need to prepare the internationally recognised standard saturated soil paste extract this is because the soil paste is required to stand for 24 h with a tedious vacuum system used to suction out the extract with salinity subsequently determined by measuring the conductance of an electrical current through the extract to value add to the limited soil ece proximal soil sensors can be used including the use of electromagnetic em induction instruments they are popular because they can non invasively measure the soil apparent electrical conductivity eca ms m which is often related to ece e g corwin and lesch 2003 bouksila et al 2012 one of the most used instruments is the geonics em38 geonics ltd mississauga canada which can measure eca in the root zone this is because it has an inter coil spacing of 1 m between a transmitter and receiver coil and owing to the low frequency 14 khz it enables a depth weighted measurement of eca between 0 and 0 75 and 0 1 50 m in the horizontal ecah and vertical ecav orientations respectively em application has been initially conducted in salinized semi arid and arid areas to develop a calibration between eca and ece e g diaz and herrero 1992 which is used to map salinity at the field lesch et al 1998 plot amezketa 2006 and regional nogués et al 2006 scales later investigations become a little more sophisticated for example to study growth and yield response of olive cultivars subject to three irrigation water salinity treatments aragüés et al 2010 or mapping salinity in fields affected by saline ground water herrero and hudnall 2013 in most instances eca is calibrated against ece at specific increments or average depth the former prone to errors huang et al 2015 while latter doesn t provide information about profile ece i e uniform inverted or leached required to understand salinity processes and monitor impact of management to overcome this constraint multiple eca measurements can be inverted to estimate the true soil electrical conductivity σ distribution several inversion methods have been proposed to estimate the σ distribution from the measured eca data e g monteiro santos 2004 schamper et al 2012 dafflon et al 2013 von hebel et al 2014 shanahan et al 2015 jadoon et al 2017 moghadas et al 2017 dragonetti et al 2018 moghadas 2019 mclachlan et al 2021 narciso et al 2022 which is also widely used to predict ece for example huang et al 2017 showed that by inverting dualem 1 data across a dryland wheat field ece could be mapped in 3 d koganti et al 2018 showed how dualem 21 data could map ece in hyper salinized fields in india and gómez flores et al 2022 showed how dualem 21 data could map ece and sodium absorption ratio sar in 3 d in the b xii irrigation district in southwest spain a heavy clay reclaimed marsh area farzamian et al 2021 also showed how time lapse cmd mini explorer data can be used to assess the dynamics of soil salinity the use of single coil instruments such as the em38 geonics ltd mississauga canada at different heights from the soil surface has also been demonstrated to be a useful tool for obtaining multiple eca measurements that can be used for inverse modelling e g farzamian et al 2015 since many countries and institutes do not have access to the recently developed and more expensive multicoil emi sensors this alternative solution has been used successfully to map soil salinity and sodicity e g farzamian et al 2019a paz et al 2020a and also to assess the dynamics of soil salinity in irrigated lands e g paz et al 2020b however this approach is still not the norm in salinity mapping an example is tunisia where there has been no study on using the inverse modelling and multiple eca readings to obtain the distribution of σ and map the soil salinity distribution with depth although the soil salinity is a major concern across the country in the present study the use of an em38 eca collected at multiple heights and quasi 3d q 3d inversion algorithm was investigated to create maps of soil ece at landscape scale of about 150 ha and various depths in a tunisian hot desert climate under varying groundwater table and salinity heterogeneous soils and different water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area fig 1 shows the study area is in the northern irrigated area of fatnassa oasis about 500 km south of tunis tunisia which is located at 33 47 26 6 n and 8 44 11 2 e the oasis is limited to the north by fatnassa village and in the southwest by chott el jerid a naturally salty depression below sea level which constitutes the natural drainage outlet of the region fig 1 according to the köppen climate classification the bioclimate of fatnassa oasis is a hot desert bwh the rainfall regime is irregular with less than 100 mm and a potential evapotranspiration of approximately 2500 mm annually bahri et al 2004 according to the usda soil taxonomy usda 1999 the soil is mostly gypsic aridisol at 0 2 m soil layer the average sand content is about 99 and gypsum hydrous calcium sulphate caso42 h2o about 60 bouksila et al 2012 the northern fatnassa oasis covers officially 115 ha however due to illegal extension currently the oasis covers around 150 ha the experimental area consists of 467 farming plots fig 2a with an average size of 0 25 ha ben aïssa et al 2005 these are situated in three sectors sector 1 in the east sector 2 in the northwest and sector 3 in the southwest the oasis altitude ranges from 26 m in the north to 16 m in the south with the slope of about 0 3 0 5 fig 2b the farming system is mainly composed of date palms and fodder crops traditional surface irrigation is the main method used in the oasis although canals were replaced with pipes in some areas to improve water irrigation efficiency bouksila 2011 irrigation water is a mixture of groundwater from the complex terminal aquifer system and the artesian aquifer of the intercalary continental marlet et al 2009 a water tower allows the transport of water by gravity through three open concrete channels which serve in turn rota the three irrigated sectors fig 2a during the survey period the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water of the deeper aquifer was 3 7 ds m which is at the lower end of moderately saline 2 10 d s m according to fao rhoades et al 1992 while the ph was 7 7 and the sar was 4 9 meq l 1 0 5 as a result of poor irrigation management and the rapid expansion of date palm plantations the duration of the water rota can be up to 25 days bouksila 2011 after the tunisian revolution in 2011 many farmers have dug illicit wells to overcome the long duration of water rota and irrigation frequency drainage consists of collectors and tile drains buried 1 5 m deep and spaced 100 m apart due to the low natural slope proximity to a natural depression western and southern oasis limit and poor drainage network efficiency very shallow and saline groundwater was observed in this area since 2001 bouksila 2011 the soil moisture depth to groundwater and soil salinity of groundwater vary widely over the study area and at the time of measurement owing to irrigation water scheduling volume and frequency and the spatial variation of irrigation methods flooding improved surface irrigation etc drainage network efficiency and farmer agricultural management at a small plot scale bahri et al 2004 bouksila 2011 bouksila et al 2012 2 2 em38 multi height data collection an em survey was carried out during march 2018 in this regard an em38 geonics ltd mississauga canada was used to collect eca data fig 2c shows the spatial distribution of the 258 eca measurement points briefly eca was collected along 20 approximately north south aligned transects spaced 100 m apart along each transect eca measurements were taken at 50 m spacing coordinates eastings and northings m and altitude z m were determined by a trimble model 4600ls global positioning system with an accuracy of 0 01 m for easting and northing and 0 02 m for altitude at each location em38 eca was collected in horizontal ecah and vertical ecav dipole orientations and at four different heights including 0 i e ecah0 ecav0 0 2 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 0 4 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 and 0 6 m ecah0 6 ecav0 6 the theoretical depth of measurement of each orientation and height is presented in table 1 this set up represents investigation of the root zone with eight readings at different depths until the maximum theoretical depth of 0 1 5 m 2 3 soil sampling and laboratory analysis across the fatnassa oasis there is a network of piezometers installed at a depth between 2 and 3 m for ground water quality and land monitoring since 2001 bahri et al 2004 marlet et al 2009 bouksila et al 2012 the 51 piezometer locations were used as reference points fig 2d for ground water properties including ground water depth dgw m and electrical conductivity ecgw ds m due to the shallow groundwater in the study area the soil was sampled from the surface down to 1 m at each soil sample location five soil samples were collected at 0 2 m depth intervals for laboratory analysis including first 0 0 2 m second 0 2 0 4 m third 0 4 0 6 m fourth 0 6 0 8 m and last layer 0 8 1 0 m to avoid dehydration of the gypsum in fatnassa gypsiferous soil the samples were dried in a ventilated oven at 50 c for two days until the soil weight became constant fao 1990 bouksila et al 2008 the dry soil sample was then used to measure ece according to the protocol recommended by the united states department of agriculture s us salinity laboratory usda 1954 2 4 quasi 3d inversion of em38 data eca data were inverted using em4soil software triantafilis et al 2013 by applying a quasi 3d q 3d inversion algorithm the 1 d laterally constrained inversion algorithm developed by monteiro santos 2004 was used in this software the subsurface model in this algorithm is constructed by distributing a set of 1 d models according to the locations of the eca measurements two inversion algorithms s1 and s2 sasaki 1989 2001 which are variations of the occam regularisation degroot hedlin and constable 1990 were used in the s1 option the corrections to the model parameters at each iteration are calculated by solving the system of equations 1 j t j λ c t c δ p j t b in the s2 option the corrections of the parameters at each iteration are calculated solving the equations 2 j t j λ c t c δ p j t b λ c t c p p o where δ p is the vector comprising corrections of the parameters logarithm of conductivities p j of an initial model p o refers to a reference model b is the vector containing the differences between the logarithm of the observed and calculated apparent conductivities j is the jacobian matrix with elements given by σ j σ ai c σ ai c σ j λ is a damping factor and determines the amplitude of the parameter corrections in the space domain which controls the balance between data fit and model roughness farzamian et al 2019b the regularisation matrix c stores the coefﬁcients of the spatial roughness of the model parameters which is defined as 3 δ r j δ pje δ pjw 4 δ p δ pjn δ pjs where the elements of matrix c are 1 or 4 according to the position of the neighbours models resulting from the s2 algorithm are generally smoother than those from s1 since the s2 algorithm constrains the obtained variation around a reference model a cumulative function cf model mcneill 1980 as well as a full solution fs model monteiro santos et al 2010 were used to carry out forward modelling the model misﬁt is calculated using the following equation 4 misfit 1 n i 1 n ln σ a o σ a c 2 where n is the number of apparent conductivity value with σ a o and σ a c a representing observed and calculated σ a respectively the inversion proceeded until the maximum number of iterations was reached here set to 10 iterations or the inversion converged here taken to be when the objective function changed by less than 1 between iterations during the inversion process damping factors λ decrease gradually to resolve more detailed parameters inversion results will generally be smoother if the values are larger inversions with different damping factor values e g zare et al 2020 are usually conducted to determine the best damping factor value herein the aim is to determine a combination of the em38 data collected at different heights i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 inversion parameters including the inversion algorithm s1 or s2 and λ that provides the best linear regression lr between ece at all depths and σ the dipole orientation i e horizontal and vertical as well as the height of the sensor from the ground surface i e 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m were introduced to the em4soil software when preparing the em38 data for inversion in terms of λ values in 0 05 0 5 range were assigned to compare the various parameter choices inversion of eca data collected at each location was generated applying an initial model of seven layers i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 1 2 1 5 m which were kept fixed during the inversion process the first five layers are equal to the lower depth at which soil samples were collected and for laboratory determination of ece with that the estimates in σ required for calibration validation and generation of ece maps from inversion of eca data based on variation of the measured eca at different heights the initial model was defined with electrical conductivity of 50 ms m for first two layers 100 ms m for 0 6 and 0 8 m 200 ms m for the deeper layers at 1 and 1 2 m and 300 ms m for the 1 5 m and deeper 2 5 model calibration and validation the optimal combination of eca data collected at different heights 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m inversion parameters including the inversion algorithm s1 or s2 and λ were determined to provide the best linear regression lr model between estimates of σ and ece at all depths to compare the coefficient of determination r2 of the different combinations the classification of moore and kirkland 2007 whereby r2 was strong 0 70 moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 weak 0 3 r2 0 5 and very weak 0 3 was considered for this purpose the reference dataset was divided into two subsets for development of a calibration and validation dataset the two subsets were obtained with the r software r core team 2018 function createdatapartition of the caret package assigning 70 i e n 35 of the sample locations to the calibration set and the remaining 30 i e n 16 of the sample locations to the validation set and as a function of the distribution of the eca data collected in both horizontal and vertical modes of operation and all heights i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 so that there is a balanced distribution within the two subsets to evaluate the prediction ability of the lr model the prediction bias accuracy and agreement were assessed bias of predictions was compared considering the mean error me at validation locations 5 me 1 n j 1 n y x where x and y are the measured and predicted ece respectively it evaluates whether the modelling consistently over positive or under predicted negative ece with values closest to zero are the least biased the accuracy of prediction was assessed by calculating the root mean square error rmse which is square root of mean of the squared differences between measured x and predicted y ece 6 rmse 1 n j 1 n x y 2 as with the me values closest to zero are the most accurate moreover and according to singh et al 2005 if the rmse is less than half the standard deviation sd of the measured property then this is deemed a satisfactory prediction the agreement between measured and predicted ece was also considered using the lin s concordance correlation coefficient lccc described in lin 1989 this is because the lccc shows how close the prediction conforms to the measured values along a 45 degree line from the origin i e 1 1 line and as follows 7 lccc 2 s xy s x 2 s y 2 x y 2 where x and y are the means for the measured and predicted ece respectively s x 2 and s y 2 are the corresponding variances and 2 s xy is the covariance between the two 8 s xy 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y mcbride 2005 suggests that the prediction agreement can be categorised according to the lin s whereby it is excellent 0 9 good 0 8 0 9 moderate 0 65 0 8 and poor 0 65 a 95 confidence interval ci was also calculated and used to evaluate the uncertainty between the predicted and measured ece the ci demonstrates a range that is expected to contain the true value of the predicted ece curran everett 2009 specifically uncertainty was calculated for ece y ˆ i for each estimate in σ value x i obtained 9 s y ˆ s yx n 1 x 1 x var x 2 where s yx is the standard error i e rmse of the lr and var x is the population variance of x the ci for y ˆ i is then calculated by multiplying syx by tα 2 n 2 α value is for two tails at a significance level of 0 05 as described in khongnawang et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 data analysis groundwater properties fig 2e shows the spatial distribution of dgw m in the southwest it was shallowest i e 0 5 m and in general was within the root zone i e 1 m along the western margin in the centre and along the southwestern third the remaining areas in the centre and to the north were beyond the rootzone i e 1 2 m and relatively less influenced by capillary rise of saline groundwater this was also the case in the northeast corner where dgw was deepest i e 2 m fig 2f shows the spatial distribution of ecgw ds m unlike the elevation and dgw which generally had trends from the southwest to northeast corner ecgw was more variable taking into account the fao water quality guidelines rhoades et al 1992 the ecgw was highly saline i e 10 ds m in the southwest corner northwest margin centre southeast and northeast corners in the remaining areas it was moderately saline 2 10 ds m these results can be explained by the complex nature of the salt and water balance input output in the oasis due to the climatic conditions spatial variation of irrigation scheduling rate and frequency water quality from deep aquifer and or private well drainage network efficiency and the underground flow between inside and outside of the oasis bahri et al 2004 marlet et al 2009 bouksila 2011 3 2 data analysis ece table 2a shows the basic calibration summary statistics of ece at the various depth increments table 2b shows this for the ece at the calibration locations i e n 35 in the first layer 0 0 2 m the minimum ece 3 4 ds m was slightly saline 2 4 ds m with the mean 5 28 ds m moderately and maximum 10 57 ds m highly saline the ece had near identical minimum 3 39 ds m and maximum 9 03 ds m ece and equivalent mean 5 11 ds m in the second layer 0 2 0 4 m as for the remaining layers the minimum ece was 3 46 and 3 92 ds m slightly saline in the third 0 4 0 6 m and fourth 0 6 0 8 m layers respectively with the last layer 4 06 ds m at the lower end of moderately saline it is worth noting that the minimum ece at all depths were within the salinity range at which selection of moderately tolerant 3 6 ds m crops is necessary with the ece 4 ds m threshold at which date palm phoenix dactylifera are influenced by salinity is exceeded in the last layer it is also worth noting that the maximum ece increased with increasing depth with the ece values equal to 10 77 14 99 and 14 18 ds m in the 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 m layers respectively all highly 8 16 ds m saline barrett lennard et al 2008 the implications of this subsoil salt load are that via capillary rise and mobilisation into the rootzone will require soil and water management as well as the selection of salinity tolerant 6 10 ds m crops table 2c shows the summary statistics for the ece at the validation locations i e n 16 in the first layer the minimum ece 3 68 ds m was slightly saline 2 4 ds m with the mean 7 49 ds m moderately 4 8 ds m and maximum 36 7 ds m extremely 32 ds m saline while the statistics for this layer in the calibration samples were in equivalent salinity classes this was not the case for the maximum value this was similarly the case for the validation ece data in the second layer which had near identical minimum ece 3 62 ds m with the calibration data but the mean 7 8 ds m was larger as too was the maximum 34 7 ds m the validation ece data for remaining depths show also relatively larger maximum and mean values compared to the calibration dataset but the difference is smaller than those found in the first and second layers to better understand these basic statistics fig 3a shows measured ece at the validation locations in terms of salinity profiles locations 3 17 and 22 represent uniformly slightly saline profiles located in areas where dgw was approximately 1 m and ecgw was moderately saline whereas locations 26 and 53 represent uniformly moderately saline profiles in areas where dgw was approximately 1 m and the ecgw was at the lower end of highly saline location 19 represents a moderately saline profile in areas where the dgw was approximately 1 5 m and the ecgw was moderately saline leached salinity profiles were evident at locations 5 187 and 225 which increase in ece with depth from moderately to highly saline they were in areas where dgw was 1 1 m and ecgw was at larger end of moderately saline or smaller end of highly saline similarly profile 48 was also a leached profile but here dgw was 1 m with ecgw at the larger end of highly saline the only inverted salinity profile in the validation data set was at location 27 whereby salinity increased from the subsoil 16 ds m to the topsoil 32 ds m this is the only soil profile with extreme salinity and the reason for the disparity between the maximum values of the calibration and validation data in the first three layers as such this may make it difficult to predict ece at this location as it would appear to be beyond the range of the calibration data another possible explanation for the differences between the statistics of two datasets lies in the selection procedure since the soil samples were divided into calibration and validation sets based on the eca data not the ece values depending on the correlation between eca and ece they may not yield equivalent sampling in terms of ece additionally the vertical changes in ece values of each sampling location are not taken into account in the selection process which could further affect the statistics of two datasets this step however is unavoidable as part of the selection process since sampling locations should be determined based on the observed spatial variation of eca data 3 3 multi height eca data fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the measured eca of both orientations and at various heights for example fig 4a shows the ecah0 was large i e 460 ms m at two locations in the centre ecah0 generally decreased away from these locations and then increased but to intermediate large 340 460 ms m and intermediate 220 340 ms m values in the northwest southwest south and northeast fig 4b shows the ecav0 was equivalent to ecah0 in terms of the spatial distribution however table 3a shows that the maximum ecah0 606 ms m was larger than that for ecav0 515 ms m at one of these locations in centre of the study area this suggests that ece at this site may be inverted i e more salinity in the topsoil than subsoil moreover this was consistent with where there was shallow saline groundwater table close to 1 m and where capillary action would most likely drive salt into the rootzone fig 2e in addition the large ecav0 was most likely a function of the highly saline nature of the ecgw i e 23 ds m as shown in fig 2f table 3b shows the basic summary statistics of the eca at the calibration sites and measured at various height increments on the ground the minimum ecah0 25 ms m was smaller than the minimum ecav0 37 ms m with the mean 94 ms m and maximum 337 ms m ecah0 similarly smaller than the ecav0 126 and 344 ms m respectively this suggests that σ increases with depth at calibration sites since ecav has greater investigation depth as shown in table 1 it is worth noting that the sd of ecah0 74 18 was slightly larger than the ecav0 56 55 with the coefficient of variation cv of ecah0 78 91 slightly larger than the ecav0 56 55 both data sets had large values of kurtosis with the ecah0 6 64 larger than ecav0 4 53 with both being leptokurtic value is greater than 1 0 as the instrument was raised in increments of 0 2 m eca statistics in both orientations decreased in magnitude given the reduced depth response for example when the instrument was raised to a height of 0 4 m the ecah0 4 minimum 11 ms m mean 49 ms m and maximum 157 ms m were approximately half that of the ecah0 the sd and kurtosis also generally decreased however the cv generally increased in comparison between ecah and ecav the ecah data show a larger cv regardless of sensor height suggesting greater variability of σ in shallower soil layers because ecah measurements have a smaller investigation depth and greater sensitivity to the shallower soil layers greater variability of σ is expected in shallower soil layers mostly in the first layer due to large spatial variability of soil moisture in this layer which influence σ significantly table 3c also shows the basic summary statistics of the eca at the validation sites and measured at various height overall the summary statistics were equivalent to that shown and indicated at the calibration locations and for each orientation and height which reveals that the latter was a reflection of the former this was also the case for the calibration data of diminishing number of calibration sample locations i e n 30 25 5 however these summary statistics are not shown 3 4 correlation between measurements of eca and ece to understand whether eca in either orientation or various heights would be satisfactory on their own and to establish a lr with ece table 4 shows the r2 between eca and the various measured ece depth increments at all 51 soil sample locations with respect to ecah0 the best r2 was with the third layer 0 59 and fourth layers 0 55 ece which would be both considered to be moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 whereas in the first layer 0 48 second layer 0 41 and last layer 0 49 they were weak 0 3 r2 0 5 similar r2 were achieved between ecav0 with the best r2 being for the last layer 0 60 fourth layer 0 55 and third layer 0 54 ece all considered moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 whereas in the first layer 0 32 and second layer 0 40 they remained weak 0 3 r2 0 5 with increasing height r2 remained weak at first and second layers with no improvement in any other layer while a lr between ecah0 and ecav0 and ece of last three layers was moderate the remaining lr with either of these two eca measurements taken on the soil surface or other heights and any other measured ece in the first two layers was weak as such these lr models were not satisfactory to predict ece in these layers given this zone was of high importance for soil use and water management due to the root density of forage crops and its production impact on farmer s income this makes these calibrations unsatisfactory in addition this approach requires development of an individual lr for each depth increment meaning that each calibration can only be used for specific depth prediction of ece this also means there would be larger model errors particularly in the first two layers which was found to be problematic even in areas where there was a strong r2 between eca and ece huang et al 2015 3 5 correlation between estimates of σ and ece table 5 shows r2 between measured ece at various depths including 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 0 m at all locations i e n 51 and estimates of σ at same depths from inversion of ecah and ecav and various heights the largest r2 0 61 was obtained with the inversion model which included the use of ecah0 ecah0 2 ecav0 and ecav0 2 and applying cf forward model s1 inversion algorithm and a λ value of 0 20 and the maximum number of 10 iterations this r2 while equivalent to r2 between ecav0 and last layer ece 0 60 as well as between ecah0 and third layer ece 0 59 was better than any of the other depth specific lr moreover lr between σ and ece can be used to predict ece at any depth with higher accuracy and agreement due to a larger r2 and more confidence due to the larger number of soil samples used for calibration inclusion of ecah0 4 and ecav0 4 to inversion modelling did not improve r2 0 52 nor addition of ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 to inversion modelling 0 42 moreover using only ecah0 or ecav0 did not improve r2 0 53 with all these models being at lower end of moderate given these results inversion of em38 eca values measured using ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 and ecav0 2 were considered optimal and these data were used for further analysis and interpretation this inversion modelling result m3 was considered for predicting soil ece maps in the study area in fig 5 the measured eca against model responses calculated eca for the ecah0 ecah0 2 ecav0 and ecav0 2 which was included in the inversion of m3 model was plotted there is a very good agreement between the model responses and the measured eca which indicates reliable estimation of σ distribution from the measured eca data 3 6 model calibration and validation fig 6a shows the plot of σ versus measured ece considering n 35 calibration soil sample locations the r2 was moderate 0 56 the calibration equation was then used to evaluate the prediction ability in the validation soil sample locations fig 6b shows the plot of measured versus predicted ece in the validation soil sample locations fig 6b shows a good 1 1 concordance when measured and predicted ece was either moderately 4 8 ds m or highly saline 8 16 ds m this was not the case for severely saline 16 32 ds m ece however at validation location site 27 as indicated previously two samples i e first and second layers fell outside the range of the calibration data and were outliers and they were under predicted as such they were excluded from further consideration and analysis of prediction agreement and accuracy the three other samples at this location and from the last three layers were included however the bias me between measured and predicted ece at the validation points is very small 0 34 ds m and the slightly negative me indicates bias was toward under prediction the rmse of 2 94 ds m between measured and predicted ece at the validation points suggest a relatively good accuracy of prediction in terms of agreement between measured and predicted ece at the validation points the lccc of 0 80 suggest a good agreement 3 7 depth slices of predicted soil ece fig 7 shows spatial variation of predicted ece at different depths fig 7a shows predicted ece in the first layer was mostly moderately saline with only a slightly saline area mapped in one location this was consistent with the calibration 5 28 ds m and validation 5 4 ds m data where the mean ece 5 28 ds m were both moderately saline however there were a few small pockets in the centre northwest and northeast corners as well as a contiguous area in the southeast corner where ece was highly saline figs 7b and 7c showed that the predicted ece were equivalent in the second and third layers this indicates that across most of the oasis the soil was characterised by profiles that were uniformly either moderately or highly saline within rootzone the reason for this is driven by the hot climate köppen classification namely the meagre rainfall i e 100 mm per year and large potential evapotranspiration i e 2500 mm per year as a result poor quality irrigation water i e 3 7 ds m available from a deep aquifer is used this causes salinity to build up uniformly in the soil owing to lack of leaching by rainfall of the applied saline water while the salinity is only moderate 4 8 ds m in most places soil water and crop management would be required to enable the sustainable production of the most productive cash crop of date palms i e phoenix dactylifera this is because the ece of dates at initial yield decline is 4 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 figs 7d and 7e showed that the predicted ece in the last two layers were equivalent for the most part and with respect to areas of moderate salinity where salinity was uniform throughout profile and exemplified at location 3 fig 3a in other areas where ece was highly saline in the centre and western margin of the fatnassa oasis the extent of salinization was larger in the centre the reason was most likely due to ecgw fig 2f being intermediate large 15 19 ds m to large 19 ds m and proximity of groundwater to the rootzone i e 1 1 1 2 m the root zone is thus susceptible to capillary rise and inevitably a redistribution of salts from the subsoil into the topsoil the issue of rising water tables seems to be problematic and was exemplified in the extremely saline and inverted profile 27 fig 3a in the northern part of the study area where the elevation was low 18 5 m dgw relatively shallow 1 1 m and ecgw was highly saline 23 ds m this was similarly the case at location 11 where ece in the fourth layer was moderately saline but owing to capillary rise salts were mobilised into the topsoil making ece highly saline here the elevation while higher 21 5 m and ecgw smaller 11 ds m it was still highly saline and susceptible to capillary rise with dgw also shallow and less than 1 m from the soil surface the irrigation event frequency and dose and the drainage efficiency have a large impact of groundwater properties ecgw and dwt and the shape of soil salinity profile often after irrigation the inverted soil salinity profile is leached at topsoil and it shapes evolves according to irrigation scheduling and groundwater properties ecgw and dgw this was similarly the case in the southwest corner near exemplified by location 225 which was closest to chott el jerid drainage outlet where the elevation was low 17 5 m and dgw also shallow and less than 0 6 m from the soil surface fig 2e as a result the very low natural and open drainage collector slope was the main cause of the poor efficiency of the drainage network and therefore the creation of a shallow and saline groundwater this is due to the almost no irrigation such as the abandoned fields at plot 11 and or poor efficiency of the drainage network due to a mineral and root clogging of the drainage pipe and the low open drainage collector slope these isolated areas were observed since 2001 and well described by bahri et al 2004 and bouksila et al 2012 3 8 depth slices of ci for predicted ece fig 8a shows the spatial distribution of ci for predicted ece in the first layer the ci was small 1 and intermediate small 1 1 2 in most areas and associated with predicted ece which was moderate this suggests reasonable confidence in predictions of soil salinity in the first layer and in this range 4 8 ds m for example in fig 3a which shows measured and fig 3b which shows predicted ece there was equivalence in salinity of uniform moderately saline ece for profiles 16 and 26 accordingly it can be said that most of the fatnassa oasis has been impacted by soil salinization and as a function of irrigation using poor water quality under low efficiency of drainage network and surface irrigation system as a result and owing to the hot climate meagre rainfall salts added have not been leached and therefore led to accumulation of salts into the rootzone conversely the ci was intermediate 1 2 1 4 intermediate large 1 4 1 6 and large 1 6 in areas where the predicted ece was highly saline this suggests a little more uncertainty in the predictions when ece was larger however the uncertainty was again not large equivalent ci was evident in the deeper layers i e figs 8c and 8d moreover the ci was equivalent to those reported by khongnawang et al 2022 who predicted ece at various depths at 0 3 m increments and to a depth of 1 5 m across a small area of 9 fields covering 5 ha in the muang pea irrigation area and adjacent to the kham rean canal in northeast thailand in their study predicted ece was smaller and included non saline slightly and moderately saline ece with less variation in ci i e 0 45 to 0 9 nevertheless the cause of the larger ci can be attributed to the rapid change in ece from moderately saline to highly saline over short spatial scales average farm size about 0 25 ha to explain this fig 4 shows the measured eca using the em38 in various orientations and heights above the ground this was particularly the case about the eca collected on the ground e g ecah0 and ecav0 and near the soil surface in the horizontal mode of operation e g ecah0 2 and ecav0 2 the short scale variation in eca can be seen particularly in the east west direction because eca was only collected along transects spaced 100 m apart compared with 50 m on the north south transects since em4soil is based on a 1 dimensional spatial constrained technique the estimates of σ are smoothed considering adjacent eca monteiro santos et al 2010 if the eca changes rapidly this tends to cause smoothing of the data and subsequently herein mostly under estimation of σ and subsequently under predicted ece as seen in figs 3a and 3b the reason of the short scale variation and the isolated instances of highly saline areas is most likely attributable to water and soil management effects particularly irrigation practices at the farmers field level at the time of the survey additional information including soil type irrigation system i e traditional or improved surface system and scheduling dose frequency or land use were not recorded knowledge about the soil water and crop management is necessary to understand the causes of these so called hotspots or the point source of the highly saline ece this in turn would enable suitable management strategies to be employed including but not limited to soil management to raise the seed bed or design it in such a way to enable salts to be drawn away from the seed changes in irrigation water application e g from flood to localised such bubbler or drip irrigation increase the drainage network efficiency and or use of a more salt tolerant plant or varieties of a plant in the tunisian oases affected by soil salinization farmers practice sandy amendments about 0 2 0 3 m thickness to develop a non saline soil at seed bed bouksila et al 2012 karbout et al 2020 to reduce the ci for ece prediction in shallower layers additional eca could be collected on a 50 m grid this would provide at least 1 data point per field one every 0 25 ha and remove some of uncertainty in prediction as a function of short scale variation caused by different management practices moreover additional eca measurements in area with greater spatial variability of σ could also reduce the ci to improve prediction of ece in deeper layers an emi sensor with deeper investigation depth such as the em31 instrument could be used this is because it has an inter coil spacing of 3 66 m between a transmitter and receiver coil and owing to the low frequency 10 khz and when held 1 m above the soil surface it enables a depth weighted measurement of eca between 0 and 3 and 0 6 m in the horizontal ecah and vertical ecav orientations respectively as a result there would be additional eca data to assist in predicting ece in deeper layers and in addition resolve the location of the often saline groundwater this approach requires joint inversion of the em38 and em31 eca and was shown to be useful by triantafilis and monteiro santos 2011 in predicting topsoil and subsoil ece along a single transect and considering em38 eca data collected in both modes of operation and at a single height i e 0 6 m and equivalent em31 eca i e 1 m this was similarly shown by zhao et al 2018 to improve prediction of topsoil and subsoil cation exchange capacity across a small field using em38 eca data collected in both modes of operation and at a single height i e 0 2 m and equivalent em31 eca i e 1 m alternatively a single frequency multiple coil em instrument such as dualem 421 could be used this is because several authors zare et al 2015 stockmann et al 2017 have found that using this type of instrument improve efficiency of eca data collection given a dualem 1 provides eca equivalent to em38 ecah and ecav while the dualem 4 component gives eca similar to an em31 moreover dualem 2 arrays provide additional data which provides eca at depths in between an em38 and em31 it is also possible to argue that the operator body may influence the emi measurements when the operator performs the measurements at different heights and approach the sensor to read eca values during the current study it was ensured that all sites used a consistent measurement procedure to minimise the possibility of this effect on overall results in addition this effect may be more significant in areas with lower electrical conductivity which is not the case in our site with high salinity of soil future studies can study such effects in study areas having low electrical conductivity 4 conclusions in this study and to add value to limited saturated soil paste extract ece data we collected proximally sensed apparent soil electrical conductivity eca ms m data using an em instrument em38 with a single pair of coils at two horizontal and vertical dipole orientations and four heights i e 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m across a large area of fatnassa saharan climate oasis southern tunisia resulting in a total set of eight eca i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 from this data the spatial distribution of soil electrical conductivity σ was estimated by q 3d inversion of eca data and evaluated the potential for prediction of the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract ece good ece prediction from multi height em38 eca data were achieved by q 3d inversion of eca data collected at 0 and 0 2 m heights r2 0 61 based on these results it recommended to have ecah and ecav measurements on the surface and at the height of 0 2 m i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 and to use the s1 algorithm along with small λ values as this most likely presents the best combination under the investigated field condition the calibration validation procedure based on assigning 35 of the sampling sites to the calibration set and the remaining 16 boreholes to the validations sets show good accuracy rmse 2 94 ds m small bias me 0 56 ds m and good concordance lin s 0 80 given the large variability of measured groundwater depth 0 4 to over 3 m and its electrical conductivity 6 24 ds m ece 3 37 ds m and different management practices for the calibration and validation procedure fewer boreholes may suffice therefore an effort could be made to explore the optimal number of soil samples needed as proposed for example by li et al 2019 one of the challenging issues in many research institutes and enterprises especially in the developing countries is the lack of access to more recent developed and expensive multi coil or multi frequency emi instruments which enables measuring eca at different depths simultaneously at a single pass the alternative solution proposed in this study is to measure eca data using a single coil instrument but at different heights allowing us to collect sufficient data required for inversion modelling and improved quantitative investigation of soil properties this study shows that using multiple measurements with a single coil instrument allows establishing a single calibration equation that can be used to predict ece i e soil salinity indicator at any desirable depth with more confidence due to the larger number of soil samples used for the calibration and validation in the absence of sufficient eca data and inversion process depth specific linear regression lr can be only established and therefore ece data from the specific depth can be only used in the calibration and validation procedure this may add additional limitation to the methodology when the number of boreholes is limited moreover the resulting r2 in our case study is significantly better than each depth specific calibration and more specifically in the first layer where the depth specific calibration does not provide satisfactory results the overall approach used in this study allowed to develop a landscape scale 3d map of baseline soil salinity status across an area of about 150 ha the predicted ece reveals that the soil of the oasis is moderately saline 4 8 ds m in general and in all investigated depths which may comprise the agricultural productivity in addition there is an increasing trend in soil salinity in the south west of study area where the groundwater is shallow and several isolated areas that is consistent with the trend in groundwater salinity the soil is highly saline 8 16 ds m in these zones due to shallow and saline groundwater and low drainage efficiency requiring soil and water management improvement to maintain the soil salinity below the plant salinity tolerance and to reduce the soil degradation measures to improve the soil quality regarding salinity can be to improve the efficiency of the drainage system and the irrigation scheduling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8914,approximately half of tunisia s irrigated area suffers from soil salinization due to arid and semi arid conditions irrigation with low quality water shallow and saline groundwater and poor drainage to manage salt affected soils efficient assessment methods are needed to map soil salinity in irrigated lands and to evaluate the performance of crop water and soil management strategies in this study apparent soil electrical conductivity eca data were collected using a non invasive electromagnetic induction emi instrument em38 at different dipole orientations and heights from the soil surface across the large agricultural area of fatnassa saharan an oasis in southern tunisia using a quasi 3d q 3d inversion algorithm the spatial distribution of true soil electrical conductivity σ was estimated and the potential for prediction of the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract ece from inverted eca data was evaluated by establishing a linear regression lr between σ and ece collected at 51 reference points the results indicate that the q 3d inversion of eca measured at 0 and 0 2 m heights gives the best coefficient of determination r2 between σ and ece r2 0 61 calibration procedure was performed afterward to develop a single calibration equation and an independent validation dataset to evaluate the robustness of the obtained calibration model the calibration validation procedure shows moderate strength r2 0 56 good accuracy with the root mean square error rmse of 2 94 ds m small bias with mean error me of 0 56 ds m and an acceptable lin s concordance correlation coefficient lccc of 0 80 our study reveals the applicability of using the proposed methodology based on inversion of eca data collected at multiple heights and orientations to develop a single regional calibration and to efficiently estimate ece at any depth across the irrigation district also in the absence of recent devolved multicoil emi instruments eca data measured using a single coil instrument but at different heights can provide sufficient data required for inversion modelling and quantitative investigation of soil properties the prediction results reveal that the soil of the oasis is moderately to severely saline which may adversely affect agricultural productivity and the sustainability of crop production keywords electromagnetic induction tunisian oasis multi heights eca measurements quasi 3d inversion 3d soil salinity mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the semi arid areas of tunisia account for two thirds of the country with the remaining one third being arid ben boubaker 2016 to supplement the meagre rainfall irrigation is used however of the potential water resources available approximately half i e 52 of the groundwater has a total dissolved salt tds between 1 5 and 3 g l and two thirds of deep aquifers are of higher salinity i e tds 3 g l khanfir 2017 while irrigation improved productivity in the short term the use of low quality irrigation water has led to about half of the total irrigated area in tunisia 435 000 ha suffering from soil salinization dgacta 2007 bouksila 2011 which negatively affects natural resources and crop production bouksila 2011 to limit further degradation an understanding of the spatial extent of areas of soil salinity is essential to improve soil water and crop management and maintain agriculture productivity bouksila et al 2013 therefore information about the measured soil electrical conductivity of a saturated soil paste extract ece ds m as an indicator of soil salinity is necessary specifically the spatial extent of non 0 2 ds m slightly 2 4 ds m moderately 4 8 ds m highly 8 16 ds m and extremely saline 16 32 ds m areas barrett lennard et al 2008 this information aims to identify areas requiring management and also to select moderately tolerant 3 6 ds m and tolerant 6 10 ds m crops to salinity the laboratory measurement of soil ece is time prohibitive owing for the need to prepare the internationally recognised standard saturated soil paste extract this is because the soil paste is required to stand for 24 h with a tedious vacuum system used to suction out the extract with salinity subsequently determined by measuring the conductance of an electrical current through the extract to value add to the limited soil ece proximal soil sensors can be used including the use of electromagnetic em induction instruments they are popular because they can non invasively measure the soil apparent electrical conductivity eca ms m which is often related to ece e g corwin and lesch 2003 bouksila et al 2012 one of the most used instruments is the geonics em38 geonics ltd mississauga canada which can measure eca in the root zone this is because it has an inter coil spacing of 1 m between a transmitter and receiver coil and owing to the low frequency 14 khz it enables a depth weighted measurement of eca between 0 and 0 75 and 0 1 50 m in the horizontal ecah and vertical ecav orientations respectively em application has been initially conducted in salinized semi arid and arid areas to develop a calibration between eca and ece e g diaz and herrero 1992 which is used to map salinity at the field lesch et al 1998 plot amezketa 2006 and regional nogués et al 2006 scales later investigations become a little more sophisticated for example to study growth and yield response of olive cultivars subject to three irrigation water salinity treatments aragüés et al 2010 or mapping salinity in fields affected by saline ground water herrero and hudnall 2013 in most instances eca is calibrated against ece at specific increments or average depth the former prone to errors huang et al 2015 while latter doesn t provide information about profile ece i e uniform inverted or leached required to understand salinity processes and monitor impact of management to overcome this constraint multiple eca measurements can be inverted to estimate the true soil electrical conductivity σ distribution several inversion methods have been proposed to estimate the σ distribution from the measured eca data e g monteiro

2022 which is also widely used to predict ece for example huang et al 2017 showed that by inverting dualem 1 data across a dryland wheat field ece could be mapped in 3 d koganti et al 2018 showed how dualem 21 data could map ece in hyper salinized fields in india and gómez flores et al 2022 showed how dualem 21 data could map ece and sodium absorption ratio sar in 3 d in the b xii irrigation district in southwest spain a heavy clay reclaimed marsh area farzamian et al 2021 also showed how time lapse cmd mini explorer data can be used to assess the dynamics of soil salinity the use of single coil instruments such as the em38 geonics ltd mississauga canada at different heights from the soil surface has also been demonstrated to be a useful tool for obtaining multiple eca measurements that can be used for inverse modelling e g farzamian et al 2015 since many countries and institutes do not have access to the recently developed and more expensive multicoil emi sensors this alternative solution has been used successfully to map soil salinity and sodicity e g farzamian et al 2019a paz et al 2020a and also to assess the dynamics of soil salinity in irrigated lands e g paz et al 2020b however this approach is still not the norm in salinity mapping an example is tunisia where there has been no study on using the inverse modelling and multiple eca readings to obtain the distribution of σ and map the soil salinity distribution with depth although the soil salinity is a major concern across the country in the present study the use of an em38 eca collected at multiple heights and quasi 3d q 3d inversion algorithm was investigated to create maps of soil ece at landscape scale of about 150 ha and various depths in a tunisian hot desert climate under varying

2005 these are situated in three sectors sector 1 in the east sector 2 in the northwest and sector 3 in the southwest the oasis altitude ranges from 26 m in the north to 16 m in the south with the slope of about 0 3 0 5 fig 2b the farming system is mainly composed of date palms and fodder crops traditional surface irrigation is the main method used in the oasis although canals were replaced with pipes in some areas to improve water irrigation efficiency bouksila 2011 irrigation water is a mixture of groundwater from the complex terminal aquifer system and the artesian aquifer of the intercalary continental marlet et al 2009 a water tower allows the transport of water by gravity through three open concrete channels which serve in turn rota the three irrigated sectors fig 2a during the survey period the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water of the deeper aquifer was 3 7 ds m which is at the lower end of moderately saline 2 10 d s m according to fao rhoades et al 1992 while the ph was 7 7 and the sar was 4 9 meq l 1 0 5 as a result of poor irrigation management and the rapid expansion of date palm plantations the duration of the water rota can be up to 25 days bouksila 2011 after the tunisian revolution in 2011 many farmers have dug illicit wells to overcome the long duration of water rota and irrigation frequency drainage consists of collectors and tile drains buried 1 5 m deep and spaced 100 m apart due to the low natural slope proximity to a natural depression western and southern oasis limit and poor drainage network efficiency very shallow and saline groundwater was observed in this area since 2001 bouksila 2011 the soil moisture depth to groundwater and soil salinity of groundwater vary widely over the study area and at the time of measurement owing to irrigation water scheduling volume and frequency and the spatial variation of irrigation methods flooding improved surface irrigation etc drainage network efficiency and farmer

em38 geonics ltd mississauga canada was used to collect eca data fig 2c shows the spatial distribution of the 258 eca measurement points briefly eca was collected along 20 approximately north south aligned transects spaced 100 m apart along each transect eca measurements were taken at 50 m spacing coordinates eastings and northings m and altitude z m were determined by a trimble model 4600ls global positioning system with an accuracy of 0 01 m for easting and northing and 0 02 m for altitude at each location em38 eca was collected in horizontal ecah and vertical ecav dipole orientations and at four different heights including 0 i e ecah0 ecav0 0 2 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 0 4 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 and 0 6 m ecah0 6 ecav0 6 the theoretical depth of measurement of each orientation and height is presented in table 1 this set up represents investigation of the root zone with eight readings at different depths until the maximum theoretical depth of 0 1 5 m 2 3 soil sampling and laboratory analysis across the fatnassa oasis there is a network of piezometers installed at a depth between 2 and 3 m for ground water quality and land monitoring since 2001 bahri et al 2004 marlet et al 2009 bouksila et al 2012 the 51 piezometer locations were used as reference points fig 2d for ground water properties including ground water depth dgw m and electrical conductivity ecgw ds m due to the shallow groundwater in the study area the soil was sampled from the surface down to 1 m at each soil sample location five soil samples were collected at 0 2 m depth intervals for laboratory analysis including first 0 0 2 m second 0 2 0 4 m third 0 4 0 6 m fourth 0 6 0 8 m and last layer 0 8 1 0 m to avoid dehydration of the gypsum in fatnassa gypsiferous soil the samples were dried in a ventilated oven at 50 c for two days until the soil weight became constant fao 1990 bouksila et al 2008 the dry soil sample was then used to measure ece according to the protocol recommended by the united states department of agriculture s us salinity laboratory usda 1954 2 4 quasi 3d inversion of em38 data eca data were inverted using em4soil software triantafilis et al 2013 by applying a quasi 3d q 3d inversion algorithm the 1 d laterally constrained inversion algorithm developed by monteiro santos 2004 was used in this software the subsurface model in this algorithm is constructed by distributing a set of 1 d models according to the locations of the eca measurements two inversion algorithms s1 and s2 sasaki 1989 2001 which are variations of the occam regularisation degroot hedlin and constable 1990 were used in the s1 option the corrections to the model parameters at each iteration are calculated by solving the system of equations 1 j t j λ c t c δ p j t b in the s2 option the corrections of the parameters at each iteration are calculated solving the equations 2 j t j λ c t c δ p j t b λ c t c p p o where δ p is the vector comprising corrections of the parameters logarithm of conductivities p j of an initial model p o refers to a reference model b is the vector containing the differences between the logarithm of the observed and calculated apparent conductivities j is the jacobian matrix with elements given by σ j σ ai c σ ai c σ j λ is a damping factor and determines the amplitude of the parameter corrections in the space domain which controls the balance between data fit and model roughness farzamian et al 2019b the regularisation matrix c stores the coefﬁcients of the spatial roughness of the model parameters which is defined as 3 δ r j δ pje δ pjw 4 δ p δ pjn δ pjs where the elements of matrix c are 1 or 4 according to the position of the neighbours models resulting from the s2 algorithm are generally smoother than those from s1 since the s2 algorithm constrains the obtained variation around a reference model a cumulative function cf model mcneill 1980 as well as a full solution fs model monteiro santos et al 2010 were used to carry out forward modelling the model misﬁt is calculated using the following equation 4 misfit 1 n i 1 n ln σ a o σ a c 2 where n is the number of apparent conductivity value with σ a o and σ a c a representing observed and calculated σ a respectively the inversion proceeded until the maximum number of iterations was reached here set to 10 iterations or the inversion converged here taken to be when the objective function changed by less than 1 between iterations during the inversion process damping factors λ decrease gradually to resolve more detailed parameters inversion results will generally be smoother if the values are larger inversions with different damping factor values e g zare et al 2020 are usually conducted to determine the best damping factor value herein the aim is to determine a combination of the em38 data collected at different heights i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 inversion parameters including the inversion algorithm s1 or s2 and λ that provides the best linear regression lr between ece at all depths and σ the dipole orientation i e horizontal and vertical as well as the height of the sensor from the ground surface i e 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m were introduced to the em4soil software when preparing the em38 data for inversion in terms of λ values in 0 05 0 5 range were assigned to compare the various parameter choices inversion of eca data collected at each location was generated applying an initial model of seven layers i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 1 2 1 5 m which were kept fixed during the inversion process the first five layers are equal to the lower depth at which soil samples were collected and for laboratory determination of ece with that the estimates in σ required for calibration validation and generation of ece maps from inversion of eca data based on variation of the measured eca at different heights the initial model was defined with electrical conductivity of 50 ms m for first two layers 100 ms m for 0 6 and 0 8 m 200 ms m for the deeper layers at 1 and 1 2 m and 300 ms m for the 1 5 m and deeper 2 5 model calibration and validation the optimal combination of eca data collected at different heights 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m inversion parameters including the inversion algorithm s1 or s2 and λ were determined to provide the best linear regression lr model between estimates of σ and ece at all depths to compare the coefficient of determination r2 of the different combinations the classification of moore and kirkland 2007 whereby r2 was strong 0 70 moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 weak 0 3 r2 0 5 and very weak 0 3 was considered for this purpose the reference dataset was divided into two subsets for development of a calibration and validation dataset the two subsets were obtained with the r software r core team 2018 function createdatapartition of the caret package assigning 70 i e n 35 of the sample locations to the calibration set and the remaining 30 i e n 16 of the sample locations to the validation set and as a function of the distribution of the eca data collected in both horizontal and vertical modes of operation and all heights i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 so that there is a balanced distribution within the two subsets to evaluate the prediction ability of the lr model the prediction bias accuracy and agreement were assessed bias of predictions was compared considering the mean error me at validation locations 5 me 1 n j 1 n y x where x and y are the measured and predicted ece respectively it evaluates whether the modelling consistently over positive or under predicted negative ece with values closest to zero are the least biased the accuracy of prediction was assessed by calculating the root mean square error rmse which is square root of mean of the squared differences between measured x and predicted y ece 6 rmse 1 n j 1 n x y 2 as with the me values closest to zero are the most accurate moreover and according to singh et al 2005 if the rmse is less than half the standard deviation sd of the measured property then this is deemed a satisfactory prediction the agreement between measured and predicted ece was also considered using the lin s concordance correlation coefficient lccc described in lin 1989 this is because the lccc shows how close the prediction conforms to the measured values along a 45 degree line from the origin i e 1 1 line and as follows 7 lccc 2 s xy s x 2 s y 2 x y 2 where x and y are the means for the measured and predicted ece respectively s x 2 and s y 2 are the corresponding variances and 2 s xy is the covariance between the two 8 s xy 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y mcbride 2005 suggests that the prediction agreement can be categorised according to the lin s whereby it is excellent 0 9 good 0 8 0 9 moderate 0 65 0 8 and poor 0 65 a 95 confidence interval ci was also calculated and used to evaluate the uncertainty between the predicted and measured ece the ci demonstrates a range that is expected to contain the true value of the predicted ece curran everett 2009 specifically uncertainty was calculated for ece y ˆ i for each estimate in σ value x i obtained 9 s y ˆ s yx n 1 x 1 x var x 2 where s yx is the standard error i e rmse of the lr and var x is the population variance of x the ci for y ˆ i is then calculated by multiplying syx by tα 2 n 2 α value is for two tails at a significance level of 0 05 as described in khongnawang et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 data analysis groundwater properties fig 2e shows the spatial distribution of dgw m in the southwest it was shallowest i e 0 5 m and in general was within the root zone i e 1 m along the western margin in the centre and along the southwestern third the remaining areas in the centre and to the north were beyond the rootzone i e 1 2 m and relatively less influenced by capillary rise of saline groundwater this was also the case in the northeast corner where dgw was deepest i e 2 m fig 2f shows the spatial distribution of ecgw ds m unlike the elevation and dgw which generally had trends from the southwest to northeast corner ecgw was more variable taking into account the fao water quality guidelines rhoades et al 1992 the ecgw was highly saline i e 10 ds m in the southwest corner northwest margin centre southeast and northeast corners in the remaining areas it was moderately saline 2 10 ds m these results can be explained by the complex nature of the salt and water balance input output in the oasis due to the climatic conditions spatial variation of irrigation scheduling rate and frequency water quality from deep aquifer and or private well drainage network efficiency and the underground flow between inside and outside of the oasis bahri et al 2004 marlet et al 2009 bouksila 2011 3 2 data analysis ece table 2a shows the basic calibration summary statistics of ece at the various depth increments table 2b shows this for the ece at the calibration locations i e n 35 in the first layer 0 0 2 m the minimum ece 3 4 ds m was slightly saline 2 4 ds m with the mean 5 28 ds m moderately and maximum 10 57 ds m highly saline the ece had near identical minimum 3 39 ds m and maximum 9 03 ds m ece and equivalent mean 5 11 ds m in the second layer 0 2 0 4 m as for the remaining layers the minimum ece was 3 46 and 3 92 ds m slightly saline in the third 0 4 0 6 m and fourth 0 6 0 8 m layers respectively with the last layer 4 06 ds m at the lower end of moderately saline it is worth noting that the minimum ece at all depths were within the salinity range at which selection of moderately tolerant 3 6 ds m crops is necessary with the ece 4 ds m threshold at which date palm phoenix dactylifera are influenced by salinity is exceeded in the last layer it is also worth noting that the maximum ece increased with increasing depth with the ece values equal to 10 77 14 99 and 14 18 ds m in the 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 m layers respectively all highly 8 16 ds m saline barrett lennard et al 2008 the implications of this subsoil salt load are that via capillary rise and mobilisation into the rootzone will require soil and water management as well as the selection of salinity tolerant 6 10 ds m crops table 2c shows the summary statistics for the ece at the validation locations i e n 16 in the first layer the minimum ece 3 68 ds m was slightly saline 2 4 ds m with the mean 7 49 ds m moderately 4 8 ds m and maximum 36 7 ds m extremely 32 ds m saline while the statistics for this layer in the calibration samples were in equivalent salinity classes this was not the case for the maximum value this was similarly the case for the validation ece data in the second layer which had near identical minimum ece 3 62 ds m with the calibration data but the mean 7 8 ds m was larger as too was the maximum 34 7 ds m the validation ece data for remaining depths show also relatively larger maximum and mean values compared to the calibration dataset but the difference is smaller than those found in the first and second layers to better understand these basic statistics fig 3a shows measured ece at the validation locations in terms of salinity profiles locations 3 17 and 22 represent uniformly slightly saline profiles located in areas where dgw was approximately 1 m and ecgw was moderately saline whereas locations 26 and 53 represent uniformly moderately saline profiles in areas where dgw was approximately 1 m and the ecgw was at the lower end of highly saline location 19 represents a moderately saline profile in areas where the dgw was approximately 1 5 m and the ecgw was moderately saline leached salinity profiles were evident at locations 5 187 and 225 which increase in ece with depth from moderately to highly saline they were in areas where dgw was 1 1 m and ecgw was at larger end of moderately saline or smaller end of highly saline similarly profile 48 was also a leached profile but here dgw was 1 m with ecgw at the larger end of highly saline the only inverted salinity profile in the validation data set was at location 27 whereby salinity increased from the subsoil 16 ds m to the topsoil 32 ds m this is the only soil profile with extreme salinity and the reason for the disparity between the maximum values of the calibration and validation data in the first three layers as such this may make it difficult to predict ece at this location as it would appear to be beyond the range of the calibration data another possible explanation for the differences between the statistics of two datasets lies in the selection procedure since the soil samples were divided into calibration and validation sets based on the eca data not the ece values depending on the correlation between eca and ece they may not yield equivalent sampling in terms of ece additionally the vertical changes in ece values of each sampling location are not taken into account in the selection process which could further affect the statistics of two datasets this step however is unavoidable as part of the selection process since sampling locations should be determined based on the observed spatial variation of eca data 3 3 multi height eca data fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the measured eca of both orientations and at various heights for example fig 4a shows the ecah0 was large i e 460 ms m at two locations in the centre ecah0 generally decreased away from these locations and then increased but to intermediate large 340 460 ms m and intermediate 220 340 ms m values in the northwest southwest south and northeast fig 4b shows the ecav0 was equivalent to ecah0 in terms of the spatial distribution however table 3a shows that the maximum ecah0 606 ms m was larger than that for ecav0 515 ms m at one of these locations in centre of the study area this suggests that ece at this site may be inverted i e more salinity in the topsoil than subsoil moreover this was consistent with where there was shallow saline groundwater table close to 1 m and where capillary action would most likely drive salt into the rootzone fig 2e in addition the large ecav0 was most likely a function of the highly saline nature of the ecgw i e 23 ds m as shown in fig 2f table 3b shows the basic summary statistics of the eca at the calibration sites and measured at various height increments on the ground the minimum ecah0 25 ms m was smaller than the minimum ecav0 37 ms m with the mean 94 ms m and maximum 337 ms m ecah0 similarly smaller than the ecav0 126 and 344 ms m respectively this suggests that σ increases with depth at calibration sites since ecav has greater investigation depth as shown in table 1 it is worth noting that the sd of ecah0 74 18 was slightly larger than the ecav0 56 55 with the coefficient of variation cv of ecah0 78 91 slightly larger than the ecav0 56 55 both data sets had large values of kurtosis with the ecah0 6 64 larger than ecav0 4 53 with both being leptokurtic value is greater than 1 0 as the instrument was raised in increments of 0 2 m eca statistics in both orientations decreased in magnitude given the reduced depth response for example when the instrument was raised to a height of 0 4 m the ecah0 4 minimum 11 ms m mean 49 ms m and maximum 157 ms m were approximately half that of the ecah0 the sd and kurtosis also generally decreased however the cv generally increased in comparison between ecah and ecav the ecah data show a larger cv regardless of sensor height suggesting greater variability of σ in shallower soil layers because ecah measurements have a smaller investigation depth and greater sensitivity to the shallower soil layers greater variability of σ is expected in shallower soil layers mostly in the first layer due to large spatial variability of soil moisture in this layer which influence σ significantly table 3c also shows the basic summary statistics of the eca at the validation sites and measured at various height overall the summary statistics were equivalent to that shown and indicated at the calibration locations and for each orientation and height which reveals that the latter was a reflection of the former this was also the case for the calibration data of diminishing number of calibration sample locations i e n 30 25 5 however these summary statistics are not shown 3 4 correlation between measurements of eca and ece to understand whether eca in either orientation or various heights would be satisfactory on their own and to establish a lr with ece table 4 shows the r2 between eca and the various measured ece depth increments at all 51 soil sample locations with respect to ecah0 the best r2 was with the third layer 0 59 and fourth layers 0 55 ece which would be both considered to be moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 whereas in the first layer 0 48 second layer 0 41 and last layer 0 49 they were weak 0 3 r2 0 5 similar r2 were achieved between ecav0 with the best r2 being for the last layer 0 60 fourth layer 0 55 and third layer 0 54 ece all considered moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 whereas in the first layer 0 32 and second layer 0 40 they remained weak 0 3 r2 0 5 with increasing height r2 remained weak at first and second layers with no improvement in any other layer while a lr between ecah0 and ecav0 and ece of last three layers was moderate the remaining lr with either of these two eca measurements taken on the soil surface or other heights and any other measured ece in the first two layers was weak as such these lr models were not satisfactory to predict ece in these layers given this zone was of high importance for soil use and water management due to the root density of forage crops and its production impact on farmer s income this makes these calibrations unsatisfactory in addition this approach requires development of an individual lr for each depth increment meaning that each calibration can only be used for specific depth prediction of ece this also means there would be larger model errors particularly in the first two layers which was found to be problematic even in areas where there was a strong r2 between eca and ece huang et al 2015 3 5 correlation between estimates of σ and ece table 5 shows r2 between measured ece at various depths including 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 0 m at all locations i e n 51 and estimates of σ at same depths from inversion of ecah and ecav and various heights the largest r2 0 61 was obtained with the inversion model which included the use of ecah0 ecah0 2 ecav0 and ecav0 2 and applying cf forward model s1 inversion algorithm and a λ value of 0 20 and the maximum number of 10 iterations this r2 while equivalent to r2 between ecav0 and last layer ece 0 60 as well as between ecah0 and third layer ece 0 59 was better than any of the other depth specific lr moreover lr between σ and ece can be used to predict ece at any depth with higher accuracy and agreement due to a larger r2 and more confidence due to the larger number of soil samples used for calibration inclusion of ecah0 4 and ecav0 4 to inversion modelling did not improve r2 0 52 nor addition of ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 to inversion modelling 0 42 moreover using only ecah0 or ecav0 did not improve r2 0 53 with all these models being at lower end of moderate given these results inversion of em38 eca values measured using ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 and ecav0 2 were considered optimal and these data were used for further analysis and interpretation this inversion modelling result m3 was considered for predicting soil ece maps in the study area in fig 5 the measured eca against model responses calculated eca for the ecah0 ecah0 2 ecav0 and ecav0 2 which was included in the inversion of m3 model was plotted there is a very good agreement between the model responses and the measured eca which indicates reliable estimation of σ distribution from the measured eca data 3 6 model calibration and validation fig 6a shows the plot of σ versus measured ece considering n 35 calibration soil sample locations the r2 was moderate 0 56 the calibration equation was then used to evaluate the prediction ability in the validation soil sample locations fig 6b shows the plot of measured versus predicted ece in the validation soil sample locations fig 6b shows a good 1 1 concordance when measured and predicted ece was either moderately 4 8 ds m or highly saline 8 16 ds m this was not the case for severely saline 16 32 ds m ece however at validation location site 27 as indicated previously two samples i e first and second layers fell outside the range of the calibration data and were outliers and they were under predicted as such they were excluded from further consideration and analysis of prediction agreement and accuracy the three other samples at this location and from the last three layers were included however the bias me between measured and predicted ece at the validation points is very small 0 34 ds m and the slightly negative me indicates bias was toward under prediction the rmse of 2 94 ds m between measured and predicted ece at the validation points suggest a relatively good accuracy of prediction in terms of agreement between measured and predicted ece at the validation points the lccc of 0 80 suggest a good agreement 3 7 depth slices of predicted soil ece fig 7 shows spatial variation of predicted ece at different depths fig 7a shows predicted ece in the first layer was mostly moderately saline with only a slightly saline area mapped in one location this was consistent with the calibration 5 28 ds m and validation 5 4 ds m data where the mean ece 5 28 ds m were both moderately saline however there were a few small pockets in the centre northwest and northeast corners as well as a contiguous area in the southeast corner where ece was highly saline figs 7b and 7c showed that the predicted ece were equivalent in the second and third layers this indicates that across most of the oasis the soil was characterised by profiles that were uniformly either moderately or highly saline within rootzone the reason for this is driven by the hot climate köppen classification namely the meagre rainfall i e 100 mm per year and large potential evapotranspiration i e 2500 mm per year as a result poor quality irrigation water i e 3 7 ds m available from a deep aquifer is used this causes salinity to build up uniformly in the soil owing to lack of leaching by rainfall of the applied saline water while the salinity is only moderate 4 8 ds m in most places soil water and crop management would be required to enable the sustainable production of the most productive cash crop of date palms i e phoenix dactylifera this is because the ece of dates at initial yield decline is 4 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 figs 7d and 7e showed that the predicted ece in the last two layers were equivalent for the most part and with respect to areas of moderate salinity where salinity was uniform throughout profile and exemplified at location 3 fig 3a in other areas where ece was highly saline in the centre and western margin of the fatnassa oasis the extent of salinization was larger in the centre the reason was most likely due to ecgw fig 2f being intermediate large 15 19 ds m to large 19 ds m and proximity of groundwater to the rootzone i e 1 1 1 2 m the root zone is thus susceptible to capillary rise and inevitably a redistribution of salts from the subsoil into the topsoil the issue of rising water tables seems to be problematic and was exemplified in the extremely saline and inverted profile 27 fig 3a in the northern part of the study area where the elevation was low 18 5 m dgw relatively shallow 1 1 m and ecgw was highly saline 23 ds m this was similarly the case at location 11 where ece in the fourth layer was moderately saline but owing to capillary rise salts were mobilised into the topsoil making ece highly saline here the elevation while higher 21 5 m and ecgw smaller 11 ds m it was still highly saline and susceptible to capillary rise with dgw also shallow and less than 1 m from the soil surface the irrigation event frequency and dose and the drainage efficiency have a large impact of groundwater properties ecgw and dwt and the shape of soil salinity profile often after irrigation the inverted soil salinity profile is leached at topsoil and it shapes evolves according to irrigation scheduling and groundwater properties ecgw and dgw this was similarly the case in the southwest corner near exemplified by location 225 which was closest to chott el jerid drainage outlet where the elevation was low 17 5 m and dgw also shallow and less than 0 6 m from the soil surface fig 2e as a result the very low natural and open drainage collector slope was the main cause of the poor efficiency of the drainage network and therefore the creation of a shallow and saline groundwater this is due to the almost no irrigation such as the abandoned fields at plot 11 and or poor efficiency of the drainage network due to a mineral and root clogging of the drainage pipe and the low open drainage collector slope these isolated areas were observed since 2001 and well described by bahri et al 2004 and bouksila et al 2012 3 8 depth slices of ci for predicted ece fig 8a shows the spatial distribution of ci for predicted ece in the first layer the ci was small 1 and intermediate small 1 1 2 in most areas and associated with predicted ece which was moderate this suggests reasonable confidence in predictions of soil salinity in the first layer and in this range 4 8 ds m for example in fig 3a which shows measured and fig 3b which shows predicted ece there was equivalence in salinity of uniform moderately saline ece for profiles 16 and 26 accordingly it can be said that most of the fatnassa oasis has been impacted by soil salinization and as a function of irrigation using poor water quality under low efficiency of drainage network and surface irrigation system as a result and owing to the hot climate meagre rainfall salts added have not been leached and therefore led to accumulation of salts into the rootzone conversely the ci was intermediate 1 2 1 4 intermediate large 1 4 1 6 and large 1 6 in areas where the predicted ece was highly saline this suggests a little more uncertainty in the predictions when ece was larger however the uncertainty was again not large equivalent ci was evident in the deeper layers i e figs 8c and 8d moreover the ci was equivalent to those reported by khongnawang et al 2022 who predicted ece at various depths at 0 3 m increments and to a depth of 1 5 m across a small area of 9 fields covering 5 ha in the muang pea irrigation area and adjacent to the kham rean canal in northeast thailand in their study predicted ece was smaller and included non saline slightly and moderately saline ece with less variation in ci i e 0 45 to 0 9 nevertheless the cause of the larger ci can be attributed to the rapid change in ece from moderately saline to highly saline over short spatial scales average farm size about 0 25 ha to explain this fig 4 shows the measured eca using the em38 in various orientations and heights above the ground this was particularly the case about the eca collected on the ground e g ecah0 and ecav0 and near the soil surface in the horizontal mode of operation e g ecah0 2 and ecav0 2 the short scale variation in eca can be seen particularly in the east west direction because eca was only collected along transects spaced 100 m apart compared with 50 m on the north south transects since em4soil is based on a 1 dimensional spatial constrained technique the estimates of σ are smoothed considering adjacent eca monteiro santos et al 2010 if the eca changes rapidly this tends to cause smoothing of the data and subsequently herein mostly under estimation of σ and subsequently under predicted ece as seen in figs 3a and 3b the reason of the short scale variation and the isolated instances of highly saline areas is most likely attributable to water and soil management effects particularly irrigation practices at the farmers field level at the time of the survey additional information including soil type irrigation system i e traditional or improved surface system and scheduling dose frequency or land use were not recorded knowledge about the soil water and crop management is necessary to understand the causes of these so called hotspots or the point source of the highly saline ece this in turn would enable suitable management strategies to be employed including but not limited to soil management to raise the seed bed or design it in such a way to enable salts to be drawn away from the seed changes in irrigation water application e g from flood to localised such bubbler or drip irrigation increase the drainage network efficiency and or use of a more salt tolerant plant or varieties of a plant in the tunisian oases affected by soil salinization farmers practice sandy amendments about 0 2 0 3 m thickness to develop a non saline soil at seed bed bouksila et al 2012 karbout et al 2020 to reduce the ci for ece prediction in shallower layers additional eca could be collected on a 50 m grid this would provide at least 1 data point per field one every 0 25 ha and remove some of uncertainty in prediction as a function of short scale variation caused by different management practices moreover additional eca measurements in area with greater spatial variability of σ could also reduce the ci to improve prediction of ece in deeper layers an emi sensor with deeper investigation depth such as the em31 instrument could be used this is because it has an inter coil spacing of 3 66 m between a transmitter and receiver coil and owing to the low frequency 10 khz and when held 1 m above the soil surface it enables a depth weighted measurement of eca between 0 and 3 and 0 6 m in the horizontal ecah and vertical ecav orientations respectively as a result there would be additional eca data to assist in predicting ece in deeper layers and in addition resolve the location of the often saline groundwater this approach requires joint inversion of the em38 and em31 eca and was shown to be useful by triantafilis and monteiro santos 2011 in predicting topsoil and subsoil ece along a single transect and considering em38 eca data collected in both modes of operation and at a single height i e 0 6 m and equivalent em31 eca i e 1 m this was similarly shown by zhao et al 2018 to improve prediction of topsoil and subsoil cation exchange capacity across a small field using em38 eca data collected in both modes of operation and at a single height i e 0 2 m and equivalent em31 eca i e 1 m alternatively a single frequency multiple coil em instrument such as dualem 421 could be used this is because several authors zare et al 2015 stockmann et al 2017 have found that using this type of instrument improve efficiency of eca data collection given a dualem 1 provides eca equivalent to em38 ecah and ecav while the dualem 4 component gives eca similar to an em31 moreover dualem 2 arrays provide additional data which provides eca at depths in between an em38 and em31 it is also possible to argue that the operator body may influence the emi measurements when the operator performs the measurements at different heights and approach the sensor to read eca values during the current study it was ensured that all sites used a consistent measurement procedure to minimise the possibility of this effect on overall results in addition this effect may be more significant in areas with lower electrical conductivity which is not the case in our site with high salinity of soil future studies can study such effects in study areas having low electrical conductivity 4 conclusions in this study and to add value to limited saturated soil paste extract ece data we collected proximally sensed apparent soil electrical conductivity eca ms m data using an em instrument em38 with a single pair of coils at two horizontal and vertical dipole orientations and four heights i e 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m across a large area of fatnassa saharan climate oasis southern tunisia resulting in a total set of eight eca i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 ecah0 4 ecav0 4 ecah0 6 and ecav0 6 from this data the spatial distribution of soil electrical conductivity σ was estimated by q 3d inversion of eca data and evaluated the potential for prediction of the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract ece good ece prediction from multi height em38 eca data were achieved by q 3d inversion of eca data collected at 0 and 0 2 m heights r2 0 61 based on these results it recommended to have ecah and ecav measurements on the surface and at the height of 0 2 m i e ecah0 ecav0 ecah0 2 ecav0 2 and to use the s1 algorithm along with small λ values as this most likely presents the best combination under the investigated field condition the calibration validation procedure based on assigning 35 of the sampling sites to the calibration set and the remaining 16 boreholes to the validations sets show good accuracy rmse 2 94 ds m small bias me 0 56 ds m and good concordance lin s 0 80 given the large variability of measured groundwater depth 0 4 to over 3 m and its electrical conductivity 6 24 ds m ece 3 37 ds m and different management practices for the calibration and validation procedure fewer boreholes may suffice therefore an effort could be made to explore the optimal number of soil samples needed as proposed for example by li et al 2019 one of the challenging issues in many research institutes and enterprises especially in the developing countries is the lack of access to more recent developed and expensive multi coil or multi frequency emi instruments which enables measuring eca at different depths simultaneously at a single pass the alternative solution proposed in this study is to measure eca data using a single coil instrument but at different heights allowing us to collect sufficient data required for inversion modelling and improved quantitative investigation of soil properties this study shows that using multiple measurements with a single coil instrument allows establishing a single calibration equation that can be used to predict ece i e soil salinity indicator at any desirable depth with more confidence due to the larger number of soil samples used for the calibration and validation in the absence of sufficient eca data and inversion process depth specific linear regression lr can be only established and therefore ece data from the specific depth can be only used in the calibration and validation procedure this may add additional limitation to the methodology when the number of boreholes is limited moreover the resulting r2 in our case study is significantly better than each depth specific calibration and more specifically in the first layer where the depth specific calibration does not provide satisfactory results the overall approach used in this study allowed to develop a landscape scale 3d map of baseline soil salinity status across an area of about 150 ha the predicted ece reveals that the soil of the oasis is moderately saline 4 8 ds m in general and in all investigated depths which may comprise the agricultural productivity in addition there is an increasing trend in soil salinity in the south west of study area where the groundwater is shallow and several isolated areas that is consistent with the trend in groundwater salinity the soil is highly saline 8 16 ds m in these zones due to shallow and saline groundwater and low drainage efficiency requiring soil and water management improvement to maintain the soil salinity below the plant salinity tolerance and to reduce the soil degradation measures to improve the soil quality regarding salinity can be to improve the efficiency of the drainage system and the irrigation scheduling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
