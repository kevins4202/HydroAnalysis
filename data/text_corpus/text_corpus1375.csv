6875,this study develops a novel approach to data driven hydrological modeling the approach adopts the feature representation technique in computer vision to effectively exploit spatial information contained in time variant input data fields and seamlessly fuse multisource information via machine learning the new approach overcomes a major limitation of existing approaches in which the spatial heterogeneity of input variables cannot be sufficiently accounted for the approach is applied to predict the streamflow in a watershed on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau and its performance is compared with various data driven and process based models the major findings are as follows first the new approach represents a general framework for the fusion of multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and demonstrates great potential to incorporate fast growing environmental big data second the new approach demonstrates satisfactory short term forecasting long term simulation and transfer learning performances and is promising for addressing predictions in ungauged basins third the predictors including precipitation temperature leaf area index and historical streamflow play markedly distinct roles in modeling streamflow with the novel approach finally topographic information is not a necessary model input in the proposed approach because spatial patterns can be well embodied by other inputs e g temperature that have high similarities with topography this study represents the first attempt to bring computer vision into data driven hydrological modeling and may inspire future studies in this promising direction keywords computer vision data fusion hydrological modeling machine learning heihe river basin environmental big data 1 introduction hydrological modeling can be performed using process based or data driven models beven 2012 data driven models provide direct mappings between driving forces e g rainfall and hydrological responses e g runoff without process descriptions in the past century after freeze and harlan s blueprint freeze and harlan 1969 considerable advances have been made in process based hydrological modeling in the 1990s data driven models began to receive increased attention from the hydrologic community largely due to the remarkable progress in machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks anns beven 2012 hsu et al 1995 since then in addition to classic runoff forecasting heřmanovský et al 2017 data driven models have been applied to address a variety of hydrological issues such as soil moisture estimation ahmad et al 2010 evapotranspiration prediction abdullah et al 2015 river stage forecasting chau 2007 and groundwater level simulation gholami et al 2015 however the hydrologic community by and large still views data driven models as a valuable supplement to process based models in hydrological modeling in recent years the rapid development of artificial intelligence ai and big data has triggered revolutionary changes in many research fields such as life science economics and sociology lecun et al 2015 in the broad area of earth science new satellite and airborne remote sensing systems as well as ground based sensor network systems are producing environmental big data with high spatial and temporal resolutions nativi et al 2015 for instance as reported by the european space agency http www esa int its present twin sentinel 2 satellites can acquire up to two petabytes 1 pb 106 gb of data annually using their powerful sensors with such high throughput real time environmental big data the opportunity to use ai for data driven hydrological forecasting is emerging however the exponentially increasing volume of environmental data poses a considerable challenge to forecasting babovic 2005 although some hydrologists anticipate that ai will improve our capacity in hydrological prediction to an unprecedented level yaseen et al 2015 as is occurring in many other fields a new paradigm for hydrological modeling in the era of big data has yet to be established one challenge is to fuse multisource data in data driven hydrological modeling machine learning has been introduced into hydrological research for many years nourani et al 2014 however previous data driven models have mainly considered ground based measurements that are relatively sparse in time and space or watershed wide averages of gridded meteorological data while big picture spatial coverage data obtained by earth observing satellites e g satellite derived soil moisture and a satellite based cloud liquid water path have rarely been used famiglietti et al 2015 the difficulty for data driven models lies in the inconsistency of diverse sources of data concerning temporal and spatial resolutions and encoding formats recent runoff forecasting studies attempted to incorporate cross source data such as climate phenomenon indices rice and emanuel 2017 and time series of snow cover data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite product uysal et al 2016 however these data only represent a small portion of the data being collected by a wide range of environmental sensors furthermore non time series data such as digital elevation model dem and soil type maps while fundamental for process based hydrological modeling are difficult to fuse into data driven models because of their time invariance an effective approach to data fusion has yet to be developed to improve data driven hydrological modeling the second challenge is to address the spatial heterogeneity of predictors in data driven models previous studies often ignored the spatial features of model input data and simply averaged the data over the entire modeling domain in what resembles a lumped approach to process based modeling however the spatial patterns of driving forces may have significant impacts on hydrological responses for example if a storm center is close to a watershed outlet a short time to peak and a flashy hydrograph are expected at the outlet thus discarding the relevant spatial information contained in the original data may result in considerable inaccuracy and uncertainty in data driven forecasting chen and adams 2006 efforts have been made to address this problem in rainfall runoff modeling for example zhang and govindaraju 2003 developed a geomorphology based ann model by taking into account the similarity between the geometric nature of a channel network and the architecture of a neural network in another study bhattacharjya and chaurasia 2012 the contributions of rainfall in different subbasins were determined based on geomorphologic parameters which were used to calculate the weighted average of the rainfall for the entire watershed the watershed wide average rainfall was then used as an input in the ann model tsai et al 2014 developed an innovative semi distributed data driven model for reservoir inflow forecasting the radar derived rainfall data were clustered into several subbasins the semi distributed input at different subbasins was associated with different time lags determined via correlation analyses between the gauged rainfall and reservoir inflow to better address the nonlinearity of the hydrological response chang and tsai 2016 used a self organizing map som instead of categorizing subbasins and employed a gamma test gt to determine the travel time however the aforementioned approaches either lumped or semi distributed with regard to model inputs do not fully exploit spatial information a straightforward strategy for model improvement is the development of a fully distributed data driven model that can make use of data information at every spatial unit unfortunately this strategy would lead to extremely complicated machine learning model structures jean et al 2016 and would therefore result in the curse of dimensionality the third challenge is to choose the appropriate data from the massive datasets and identify the most relevant input variables i e predictors environmental monitoring systems worldwide are providing an increasingly large amount of data with progressively finer temporal and spatial resolutions hart and martinez 2006 it would be ill advised to attempt to utilize all the available data not only because the data dimensions would increase from dozens to tens or even hundreds of thousands but also because the learning process would have to address redundant data and or irrelevant information galelli and castelletti 2013 the identification of influential input variables would be beneficial to the reasonability of black box models several studies have analyzed the contributions of typical predictors including the historical streamflow precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and net solar radiation to streamflow prediction in data driven models chang and tsai 2016 wu and chau 2011 however as most of these models did not capitalize on the spatial information of predictors streamflow was often the overwhelmingly predominant predictor galelli and castelletti 2013 whereas other predictors with spatial heterogeneity were seriously undervalued thus the development of innovative data driven models in which the roles of different predictors can be correctly identified is highly desired to address these challenges an innovative solution to the representation of spatial information in data driven models is important as an essential element of ai and big data analysis computer vision is undergoing rapid development the goal of computer vision is to enable the machine to understand the world often called visual perception through the processing of digital signals wang et al 2013 computer vision techniques have been applied in various fields of earth science such as remote sensing change detection schneider 2012 biophysical variable estimation e g ocean chlorophyll concentration camps valls et al 2006 and other analyses of imagery derived from airborne and satellite sensors mountrakis et al 2011 however to the best of our knowledge computer vision has not been introduced into hydrological modeling yet hence the core idea of this study is to use an advanced feature representation technique in the field of computer vision to extract features from gridded images and then map these features to hydrological responses via machine learning note that machine learning is also a frequently used technique in computer vision however in this study machine learning is used to build black box hydrological models not to process images i e data fields features extracted using computer vision usually have no explicit physical meanings and can only be understood and interpreted by the machine itself representing a unique characteristic of computer vision based models compared to classic data driven models most feature extraction approaches tend to represent an image as a collection of either global features describing an image as a whole e g texture and intensity or local features describing specific objects in an image nixon and aguado 2012 one drawback of global feature extraction is that information about the spatial layout of features is disregarded lazebnik et al 2006 developed an improved image representation named spatial pyramid mapping spm to solve this problem this method can record spatial information in the extracted feature vector the spm model and its variants have demonstrated convincing performance in computer vision applications harada et al 2011 in the present study a mountainous watershed on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau was selected as the study area a variant of the spm model is employed to extract features from multiple time variant data fields including precipitation surface temperature and remote sensing based leaf area index lai the extracted feature vectors and streamflow observations are used to build flow models by machine learning the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to build a novel framework fusing multisource spatiotemporal information for data driven hydrological modeling 2 to investigate the power of computer vision in processing massive environmental data for hydrological modeling and 3 to demonstrate how data driven modeling can deepen the understanding of hydrological processes the main contribution of this study lies in its adoption of computer vision to overcome a major limitation of existing data driven hydrological models that is insufficient consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of input variables overall this study highlights a promising direction towards a new paradigm of hydrological modeling in the era of big data 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and multisource data the study area fig 1 the yingluoxia watershed lies on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau the watershed is the upstream part of the heihe river basin hrb which is the second largest endorheic river basin in china the watershed has an area of approximately 10 010 km2 and an elevation that ranges from 1689 m in the northeast to 5054 m in the west the average annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm and mainly falls from june to september and the average annual temperature is approximately 2 c perennial snow exists above 3400 m while the seasonal snow cover ranges from 2700 m to 3400 m wang et al 2010 grassland and brushland are the dominant land cover types and constitute approximately 50 and 12 of the total area respectively li et al 2010 the topography meteorology and vegetation cover in this watershed have significant spatial heterogeneity a variety of process based models have been developed to simulate the hydrological processes in the yingluoxia watershed in previous studies gao et al 2018 li et al 2011b this watershed offers an ideal testbed for benchmarking the model proposed in this study with existing models table 1 lists the multisource data used in this modeling study all the data were acquired from the cold and arid regions science data center http card westgis ac cn the time variant data fields of precipitation and temperature pan et al 2012 were derived from the weather research and forecasting wrf model and validated by the daily observed data of china meteorological administration cma stations http data cma cn en the lai data liao et al 2013 were retrieved from a canopy bidirectional reflectance function brdf model these meteorological and ecological data were preprocessed using different strategies and then used as dynamic inputs for different data driven models details of the preprocessing strategies will be explained in the following sections to ensure that the same time interval would be maintained in the models the lai raster data were linearly interpolated into a daily resolution the linear interpolation is appropriate because lai does not generally abruptly change at a weekly timescale note that other variables such as surface pressure relative humidity wind speed and downward radiations were also considered as potential predictors in preliminary tests as these variables exerted no significant influence on the model performances they were not included in the final models streamflow observations at the outlet yingluoxia in fig 1 are the target to be matched by the models and streamflow observations at the two upstream gaging stations zhamashike and qilian in fig 1 are also discussed our new model see section 2 3 does not require land cover and stream network data but the two models used for comparative purposes see section 2 4 do require these data 2 2 new framework of data fusion a new approach to data driven hydrological modeling is proposed in this study which couples computer vision with machine learning the model built according to this approach is hereafter known as the computer vision model cv the cv is further compared with two existing types of data driven models one is the lumped model lm which uses watershed wide averages of input data fields e g gridded remote sensing and meteorological data as the predictors the other is the semi distributed model sd proposed by tsai et al 2014 in which the predictors are the averages of input data fields calculated for all delineated subbasins instead of the averages calculated for the entire watershed in the lm more technical details about the cv lm and sd are provided in sections 2 3 and 2 4 fig 2 illustrates the general frameworks of the cv lm and sd in parallel in the cv the temporally varied and spatially distributed data fields are treated as 8 bit images and represented by feature vectors via computer vision the extracted feature vectors together with historical hydrological records i e streamflow observations at specific gaging stations are then used to train the machine learning model the model can subsequently be used to infer future streamflow more details of the cv are provided in section 2 3 the major differences between the cv and the other two models as illustrated in fig 2 are the following first both the cv and lm have a straightforward procedure of model building and need no auxiliary data while the sd requires a series of complicated operations on additional data fields such as topographic data stream network and land cover map fields second the lm does not utilize the spatial information contained in input data fields and the sd only utilizes spatial information to a limited extent in contrast the cv can deeply explore spatial information with a cell by cell strategy to extract feature vectors and is essentially analogous to a quasi fully distributed model thus with regard to the utilization of the spatial information the three models adequately cover the full spectrum of data driven hydrological models compared to process based modeling the cv has many advantages with regard to fusing spatiotemporal data first the cv can utilize almost any type of spatiotemporal data as its inputs while classic process based hydrological models have rigorous definitions of model inputs and outputs for example soil moisture snow cover and lai spatiotemporal data cannot be utilized as inputs by a process based model but can readily be used as inputs by the cv because data driven modeling is based on correlation rather than causation second process based hydrological models are not able to assimilate hydrological observations e g streamflow data by themselves and data assimilation algorithms such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf clark et al 2008 and particle filter salamon and feyen 2009 are needed while the cv can directly assimilate observations by treating them as input data as illustrated in fig 2 third the cv provides a straightforward and uniform way i e feature extraction via computer vision to process spatiotemporal data while process based models similar to the sd require specific operations on different data fields with the unique features discussed above the cv represents a new framework for fusing multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and demonstrates great potential to incorporate environmental big data in this framework nonstationarity in hydrological modeling when significant can be resolved by assimilating relevant data in model training for example to account for the impact of land use change on the rainfall runoff relationship the cv can incorporate time series of land use land cover images as its input data fields 2 3 computer vision model this study considers precipitation p temperature t and lai data fields as the inputs of the data driven models fig 3 illustrates the procedure of feature extraction in the cv in computer vision features refer to different types of information abstracted from an image using features instead of pixel values computer vision can quantitatively describe an image in far fewer dimensions than can other techniques common features such as contour shape texture and image intensity are often in the form of numerical value vectors in this study all the data fields are first converted into 8 bit images specifically the raster values in each input category i e p t and lai are scaled into integers within the range of 0 255 to generate 8 bit grayscale images and the background value is set to 0 i e black for example in the temperature images used in this study the maximum value 301 9 k and minimum value 241 3 k are mapped to 255 i e white and 0 i e black respectively preliminary tests show that the conversion to 8 bit images is adequate in this case a smaller image depth e g 4 bit scales the pixel values of the data fields into a narrow integer range e g 0 15 leading to the loss of details of the spatial pattern in contrast a larger image depth e g 12 bit produces a very wide integer range e g 0 4096 which enhances the local noise in some raw data fields and consequently affects the effectiveness of feature extraction texture and intensity have been found to be appropriate features to describe converted images for hydrological modeling the texture feature can represent the spatial variability of data fields a number of visual descriptors have been proposed to characterize the texture feature in the field of computer vision local binary pattern lbp which is used in this study is among the most popular descriptors ojala et al 1996 compared with other texture descriptors lbp has the merits of discriminative power overall computational simplicity flexibility and ease of implementation heikkilä et al 2009 the intensity feature directly reflects the pixel values of the original data field in this study the spm strategy lazebnik et al 2006 is used to spatially represent the texture and intensity features of images the grayscale image is divided into a sequence of increasingly finer subregions at different levels forming a pyramid of subimages at the pyramid level ℓ ℓ 0 1 l the 2 dimensional image is evenly divided into 22 ℓ subregions where l denotes the maximum pyramid level the texture feature of a subregion is represented by a histogram signified as a list of normalized lbp counts the intensity feature of a subregion is simply its average grayscale value the feature statistics either for the histogram or average grayscale value of each pyramid of images are then concatenated sequentially into the respective feature vector which is either the texture feature vector or the intensity feature vector see fig 3 the texture and intensity feature vectors are then combined into a final vector used as input for the ann because the visual statistics of these subregions are stored sequentially in the feature vector the relative positional information of each subregion is retained inside the final vector more technical details of the lbp descriptor and the spm strategy are provided in appendix a and appendix b in the supplementary material in this study the number of bins in the texture histograms is set to 15 and the average intensity is a scalar the maximum pyramid levels l for extracting texture and intensity features are set to 2 and 4 respectively for example l 4 means that the original image is transformed into a pyramid with 1 subregion at spatial level 0 4 subregions at spatial level 1 16 subregions at spatial level 2 64 subregions at spatial level 3 and 256 subregions at spatial level 4 this configuration results in texture and intensity feature vector lengths of 315 1 4 16 15 and 341 1 4 16 64 256 1 respectively therefore the dimension of the final input vector of each input data field is 656 315 341 preliminary tests confirm that the selected l values ensure a good balance between the accuracy and computing efficiency of the model for more complex applications with a larger sample size more pyramid levels can be considered to improve the modeling accuracy note that the feature extraction in this study only represents a specific paradigm and other features e g gradients or feature descriptors may be more suitable in other cases this study examines different time lag lengths of the predictor variables i e p t lai and historical streamflow preliminary tests indicate that the predictors have no significant influence on the output i e the streamflow at the outlet when the lag time exceeds 3 days therefore the cv in this study uses a 3 day lag time which means the predictor variables for the most recent three days including the current day are the model inputs given this lag time when p t lai and historical streamflow at the watershed outlet are all model inputs the total dimension of the input vector is 5907 656 3 1 3 because the feature statistics from the background region null grayscale value are time invariant they are removed from the input vectors such that the model complexity is reduced thus the total dimension of the actual input vector is less than 5907 3818 in this study 2 4 existing models for comparison this study also examines two existing types of data driven models the lm and sd their modeling frameworks are illustrated and compared with the cv framework in fig 2 for the lm preliminary tests showed that a 3 day lag time for the predictor variables is appropriate which is consistent with the cv given this lag time when the model inputs include p t lai and historical streamflow at the watershed outlet the total dimension of the input vector for the lm is 12 3 1 3 the sd is built for the study area following tsai et al 2014 the entire watershed is first delineated into 39 subbasins fig 4 based on dem the number of subbasins in the process based models built for the same watershed lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 is within the range of 20 45 in general preliminary tests show that the performance of the sd is not sensitive to the number of subbasins within this range the theoretical travel time is then calculated grid by grid using the mndnr hydro tools developed by the minnesota department of natural resources https gisdata mn gov dataset dnr arcgis toolbox the calculation is based on manning s equation for open channel flow the travel time is primarily influenced by topography surface roughness and channel width zuazo et al 2014 the roughness coefficient and hydraulic radius values follow the recommendations of the toolbox although the calculation of travel time is relatively simple it adequately supports the determination of the lag time of subbasins once the grid based travel time is calculated the lag time of the subbasins is determined as the average travel time over the subbasin subbasins with an average travel time within 1 day 2 days and 3 days are assigned 1 day 2 day and 3 day lag times respectively according to fig 4 the numbers of subbasins with a 1 day 2 day and 3 day lag time are 16 19 and 4 respectively this result also supports the choice of a 3 day lag time in the cv and lm in the sd for each of the spatially distributed model inputs i e p t and lai the average values of the 39 subbasins with different lag times see fig 4 are considered and comprise a 39 element vector thus when the 3 day lagging historical streamflow at the watershed outlet is included as a model input the total dimension of the input vector for the sd is 120 39 3 1 3 2 5 machine learning algorithm the data fusion framework of the cv see fig 2 is general and suits any machine learning algorithm such as anns kashani et al 2016 support vector machines svms naganna and deka 2014 extreme learning machines yaseen et al 2016 and regression trees galelli and castelletti 2013 in this study the classical ann is selected because it has been widely used in hydrological modeling and preliminary tests have shown that it outperforms svm another popular algorithm for this study case other machine learning algorithms may be equally or more suitable for this study case but identifying such algorithms is not an objective of this study the ann has a computing system capable of recognizing patterns by learning in the same way as biological neural networks do in human brains rather than by using rule based programming in anns a collection of connected artificial neurons is organized in layers and each connection transmits information from one neuron to another signals entering the input layer arrive at the output layer by passing through one or more hidden layers anns can well represent the nonlinearity of hydrological processes hsu et al 1995 taormina et al 2015 the neural network used in this study is a fully connected four layer perceptron whose structure is illustrated in fig 5 the extracted feature vectors of p t lai and the historical streamflow observations are fed into the input layer and processed in the hidden layers the output layer provides the streamflow prediction for faster convergence all the inputs and outputs are scaled to 0 1 before the training note that the four rounded rectangles in the input layers fig 5 represent four categories of inputs not merely four neurons the actual number of neurons in the input layer depends on the dimensions of the feature vectors and varies among different experiments the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer must be tuned to achieve good model performance in this study preliminary trials showed that two hidden layers are sufficient to ensure satisfactory results for the cv lm and sd different numbers of neurons ranging from 4 to 64 in the hidden layers were also tested to maintain a good balance between the model accuracy and efficiency in the training period 8 16 neurons are included in each hidden layer of the cv whereas 16 32 neurons are included in each hidden layer of the lm and sd which had comparatively few input layer neurons the actual neuron number varies in the numerical experiments conducted in this study because the experiments consider different combinations of input variables as the daily flow observations used in this study span from 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2011 a maximum of 4380 input output data pairs can be prepared for training and testing the three ann based models this period covers dry years e g 2004 and wet years e g 2008 and the meteorological conditions in recent years i e after 2011 are within the historical ranges unless otherwise stated the dataset is divided into two subsets 75 for model training 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2008 and the remaining 25 for model testing 1 4 2009 to 12 31 2011 in the training stage 2847 data pairs i e 65 of the total are randomly picked from the subset and used to seek the optimal trainable parameters i e weight and bias values in the networks the other 438 data pairs i e 10 of the total are used for validation with the early stop strategy prechelt 1998 adopted to avoid overfitting the models are trained using back propagation rumelhart et al 1986 with adam kingma and ba 2014 as the optimizer in the adam optimizer the learning rate and the learning rate decay over each update are respectively configured to 0 0005 and 0 001 based on preliminary tests note that the cv involves more ann trainable parameters than do the lm and sd because it has more neurons in the input layer however the cv is still computationally affordable and inexpensive the maximum elapsed time of the cv is less than 15 min on an average personal computer core i7 6700 cpu 3 40 ghz and 16 gb ram in all the numerical experiments introduced in the next section in comparison many physically based hydrological models take hours to complete a ten year simulation it is worth re emphasizing that the machine learning techniques in the three data driven models are the same i e classical anns and they are not the focus of the model comparison 2 6 numerical experiments several numerical experiments were conducted to examine the applicability of the cv and table 2 summarizes eight groups of experiments with the most important findings exp 1 and exp 2 investigated short term streamflow forecasting with a prediction lead time of up to five days while exp 3 to exp 5 examined the explanatory abilities of different input variables the historical streamflow with a 3 day lag time is included as a predictor in exp 1 exp 2 and exp 4 but is excluded from exp 3 and exp 5 the performances of the cv lm and sd are systematically compared in these experiments exp 6 and exp 7 demonstrate the approach to long term continuous streamflow simulation by the cv in exp 6 the 1 day lead time streamflow prediction is performed at time t i e q t 1 by a short term forecasting model with input variables of p t and historical streamflow and the prediction is then used as input in the subsequent time steps 1 2 or 3 steps depending on the lag time this recursive calculation is iterated to achieve an n day ahead here n denotes the simulation length streamflow simulation starting from time t 1 fig 6 illustrates the iterative process of n day ahead streamflow simulation based on a short term forecasting model with 3 day lag time and 1 day lead time exp 7 is similar to exp 6 except that the simulated streamflow is not recursively used as a predictor i e the recursive part shown in fig 6 is excluded the n day ahead streamflow simulation in exp 7 is entirely based on meteorological data fields exp 8 is specifically designed to examine the applicability of the cv for addressing hydrologic predictions in ungauged basins pub this experiment assumes that during the training period 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2009 the streamflow was gauged at the two upstream stations zhamashike and qilian but not at the watershed outlet yingluoxia fig 4 to perform cross watershed transfer learning with the cv the one day lead time models in exp 3 are retrained using the data from the two upstream subwatersheds and then tested at yingluoxia for the period from 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2011 the input vectors are extracted for the two subwatersheds for training and for the entire study watershed for testing according to the approach described in section 2 3 the input vector lengths are the same as those in exp 3 eventually 7300 3650 2 input output data pairs are prepared for training and 4380 input output data pairs are prepared for testing exp 8 represents transfer learning in space by the cv transfer learning is easy to implement because the cv has a straightforward and uniform strategy to process spatiotemporal data for comparison the lm is also employed to perform transfer learning but the sd is not considered because its model structure makes cross watershed transfer learning very difficult to implement for the lm the watershed average data fields alone are not sufficient to predict the streamflow at the watershed outlet because the streamflow is also related to the watershed area in previous studies two strategies are commonly used to address this area related issue one is to determine weighting factors for different watersheds based on their areas and then use the weighted contribution of their meteorological data to develop the ann model bhattacharjya and chaurasia 2012 the other is to include the watershed area as an additional variable in the input vector nourani and komasi 2013 our preliminary tests indicated that the second strategy is more suitable for the study area the length of each input vector is 10 after considering the 3 day lagging p t lai and area for the respective watershed to adequately evaluate the performance of the three ann based models nash sutcliffe efficiency nse logarithmic nse log nse and volumetric efficiency ve are employed as goodness of fit metrics nse is a classic and popular metric defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 but it overemphasizes peaks log nse uses the logarithms of the observed and predicted values to compute nse such that the influence of low values can be enhanced liu and kumar 2016 ve is an alternative index enhancing the measurement of overall performance criss and winston 2008 that addresses certain limitations of nse in the context of streamflow modeling nse and ve are calculated as follows 1 nse 1 q q 2 q q 2 2 ve 1 q q q where q is the simulated streamflow q is the observed streamflow and q is the mean value of the observed streamflow all metrics are bounded from negative infinity to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match between the prediction and the observation 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term forecasting fig 7 plots the short term forecasting with a 1 day lead time i e exp 1 in table 2 by the cv the predicted hydrograph closely matches the flow observations as indicated by the nse and ve values as table 3 shows the sd and lm perform slightly better than does the cv in exp 1 this result is not surprising in this study the autocorrelation of short lag times in the streamflow data is strong and even if the historical streamflow is the only predictor i e exp 4 the nse in the testing stage can be as high as 0 862 this result implies that the historical streamflow has a dominant impact on forecasting with a 1 day lead time in exp 1 the lm and sd have far fewer neurons in the input layer 12 and 120 neurons respectively than does the cv 5907 neurons therefore the explanatory power of the historical streamflow is better embodied in the lm and sd however when longer lead times are considered in exp 2 the cv advantage becomes prominent in fig 8 the solid lines with markers indicate that the performances of the three models decrease as the lead time is increased from 1 day to 5 days but the cv has a much slower decay than does the sd even when the lead time is 5 days the cv nse is still above 0 76 thus the cv relies much less than do the other models on historical streamflow in the short term forecasting which implies its great potential for addressing pub exp 3 is similar to exp 1 and exp 2 except that the historical streamflow is not included in the inputs as table 3 shows the sd and lm experience more substantial decreases than does the cv in the three metrics and are outperformed by the cv when the lead time is 1 day the dashed lines with markers in fig 8 demonstrate the decreasing performances of the three models with different lead times when the historical streamflow is excluded of all the models the cv has the best performance for all lead times in addition the decreasing tendency of nse is more prominent when the historical streamflow is included in the inputs i e for each model the solid line has a steeper slope than the dashed line in fig 8 this finding indicates that the inclusion of historical streamflow is not beneficial for the short term forecasting with a long lead time this result is probably due to the rapid decrease in the contribution of historical streamflow to predicting future streamflow as indicated by the black solid line without markers i e the results of exp 4 in which historical streamflow is the only predictor in fig 8 likewise when p t or lai is taken as an individual input in exp 5 cv is also the best performing model with regard to all the metrics see table 3 the role of each predictor will be further discussed in section 3 4 it is also worth noting from table 3 that the three metrics lead to very similar comparison results overall exp 1 to exp 5 prove the applicability of the cv for short term streamflow forecasting the cv also demonstrates a higher prediction accuracy and robustness than do the lm and sd when the forecasting lead time is longer than 1 day this result is largely due to the feature extraction by computer vision which sufficiently exploits the spatial information contained in the input data fields as noted above the cv is essentially analogous to a quasi fully distributed model 3 2 long term simulation exp 6 conducts an n days ahead long term simulation by the cv using p t and the preceding streamflow simulated as the model inputs in the training stage the timeframe of the model inputs is from 1 1 2000 to 12 30 2008 and the timeframe of the model target i e the future streamflow is from 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2008 the recursive calculation illustrated by fig 6 is then performed to achieve the 3 years ahead long term simulation from 1 4 2009 to 12 31 2011 as shown in fig 9 a the simulated streamflow adequately matches the observations but several high peaks are underestimated exp 7 is implemented in a similar way as exp 6 except that the simulated streamflow is not recursively included as a predictor as fig 9b shows the temporal variation in the simulated streamflow is not as smooth as that in fig 9a but those high peaks are better matched as indicated by the enhanced nse value the improved nse in exp 7 is an interesting finding that suggests that the meteorological data are sufficient to build the data driven model in this case additionally including simulated streamflow in the iterative calculation fig 6 may degrade the model performance in long term simulations because the simulated streamflow error may accumulate in a serial propagated long term simulation over the past decade the iteratively multistep ahead predictor designed to improve the accuracy of long term hydrological prediction has received much attention yang et al 2013 but the iterative error remains a difficult problem to solve the results of exp 7 indicate that the proposed cv could be a promising solution to this problem table 4 compares the performances of the cv exp 6 and exp 7 and several process based models reported in the literature which are evaluated at the same watershed as table 4 shows the cv has a comparable or improved performance in comparison to that of process based models but the cv only uses the basic meteorological data while process based models rely on a variety of input data this improved performance is a considerable advantage of the cv in addition to its data processing and data fusion advantages described in section 2 2 this advantage is attributed to the great power of computer vision in exploring the spatial patterns of data fields 3 3 applicability of cv for pub the problem of pub has triggered intensive research since the beginning of the new millennium hrachowitz et al 2013 there are a variety of approaches addressing pub based on the core need to transfer information obtained in gauged areas to ungauged areas ganora et al 2009 this technique is reminiscent of the well known concept of transfer learning in ai which focuses on storing knowledge learned from the source domain and applying it to a different but related target domain pan and yang 2010 as previously shown the performance of the cv without the historical streamflow as a predictor is satisfactory in both the short term simulation table 3 and long term simulation table 4 this result indicates the great potential of the cv to address pub as examined in exp 8 as fig 10 shows the cv outperforms the lm significantly in predicting the streamflow at yingluoxia especially in reproducing flow peaks and variations at short time scales the nse values associated with the transfer learning of the cv are as high as 0 706 at the daily scale and 0 888 at the monthly scale the enhanced performance implies that the cv is much more powerful in identifying common data field features from different regions overall this experiment demonstrates the potential of the cv to address pub via transfer learning in computer science the transfer learning strategy used in this study is often referred to as domain adaptation pan and yang 2010 however the accurate prediction of runoff in entirely ungauged watersheds remains a considerable challenge performing cv based transfer learning for such watersheds may require a true big data environment and deserves further exploration 3 4 roles of different predictors the results of exp 5 presented in table 3 indicate that t and lai are the best individual predictors for all three models while p is the worst individual predictor the important role of t is likely related to snowmelt and or seasonally frozen soil which are vital driving forces of the streamflow in this cold and arid region gao et al 2018 qin et al 2016 the snowpack melting and frozen soil thawing depend heavily on t in addition t induced changes in evapotranspiration also affect regional water allocation barnett et al 2005 the important role of lai is also not surprising the presence and development of vegetation are tightly interrelated with the soil moisture content which is a pivot state variable of the runoff yield evapotranspiration and infiltration in a watershed jiao et al 2017 correlation analysis was also conducted between the streamflow at the outlet and the watershed wide average p t and lai values the streamflow is highly correlated with the lai in the most recent three days with an average correlation coefficient of 0 731 the average correlation between the streamflow and t in the most recent three days is also high 0 671 however the average correlation coefficient between the streamflow and previous p in the most recent three days is only 0 493 these correlation results are consistent with the results of exp 5 although t and lai are both important in streamflow forecasting in this study they play different roles in shaping the hydrograph fig 11 presents the relationships between the observed streamflow and predicted streamflow in the testing period in the form of scatter plots with marginal densities the streamflow range is divided into five sections by the 25th 75th 95th and 99th percentiles of the observations namely the low flow section 22 2 m3 s medium flow section 22 2 85 4 m3 s high flow section 85 4 159 7 m3 s peak flow section 159 7 281 4 m3 s and extreme peak flow section 281 4 m3 s the five sections contain 25 50 20 4 and 1 of the observations respectively a comparison between fig 11a and b shows that the impact of excluding streamflow from the inputs is most prominent in the peak flow and extreme peak flow sections fig 11a shows the best prediction for the extreme peak flow section among the six subplots this result suggests that historical streamflow plays an important role in predicting peak flows especially extremes fig 11c indicates that with p as the only predictor the model performance is relatively poor r2 0 531 and the prediction misses most of the observations in the low flow section 8 1 compared to the original 25 however fig 11c shows acceptable prediction results for the peak flow and extreme peak flow sections compared to the overall performance this finding suggests that p is critical to the peak flow forecasting of cv but has little explanatory power for low flow which probably implies that the baseflow in the study area is largely controlled by water sources other than p most likely water from snowmelt or seasonally frozen soil as previously discussed this analysis is consistent with the latest investigation into the same watershed gao et al 2018 this recent study demonstrated that runoff during the thawing season is mainly sourced by p while runoff during the cold season is significantly dependent on the increasing soil t which changed the permafrost into seasonally frozen ground as fig 11d and e as well as table 3 indicate the overall importance of t to short term forecasting is similar to that of lai however regarding the low flow and extreme peak flow sections t exhibits more explanatory power than does lai the comparison of fig 11e and f indicates that the removal of the two end sections changes the slope of the trendline from 0 652 to 0 948 making it closer to the 45 line this finding indicates that the explanatory power of lai is much greater when the data points at the two ends are excluded the results of fig 11e and f suggest that lai is a critical predictor for the average water yield of the watershed but has a limited impact on the hydrograph shape which is largely determined by the baseflow and peak extremes in fact as revealed by qin et al 2016 lai in this watershed reflects the thickness changes of the seasonally frozen soil which contributes to the streamflow and affects the evapotranspiration and eventually the regional hydrological process to recapitulate the data fusion framework of the cv enables a systematic analysis of the roles of different predictors such an analysis provides valuable information not only for improving computational efficiency but also for understanding hydrological processes in our study area the peak flow is mainly controlled by p and t the baseflow is significantly impacted by t and the average water yield is highly correlated with lai in addition the historical streamflow plays an important role in predicting future peak flows all these findings reflect the cold and arid regional background of the study area 3 5 similarity between different data fields in this study the proposed cv seemingly assimilates no topographic information because the dem is not used however the topographic information enters the model in an implicit way because similarities exist between the dem and the meteorological and ecological data fields the similarities between the data fields i e images can be easily computed based on the spm model lazebnik et al 2006 the spm model was originally designed for estimating the overall perceptual similarity between images and the feature extraction functionality used in the cv is a part of this design a number of indicators have been proposed to compute the similarity between images according to their feature distribution rubner 2000 in this study the similarity measure hereinafter the matching score is given by the χ 2 distance eq 3 a bin to bin measure to determine the dissimilarity between two statistical distributions 3 d χ 2 i h i m i 2 m i where m i h i k i 2 hi and ki are the i th element of the different vectors h and k respectively the χ 2 distance is normalized to 0 1 in reverse as a matching score to compare the relative similarity fig 12 plots the similarities between different types of images at a monthly time scale the matching score for t and dem is roughly above 80 whereas the score for p and dem varies between nearly zero and 25 the score for lai and dem varies over a wider range and can be as high as approximately 60 more importantly all the matching scores fluctuate on a seasonal basis as t is highly elevation dependent the good matching score for t is not surprising excluding changes associated with the possible effects of the regional climate and growing season the variation in the matching score is probably due to the time variant grayscales in the t field images i e bright for the high t in the summer and dark for the low t in the winter while the color of the dem is static the similarity of the lai significantly changes within a year and the peak values occur during the summer from june to august as the vegetation in this area is mainly grassland and brushland gao et al 2008 the spatial distribution of lai is highly heterogeneous across elevations in summer but relatively uniform in winter when grass and leaves are mostly withering this finding explains the leptokurtic pattern of the matching score in contrast the image patterns of p are entirely different from those of dem indicating that p is largely controlled by regional climate conditions other than local topography not coincidentally the matching scores in this study area are significantly related to the roles of the predictors discussed in section 3 4 the similarity issue discussed above is critical to the fusion of spatiotemporal data by computer vision most of the present high resolution atmospheric forcing data and remote sensing products are interpolated downscaled or assimilated from station based observations and coarse raw imagery referring to topographic indices kilibarda et al 2014 consequently these data fields must have a certain degree of similarity with the dem in the framework of the cv the similarity may imply overlapping information within the extracted feature vectors if the similarity between a predictor and the dem is high it is preferable not to consider the dem as a direct input because the overlapping or redundant information may cause numerical difficulties which should be eschewed in machine learning peng et al 2017 even in a universal cv based model for pub wherein a large number of watersheds are trained simultaneously and the dem feature vector is no longer constant throughout it is still unwise to regard the dem as a direct predictor for the same reason overall the above findings suggest that a similarity analysis should be a preceding step for computer vision based modeling if a high similarity is identified among various input data fields excluding certain data fields might be beneficial to the numerical stability of the model the exclusion does not necessarily mean that the data fields e g dem in this study case are not important 3 6 potential improvements the computer vision model while performing well in the case study could be further improved by using more advanced algorithms one example is the feature extraction algorithm this study selects texture and intensity as the features to represent an image which is a handcrafted and subjective strategy this strategy is a type of shallow learning from the perspective of computer science especially for its selection of feature descriptors and the involved parameters shallow learning has a limited capacity for processing raw data and relies heavily on the extracted features lecun et al 2015 recently deep learning has been shown to be capable of extracting useful features from various datasets via a cascade of hierarchically arranged layers of nonlinear processing units offering an attractive alternative for representing meteorological and ecological data fields in data driven hydrological modeling however deep learning has not been employed in many applications in the field of hydrology marçais and de dreuzy 2017 examining the power of deep learning in the proposed framework appears to be an interesting research topic the ann models and their training method may also be improved by referring to recent advances related to hydrological modeling for example wu and chau 2006 proposed a novel hybrid model that integrates the genetic algorithm with an ann model for flood forecasting the hybrid ga based ann model can produce better accuracy in performance than conventional ann models taormina et al 2015 utilized binary coded swarm optimization for the identification of the filter parameters and neural network structure in streamflow modeling fotovatikhah et al 2018 reviewed existing hybrid models that combine soft computing evolutionary algorithms and machine learning algorithms in flood management using the advanced ann models may further enhance the performance of the cv and deserves further study 4 conclusions this study develops a new approach to data driven hydrological modeling the approach adopts a computer vision technique to effectively exploit the spatial information contained in time variant input data fields and seamlessly fuses the multisource information via machine learning with this new approach a cv is developed to simulate the streamflow of a mountainous watershed in the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau a series of numerical experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the cv in comparison to the performances of two existing data driven models an lm and an sd the major findings of this study are as follows first the cv represents a general framework with which to fuse multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and has a great potential to incorporate fast growing environmental big data e g various remote sensing data and high resolution weather data the cv avoids the complicated and case dependent operations of data processing and structure configuration required by existing process based or data driven hydrological models and can also readily utilize any spatiotemporal data as its inputs as long as the data are correlated with the target output variable second in this study the cv performs well in short term forecasting long term simulation and transfer learning for short term forecasting the cv has a higher prediction accuracy and robustness than do the lm and sd when the forecasting lead time exceeds one day for long term simulation the cv uses much less data than do existing process based models to achieve a comparable or even better performance for transfer learning the cv outperforms the lm especially in reproducing flow peaks and is promising for addressing pub third because of its flexibility in fusing multisource spatiotemporal data the cv enables a systematic analysis of the roles of different predictors in the cold mountainous area studied the peak flow is mainly controlled by p and t the baseflow is significantly impacted by t and the average water yield is highly correlated with the lai in addition historical streamflow plays an important role in predicting future peak flows finally although topographic information is not included as a model input in this study its impact is embodied well by other inputs e g temperature due to the similarities between those data fields and the dem the implication is that if a high similarity is identified among various input data fields it may be desirable to exclude certain data fields in order to achieve numerical stability of the data driven model overall this study represents the first step in a promising direction towards the use of computer vision in hydrological modeling while the proposed modeling framework is general the key algorithms of feature extraction and machine learning adopted in this study could be further improved by referring to recent advances in related areas moreover many exciting associated research problems deserve further exploration one next step is to develop more accurate data driven models for pub if the environmental big data of all gauged basins worldwide could be obtained for one day a universal computer vision strategy for pub could be built using cutting edge deep learning technologies ai advances in other fields such as natural language video description advances support this possibility in addition data driven real time hydrological forecasting at the global scale represents another important research problem

6875,this study develops a novel approach to data driven hydrological modeling the approach adopts the feature representation technique in computer vision to effectively exploit spatial information contained in time variant input data fields and seamlessly fuse multisource information via machine learning the new approach overcomes a major limitation of existing approaches in which the spatial heterogeneity of input variables cannot be sufficiently accounted for the approach is applied to predict the streamflow in a watershed on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau and its performance is compared with various data driven and process based models the major findings are as follows first the new approach represents a general framework for the fusion of multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and demonstrates great potential to incorporate fast growing environmental big data second the new approach demonstrates satisfactory short term forecasting long term simulation and transfer learning performances and is promising for addressing predictions in ungauged basins third the predictors including precipitation temperature leaf area index and historical streamflow play markedly distinct roles in modeling streamflow with the novel approach finally topographic information is not a necessary model input in the proposed approach because spatial patterns can be well embodied by other inputs e g temperature that have high similarities with topography this study represents the first attempt to bring computer vision into data driven hydrological modeling and may inspire future studies in this promising direction keywords computer vision data fusion hydrological modeling machine learning heihe river basin environmental big data 1 introduction hydrological modeling can be performed using process based or data driven models beven 2012 data driven models provide direct mappings between driving forces e g rainfall and hydrological responses e g runoff without process descriptions in the past century after freeze and harlan s blueprint freeze and harlan 1969 considerable advances have been made in process based hydrological modeling in the 1990s data driven models began to receive increased attention from the hydrologic community largely due to the remarkable progress in machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks anns beven 2012 hsu et al 1995 since then in addition to classic runoff forecasting heřmanovský et al 2017 data driven models have been applied to address a variety of hydrological issues such as soil moisture estimation ahmad et al 2010 evapotranspiration prediction abdullah et al 2015 river stage forecasting chau 2007 and groundwater level simulation gholami et al 2015 however the hydrologic community by and large still views data driven models as a valuable supplement to process based models in hydrological modeling in recent years the rapid development of artificial intelligence ai and big data has triggered revolutionary changes in many research fields such as life science economics and sociology lecun et al 2015 in the broad area of earth science new satellite and airborne remote sensing systems as well as ground based sensor network systems are producing environmental big data with high spatial and temporal resolutions nativi et al 2015 for instance as reported by the european space agency http www esa int its present twin sentinel 2 satellites can acquire up to two petabytes 1 pb 106 gb of data annually using their powerful sensors with such high throughput real time environmental big data the opportunity to use ai for data driven hydrological forecasting is emerging however the exponentially increasing volume of environmental data poses a considerable challenge to forecasting babovic 2005 although some hydrologists anticipate that ai will improve our capacity in hydrological prediction to an unprecedented level yaseen et al 2015 as is occurring in many other fields a new paradigm for hydrological modeling in the era of big data has yet to be established one challenge is to fuse multisource data in data driven hydrological modeling machine learning has been introduced into hydrological research for many years nourani et al 2014 however previous data driven models have mainly considered ground based measurements that are relatively sparse in time and space or watershed wide averages of gridded meteorological data while big picture spatial coverage data obtained by earth observing satellites e g satellite derived soil moisture and a satellite based cloud liquid water path have rarely been used famiglietti et al 2015 the difficulty for data driven models lies in the inconsistency of diverse sources of data concerning temporal and spatial resolutions and encoding formats recent runoff forecasting studies attempted to incorporate cross source data such as climate phenomenon indices rice and emanuel 2017 and time series of snow cover data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite product uysal et al 2016 however these data only represent a small portion of the data being collected by a wide range of environmental sensors furthermore non time series data such as digital elevation model dem and soil type maps while fundamental for process based hydrological modeling are difficult to fuse into data driven models because of their time invariance an effective approach to data fusion has yet to be developed to improve data driven hydrological modeling the second challenge is to address the spatial heterogeneity of predictors in data driven models previous studies often ignored the spatial features of model input data and simply averaged the data over the entire modeling domain in what resembles a lumped approach to process based modeling however the spatial patterns of driving forces may have significant impacts on hydrological responses for example if a storm center is close to a watershed outlet a short time to peak and a flashy hydrograph are expected at the outlet thus discarding the relevant spatial information contained in the original data may result in considerable inaccuracy and uncertainty in data driven forecasting chen and adams 2006 efforts have been made to address this problem in rainfall runoff modeling for example zhang and govindaraju 2003 developed a geomorphology based ann model by taking into account the similarity between the geometric nature of a channel network and the architecture of a neural network in another study bhattacharjya and chaurasia 2012 the contributions of rainfall in different subbasins were determined based on geomorphologic parameters which were used to calculate the weighted average of the rainfall for the entire watershed the watershed wide average rainfall was then used as an input in the ann model tsai et al 2014 developed an innovative semi distributed data driven model for reservoir inflow forecasting the radar derived rainfall data were clustered into several subbasins the semi distributed input at different subbasins was associated with different time lags determined via correlation analyses between the gauged rainfall and reservoir inflow to better address the nonlinearity of the hydrological response chang and tsai 2016 used a self organizing map som instead of categorizing subbasins and employed a gamma test gt to determine the travel time however the aforementioned approaches either lumped or semi distributed with regard to model inputs do not fully exploit spatial information a straightforward strategy for model improvement is the development of a fully distributed data driven model that can make use of data information at every spatial unit unfortunately this strategy would lead to extremely complicated machine learning model structures jean et al 2016 and would therefore result in the curse of dimensionality the third challenge is to choose the appropriate data from the massive datasets and identify the most relevant input variables i e predictors environmental monitoring systems worldwide are providing an increasingly large amount of data with progressively finer temporal and spatial resolutions hart and martinez 2006 it would be ill advised to attempt to utilize all the available data not only because the data dimensions would increase from dozens to tens or even hundreds of thousands but also because the learning process would have to address redundant data and or irrelevant information galelli and castelletti 2013 the identification of influential input variables would be beneficial to the reasonability of black box models several studies have analyzed the contributions of typical predictors including the historical streamflow precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and net solar radiation to streamflow prediction in data driven models chang and tsai 2016 wu and chau 2011 however as most of these models did not capitalize on the spatial information of predictors streamflow was often the overwhelmingly predominant predictor galelli and castelletti 2013 whereas other predictors with spatial heterogeneity were seriously undervalued thus the development of innovative data driven models in which the roles of different predictors can be correctly identified is highly desired to address these challenges an innovative solution to the representation of spatial information in data driven models is important as an essential element of ai and big data analysis computer vision is undergoing rapid development the goal of computer vision is to enable the machine to understand the world often called visual perception through the processing of digital signals wang et al 2013 computer vision techniques have been applied in various fields of earth science such as remote sensing change detection schneider 2012 biophysical variable estimation e g ocean chlorophyll concentration camps valls et al 2006 and other analyses of imagery derived from airborne and satellite sensors mountrakis et al 2011 however to the best of our knowledge computer vision has not been introduced into hydrological modeling yet hence the core idea of this study is to use an advanced feature representation technique in the field of computer vision to extract features from gridded images and then map these features to hydrological responses via machine learning note that machine learning is also a frequently used technique in computer vision however in this study machine learning is used to build black box hydrological models not to process images i e data fields features extracted using computer vision usually have no explicit physical meanings and can only be understood and interpreted by the machine itself representing a unique characteristic of computer vision based models compared to classic data driven models most feature extraction approaches tend to represent an image as a collection of either global features describing an image as a whole e g texture and intensity or local features describing specific objects in an image nixon and aguado 2012 one drawback of global feature extraction is that information about the spatial layout of features is disregarded lazebnik et al 2006 developed an improved image representation named spatial pyramid mapping spm to solve this problem this method can record spatial information in the extracted feature vector the spm model and its variants have demonstrated convincing performance in computer vision applications harada et al 2011 in the present study a mountainous watershed on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau was selected as the study area a variant of the spm model is employed to extract features from multiple time variant data fields including precipitation surface temperature and remote sensing based leaf area index lai the extracted feature vectors and streamflow observations are used to build flow models by machine learning the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to build a novel framework fusing multisource spatiotemporal information for data driven hydrological modeling 2 to investigate the power of computer vision in processing massive environmental data for hydrological modeling and 3 to demonstrate how data driven modeling can deepen the understanding of hydrological processes the main contribution of this study lies in its adoption of computer vision to overcome a major limitation of existing data driven hydrological models that is insufficient consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of input variables overall this study highlights a promising direction towards a new paradigm of hydrological modeling in the era of big data 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and multisource data the study area fig 1 the yingluoxia watershed lies on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau the watershed is the upstream part of the heihe river basin hrb which is the second largest endorheic river basin in china the watershed has an area of approximately 10 010 km2 and an elevation that ranges from 1689 m in the northeast to 5054 m in the west the average annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm and mainly falls from june to september and the average annual temperature is approximately 2 c perennial snow exists above 3400 m while the seasonal snow cover ranges from 2700 m to 3400 m wang et al 2010 grassland and brushland are the dominant land cover types and constitute approximately 50 and 12 of the total area respectively li et al 2010 the topography meteorology and vegetation cover in this watershed have significant spatial heterogeneity a variety of process based models have been developed to simulate the hydrological processes in the yingluoxia watershed in previous studies gao et al 2018 li et al 2011b this watershed offers an ideal testbed for benchmarking the model proposed in this study with existing models table 1 lists the multisource data used in this modeling study all the data were acquired from the cold and arid regions science data center http card westgis ac cn the time variant data fields of precipitation and temperature pan et al 2012 were derived from the weather research and forecasting wrf model and validated by the daily observed data of china meteorological administration cma stations http data cma cn en the lai data liao et al 2013 were retrieved from a canopy bidirectional reflectance function brdf model these meteorological and ecological data were preprocessed using different strategies and then used as dynamic inputs for different data driven models details of the preprocessing strategies will be explained in the following sections to ensure that the same time interval would be maintained in the models the lai raster data were linearly interpolated into a daily resolution the linear interpolation is appropriate because lai does not generally abruptly change at a weekly timescale note that other variables such as surface pressure relative humidity wind speed and downward radiations were also considered as potential predictors in preliminary tests as these variables exerted no significant influence on the model performances they were not included in the final models streamflow observations at the outlet yingluoxia in fig 1 are the target to be matched by the models and streamflow observations at the two upstream gaging stations zhamashike and qilian in fig 1 are also discussed our new model see section 2 3 does not require land cover and stream network data but the two models used for comparative purposes see section 2 4 do require these data 2 2 new framework of data fusion a new approach to data driven hydrological modeling is proposed in this study which couples computer vision with machine learning the model built according to this approach is hereafter known as the computer vision model cv the cv is further compared with two existing types of data driven models one is the lumped model lm which uses watershed wide averages of input data fields e g gridded remote sensing and meteorological data as the predictors the other is the semi distributed model sd proposed by tsai et al 2014 in which the predictors are the averages of input data fields calculated for all delineated subbasins instead of the averages calculated for the entire watershed in the lm more technical details about the cv lm and sd are provided in sections 2 3 and 2 4 fig 2 illustrates the general frameworks of the cv lm and sd in parallel in the cv the temporally varied and spatially distributed data fields are treated as 8 bit images and represented by feature vectors via computer vision the extracted feature vectors together with historical hydrological records i e streamflow observations at specific gaging stations are then used to train the machine learning model the model can subsequently be used to infer future streamflow more details of the cv are provided in section 2 3 the major differences between the cv and the other two models as illustrated in fig 2 are the following first both the cv and lm have a straightforward procedure of model building and need no auxiliary data while the sd requires a series of complicated operations on additional data fields such as topographic data stream network and land cover map fields second the lm does not utilize the spatial information contained in input data fields and the sd only utilizes spatial information to a limited extent in contrast the cv can deeply explore spatial information with a cell by cell strategy to extract feature vectors and is essentially analogous to a quasi fully distributed model thus with regard to the utilization of the spatial information the three models adequately cover the full spectrum of data driven hydrological models compared to process based modeling the cv has many advantages with regard to fusing spatiotemporal data first the cv can utilize almost any type of spatiotemporal data as its inputs while classic process based hydrological models have rigorous definitions of model inputs and outputs for example soil moisture snow cover and lai spatiotemporal data cannot be utilized as inputs by a process based model but can readily be used as inputs by the cv because data driven modeling is based on correlation rather than causation second process based hydrological models are not able to assimilate hydrological observations e g streamflow data by themselves and data assimilation algorithms such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf clark et al 2008 and particle filter salamon and feyen 2009 are needed while the cv can directly assimilate observations by treating them as input data as illustrated in fig 2 third the cv provides a straightforward and uniform way i e feature extraction via computer vision to process spatiotemporal data while process based models similar to the sd require specific operations on different data fields with the unique features discussed above the cv represents a new framework for fusing multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and demonstrates great potential to incorporate environmental big data in this framework nonstationarity in hydrological modeling when significant can be resolved by assimilating relevant data in model training for example to account for the impact of land use change on the rainfall runoff relationship the cv can incorporate time series of land use land cover images as its input data fields 2 3 computer vision model this study considers precipitation p temperature t and lai data fields as the inputs of the data driven models fig 3 illustrates the procedure of feature extraction in the cv in computer vision features refer to different types of information abstracted from an image using features instead of pixel values computer vision can quantitatively describe an image in far fewer dimensions than can other techniques common features such as contour shape texture and image intensity are often in the form of numerical value vectors in this study all the data fields are first converted into 8 bit images specifically the raster values in each input category i e p t and lai are scaled into integers within the range of 0 255 to generate 8 bit grayscale images and the background value is set to 0 i e black for example in the temperature images used in this study the maximum value 301 9 k and minimum value 241 3 k are mapped to 255 i e white and 0 i e black respectively preliminary tests show that the conversion to 8 bit images is adequate in this case a smaller image depth e g 4 bit scales the pixel values of the data fields into a narrow integer range e g 0 15 leading to the loss of details of the spatial pattern in contrast a larger image depth e g 12 bit produces a very wide integer range e g 0 4096 which enhances the local noise in some raw data fields and consequently affects the effectiveness of feature extraction texture and intensity have been found to be appropriate features to describe converted images for hydrological modeling the texture feature can represent the spatial variability of data fields a number of visual descriptors have been proposed to characterize the texture feature in the field of computer vision local binary pattern lbp which is used in this study is among the most popular descriptors ojala et al 1996 compared with other texture descriptors lbp has the merits of discriminative power overall computational simplicity flexibility and ease of implementation heikkilä et al 2009 the intensity feature directly reflects the pixel values of the original data field in this study the spm strategy lazebnik et al 2006 is used to spatially represent the texture and intensity features of images the grayscale image is divided into a sequence of increasingly finer subregions at different levels forming a pyramid of subimages at the pyramid level ℓ ℓ 0 1 l the 2 dimensional image is evenly divided into 22 ℓ subregions where l denotes the maximum pyramid level the texture feature of a subregion is represented by a histogram signified as a list of normalized lbp counts the intensity feature of a subregion is simply its average grayscale value the feature statistics either for the histogram or average grayscale value of each pyramid of images are then concatenated sequentially into the respective feature vector which is either the texture feature vector or the intensity feature vector see fig 3 the texture and intensity feature vectors are then combined into a final vector used as input for the ann because the visual statistics of these subregions are stored sequentially in the feature vector the relative positional information of each subregion is retained inside the final vector more technical details of the lbp descriptor and the spm strategy are provided in appendix a and appendix b in the supplementary material in this study the number of bins in the texture histograms is set to 15 and the average intensity is a scalar the maximum pyramid levels l for extracting texture and intensity features are set to 2 and 4 respectively for example l 4 means that the original image is transformed into a pyramid with 1 subregion at spatial level 0 4 subregions at spatial level 1 16 subregions at spatial level 2 64 subregions at spatial level 3 and 256 subregions at spatial level 4 this configuration results in texture and intensity feature vector lengths of 315 1 4 16 15 and 341 1 4 16 64 256 1 respectively therefore the dimension of the final input vector of each input data field is 656 315 341 preliminary tests confirm that the selected l values ensure a good balance between the accuracy and computing efficiency of the model for more complex applications with a larger sample size more pyramid levels can be considered to improve the modeling accuracy note that the feature extraction in this study only represents a specific paradigm and other features e g gradients or feature descriptors may be more suitable in other cases this study examines different time lag lengths of the predictor variables i e p t lai and historical streamflow preliminary tests indicate that the predictors have no significant influence on the output i e the streamflow at the outlet when the lag time exceeds 3 days therefore the cv in this study uses a 3 day lag time which means the predictor variables for the most recent three days including the current day are the model inputs given this lag time when p t lai and historical streamflow at the watershed outlet are all model inputs the total dimension of the input vector is 5907 656 3 1 3 because the feature statistics from the background region null grayscale value are time invariant they are removed from the input vectors such that the model complexity is reduced thus the total dimension of the actual input vector is less than 5907 3818 in this study 2 4 existing models for comparison this study also examines two existing types of data driven models the lm and sd their modeling frameworks are illustrated and compared with the cv framework in fig 2 for the lm preliminary tests showed that a 3 day lag time for the predictor variables is appropriate which is consistent with the cv given this lag time when the model inputs include p t lai and historical streamflow at the watershed outlet the total dimension of the input vector for the lm is 12 3 1 3 the sd is built for the study area following tsai et al 2014 the entire watershed is first delineated into 39 subbasins fig 4 based on dem the number of subbasins in the process based models built for the same watershed lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 is within the range of 20 45 in general preliminary tests show that the performance of the sd is not sensitive to the number of subbasins within this range the theoretical travel time is then calculated grid by grid using the mndnr hydro tools developed by the minnesota department of natural resources https gisdata mn gov dataset dnr arcgis toolbox the calculation is based on manning s equation for open channel flow the travel time is primarily influenced by topography surface roughness and channel width zuazo et al 2014 the roughness coefficient and hydraulic radius values follow the recommendations of the toolbox although the calculation of travel time is relatively simple it adequately supports the determination of the lag time of subbasins once the grid based travel time is calculated the lag time of the subbasins is determined as the average travel time over the subbasin subbasins with an average travel time within 1 day 2 days and 3 days are assigned 1 day 2 day and 3 day lag times respectively according to fig 4 the numbers of subbasins with a 1 day 2 day and 3 day lag time are 16 19 and 4 respectively this result also supports the choice of a 3 day lag time in the cv and lm in the sd for each of the spatially distributed model inputs i e p t and lai the average values of the 39 subbasins with different lag times see fig 4 are considered and comprise a 39 element vector thus when the 3 day lagging historical streamflow at the watershed outlet is included as a model input the total dimension of the input vector for the sd is 120 39 3 1 3 2 5 machine learning algorithm the data fusion framework of the cv see fig 2 is general and suits any machine learning algorithm such as anns kashani et al 2016 support vector machines svms naganna and deka 2014 extreme learning machines yaseen et al 2016 and regression trees galelli and castelletti 2013 in this study the classical ann is selected because it has been widely used in hydrological modeling and preliminary tests have shown that it outperforms svm another popular algorithm for this study case other machine learning algorithms may be equally or more suitable for this study case but identifying such algorithms is not an objective of this study the ann has a computing system capable of recognizing patterns by learning in the same way as biological neural networks do in human brains rather than by using rule based programming in anns a collection of connected artificial neurons is organized in layers and each connection transmits information from one neuron to another signals entering the input layer arrive at the output layer by passing through one or more hidden layers anns can well represent the nonlinearity of hydrological processes hsu et al 1995 taormina et al 2015 the neural network used in this study is a fully connected four layer perceptron whose structure is illustrated in fig 5 the extracted feature vectors of p t lai and the historical streamflow observations are fed into the input layer and processed in the hidden layers the output layer provides the streamflow prediction for faster convergence all the inputs and outputs are scaled to 0 1 before the training note that the four rounded rectangles in the input layers fig 5 represent four categories of inputs not merely four neurons the actual number of neurons in the input layer depends on the dimensions of the feature vectors and varies among different experiments the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer must be tuned to achieve good model performance in this study preliminary trials showed that two hidden layers are sufficient to ensure satisfactory results for the cv lm and sd different numbers of neurons ranging from 4 to 64 in the hidden layers were also tested to maintain a good balance between the model accuracy and efficiency in the training period 8 16 neurons are included in each hidden layer of the cv whereas 16 32 neurons are included in each hidden layer of the lm and sd which had comparatively few input layer neurons the actual neuron number varies in the numerical experiments conducted in this study because the experiments consider different combinations of input variables as the daily flow observations used in this study span from 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2011 a maximum of 4380 input output data pairs can be prepared for training and testing the three ann based models this period covers dry years e g 2004 and wet years e g 2008 and the meteorological conditions in recent years i e after 2011 are within the historical ranges unless otherwise stated the dataset is divided into two subsets 75 for model training 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2008 and the remaining 25 for model testing 1 4 2009 to 12 31 2011 in the training stage 2847 data pairs i e 65 of the total are randomly picked from the subset and used to seek the optimal trainable parameters i e weight and bias values in the networks the other 438 data pairs i e 10 of the total are used for validation with the early stop strategy prechelt 1998 adopted to avoid overfitting the models are trained using back propagation rumelhart et al 1986 with adam kingma and ba 2014 as the optimizer in the adam optimizer the learning rate and the learning rate decay over each update are respectively configured to 0 0005 and 0 001 based on preliminary tests note that the cv involves more ann trainable parameters than do the lm and sd because it has more neurons in the input layer however the cv is still computationally affordable and inexpensive the maximum elapsed time of the cv is less than 15 min on an average personal computer core i7 6700 cpu 3 40 ghz and 16 gb ram in all the numerical experiments introduced in the next section in comparison many physically based hydrological models take hours to complete a ten year simulation it is worth re emphasizing that the machine learning techniques in the three data driven models are the same i e classical anns and they are not the focus of the model comparison 2 6 numerical experiments several numerical experiments were conducted to examine the applicability of the cv and table 2 summarizes eight groups of experiments with the most important findings exp 1 and exp 2 investigated short term streamflow forecasting with a prediction lead time of up to five days while exp 3 to exp 5 examined the explanatory abilities of different input variables the historical streamflow with a 3 day lag time is included as a predictor in exp 1 exp 2 and exp 4 but is excluded from exp 3 and exp 5 the performances of the cv lm and sd are systematically compared in these experiments exp 6 and exp 7 demonstrate the approach to long term continuous streamflow simulation by the cv in exp 6 the 1 day lead time streamflow prediction is performed at time t i e q t 1 by a short term forecasting model with input variables of p t and historical streamflow and the prediction is then used as input in the subsequent time steps 1 2 or 3 steps depending on the lag time this recursive calculation is iterated to achieve an n day ahead here n denotes the simulation length streamflow simulation starting from time t 1 fig 6 illustrates the iterative process of n day ahead streamflow simulation based on a short term forecasting model with 3 day lag time and 1 day lead time exp 7 is similar to exp 6 except that the simulated streamflow is not recursively used as a predictor i e the recursive part shown in fig 6 is excluded the n day ahead streamflow simulation in exp 7 is entirely based on meteorological data fields exp 8 is specifically designed to examine the applicability of the cv for addressing hydrologic predictions in ungauged basins pub this experiment assumes that during the training period 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2009 the streamflow was gauged at the two upstream stations zhamashike and qilian but not at the watershed outlet yingluoxia fig 4 to perform cross watershed transfer learning with the cv the one day lead time models in exp 3 are retrained using the data from the two upstream subwatersheds and then tested at yingluoxia for the period from 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2011 the input vectors are extracted for the two subwatersheds for training and for the entire study watershed for testing according to the approach described in section 2 3 the input vector lengths are the same as those in exp 3 eventually 7300 3650 2 input output data pairs are prepared for training and 4380 input output data pairs are prepared for testing exp 8 represents transfer learning in space by the cv transfer learning is easy to implement because the cv has a straightforward and uniform strategy to process spatiotemporal data for comparison the lm is also employed to perform transfer learning but the sd is not considered because its model structure makes cross watershed transfer learning very difficult to implement for the lm the watershed average data fields alone are not sufficient to predict the streamflow at the watershed outlet because the streamflow is also related to the watershed area in previous studies two strategies are commonly used to address this area related issue one is to determine weighting factors for different watersheds based on their areas and then use the weighted contribution of their meteorological data to develop the ann model bhattacharjya and chaurasia 2012 the other is to include the watershed area as an additional variable in the input vector nourani and komasi 2013 our preliminary tests indicated that the second strategy is more suitable for the study area the length of each input vector is 10 after considering the 3 day lagging p t lai and area for the respective watershed to adequately evaluate the performance of the three ann based models nash sutcliffe efficiency nse logarithmic nse log nse and volumetric efficiency ve are employed as goodness of fit metrics nse is a classic and popular metric defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 but it overemphasizes peaks log nse uses the logarithms of the observed and predicted values to compute nse such that the influence of low values can be enhanced liu and kumar 2016 ve is an alternative index enhancing the measurement of overall performance criss and winston 2008 that addresses certain limitations of nse in the context of streamflow modeling nse and ve are calculated as follows 1 nse 1 q q 2 q q 2 2 ve 1 q q q where q is the simulated streamflow q is the observed streamflow and q is the mean value of the observed streamflow all metrics are bounded from negative infinity to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match between the prediction and the observation 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term forecasting fig 7 plots the short term forecasting with a 1 day lead time i e exp 1 in table 2 by the cv the predicted hydrograph closely matches the flow observations as indicated by the nse and ve values as table 3 shows the sd and lm perform slightly better than does the cv in exp 1 this result is not surprising in this study the autocorrelation of short lag times in the streamflow data is strong and even if the historical streamflow is the only predictor i e exp 4 the nse in the testing stage can be as high as 0 862 this result implies that the historical streamflow has a dominant impact on forecasting with a 1 day lead time in exp 1 the lm and sd have far fewer neurons in the input layer 12 and 120 neurons respectively than does the cv 5907 neurons therefore the explanatory power of the historical streamflow is better embodied in the lm and sd however when longer lead times are considered in exp 2 the cv advantage becomes prominent in fig 8 the solid lines with markers indicate that the performances of the three models decrease as the lead time is increased from 1 day to 5 days but the cv has a much slower decay than does the sd even when the lead time is 5 days the cv nse is still above 0 76 thus the cv relies much less than do the other models on historical streamflow in the short term forecasting which implies its great potential for addressing pub exp 3 is similar to exp 1 and exp 2 except that the historical streamflow is not included in the inputs as table 3 shows the sd and lm experience more substantial decreases than does the cv in the three metrics and are outperformed by the cv when the lead time is 1 day the dashed lines with markers in fig 8 demonstrate the decreasing performances of the three models with different lead times when the historical streamflow is excluded of all the models the cv has the best performance for all lead times in addition the decreasing tendency of nse is more prominent when the historical streamflow is included in the inputs i e for each model the solid line has a steeper slope than the dashed line in fig 8 this finding indicates that the inclusion of historical streamflow is not beneficial for the short term forecasting with a long lead time this result is probably due to the rapid decrease in the contribution of historical streamflow to predicting future streamflow as indicated by the black solid line without markers i e the results of exp 4 in which historical streamflow is the only predictor in fig 8 likewise when p t or lai is taken as an individual input in exp 5 cv is also the best performing model with regard to all the metrics see table 3 the role of each predictor will be further discussed in section 3 4 it is also worth noting from table 3 that the three metrics lead to very similar comparison results overall exp 1 to exp 5 prove the applicability of the cv for short term streamflow forecasting the cv also demonstrates a higher prediction accuracy and robustness than do the lm and sd when the forecasting lead time is longer than 1 day this result is largely due to the feature extraction by computer vision which sufficiently exploits the spatial information contained in the input data fields as noted above the cv is essentially analogous to a quasi fully distributed model 3 2 long term simulation exp 6 conducts an n days ahead long term simulation by the cv using p t and the preceding streamflow simulated as the model inputs in the training stage the timeframe of the model inputs is from 1 1 2000 to 12 30 2008 and the timeframe of the model target i e the future streamflow is from 1 4 2000 to 12 31 2008 the recursive calculation illustrated by fig 6 is then performed to achieve the 3 years ahead long term simulation from 1 4 2009 to 12 31 2011 as shown in fig 9 a the simulated streamflow adequately matches the observations but several high peaks are underestimated exp 7 is implemented in a similar way as exp 6 except that the simulated streamflow is not recursively included as a predictor as fig 9b shows the temporal variation in the simulated streamflow is not as smooth as that in fig 9a but those high peaks are better matched as indicated by the enhanced nse value the improved nse in exp 7 is an interesting finding that suggests that the meteorological data are sufficient to build the data driven model in this case additionally including simulated streamflow in the iterative calculation fig 6 may degrade the model performance in long term simulations because the simulated streamflow error may accumulate in a serial propagated long term simulation over the past decade the iteratively multistep ahead predictor designed to improve the accuracy of long term hydrological prediction has received much attention yang et al 2013 but the iterative error remains a difficult problem to solve the results of exp 7 indicate that the proposed cv could be a promising solution to this problem table 4 compares the performances of the cv exp 6 and exp 7 and several process based models reported in the literature which are evaluated at the same watershed as table 4 shows the cv has a comparable or improved performance in comparison to that of process based models but the cv only uses the basic meteorological data while process based models rely on a variety of input data this improved performance is a considerable advantage of the cv in addition to its data processing and data fusion advantages described in section 2 2 this advantage is attributed to the great power of computer vision in exploring the spatial patterns of data fields 3 3 applicability of cv for pub the problem of pub has triggered intensive research since the beginning of the new millennium hrachowitz et al 2013 there are a variety of approaches addressing pub based on the core need to transfer information obtained in gauged areas to ungauged areas ganora et al 2009 this technique is reminiscent of the well known concept of transfer learning in ai which focuses on storing knowledge learned from the source domain and applying it to a different but related target domain pan and yang 2010 as previously shown the performance of the cv without the historical streamflow as a predictor is satisfactory in both the short term simulation table 3 and long term simulation table 4 this result indicates the great potential of the cv to address pub as examined in exp 8 as fig 10 shows the cv outperforms the lm significantly in predicting the streamflow at yingluoxia especially in reproducing flow peaks and variations at short time scales the nse values associated with the transfer learning of the cv are as high as 0 706 at the daily scale and 0 888 at the monthly scale the enhanced performance implies that the cv is much more powerful in identifying common data field features from different regions overall this experiment demonstrates the potential of the cv to address pub via transfer learning in computer science the transfer learning strategy used in this study is often referred to as domain adaptation pan and yang 2010 however the accurate prediction of runoff in entirely ungauged watersheds remains a considerable challenge performing cv based transfer learning for such watersheds may require a true big data environment and deserves further exploration 3 4 roles of different predictors the results of exp 5 presented in table 3 indicate that t and lai are the best individual predictors for all three models while p is the worst individual predictor the important role of t is likely related to snowmelt and or seasonally frozen soil which are vital driving forces of the streamflow in this cold and arid region gao et al 2018 qin et al 2016 the snowpack melting and frozen soil thawing depend heavily on t in addition t induced changes in evapotranspiration also affect regional water allocation barnett et al 2005 the important role of lai is also not surprising the presence and development of vegetation are tightly interrelated with the soil moisture content which is a pivot state variable of the runoff yield evapotranspiration and infiltration in a watershed jiao et al 2017 correlation analysis was also conducted between the streamflow at the outlet and the watershed wide average p t and lai values the streamflow is highly correlated with the lai in the most recent three days with an average correlation coefficient of 0 731 the average correlation between the streamflow and t in the most recent three days is also high 0 671 however the average correlation coefficient between the streamflow and previous p in the most recent three days is only 0 493 these correlation results are consistent with the results of exp 5 although t and lai are both important in streamflow forecasting in this study they play different roles in shaping the hydrograph fig 11 presents the relationships between the observed streamflow and predicted streamflow in the testing period in the form of scatter plots with marginal densities the streamflow range is divided into five sections by the 25th 75th 95th and 99th percentiles of the observations namely the low flow section 22 2 m3 s medium flow section 22 2 85 4 m3 s high flow section 85 4 159 7 m3 s peak flow section 159 7 281 4 m3 s and extreme peak flow section 281 4 m3 s the five sections contain 25 50 20 4 and 1 of the observations respectively a comparison between fig 11a and b shows that the impact of excluding streamflow from the inputs is most prominent in the peak flow and extreme peak flow sections fig 11a shows the best prediction for the extreme peak flow section among the six subplots this result suggests that historical streamflow plays an important role in predicting peak flows especially extremes fig 11c indicates that with p as the only predictor the model performance is relatively poor r2 0 531 and the prediction misses most of the observations in the low flow section 8 1 compared to the original 25 however fig 11c shows acceptable prediction results for the peak flow and extreme peak flow sections compared to the overall performance this finding suggests that p is critical to the peak flow forecasting of cv but has little explanatory power for low flow which probably implies that the baseflow in the study area is largely controlled by water sources other than p most likely water from snowmelt or seasonally frozen soil as previously discussed this analysis is consistent with the latest investigation into the same watershed gao et al 2018 this recent study demonstrated that runoff during the thawing season is mainly sourced by p while runoff during the cold season is significantly dependent on the increasing soil t which changed the permafrost into seasonally frozen ground as fig 11d and e as well as table 3 indicate the overall importance of t to short term forecasting is similar to that of lai however regarding the low flow and extreme peak flow sections t exhibits more explanatory power than does lai the comparison of fig 11e and f indicates that the removal of the two end sections changes the slope of the trendline from 0 652 to 0 948 making it closer to the 45 line this finding indicates that the explanatory power of lai is much greater when the data points at the two ends are excluded the results of fig 11e and f suggest that lai is a critical predictor for the average water yield of the watershed but has a limited impact on the hydrograph shape which is largely determined by the baseflow and peak extremes in fact as revealed by qin et al 2016 lai in this watershed reflects the thickness changes of the seasonally frozen soil which contributes to the streamflow and affects the evapotranspiration and eventually the regional hydrological process to recapitulate the data fusion framework of the cv enables a systematic analysis of the roles of different predictors such an analysis provides valuable information not only for improving computational efficiency but also for understanding hydrological processes in our study area the peak flow is mainly controlled by p and t the baseflow is significantly impacted by t and the average water yield is highly correlated with lai in addition the historical streamflow plays an important role in predicting future peak flows all these findings reflect the cold and arid regional background of the study area 3 5 similarity between different data fields in this study the proposed cv seemingly assimilates no topographic information because the dem is not used however the topographic information enters the model in an implicit way because similarities exist between the dem and the meteorological and ecological data fields the similarities between the data fields i e images can be easily computed based on the spm model lazebnik et al 2006 the spm model was originally designed for estimating the overall perceptual similarity between images and the feature extraction functionality used in the cv is a part of this design a number of indicators have been proposed to compute the similarity between images according to their feature distribution rubner 2000 in this study the similarity measure hereinafter the matching score is given by the χ 2 distance eq 3 a bin to bin measure to determine the dissimilarity between two statistical distributions 3 d χ 2 i h i m i 2 m i where m i h i k i 2 hi and ki are the i th element of the different vectors h and k respectively the χ 2 distance is normalized to 0 1 in reverse as a matching score to compare the relative similarity fig 12 plots the similarities between different types of images at a monthly time scale the matching score for t and dem is roughly above 80 whereas the score for p and dem varies between nearly zero and 25 the score for lai and dem varies over a wider range and can be as high as approximately 60 more importantly all the matching scores fluctuate on a seasonal basis as t is highly elevation dependent the good matching score for t is not surprising excluding changes associated with the possible effects of the regional climate and growing season the variation in the matching score is probably due to the time variant grayscales in the t field images i e bright for the high t in the summer and dark for the low t in the winter while the color of the dem is static the similarity of the lai significantly changes within a year and the peak values occur during the summer from june to august as the vegetation in this area is mainly grassland and brushland gao et al 2008 the spatial distribution of lai is highly heterogeneous across elevations in summer but relatively uniform in winter when grass and leaves are mostly withering this finding explains the leptokurtic pattern of the matching score in contrast the image patterns of p are entirely different from those of dem indicating that p is largely controlled by regional climate conditions other than local topography not coincidentally the matching scores in this study area are significantly related to the roles of the predictors discussed in section 3 4 the similarity issue discussed above is critical to the fusion of spatiotemporal data by computer vision most of the present high resolution atmospheric forcing data and remote sensing products are interpolated downscaled or assimilated from station based observations and coarse raw imagery referring to topographic indices kilibarda et al 2014 consequently these data fields must have a certain degree of similarity with the dem in the framework of the cv the similarity may imply overlapping information within the extracted feature vectors if the similarity between a predictor and the dem is high it is preferable not to consider the dem as a direct input because the overlapping or redundant information may cause numerical difficulties which should be eschewed in machine learning peng et al 2017 even in a universal cv based model for pub wherein a large number of watersheds are trained simultaneously and the dem feature vector is no longer constant throughout it is still unwise to regard the dem as a direct predictor for the same reason overall the above findings suggest that a similarity analysis should be a preceding step for computer vision based modeling if a high similarity is identified among various input data fields excluding certain data fields might be beneficial to the numerical stability of the model the exclusion does not necessarily mean that the data fields e g dem in this study case are not important 3 6 potential improvements the computer vision model while performing well in the case study could be further improved by using more advanced algorithms one example is the feature extraction algorithm this study selects texture and intensity as the features to represent an image which is a handcrafted and subjective strategy this strategy is a type of shallow learning from the perspective of computer science especially for its selection of feature descriptors and the involved parameters shallow learning has a limited capacity for processing raw data and relies heavily on the extracted features lecun et al 2015 recently deep learning has been shown to be capable of extracting useful features from various datasets via a cascade of hierarchically arranged layers of nonlinear processing units offering an attractive alternative for representing meteorological and ecological data fields in data driven hydrological modeling however deep learning has not been employed in many applications in the field of hydrology marçais and de dreuzy 2017 examining the power of deep learning in the proposed framework appears to be an interesting research topic the ann models and their training method may also be improved by referring to recent advances related to hydrological modeling for example wu and chau 2006 proposed a novel hybrid model that integrates the genetic algorithm with an ann model for flood forecasting the hybrid ga based ann model can produce better accuracy in performance than conventional ann models taormina et al 2015 utilized binary coded swarm optimization for the identification of the filter parameters and neural network structure in streamflow modeling fotovatikhah et al 2018 reviewed existing hybrid models that combine soft computing evolutionary algorithms and machine learning algorithms in flood management using the advanced ann models may further enhance the performance of the cv and deserves further study 4 conclusions this study develops a new approach to data driven hydrological modeling the approach adopts a computer vision technique to effectively exploit the spatial information contained in time variant input data fields and seamlessly fuses the multisource information via machine learning with this new approach a cv is developed to simulate the streamflow of a mountainous watershed in the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau a series of numerical experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the cv in comparison to the performances of two existing data driven models an lm and an sd the major findings of this study are as follows first the cv represents a general framework with which to fuse multisource spatiotemporal data for hydrological modeling and has a great potential to incorporate fast growing environmental big data e g various remote sensing data and high resolution weather data the cv avoids the complicated and case dependent operations of data processing and structure configuration required by existing process based or data driven hydrological models and can also readily utilize any spatiotemporal data as its inputs as long as the data are correlated with the target output variable second in this study the cv performs well in short term forecasting long term simulation and transfer learning for short term forecasting the cv has a higher prediction accuracy and robustness than do the lm and sd when the forecasting lead time exceeds one day for long term simulation the cv uses much less data than do existing process based models to achieve a comparable or even better performance for transfer learning the cv outperforms the lm especially in reproducing flow peaks and is promising for addressing pub third because of its flexibility in fusing multisource spatiotemporal data the cv enables a systematic analysis of the roles of different predictors in the cold mountainous area studied the peak flow is mainly controlled by p and t the baseflow is significantly impacted by t and the average water yield is highly correlated with the lai in addition historical streamflow plays an important role in predicting future peak flows finally although topographic information is not included as a model input in this study its impact is embodied well by other inputs e g temperature due to the similarities between those data fields and the dem the implication is that if a high similarity is identified among various input data fields it may be desirable to exclude certain data fields in order to achieve numerical stability of the data driven model overall this study represents the first step in a promising direction towards the use of computer vision in hydrological modeling while the proposed modeling framework is general the key algorithms of feature extraction and machine learning adopted in this study could be further improved by referring to recent advances in related areas moreover many exciting associated research problems deserve further exploration one next step is to develop more accurate data driven models for pub if the environmental big data of all gauged basins worldwide could be obtained for one day a universal computer vision strategy for pub could be built using cutting edge deep learning technologies ai advances in other fields such as natural language video description advances support this possibility in addition data driven real time hydrological forecasting at the global scale represents another important research problem

6876,the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra jamuna river basin further referred to as brahmaputra river basin is one of the most important river systems in south asia it originates on the tibetan plateau and links bangladesh bhutan china and india despite being an important river system of south asia with an immense potential for regional development very little progress has been made so far at regional level to manage this transboundary river apart from stereotypical upstream downstream syndromes a lack of trust an atmosphere of hostility and an asymmetric information and power situation as also the absence of regional principles or frameworks make transboundary interaction between the brahmaputra riparian countries complex and challenging the lack of information and knowledge regarding the river itself makes decision making further complicated negotiation for a basin wide treaty on cooperation in the absence of trust is a non starter for the brahmaputra basin for it may result in asymmetric cooperation opening up ground for future conflicts to avoid such asymmetric cooperation information rich multilateral informal dialogues need to take place to develop an accepted definition of cooperation which meets the needs of all riparian states the article provides an outline of the current issues in the brahmaputra river basin and illustrates the need for multitrack and multi stakeholder dialogues in the brahmaputra region the paper is inspired by the brahmaputra dialogue project initiated in 2013 that demonstrates that water diplomacy has to be an inclusive open and transparent process involving multiple actors because such interaction facilitates sustainable water cooperation not only between riparian countries but also between riparian communities keywords water diplomacy transboundary cooperation brahmaputra river basin multi stakeholder dialogues 1 introduction the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra jamuna river basin further referred to as brahmaputra river

drainage area of 580 000 km2 and empties into the bay of bengal ray et al 2015 it is shared between four countries china 50 5 of the total basin area india 33 6 bangladesh 8 1 and bhutan 7 8 in spite of being an important river system of south asia with an immense potential for regional development very little progress has been made so far at regional level to manage this transboundary river to date no international treaty exists for the management of the brahmaputra basin involving all the four basin countries there are a few bilateral agreements or memoranda of understanding mous which had been devised to address specific water related issues such as flood forecasting and data sharing any agreement on the brahmaputra related to a basin wide management of the river has been difficult to negotiate since there is no multilateral regional platform for such a discussion to take place the river is also inseparably linked with regional politics which are dynamic and keep evolving thereby opening or closing windows of opportunities for cooperation since the brahmaputra is particularly politically sensitive it has led to a securitisation 1 refers to requiring a remedy to protect a resource i e to securitise it in national interest like dam building to capture water resource allan and mirumachi 2010 1 of water and a certain inaccessibility of even basic information about the river including stream and sediment flow water withdrawal and usage surie and prasai 2015 this has created an atmosphere of mistrust hostility and suspicion between the riparian countries hindering cooperative water sharing initiatives at basin level more than 100 million people live in the brahmaputra basin most of them farmers the economic structure of the region is highly water dependent with a vast majority of the people depending for their livelihoods on agriculture livestock forestry fisheries and industries textile handloom and apparel located on the river bank the river is the primary water source for the basin communities many of whom are mired in chronic poverty yet the potential of the brahmaputra river basin brb for poverty reducing is immense the river provides opportunities for irrigation development livelihood enhancement and operations such as inland water navigation and hydropower development barua vij and zulfiqur rahman 2017 proponents of this view believe that the benefits foregone by the four countries by not using the water as an engine for economic and regional development have been very substantial verghese 1990 2007 particularly considering the extensive and abject poverty in all these basin countries biswas 2011 but those who contest this view argue that current dominant modes of development especially development of hydropower and river linking projects are risky unsustainable and inequitable also they are unjust socially ecologically and economically barua and vij 2018 dore 2014 the absence of an authoritative reliable and comprehensive network of scientific information about the basin biswas 2011 further complicates decision making particularly related to water infrastructure development in the region this has been leading to questionable outcomes and creating suspicion and mistrust between riparian communities all transboundary cooperation as selby 2003 2013 and zeitoun and warner 2006 observe is not always a good thing in most cases such cooperation is skewed and will benefit only the powerful riparians cooperation through asymmetric treaties like for the nile jordan ganges has become a source of conflict rather than of cooperation cascao and zeitoun 2010 therefore negotiation for a treaty for cooperation in the absence of trust and without recognising the power asymmetry between riparians is a non starter for the brb for it may result in asymmetric cooperation and may open up ground for conflicts to avoid such asymmetric cooperation information rich multilateral dialogues need to take place to develop an accepted definition of cooperation which meets the needs of co riparian states in the case of transboundary water conflict and cooperation are not mutually exclusive they operate in continuum sadoff and grey 2005 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 therefore such multilateral dialogues and deliberations also help understand who and what drives cooperation between states hence it may be argued that the absence of a regional level treaty for the brb is precisely an opportunity for multilateral and multi stakeholder water diplomacy to construct a path to more effective transboundary water cooperation in the future this article provides an outline of the current issues in the brb and illustrates the need for multitrack and multi stakeholder dialogues in the brahmaputra region it is inspired by the brahmaputra dialogue project initiated in 2013 by saciwaters a non governmental organisation based in india involving the four riparian countries of the brb the article is structured in five sections after the introduction section the second section discusses the relevance of water diplomacy in the context of transboundary water cooperation section three provides an outline of the current issues in the brb section four drawing from the brahmaputra dialogue process illustrates the need for multitrack and multi stakeholder dialogues in the brahmaputra region for regional cooperation in brahmaputra basin the conclusion is presented in section five 2 water diplomacy and transboundary waters water resource planning and management has become increasingly complex due to natural social and political networks attached to water and competing interests of different groups hossain 2013 when water is shared by two or more sovereign states it further complicates the situation as the potential and incentive for each sovereign state to cooperate vary widely when negotiation for cooperation takes place undermining these differences between riparian countries it often leads to a zero sum problem i e one party s loss is another s gain water diplomacy recognises this inherent limitation of current practices in water sharing negotiations and advocate a non zero sum approach i e a situation where both parties receive a net gain islam and susskind 2013 water diplomacy is not about negotiating on conflict issues rather it helps establish relationships to re build trust between conflict prone parties in doing so it helps prevent further conflicts and make change more sustainable wehrenfennig 2016 on a transboundary level water diplomacy is most often used to prevent conflict escalation and to improve cooperation huntjens and de man 2017 it helps in communicating at different levels and between different parties representatives of states civil society academia etc in establishing connections and in building trust it may include formal or informal dialogues between high level diplomatic delegations of riparian states or developing people to people relationships at grassroots level it is a dynamic process that seeks to develop reasonable sustainable and peaceful solutions to water allocation and management while promoting or influencing regional cooperation and collaboration huntjens et al 2015 while traditionally diplomacy is defined as high level interaction and dialogue between nation states in the present context the definition has broadened to include various other levels as well wehrenfennig 2016 track 1 diplomacy official traditional diplomacy dialogues between officials which mostly include politicians and high ranking military personnel in a nation state centred perspective track 1 5 diplomacy diplomatic initiatives that are facilitated by unofficial bodies but directly involve officials from the conflict in question nan 2005 p 165 track 2 diplomacy as defined by montville 1991 p 162 is unofficial informal interaction between members of adversary groups or nations who can interact more freely than high ranking officials aim to develop strategies to influence public opinion organize human and material resources in ways that might help resolve their conflict track 3 diplomacy people to people diplomacy undertaken by individuals and private groups to encourage interaction and understanding between hostile communities and involving awareness raising and empowerment within these communities in transboundary contexts due to the complexity related to allocation and management of water resources a track 1 diplomacy alone is not sufficient to bring about cooperation among sovereign states while track 1 diplomacy has the ability to use political power to influence the direction of negotiations and outcomes sanders 1991 the conflict resolution approaches are corrupted by power the power asymmetry between riparian countries makes track 1 diplomacy a liability to durable peace rather than a facilitating tool mapendere 2008 there is also a level of secrecy maintained during track 1 dialogues and interactions because officials cannot speak against their countries interests this acts as an obstacle to open discussion and dialogues leading to speculation as also to undermining issues important to the weaker party track 2 diplomacy tries to include more people influential academic religious and ngo leaders and other civil society actors than just the figureheads in governments it is more concerned with re establishing relationships between the parties to the conflict than bargaining over specifics wahrenfennig 2016 it may also be described as informal discussions between government and non government stakeholders facilitated by a neutral third party hanasz 2017 as dore 2014 points out track 2 refers to state civil society interactive forums that have emerged as complementary or parallel forums to track 1 which generally aim to enhance the effectiveness of state processes track 3 diplomacy aims to bring together the voices and concerns of riparian communities through dialogues and interactions for improved local governance these are mostly unofficial dialogue and problem solving activities which aim at building relationships and encouraging new thinking that can guide the official process these approaches are mostly supplements to or extensions of existing state diplomacy track 1 wehrenfennig 2016 track 1 5 is important because it complements track 1 and track 2 and its representatives fill in the gap between the two tracks mapendere 2008 particularly when a direct high level approach is not possible it facilitates communication between leaders where for historical reasons or some conflicting situation formal communication between the parties is not appreciated or just not feasible when these different levels of diplomacy are activated simultaneously it is known as multitrack diplomacy dore 2007 this incorporates all aspects of mediation from ground level work of private citizens to top level meetings of state heads this is because multitrack diplomacy recognises that political power is not concentrated only in a national government instead it is shared across multiple levels with multiple actors smith 1999 while a track 2 dialogue aims to build trust between riparian countries primarily through information exchange the absence of trust between riparians and a lack of political will often undermine that effort hanasz 2017 as a consequence the outcome of such linear diplomacy is often uncertain and unpredictable multitrack diplomacy as an extension of tracks 1 2 and 3 diplomacy by utilising all levels of society helps determine the needs and facilitate communication between all these levels diamond and mcdonald 1996 multitrack diplomacy efforts could be led by a government or by a third party professional organisations businesses religious bodies media private citizens training and educational institutes activists and donors for transboundary river basins a shift of gear from formal to informal multitrack diplomacy has started to gain importance because such diplomacy allows debate and discussion which helps bring about reasonable and well informed opinions such deliberative processes make water governance fairer and more effective also helps reducing power imbalances among stakeholders making negotiations transparent and informed dore 2014 3 the brahmaputra river basin 3 1 the brahmaputra river basin and geopolitics brahmaputra has a total length of 2880 km with a drainage area of around 573 394 square kilometres rahaman and varis 2009 see fig 1 of the 1350 billion cubic metres bcm annually discharged by the ganges yarlung zangbo brahmaputra meghna river basin the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river contributes approximately 700 bcm liu 2015 the annual flow of water from china to india is 165 4 bcm from bhutan tributaries 2 three main tributaries originating in bhutan join the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river in india negi 1991 2 to india 78 bcm and from india to bangladesh 537 24 bcm liu 2015 the basin is rich in biodiversity as well as ethnic diversity it has a varied terrain and climate with a high seasonal variability of river flow the river is highly dynamic and unpredictable and also susceptible to sudden channel migration and avulsion making it a highly complex water system ray et al 2015 source institute of water modelling bangladesh like other south asian rivers the brahmaputra is inseparably linked with the regional politics involving four riparian countries unequal in both size and power all these riparians are in various stages of development with a major portion of their population living below the poverty line each riparian therefore has national priorities with regard to the waters of the brahmaputra for china the river provides economic and energy opportunities but compared with other transboundary watercourses in china the yarlung zangbo is not much developed liu 2015 things are likely to change there however prompted by a growing demand for clean energy for example the zangmu hydroelectric power station put into operation on 23 november 2015 became the first mega hydroelectric power station on the mainstream of the yarlung zangbo river india today 2014 china s 12th five year plan of energy development approved three more dams on this river on 1 january 2013 government of the people s republic of china 2013 china is also working on an ambitious south north water transfer project involving the brahmaputra india s main domestic considerations are hydroelectricity flood erosion sediment control and integration of the isolated north east of india into the rest of the country through local development by harnessing the potential of the brahmaputra river barua and vij 2018 to increase food production and meet the needs of the population india is interested in transferring major quantities of water from the brahmaputra to drier more populous areas of the country ray et al 2015 to that effect the government had proposed the national river linking project nrlp which would divert water from the brahmaputra to the ganges liu 2015 the river basin is also a major source of hydropower for india since more than 40 66 000 mw of the total hydropower potential of the country is lying within the basin rahaman and varis 2009 however as the middle riparian in the basin india perceives these hydropower development projects as under threat from upper riparian china india fears that china s hydropower and river diversion plans will reduce the flow of water downstream which would potentially bring economic and environmental losses to india the upper riparian is seen as unilateral in its action particularly related to hydropower development and unforthcoming in terms of sharing of information ho 2014 for bangladesh the brahmaputra is the lifeline to a large section of its population nayak and panda 2016 however it is faced with multiple threats including riverbank erosion sedimentation annual floods and diminished water flow and groundwater availability in the dry season barua and vij 2018 this means that bangladesh s main domestic challenges encompass managing the physical impacts of the river nishat and faisal 2000 samaranayake et al 2016 it also sees water infrastructure development plans from india and china as a threat to its water resource as the most downstream country bangladesh is a strong proponent of regional and international cooperation on water issues and frequently enters into bilateral agreements with other countries as well as international and regional organisations liu 2015 the only example of cooperation in the brahmaputra basin considered to be a symbiotic positive relation in water related developments has been the one between bhutan and india biswas 2011 by cooperating with india in the construction of hydropower projects since 1974 bhutan has been able to create large amounts of government revenue from this economic resource liu 2015 it also indicates that bhutan embarked upon a very different path compared to the other riparians to develop its transboundary water bodies by collaborating with its southern neighbour india the arrangement has also been beneficial to india because of its growing demand for energy biswas 2011 the understanding of benefit from the brahmaputra river varies between the four sovereign states of the basin likewise the incentives to cooperate while each country realises the potential the river provides for economic development the benefits are seen through very localised and sectoral lenses this triggers tension and disputes within as well as between the riparian countries further suspicion distrust and the absence of properly formulated negotiating frameworks have resulted in very little effective communication between the co riparian countries discussions are going on among political leaders and other stakeholders for co operation on water management of the brahmaputra basin yet very little progress has actually been made till date bandyopadhyay 2002 wirsing and jasparro 2007 ray et al 2015 these discussions are also often conflated on account of larger territorial and political issues between china and india 3 for example india suspects that china claims the north eastern state of arunachal pradesh to get access to its rich water resources ho 2014 3 moreover unlike in other international river basins in the brahmaputra basin there is no institutional mechanism in place to address the issue of water management at river basin level bandyopadhyay 2002 while so far there is no visible water conflict in the basin in the absence of a regional level mechanism significant international conflicts are possible there 3 2 regional initiatives over the brahmaputra river the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc established in the 1980s provides a multilateral forum for discussion among the south asian countries however the most heated ones particularly water resource negotiations were excluded from its brief at the start crow and singh 2009 moreover the saarc does not include china the most important upper riparian of the brb besides other track i government to government initiatives like those between bangladesh bhutan india and nepal bbin and the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation bimstec do not involve all the brahmaputra basin countries this points to a lack of communication at track 1 level over the river involving all its riparian countries a few modest steps to cooperate over the brb have been taken by india bangladesh bhutan and china at bilateral level such as liu 2015 india china data sharing expert level mechanism emergency response india bangladesh joint water committee data sharing navigation ongoing process for teesta agreement bangladesh china data sharing india bhutan cooperation through hydropower these bilateral treaties address specific aspects particularly flood management of the broader issue of integrated water management barua vij and zulfiqur rahman 2017 that are also largely localised they do not have a basin wide approach there are also no mechanisms to settle disputes and differences between two governments thus making the overall scope of these bilateral cooperation shallow the legal reach of an mou is limited mostly to sharing of specific data only liu 2015 a few track ii and track iii cooperation initiatives have been taken led by non state actors their approach has been either bilateral or multilateral they are the ecosystem for life cooperation initiated by the international union of conservation of nature iucn the brahmaputra dialogue initiated by saciwaters the abu dhabi dialogue and the south asia water initiative led by the world bank a collaboration of scientists in international centre for integrated mountain development icimod with special reference to the brahmaputra salween landscape among the above mentioned four initiatives the one directly related to the brahmaputra river basin is the brahmaputra dialogue which involves all the four basin countries the rest of the initiatives does not cover the entire basin and the diplomacy is not limited to the brb only for example the ecosystem for life includes india and bangladesh bilateral forum and focuses on the whole ganga brahmaputra and meghna basin area gbm basin the abu dhabi dialogue was between the seven countries that share the rivers of the greater himalayas namely afghanistan bangladesh bhutan china india nepal and pakistan the salween brahmaputra landscape initiative was collaboration between india china and myanmar to develop a framework for cooperation and common understanding on transboundary landscape issues barua and vij 2018 this scenario of predominantly bilateral negotiations had been based mainly on domestic considerations of each riparian country in the basin yet a few discursive processes had been initiated as a means of building multilateral inter state cooperation the brahmaputra dialogue is the relevant case in point it is an initiative in multitrack and multilateral diplomacy engaging all four brahmaputra riparians to develop a framework for cooperation at basin level in the next section an analysis of the bd process is given then the observations are compared with similar processes in other river basins to provide informed conclusions about the achievements so far in the brahmaputra basin 4 multi track water diplomacy for the brahmaputra river basin 4 1 the brahmaputra dialogue in 2013 saciwaters initiated a multitrack interaction process in a project titled transboundary policy dialogue for improved water governance in brahmaputra river further known as the brahmaputra dialogue bd this dialogue provided a neutral platform for effective interaction between academicians policy makers ngos media csos and other relevant stakeholders from the brahmaputra basin countries the idea was to arrive at a mutual understanding of what issues were at stake how these might be framed and how to identify the key questions around them the approach was to start with a non formal co operative arrangement which could develop into a more formal type over time as confidence would be built and as and when the political leadership would be ready samaranayake et al 2016 4 2 the framework for multitrack diplomacy in brb the dialogues under the bd project have been and are conducted in interactive workshops these workshops are designed in such a way to give opportunities to participants to ask questions seek clarifications discuss assumptions and examine arguments this way there is space and time to deal with contested knowledge claims as also to explore alternatives huntjens et al 2015 along with multi stakeholder dialogues semi structured interviews closed door interactions and key informant meetings take place with key stakeholders to understand the nature and causes of conflict as well as cooperation options among the different stakeholders key informant meetings with stakeholders include both individual interviews and focused group discussions the data are recorded through audio recorders or written notes with the consent of participants the interviews are interactive and are based on an unstructured questionnaire barua and vij 2018 the dialogue workshops are conducted at two levels country level and regional level the country level workshop is first conducted it is meant to understand a particular concern at country level later these concerns are discussed at regional level in the presence of representatives of the riparian countries country level workshops are particularly important for india because water is a state subject here it has been recognised in india since long that the river basin should be the unit of regional planning and development this is also recognised in the national water policy of india but states have substantive power over water resources this has frequently led to interstate conflicts the brahmaputra enters india through the state of arunachal pradesh and flows through the state of assam before entering bangladesh in both states there are large communities who depend upon the river for their social and economic needs this has led to inter state conflicts regarding the sharing of water the cost of these conflicts and the cost of failing to focus on the entire river basin are rising rapidly as water scarcity increases e g booker 1995 gundimeda and howe 2008 the cost due to lack of coordinated planning will only grow if states do not come together to develop a common goal and vision for the river which can then be taken up at transboundary basin scale while in the other riparian countries of the brahmaputra basin there are no such inter state disputes country level workshops were organised to get the views of diverse groups of stakeholders this gave an opportunity to those usually left out from formal decision making processes the brahmaputra dialogue was implemented in three phases the first phase in 2013 2014 the second in 2014 2015 and the third phase in 2015 2017 as shown in fig 2 the first phase 2013 2014 started with a bilateral approach involving only india and bangladesh the track 3 mode was the entry point for the bd and so the first phase mostly focused on people to people diplomacy between india and bangladesh while recognising the role that csos ngos and local communities can play in decision making it became clear in this phase to the parties involved that the capacity of csos to participate in policy formulation implementation monitoring and evaluation was a challenge due to this lack of capacity they were usually left out from formal decision making in transboundary water management this was particularly true for marginalised communities and women there was also a problem of governments accepting civil society as a strategic and knowledge partner and acknowledging it can act as a successful intermediary between the state and the people with particular regard to the brahmaputra basin there is a sense of distrust and misperception between the state and csos hence building trust between the state and non state actors and developing capacity to participate in transboundary dialogues was identified as the most important tasks accordingly a workshop was designed to build the capacity of track 3 stakeholders to participate in multi stakeholder dialogues country level workshops were conducted in both india and bangladesh followed by a joint dialogue meeting it was organised to bring track 3 representatives from the two countries on a single platform for interaction and deliberation on issues of common interest the workshops helped raise awareness on rights and legalities related to transboundary water management improve communication and negotiation skills and enhance their knowledge about the river through expert consultation the workshops conducted in the first phase of the dialogue are listed in table 1 the second phase 2014 2015 of the dialogue moved from a bilateral to a multilateral approach with the involvement of china and bhutan as well see table 2 in this phase the dialogue moved from a track 3 to a track 2 mode the structure of the workshops was intended to remain the same country level workshops followed by regional level dialogues but in this phase country level workshops were conducted only in india and bangladesh with plans to expand them to china and bhutan in the next phase in the second phase the informal nature of track 2 diplomacy enabled a dialogue between state and non state actors it provided a space to scientists to disseminate findings of their research to both sides for a better understanding of this complex river system in the dialogue workshops it transpired that researchers water practitioners and managers have made substantial analyses to understand the dynamics and potential of this mighty river yet significant knowledge gaps remain with respect to the system and to sustainable approaches to the most productive use of the rich water resources while simultaneously reigning in their destructive forces strengthening the evidence base and enhancing a shared understanding of the system would foster more strategic and cooperative planning across administrative and sectoral boundaries as well as multiple disciplines in this context the need for developing a reliable comprehensive and common knowledge base for the brahmaputra basin was recognised by all workshop participants these dialogues at country and regional level also helped develop personal relationships between stakeholders due to the frank and open exchanges the dialogue workshops in most cases followed a problem solving approach where participants discussed various issues related to the management of the river the issues identified were managing disasters like flood drought and erosion navigation as an entry point for cooperation and the downstream environmental impact of water infrastructure projects some stakeholders also felt that important opportunities for cross learning from other basins facing similar challenges floods erosion sedimentation should be availed of through knowledge exchange and international study tours in the third phase 2015 2017 the brahmaputra dialogue expanded its reach to bhutan and china by organising country consultation meetings in both countries respectively along with dialogue workshops in india and bangladesh see table 3 phase iii became distinct from phase ii particularly on account of the composition of participants especially decision makers who participated both in country level and regional level meetings in china the dialogue is currently at track 2 level a broad range of officials executives and scholars involved in transboundary decision making attended the meetings in this phase a major challenge identified for the brb was the lack of a nodal institution that could bring stakeholders together to develop joint strategies to manage the basin therefore transboundary cases from other river basins were presented during various workshops to highlight and understand how including the process river basins across the world had arrived at a multilateral agreement other topics covered in the discussion were effective disaster management plans and the viable economic opportunities available along the basin to sustain livelihood and to address poverty and food and energy security in the area the discussion also dealt with issues like limited political will and state sovereignty regarding transboundary river water management it also brought out the importance of the creation of a level playing field and a sustainable institutional framework for dealing with these issues effectively the regional workshop in phase iii was organised in singapore a country outside the region to facilitate a neutral discussion with equal representation of diverse groups of stakeholders from each country this phase ended with a symposium the brahmaputra river symposium which was held in india with representation from the four countries it was the first of its kind for the brahmaputra basin and brought together 150 delegates from across the world to understand and assess the knowledge landscape of the basin and its relationship with policy making to identify key knowledge gaps and ways to strengthen the science policy interface it is important to mention here that during the second and third phases of the bd several meetings bilateral closed door face to face interviews etc had been conducted with government department officials and bureaucrats in india and bangladesh such meetings were meant to inform them about the dialogue process and also to seek their participation in future dialogues 5 discussion 5 1 setting the need for multitrack diplomacy the brahmaputra river basin is under development pressure considering nearly 30 of india s water resources potential and 41 of the country s total hydropower potential are found in this basin crow and singh 2009 the potential of the river to bring economic development has been the subject of at least a decade of discussion between governments of the region but with very little productive outcome on the other hand the river continues to bring disaster through annual flood and drought increasing the livelihood uncertainty and impoverishment of the largest concentration of poor people living around the basin crow 1999 crow and singh 2009 there is nevertheless a growing consensus that development of the region cannot be achieved without water resource development of the brahmaputra river basin there is a community of scholars officials and politicians in south asia who believes that the region s rivers can be better harnessed for economic development through an integrated basin wide approach nishat and faisal 2000 biswas 2011 shrestha grabs and khadgi 2015 ray et al 2015 there is also a growing recognition that such an approach needs to be combined with social economic political cultural and legal considerations along with scientific and technological paradigm baruah 2012 however unlike in other river basins shared by a number of countries there is no institutional mechanism in place in the brahmaputra basin to address the issue of water management at river basin level further there is a lack of scientific knowledge and information about the river basin since it is relatively under researched compared to other river basins of south asia ray et al 2015 notably the lack of a regional framework or information about the river has not come as an obstruction to the planning of the construction of a series of water infrastructure storage projects for this basin particularly in india and china but these plans related to hydropower dams and river linking projects are closely guarded with very limited information in the public domain there is also restricted access to and evaluation of the social and environmental impact of such plans more so the outcomes of such assessments are not shared with the affected communities leading to a lack of trust among the basin communities across the brb bandyopadhyay and ghosh 2009 so far not many large dam projects have been built in the brahmaputra basin but major projects like those in the tributaries of brahmaputra dihang and subansiri are under construction in india to be sure such large storage projects raise questions of social and ecological sustainability and the economic viability of the investments bandyopadhyay 2002 dore 2014 recently differences of opinion have emerged in two groups within the region proponents and opponents of water development projects the proponents mostly water resource experts believe that these water development infrastructures will enable the region to enjoy rapid economic development the opponents see this as a reductionist view since it does not consider the social and environmental impacts of such infrastructure projects bandyopadhyay and ghosh 2009 while probably the intentions of both groups are good the problem is there is very little communication between them in a wider context there is no platform within or between countries where meaningful exchanges of opinion can take place this has resulted in further miscommunication and suspicion leading to public agitation and unrest baruah 2012 as a result the lack of dialogue interaction and engagement has resulted in tension and friction within as well as among the co riparian nations of the brb as also mistrust at political level cooperative arrangements for transboundary waters are usually an outcome of long drawn processes that include dialogues and negotiations between the riparian countries mostly involving track 1 diplomacy however the cooperation resulting from such formal diplomacy efforts is seen as a zero sum outcome it is realised more and more that these dialogues and negotiations should happen at multiple levels and involving multiple stakeholders for example in the case of the nile river basin proponents argue that the nile basin initiative s nbi emphasis on a formal government level diplomacy approach to negotiation on the nile waters is not solving the stalemate in that basin barua and vij 2018 they insist that multitrack diplomacy should be employed to build confidence among the basin states and their peoples hefny 2011 for the mekong participatory governance and active engagement through multitrack diplomacy and dialogue involving all relevant stakeholders had become a prominent proposal for better management of the mekong river basin keo 2002 hensengerth 2009 dore 2014 as dore 2014 notes the regional track 1 governance in the mekong is struggling to equitably or effectively bring about far reaching regional change mainly because of the dominance of national interests hirsch and jensen 2006 suhardiman giordano and molle 2012 therefore to lift the quality of the mekong basin development negotiations there is a need for multitrack and multi stakeholder platforms warner 2005 dore 2014 in the case of the jordan river basin swain et al 2016 highlighted the need for multitrack water diplomacy to promote a more effectively shared utilisation of the water among riparians of the lower part of the jordan river these authors argue that while multitrack diplomacy is no substitute whatsoever for formal diplomacy such diplomacy helps manage increasing degrees of variety and variability in transboundary water management it also helps bring a plurality of views and diversity of perceptions to the table of discussion this in turn is hoped to bring more integrated and sustainable outcomes as warner 2005 puts it once people see the sense of involving multiple voices it is felt they will be broadly accepted as the way forward in dealing with the increasing complexity diversity and dynamics of water management traditional water diplomacy government to government has fallen short in south asia too barua and vij 2018 there have been cases e g the mahakali treaty between india and nepal where in spite of long negotiations the treaty became paralysed and undermined due to narrow political interests gyawali and dixit 1999 likewise the indus commission established under the 1960 indus treaty and the indo bangladesh joint rivers commission established in 1972 were a result of track 1 diplomacy yet they are considered the least cooperative institutions for transboundary water management kliot et al 2001 to promote water development projects for transboundary rivers there has to be support not only from all the countries affected by a project but also from the communities within each basin country with the increasing complexity of contemporary issues and time and resource constraints faced by governments a broad range of unofficial contacts and interactions is required to manage and resolve conflicts of transboundary scale nishat and faisal 2000 multi track diplomacy may not necessarily solve problems but they do help disputing parties understand other stakeholders views and interests at least partly warner 2005 thereby helping arrive at a common understanding of cooperation considering past experiences from different river basins multitrack diplomacy for the brahmaputra basin too is felt necessary in the larger interest of the region this diplomacy for the brb will create and support spaces where meaningful conversation can take place among diverse stakeholder groups which is lacking at the moment it can also inform and help shape a track 1 negotiation and decision making process by bringing in a wider range of perspectives on needs impacts and options and having them deliberated openly huntjens et al 2015 trust is seen as the cornerstone for cooperation but it is not something that can be easily developed or managed huntjens and de man 2017 to develop trust and confidence between the riparian countries of the brahmaputra there has to be long term interaction and communication between different actors these should include non traditional stakeholders such as the business sector media and funding institutions and marginalised groups women in particular the brahmaputra dialogue is a modest step toward this goal 5 2 outcome of the brahmaputra dialogue process dialogue in transboundary context needs a conscious effort across many years as evident from the cases of the nile mekong jordan indus and ganges rivers single track diplomacy often fails to provide space for diversity of perceptions and plurality of views lack of public involvement and secrecy around negotiations often heighten scepticism islam and susskind 2013 and could upset development plans of the region to avoid such scepticism a need for multitrack diplomacy was felt for the brb the bd process not only provided a platform for civil society and media to engage more productively but also helped government representatives take the edge off misconceptions of grassroot organisations and reduce the circulation of misinformation on the basin this happened particularly so in the country level workshops in india related to hydropower dams and the regional level dialogue held in singapore in short the bd platform bringing together multiple stakeholders with very different perspectives provided a space to discuss issues challenges and opportunities related to the brb at the same time it is important to note that although for each stakeholder cooperation could have a different meaning the drivers of cooperation need not necessarily be mutually exclusive in fact they complement each other for that reason already multitrack diplomacy would be handy for a dialogue project it is extremely difficult to quantify the achievements nevertheless some outputs of the bd in the last four years may be outlined the dialogues have been able to create a platform space for multi stakeholders across the four riparian countries to meet and talk once every year from 2013 onward in spite of arguments contestations confrontations and debates between participants the dialogue process has helped understand how each country approaches transboundary water management and cooperation the dialogues have been able to generate a willingness at multiple levels to continue the dialogue by recognising the merit and credibility of such a neutral platform particularly with respect to a trust deficit area like the brb the willingness shown by the dialogue participants have also helped attract donors interest in funding the process the bd is funded under the sawi program 4 the south asian water initiative funded by the world bank has been supporting this project since 2014 and has committed to support the project till 2019 before the world bank between 2012 and 2014 the asia foundation supported the project 4 and helped realise such sustained dialogue processes are important steps toward building trust and confidence among multiple stakeholders the workshops have been able to improve the quality of dialogue by building capacity at different levels particularly during the interaction between track 2 and track 3 participants and have also enabled participants to identify joint research themes 5 the iit guwahati india the yunan university china and institute of modelling bangladesh are working together since 2016 in a research project titled water resources vulnerability and security assessment of yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra transboundary river basin the project is funded by the national natural science foundation of china and is one of the major outcomes of the dialogue the iit guwahati and yunan university also signed an mou in september 2017 for academic collaboration and exchange 5 for robust evidence including socio economic and policy research the four years of brahmaputra dialogue workshops have opened up arenas of discussion which were usually closed to key stakeholders and they also helped give attention to arenas that were open but had been considered irrelevant to decision making till then the bd is not devoid of challenges one major challenge is generating political willingness to cooperate because political commitment is crucial for any transboundary cooperation but as politics take the centre stage the transboundary dialogue becomes complex and extremely challenging further there is always the risk of a change in political leadership and the efforts made in generating willingness at the political level track 1 may not lead to fruition after all while tracks 2 and 3 diplomacy play a crucial role in influencing political decision making they function within limitations and are not party to the final decisions consequently the track 1 5 engagement enables an understanding of the political dynamics of each riparian country so that an informed move may be made towards engaging track 1 in due course of time trust is the cornerstone of transboundary cooperation but trust cannot be built overnight it needs long term interaction between parties the brahmaputra dialogue may be seen as the first step towards building such trust since it has provided a safe place where openness and cooperation are stimulated and reinforced huntjens and de man 2017 but there is a major challenge the availability of financial resources to sustain such a process since the outcome of such dialogue projects cannot be measured quantitatively donors are often hesitant to finance processes without clear outcomes and timelines in this context programmes like sawi have proved useful where one of its objectives is to create trust and confidence in regional or basin water management through dialogue processes 6 conclusion the article discussed the need for multitrack diplomacy because it can act as an essential tool for inclusive governance in the brb while there are signs of cooperation in the basin the current mode of collaboration is mostly issue based and revolves around sharing hydrological data in addition there is a unilateral approach particularly by india and china in managing the brb there is a need for multilateral approaches that are transboundary and have an integrated focus such multilateral engagement may not lead to multilateral cooperation but it may be expected to enhance the scope of the existing cooperation by moving beyond the sharing of data to the joint management of disasters like floods the mistrust suspicion and lack of communication between riparian countries and riparian communities make track 1 diplomacy complicated in the brb the brahmaputra dialogue is probably the first sustained multitrack and multilateral effort especially developed to build trust and confidence within and between the countries sharing the basin there is no doubt that development of the water resources of the brb will play an important role in poverty alleviation and raising the living standards of the basin communities in the present situation a major challenge is that brb countries are vastly different in terms of socio economic development and environmental status this diversity gives rise to differences in overall perspective incentives to cooperate and the choice of negotiating strategies all this is making cooperation difficult the multitrack diplomacy approach for the brb as in the brahmaputra dialogue offers an innovative way to overcome such obstacles

6876,the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra jamuna river basin further referred to as brahmaputra river basin is one of the most important river systems in south asia it originates on the tibetan plateau and links bangladesh bhutan china and india despite being an important river system of south asia with an immense potential for regional development very little progress has been made so far at regional level to manage this transboundary river apart from stereotypical upstream downstream syndromes a lack of trust an atmosphere of hostility and an asymmetric information and power situation as also the absence of regional principles or frameworks make transboundary interaction between the brahmaputra riparian countries complex and challenging the lack of information and knowledge regarding the river itself makes decision making further complicated negotiation for a basin wide treaty on cooperation in the absence of trust is a non starter for the brahmaputra basin for it may result in asymmetric cooperation opening up ground for future conflicts to avoid such asymmetric cooperation information rich multilateral informal dialogues need to take place to develop an accepted definition of cooperation which meets the needs of all riparian states the article provides an outline of the current issues in the brahmaputra river basin and illustrates the need for multitrack and multi stakeholder dialogues in the brahmaputra region the paper is inspired by the brahmaputra dialogue project initiated in 2013 that demonstrates that water diplomacy has to be an inclusive open and transparent process involving multiple actors because such interaction facilitates sustainable water cooperation not only between riparian countries but also between riparian communities keywords water diplomacy transboundary cooperation brahmaputra river basin multi stakeholder dialogues 1 introduction the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra jamuna river basin further referred to as brahmaputra river basin is one of the unique river systems of south asia the river is the fourth largest in the world in terms of annual discharge it originates in tibet autonomous region tar of china has a basin drainage area of 580 000 km2 and empties into the bay of bengal ray et al 2015 it is shared between four countries china 50 5 of the total basin area india 33 6 bangladesh 8 1 and bhutan 7 8 in spite of being an important river system of south asia with an immense potential for regional development very little progress has been made so far at regional level to manage this transboundary river to date no international treaty exists for the management of the brahmaputra basin involving all the four basin countries there are a few bilateral agreements or memoranda of understanding mous which had been devised to address specific water related issues such as flood forecasting and data sharing any agreement on the brahmaputra related to a basin wide management of the river has been difficult to negotiate since there is no multilateral regional platform for such a discussion to take place the river is also inseparably linked with regional politics which are dynamic and keep evolving thereby opening or closing windows of opportunities for cooperation since the brahmaputra is particularly politically sensitive it has led to a securitisation 1 refers to requiring a remedy to protect a resource i e to securitise it in national interest like dam building to capture water resource allan and mirumachi 2010 1 of water and a certain inaccessibility of even basic information about the river including stream and sediment flow water withdrawal and usage surie and prasai 2015 this has created an atmosphere of mistrust hostility and suspicion between the riparian countries hindering cooperative water sharing initiatives at basin level more than 100 million people live in the brahmaputra basin most of them farmers the economic structure of the region is highly water dependent with a vast majority of the people depending for their livelihoods on agriculture livestock forestry fisheries and industries textile handloom and apparel located on the river bank the river is the primary water source for the basin communities many of whom are mired in chronic poverty yet the potential of the brahmaputra river basin brb for poverty reducing is immense the river provides opportunities for irrigation development livelihood enhancement and operations such as inland water navigation and hydropower development barua vij and zulfiqur rahman 2017 proponents of this view believe that the benefits foregone by the four countries by not using the water as an engine for economic and regional development have been very substantial verghese 1990 2007 particularly considering the extensive and abject poverty in all these basin countries biswas 2011 but those who contest this view argue that current dominant modes of development especially development of hydropower and river linking projects are risky unsustainable and inequitable also they are unjust socially ecologically and economically barua and vij 2018 dore 2014 the absence of an authoritative reliable and comprehensive network of scientific information about the basin biswas 2011 further complicates decision making particularly related to water infrastructure development in the region this has been leading to questionable outcomes and creating suspicion and mistrust between riparian communities all transboundary cooperation as selby 2003 2013 and zeitoun and warner 2006 observe is not always a good thing in most cases such cooperation is skewed and will benefit only the powerful riparians cooperation through asymmetric treaties like for the nile jordan ganges has become a source of conflict rather than of cooperation cascao and zeitoun 2010 therefore negotiation for a treaty for cooperation in the absence of trust and without recognising the power asymmetry between riparians is a non starter for the brb for it may result in asymmetric cooperation and may open up ground for conflicts to avoid such asymmetric cooperation information rich multilateral dialogues need to take place to develop an accepted definition of cooperation which meets the needs of co riparian states in the case of transboundary water conflict and cooperation are not mutually exclusive they operate in continuum sadoff and grey 2005 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 therefore such multilateral dialogues and deliberations also help understand who and what drives cooperation between states hence it may be argued that the absence of a regional level treaty for the brb is precisely an opportunity for multilateral and multi stakeholder water diplomacy to construct a path to more effective transboundary water cooperation in the future this article provides an outline of the current issues in the brb and illustrates the need for multitrack and multi stakeholder dialogues in the brahmaputra region it is inspired by the brahmaputra dialogue project initiated in 2013 by saciwaters a non governmental organisation based in india involving the four riparian countries of the brb the article is structured in five sections after the introduction section the second section discusses the relevance of water diplomacy in the context of transboundary water cooperation section three provides an outline of the current issues in the brb section four drawing from the brahmaputra dialogue process illustrates the need for multitrack and multi stakeholder dialogues in the brahmaputra region for regional cooperation in brahmaputra basin the conclusion is presented in section five 2 water diplomacy and transboundary waters water resource planning and management has become increasingly complex due to natural social and political networks attached to water and competing interests of different groups hossain 2013 when water is shared by two or more sovereign states it further complicates the situation as the potential and incentive for each sovereign state to cooperate vary widely when negotiation for cooperation takes place undermining these differences between riparian countries it often leads to a zero sum problem i e one party s loss is another s gain water diplomacy recognises this inherent limitation of current practices in water sharing negotiations and advocate a non zero sum approach i e a situation where both parties receive a net gain islam and susskind 2013 water diplomacy is not about negotiating on conflict issues rather it helps establish relationships to re build trust between conflict prone parties in doing so it helps prevent further conflicts and make change more sustainable wehrenfennig 2016 on a transboundary level water diplomacy is most often used to prevent conflict escalation and to improve cooperation huntjens and de man 2017 it helps in communicating at different levels and between different parties representatives of states civil society academia etc in establishing connections and in building trust it may include formal or informal dialogues between high level diplomatic delegations of riparian states or developing people to people relationships at grassroots level it is a dynamic process that seeks to develop reasonable sustainable and peaceful solutions to water allocation and management while promoting or influencing regional cooperation and collaboration huntjens et al 2015 while traditionally diplomacy is defined as high level interaction and dialogue between nation states in the present context the definition has broadened to include various other levels as well wehrenfennig 2016 track 1 diplomacy official traditional diplomacy dialogues between officials which mostly include politicians and high ranking military personnel in a nation state centred perspective track 1 5 diplomacy diplomatic initiatives that are facilitated by unofficial bodies but directly involve officials from the conflict in question nan 2005 p 165 track 2 diplomacy as defined by montville 1991 p 162 is unofficial informal interaction between members of adversary groups or nations who can interact more freely than high ranking officials aim to develop strategies to influence public opinion organize human and material resources in ways that might help resolve their conflict track 3 diplomacy people to people diplomacy undertaken by individuals and private groups to encourage interaction and understanding between hostile communities and involving awareness raising and empowerment within these communities in transboundary contexts due to the complexity related to allocation and management of water resources a track 1 diplomacy alone is not sufficient to bring about cooperation among sovereign states while track 1 diplomacy has the ability to use political power to influence the direction of negotiations and outcomes sanders 1991 the conflict resolution approaches are corrupted by power the power asymmetry between riparian countries makes track 1 diplomacy a liability to durable peace rather than a facilitating tool mapendere 2008 there is also a level of secrecy maintained during track 1 dialogues and interactions because officials cannot speak against their countries interests this acts as an obstacle to open discussion and dialogues leading to speculation as also to undermining issues important to the weaker party track 2 diplomacy tries to include more people influential academic religious and ngo leaders and other civil society actors than just the figureheads in governments it is more concerned with re establishing relationships between the parties to the conflict than bargaining over specifics wahrenfennig 2016 it may also be described as informal discussions between government and non government stakeholders facilitated by a neutral third party hanasz 2017 as dore 2014 points out track 2 refers to state civil society interactive forums that have emerged as complementary or parallel forums to track 1 which generally aim to enhance the effectiveness of state processes track 3 diplomacy aims to bring together the voices and concerns of riparian communities through dialogues and interactions for improved local governance these are mostly unofficial dialogue and problem solving activities which aim at building relationships and encouraging new thinking that can guide the official process these approaches are mostly supplements to or extensions of existing state diplomacy track 1 wehrenfennig 2016 track 1 5 is important because it complements track 1 and track 2 and its representatives fill in the gap between the two tracks mapendere 2008 particularly when a direct high level approach is not possible it facilitates communication between leaders where for historical reasons or some conflicting situation formal communication between the parties is not appreciated or just not feasible when these different levels of diplomacy are activated simultaneously it is known as multitrack diplomacy dore 2007 this incorporates all aspects of mediation from ground level work of private citizens to top level meetings of state heads this is because multitrack diplomacy recognises that political power is not concentrated only in a national government instead it is shared across multiple levels with multiple actors smith 1999 while a track 2 dialogue aims to build trust between riparian countries primarily through information exchange the absence of trust between riparians and a lack of political will often undermine that effort hanasz 2017 as a consequence the outcome of such linear diplomacy is often uncertain and unpredictable multitrack diplomacy as an extension of tracks 1 2 and 3 diplomacy by utilising all levels of society helps determine the needs and facilitate communication between all these levels diamond and mcdonald 1996 multitrack diplomacy efforts could be led by a government or by a third party professional organisations businesses religious bodies media private citizens training and educational institutes activists and donors for transboundary river basins a shift of gear from formal to informal multitrack diplomacy has started to gain importance because such diplomacy allows debate and discussion which helps bring about reasonable and well informed opinions such deliberative processes make water governance fairer and more effective also helps reducing power imbalances among stakeholders making negotiations transparent and informed dore 2014 3 the brahmaputra river basin 3 1 the brahmaputra river basin and geopolitics brahmaputra has a total length of 2880 km with a drainage area of around 573 394 square kilometres rahaman and varis 2009 see fig 1 of the 1350 billion cubic metres bcm annually discharged by the ganges yarlung zangbo brahmaputra meghna river basin the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river contributes approximately 700 bcm liu 2015 the annual flow of water from china to india is 165 4 bcm from bhutan tributaries 2 three main tributaries originating in bhutan join the yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river in india negi 1991 2 to india 78 bcm and from india to bangladesh 537 24 bcm liu 2015 the basin is rich in biodiversity as well as ethnic diversity it has a varied terrain and climate with a high seasonal variability of river flow the river is highly dynamic and unpredictable and also susceptible to sudden channel migration and avulsion making it a highly complex water system ray et al 2015 source institute of water modelling bangladesh like other south asian rivers the brahmaputra is inseparably linked with the regional politics involving four riparian countries unequal in both size and power all these riparians are in various stages of development with a major portion of their population living below the poverty line each riparian therefore has national priorities with regard to the waters of the brahmaputra for china the river provides economic and energy opportunities but compared with other transboundary watercourses in china the yarlung zangbo is not much developed liu 2015 things are likely to change there however prompted by a growing demand for clean energy for example the zangmu hydroelectric power station put into operation on 23 november 2015 became the first mega hydroelectric power station on the mainstream of the yarlung zangbo river india today 2014 china s 12th five year plan of energy development approved three more dams on this river on 1 january 2013 government of the people s republic of china 2013 china is also working on an ambitious south north water transfer project involving the brahmaputra india s main domestic considerations are hydroelectricity flood erosion sediment control and integration of the isolated north east of india into the rest of the country through local development by harnessing the potential of the brahmaputra river barua and vij 2018 to increase food production and meet the needs of the population india is interested in transferring major quantities of water from the brahmaputra to drier more populous areas of the country ray et al 2015 to that effect the government had proposed the national river linking project nrlp which would divert water from the brahmaputra to the ganges liu 2015 the river basin is also a major source of hydropower for india since more than 40 66 000 mw of the total hydropower potential of the country is lying within the basin rahaman and varis 2009 however as the middle riparian in the basin india perceives these hydropower development projects as under threat from upper riparian china india fears that china s hydropower and river diversion plans will reduce the flow of water downstream which would potentially bring economic and environmental losses to india the upper riparian is seen as unilateral in its action particularly related to hydropower development and unforthcoming in terms of sharing of information ho 2014 for bangladesh the brahmaputra is the lifeline to a large section of its population nayak and panda 2016 however it is faced with multiple threats including riverbank erosion sedimentation annual floods and diminished water flow and groundwater availability in the dry season barua and vij 2018 this means that bangladesh s main domestic challenges encompass managing the physical impacts of the river nishat and faisal 2000 samaranayake et al 2016 it also sees water infrastructure development plans from india and china as a threat to its water resource as the most downstream country bangladesh is a strong proponent of regional and international cooperation on water issues and frequently enters into bilateral agreements with other countries as well as international and regional organisations liu 2015 the only example of cooperation in the brahmaputra basin considered to be a symbiotic positive relation in water related developments has been the one between bhutan and india biswas 2011 by cooperating with india in the construction of hydropower projects since 1974 bhutan has been able to create large amounts of government revenue from this economic resource liu 2015 it also indicates that bhutan embarked upon a very different path compared to the other riparians to develop its transboundary water bodies by collaborating with its southern neighbour india the arrangement has also been beneficial to india because of its growing demand for energy biswas 2011 the understanding of benefit from the brahmaputra river varies between the four sovereign states of the basin likewise the incentives to cooperate while each country realises the potential the river provides for economic development the benefits are seen through very localised and sectoral lenses this triggers tension and disputes within as well as between the riparian countries further suspicion distrust and the absence of properly formulated negotiating frameworks have resulted in very little effective communication between the co riparian countries discussions are going on among political leaders and other stakeholders for co operation on water management of the brahmaputra basin yet very little progress has actually been made till date bandyopadhyay 2002 wirsing and jasparro 2007 ray et al 2015 these discussions are also often conflated on account of larger territorial and political issues between china and india 3 for example india suspects that china claims the north eastern state of arunachal pradesh to get access to its rich water resources ho 2014 3 moreover unlike in other international river basins in the brahmaputra basin there is no institutional mechanism in place to address the issue of water management at river basin level bandyopadhyay 2002 while so far there is no visible water conflict in the basin in the absence of a regional level mechanism significant international conflicts are possible there 3 2 regional initiatives over the brahmaputra river the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc established in the 1980s provides a multilateral forum for discussion among the south asian countries however the most heated ones particularly water resource negotiations were excluded from its brief at the start crow and singh 2009 moreover the saarc does not include china the most important upper riparian of the brb besides other track i government to government initiatives like those between bangladesh bhutan india and nepal bbin and the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation bimstec do not involve all the brahmaputra basin countries this points to a lack of communication at track 1 level over the river involving all its riparian countries a few modest steps to cooperate over the brb have been taken by india bangladesh bhutan and china at bilateral level such as liu 2015 india china data sharing expert level mechanism emergency response india bangladesh joint water committee data sharing navigation ongoing process for teesta agreement bangladesh china data sharing india bhutan cooperation through hydropower these bilateral treaties address specific aspects particularly flood management of the broader issue of integrated water management barua vij and zulfiqur rahman 2017 that are also largely localised they do not have a basin wide approach there are also no mechanisms to settle disputes and differences between two governments thus making the overall scope of these bilateral cooperation shallow the legal reach of an mou is limited mostly to sharing of specific data only liu 2015 a few track ii and track iii cooperation initiatives have been taken led by non state actors their approach has been either bilateral or multilateral they are the ecosystem for life cooperation initiated by the international union of conservation of nature iucn the brahmaputra dialogue initiated by saciwaters the abu dhabi dialogue and the south asia water initiative led by the world bank a collaboration of scientists in international centre for integrated mountain development icimod with special reference to the brahmaputra salween landscape among the above mentioned four initiatives the one directly related to the brahmaputra river basin is the brahmaputra dialogue which involves all the four basin countries the rest of the initiatives does not cover the entire basin and the diplomacy is not limited to the brb only for example the ecosystem for life includes india and bangladesh bilateral forum and focuses on the whole ganga brahmaputra and meghna basin area gbm basin the abu dhabi dialogue was between the seven countries that share the rivers of the greater himalayas namely afghanistan bangladesh bhutan china india nepal and pakistan the salween brahmaputra landscape initiative was collaboration between india china and myanmar to develop a framework for cooperation and common understanding on transboundary landscape issues barua and vij 2018 this scenario of predominantly bilateral negotiations had been based mainly on domestic considerations of each riparian country in the basin yet a few discursive processes had been initiated as a means of building multilateral inter state cooperation the brahmaputra dialogue is the relevant case in point it is an initiative in multitrack and multilateral diplomacy engaging all four brahmaputra riparians to develop a framework for cooperation at basin level in the next section an analysis of the bd process is given then the observations are compared with similar processes in other river basins to provide informed conclusions about the achievements so far in the brahmaputra basin 4 multi track water diplomacy for the brahmaputra river basin 4 1 the brahmaputra dialogue in 2013 saciwaters initiated a multitrack interaction process in a project titled transboundary policy dialogue for improved water governance in brahmaputra river further known as the brahmaputra dialogue bd this dialogue provided a neutral platform for effective interaction between academicians policy makers ngos media csos and other relevant stakeholders from the brahmaputra basin countries the idea was to arrive at a mutual understanding of what issues were at stake how these might be framed and how to identify the key questions around them the approach was to start with a non formal co operative arrangement which could develop into a more formal type over time as confidence would be built and as and when the political leadership would be ready samaranayake et al 2016 4 2 the framework for multitrack diplomacy in brb the dialogues under the bd project have been and are conducted in interactive workshops these workshops are designed in such a way to give opportunities to participants to ask questions seek clarifications discuss assumptions and examine arguments this way there is space and time to deal with contested knowledge claims as also to explore alternatives huntjens et al 2015 along with multi stakeholder dialogues semi structured interviews closed door interactions and key informant meetings take place with key stakeholders to understand the nature and causes of conflict as well as cooperation options among the different stakeholders key informant meetings with stakeholders include both individual interviews and focused group discussions the data are recorded through audio recorders or written notes with the consent of participants the interviews are interactive and are based on an unstructured questionnaire barua and vij 2018 the dialogue workshops are conducted at two levels country level and regional level the country level workshop is first conducted it is meant to understand a particular concern at country level later these concerns are discussed at regional level in the presence of representatives of the riparian countries country level workshops are particularly important for india because water is a state subject here it has been recognised in india since long that the river basin should be the unit of regional planning and development this is also recognised in the national water policy of india but states have substantive power over water resources this has frequently led to interstate conflicts the brahmaputra enters india through the state of arunachal pradesh and flows through the state of assam before entering bangladesh in both states there are large communities who depend upon the river for their social and economic needs this has led to inter state conflicts regarding the sharing of water the cost of these conflicts and the cost of failing to focus on the entire river basin are rising rapidly as water scarcity increases e g booker 1995 gundimeda and howe 2008 the cost due to lack of coordinated planning will only grow if states do not come together to develop a common goal and vision for the river which can then be taken up at transboundary basin scale while in the other riparian countries of the brahmaputra basin there are no such inter state disputes country level workshops were organised to get the views of diverse groups of stakeholders this gave an opportunity to those usually left out from formal decision making processes the brahmaputra dialogue was implemented in three phases the first phase in 2013 2014 the second in 2014 2015 and the third phase in 2015 2017 as shown in fig 2 the first phase 2013 2014 started with a bilateral approach involving only india and bangladesh the track 3 mode was the entry point for the bd and so the first phase mostly focused on people to people diplomacy between india and bangladesh while recognising the role that csos ngos and local communities can play in decision making it became clear in this phase to the parties involved that the capacity of csos to participate in policy formulation implementation monitoring and evaluation was a challenge due to this lack of capacity they were usually left out from formal decision making in transboundary water management this was particularly true for marginalised communities and women there was also a problem of governments accepting civil society as a strategic and knowledge partner and acknowledging it can act as a successful intermediary between the state and the people with particular regard to the brahmaputra basin there is a sense of distrust and misperception between the state and csos hence building trust between the state and non state actors and developing capacity to participate in transboundary dialogues was identified as the most important tasks accordingly a workshop was designed to build the capacity of track 3 stakeholders to participate in multi stakeholder dialogues country level workshops were conducted in both india and bangladesh followed by a joint dialogue meeting it was organised to bring track 3 representatives from the two countries on a single platform for interaction and deliberation on issues of common interest the workshops helped raise awareness on rights and legalities related to transboundary water management improve communication and negotiation skills and enhance their knowledge about the river through expert consultation the workshops conducted in the first phase of the dialogue are listed in table 1 the second phase 2014 2015 of the dialogue moved from a bilateral to a multilateral approach with the involvement of china and bhutan as well see table 2 in this phase the dialogue moved from a track 3 to a track 2 mode the structure of the workshops was intended to remain the same country level workshops followed by regional level dialogues but in this phase country level workshops were conducted only in india and bangladesh with plans to expand them to china and bhutan in the next phase in the second phase the informal nature of track 2 diplomacy enabled a dialogue between state and non state actors it provided a space to scientists to disseminate findings of their research to both sides for a better understanding of this complex river system in the dialogue workshops it transpired that researchers water practitioners and managers have made substantial analyses to understand the dynamics and potential of this mighty river yet significant knowledge gaps remain with respect to the system and to sustainable approaches to the most productive use of the rich water resources while simultaneously reigning in their destructive forces strengthening the evidence base and enhancing a shared understanding of the system would foster more strategic and cooperative planning across administrative and sectoral boundaries as well as multiple disciplines in this context the need for developing a reliable comprehensive and common knowledge base for the brahmaputra basin was recognised by all workshop participants these dialogues at country and regional level also helped develop personal relationships between stakeholders due to the frank and open exchanges the dialogue workshops in most cases followed a problem solving approach where participants discussed various issues related to the management of the river the issues identified were managing disasters like flood drought and erosion navigation as an entry point for cooperation and the downstream environmental impact of water infrastructure projects some stakeholders also felt that important opportunities for cross learning from other basins facing similar challenges floods erosion sedimentation should be availed of through knowledge exchange and international study tours in the third phase 2015 2017 the brahmaputra dialogue expanded its reach to bhutan and china by organising country consultation meetings in both countries respectively along with dialogue workshops in india and bangladesh see table 3 phase iii became distinct from phase ii particularly on account of the composition of participants especially decision makers who participated both in country level and regional level meetings in china the dialogue is currently at track 2 level a broad range of officials executives and scholars involved in transboundary decision making attended the meetings in this phase a major challenge identified for the brb was the lack of a nodal institution that could bring stakeholders together to develop joint strategies to manage the basin therefore transboundary cases from other river basins were presented during various workshops to highlight and understand how including the process river basins across the world had arrived at a multilateral agreement other topics covered in the discussion were effective disaster management plans and the viable economic opportunities available along the basin to sustain livelihood and to address poverty and food and energy security in the area the discussion also dealt with issues like limited political will and state sovereignty regarding transboundary river water management it also brought out the importance of the creation of a level playing field and a sustainable institutional framework for dealing with these issues effectively the regional workshop in phase iii was organised in singapore a country outside the region to facilitate a neutral discussion with equal representation of diverse groups of stakeholders from each country this phase ended with a symposium the brahmaputra river symposium which was held in india with representation from the four countries it was the first of its kind for the brahmaputra basin and brought together 150 delegates from across the world to understand and assess the knowledge landscape of the basin and its relationship with policy making to identify key knowledge gaps and ways to strengthen the science policy interface it is important to mention here that during the second and third phases of the bd several meetings bilateral closed door face to face interviews etc had been conducted with government department officials and bureaucrats in india and bangladesh such meetings were meant to inform them about the dialogue process and also to seek their participation in future dialogues 5 discussion 5 1 setting the need for multitrack diplomacy the brahmaputra river basin is under development pressure considering nearly 30 of india s water resources potential and 41 of the country s total hydropower potential are found in this basin crow and singh 2009 the potential of the river to bring economic development has been the subject of at least a decade of discussion between governments of the region but with very little productive outcome on the other hand the river continues to bring disaster through annual flood and drought increasing the livelihood uncertainty and impoverishment of the largest concentration of poor people living around the basin crow 1999 crow and singh 2009 there is nevertheless a growing consensus that development of the region cannot be achieved without water resource development of the brahmaputra river basin there is a community of scholars officials and politicians in south asia who believes that the region s rivers can be better harnessed for economic development through an integrated basin wide approach nishat and faisal 2000 biswas 2011 shrestha grabs and khadgi 2015 ray et al 2015 there is also a growing recognition that such an approach needs to be combined with social economic political cultural and legal considerations along with scientific and technological paradigm baruah 2012 however unlike in other river basins shared by a number of countries there is no institutional mechanism in place in the brahmaputra basin to address the issue of water management at river basin level further there is a lack of scientific knowledge and information about the river basin since it is relatively under researched compared to other river basins of south asia ray et al 2015 notably the lack of a regional framework or information about the river has not come as an obstruction to the planning of the construction of a series of water infrastructure storage projects for this basin particularly in india and china but these plans related to hydropower dams and river linking projects are closely guarded with very limited information in the public domain there is also restricted access to and evaluation of the social and environmental impact of such plans more so the outcomes of such assessments are not shared with the affected communities leading to a lack of trust among the basin communities across the brb bandyopadhyay and ghosh 2009 so far not many large dam projects have been built in the brahmaputra basin but major projects like those in the tributaries of brahmaputra dihang and subansiri are under construction in india to be sure such large storage projects raise questions of social and ecological sustainability and the economic viability of the investments bandyopadhyay 2002 dore 2014 recently differences of opinion have emerged in two groups within the region proponents and opponents of water development projects the proponents mostly water resource experts believe that these water development infrastructures will enable the region to enjoy rapid economic development the opponents see this as a reductionist view since it does not consider the social and environmental impacts of such infrastructure projects bandyopadhyay and ghosh 2009 while probably the intentions of both groups are good the problem is there is very little communication between them in a wider context there is no platform within or between countries where meaningful exchanges of opinion can take place this has resulted in further miscommunication and suspicion leading to public agitation and unrest baruah 2012 as a result the lack of dialogue interaction and engagement has resulted in tension and friction within as well as among the co riparian nations of the brb as also mistrust at political level cooperative arrangements for transboundary waters are usually an outcome of long drawn processes that include dialogues and negotiations between the riparian countries mostly involving track 1 diplomacy however the cooperation resulting from such formal diplomacy efforts is seen as a zero sum outcome it is realised more and more that these dialogues and negotiations should happen at multiple levels and involving multiple stakeholders for example in the case of the nile river basin proponents argue that the nile basin initiative s nbi emphasis on a formal government level diplomacy approach to negotiation on the nile waters is not solving the stalemate in that basin barua and vij 2018 they insist that multitrack diplomacy should be employed to build confidence among the basin states and their peoples hefny 2011 for the mekong participatory governance and active engagement through multitrack diplomacy and dialogue involving all relevant stakeholders had become a prominent proposal for better management of the mekong river basin keo 2002 hensengerth 2009 dore 2014 as dore 2014 notes the regional track 1 governance in the mekong is struggling to equitably or effectively bring about far reaching regional change mainly because of the dominance of national interests hirsch and jensen 2006 suhardiman giordano and molle 2012 therefore to lift the quality of the mekong basin development negotiations there is a need for multitrack and multi stakeholder platforms warner 2005 dore 2014 in the case of the jordan river basin swain et al 2016 highlighted the need for multitrack water diplomacy to promote a more effectively shared utilisation of the water among riparians of the lower part of the jordan river these authors argue that while multitrack diplomacy is no substitute whatsoever for formal diplomacy such diplomacy helps manage increasing degrees of variety and variability in transboundary water management it also helps bring a plurality of views and diversity of perceptions to the table of discussion this in turn is hoped to bring more integrated and sustainable outcomes as warner 2005 puts it once people see the sense of involving multiple voices it is felt they will be broadly accepted as the way forward in dealing with the increasing complexity diversity and dynamics of water management traditional water diplomacy government to government has fallen short in south asia too barua and vij 2018 there have been cases e g the mahakali treaty between india and nepal where in spite of long negotiations the treaty became paralysed and undermined due to narrow political interests gyawali and dixit 1999 likewise the indus commission established under the 1960 indus treaty and the indo bangladesh joint rivers commission established in 1972 were a result of track 1 diplomacy yet they are considered the least cooperative institutions for transboundary water management kliot et al 2001 to promote water development projects for transboundary rivers there has to be support not only from all the countries affected by a project but also from the communities within each basin country with the increasing complexity of contemporary issues and time and resource constraints faced by governments a broad range of unofficial contacts and interactions is required to manage and resolve conflicts of transboundary scale nishat and faisal 2000 multi track diplomacy may not necessarily solve problems but they do help disputing parties understand other stakeholders views and interests at least partly warner 2005 thereby helping arrive at a common understanding of cooperation considering past experiences from different river basins multitrack diplomacy for the brahmaputra basin too is felt necessary in the larger interest of the region this diplomacy for the brb will create and support spaces where meaningful conversation can take place among diverse stakeholder groups which is lacking at the moment it can also inform and help shape a track 1 negotiation and decision making process by bringing in a wider range of perspectives on needs impacts and options and having them deliberated openly huntjens et al 2015 trust is seen as the cornerstone for cooperation but it is not something that can be easily developed or managed huntjens and de man 2017 to develop trust and confidence between the riparian countries of the brahmaputra there has to be long term interaction and communication between different actors these should include non traditional stakeholders such as the business sector media and funding institutions and marginalised groups women in particular the brahmaputra dialogue is a modest step toward this goal 5 2 outcome of the brahmaputra dialogue process dialogue in transboundary context needs a conscious effort across many years as evident from the cases of the nile mekong jordan indus and ganges rivers single track diplomacy often fails to provide space for diversity of perceptions and plurality of views lack of public involvement and secrecy around negotiations often heighten scepticism islam and susskind 2013 and could upset development plans of the region to avoid such scepticism a need for multitrack diplomacy was felt for the brb the bd process not only provided a platform for civil society and media to engage more productively but also helped government representatives take the edge off misconceptions of grassroot organisations and reduce the circulation of misinformation on the basin this happened particularly so in the country level workshops in india related to hydropower dams and the regional level dialogue held in singapore in short the bd platform bringing together multiple stakeholders with very different perspectives provided a space to discuss issues challenges and opportunities related to the brb at the same time it is important to note that although for each stakeholder cooperation could have a different meaning the drivers of cooperation need not necessarily be mutually exclusive in fact they complement each other for that reason already multitrack diplomacy would be handy for a dialogue project it is extremely difficult to quantify the achievements nevertheless some outputs of the bd in the last four years may be outlined the dialogues have been able to create a platform space for multi stakeholders across the four riparian countries to meet and talk once every year from 2013 onward in spite of arguments contestations confrontations and debates between participants the dialogue process has helped understand how each country approaches transboundary water management and cooperation the dialogues have been able to generate a willingness at multiple levels to continue the dialogue by recognising the merit and credibility of such a neutral platform particularly with respect to a trust deficit area like the brb the willingness shown by the dialogue participants have also helped attract donors interest in funding the process the bd is funded under the sawi program 4 the south asian water initiative funded by the world bank has been supporting this project since 2014 and has committed to support the project till 2019 before the world bank between 2012 and 2014 the asia foundation supported the project 4 and helped realise such sustained dialogue processes are important steps toward building trust and confidence among multiple stakeholders the workshops have been able to improve the quality of dialogue by building capacity at different levels particularly during the interaction between track 2 and track 3 participants and have also enabled participants to identify joint research themes 5 the iit guwahati india the yunan university china and institute of modelling bangladesh are working together since 2016 in a research project titled water resources vulnerability and security assessment of yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra transboundary river basin the project is funded by the national natural science foundation of china and is one of the major outcomes of the dialogue the iit guwahati and yunan university also signed an mou in september 2017 for academic collaboration and exchange 5 for robust evidence including socio economic and policy research the four years of brahmaputra dialogue workshops have opened up arenas of discussion which were usually closed to key stakeholders and they also helped give attention to arenas that were open but had been considered irrelevant to decision making till then the bd is not devoid of challenges one major challenge is generating political willingness to cooperate because political commitment is crucial for any transboundary cooperation but as politics take the centre stage the transboundary dialogue becomes complex and extremely challenging further there is always the risk of a change in political leadership and the efforts made in generating willingness at the political level track 1 may not lead to fruition after all while tracks 2 and 3 diplomacy play a crucial role in influencing political decision making they function within limitations and are not party to the final decisions consequently the track 1 5 engagement enables an understanding of the political dynamics of each riparian country so that an informed move may be made towards engaging track 1 in due course of time trust is the cornerstone of transboundary cooperation but trust cannot be built overnight it needs long term interaction between parties the brahmaputra dialogue may be seen as the first step towards building such trust since it has provided a safe place where openness and cooperation are stimulated and reinforced huntjens and de man 2017 but there is a major challenge the availability of financial resources to sustain such a process since the outcome of such dialogue projects cannot be measured quantitatively donors are often hesitant to finance processes without clear outcomes and timelines in this context programmes like sawi have proved useful where one of its objectives is to create trust and confidence in regional or basin water management through dialogue processes 6 conclusion the article discussed the need for multitrack diplomacy because it can act as an essential tool for inclusive governance in the brb while there are signs of cooperation in the basin the current mode of collaboration is mostly issue based and revolves around sharing hydrological data in addition there is a unilateral approach particularly by india and china in managing the brb there is a need for multilateral approaches that are transboundary and have an integrated focus such multilateral engagement may not lead to multilateral cooperation but it may be expected to enhance the scope of the existing cooperation by moving beyond the sharing of data to the joint management of disasters like floods the mistrust suspicion and lack of communication between riparian countries and riparian communities make track 1 diplomacy complicated in the brb the brahmaputra dialogue is probably the first sustained multitrack and multilateral effort especially developed to build trust and confidence within and between the countries sharing the basin there is no doubt that development of the water resources of the brb will play an important role in poverty alleviation and raising the living standards of the basin communities in the present situation a major challenge is that brb countries are vastly different in terms of socio economic development and environmental status this diversity gives rise to differences in overall perspective incentives to cooperate and the choice of negotiating strategies all this is making cooperation difficult the multitrack diplomacy approach for the brb as in the brahmaputra dialogue offers an innovative way to overcome such obstacles

6877,the identification of storm tracks that generate the annual maximum floods and the quantification of their air moisture content is proposed to understand better the atmospheric generation processes of floods in spain as well as their decreasing trends identified previously in this work the role of the atmospheric component on hydrological changes on spain by using storm track data generated by the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit is examined storm tracks associated with annual maximum flood series from 14 streamflow gauges located across spain are obtained by using ncep ncar reanalysis data they are classified into five clusters through use of the k means algorithm it was also shown that the use of five clusters was able to reproduce the five major types of storms identified in spain reported in the literature the posterior grouping of the five associated storm types into two bigger groups oceanic and continental storms led to a coherent seasonal and spatial behaviour of hydrological regimes for some gauges it was observed that distinct flood statistics such as mean and variance differ significantly as a result of atmospherically distinct generation processes suggesting that local annual maximum flood series may be non homogeneous as a result of contrasting atmospheric generation processes by means of logistic regression it is estimated that the probability of occurrence of oceanic storms reduced significantly in the spanish atlantic region along the studied period furthermore the existence of low frequency cycles introduces significant variation in the occurrence of storm types in the country with them being much more frequent during the period 1975 1979 while oceanic storms were more frequent during the 1983 1987 and 1996 1999 periods those storms classified as continental are observed in 59 3 of the studied cases while those termed oceanic in 40 7 continental storms also contribute with more moisture in the studied cases that is to say 63 1 of total moisture content while oceanic storms contributed with 36 9 keywords floods storm tracks nonstationarity flood classification attribution 1 introduction the assumptions of homogeneity and stationarity considered in flood frequency studies have been frequently questioned koutsoyiannis 2002 lima et al 2017 mediero et al 2014 merz et al 2014 2012 2010 milly et al 2008 slater e villarini 2017 in the past few years this has become a topic of high interest with a significant amount of studies dealing with the characterisation of flood changes seeking to identify its drivers and attempting to model observed changing patterns merz et al 2012 in what concerns to the attribution of causes of observed flood changes merz et al 2012 and mediero et al 2014 suggest that flood trends can be the result of changes in at least one of four sets of drivers those sets are mostly related to precipitation patterns climatic drivers that influence the antecedent moisture content e g evapotranspiration and temperatures among others rainfall runoff generation processes e g changes in runoff coefficients and flood propagation processes in rivers such a case for instance has been identified by blöschl et al 2017 in a large scale study that used a flood database across europe the authors searched for flood changing patterns and sought to identify potential drivers of hydrological change they evaluated 4262 gauging stations over the past few decades and although no consistent large scale climate change signal was observed in flood magnitudes they found a clear pattern of change associated with flood timing in north eastern europe they found that warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods in regions influenced by the north sea and in some sectors of the mediterranean coast they found that delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter floods these results highlight the existence of a clear climate change signal in flood timing at a european scale due to warmer temperatures blöschl et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2017 also performed a large scale flood study with a combined database of around 1200 gauging stations in europe and north america they fit a generalised extreme value gev distribution with l moments with return periods of 25 50 and 100 years and counted the number of exceedances of distinct return levels at each station the authors were unable to find a general flood trend in any of those large domains though they were able to conclude that changes over time in the occurrence of major floods were mostly due to multidecadal variability rather than long term trends the authors linked observed changes to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index in spain there is general agreement that there has been a negative trend in hydrological variables during the past decades for instance mediero et al 2014 identified a general decreasing trend in magnitude and frequency of floods in most parts of the country for the period 1942 2009 with more notable evidence in 1959 2009 the authors attributed those decreasing trends to an increased evapotranspiration that intensified water losses and decreased soil moisture content before the occurrence of floods in addition the water balance in the catchments given by the relationship between annual runoff and annual precipitation was also an important driver of flood change evaluating specifically the douro catchment morán tejeda et al 2011 found a generalised negative trend in flood series in the period 1961 2006 other studies analysed different hydrological variables in spain and identified these same general negative trends in annual and seasonal flows lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 and droughts coch and mediero 2016 in some more human impacted areas lópez moreno et al 2006 analysed daily discharge series in the central spanish pyrenees for the period 1959 1995 they found a decreasing trend in flood events and linked those trends to land use changes they found no relationship with rainfall patterns in this specific study area some other studies performed in spain have sought to question if changes in the precipitation patterns are a plausible cause for these observed changes in the streamflow series acero et al 2012 goodess and jones 2002 lópez moreno et al 2010 and valencia et al 2012 identified trends in rainfall series in some spanish regions suggesting that locally it may also be an important atmospheric component in the attribution of flood drivers goodess and jones 2002 identified a general trend towards decreasing mean rainfall amounts across the iberian peninsula the main exceptions occur along the south eastern mediterranean coast lópez moreno et al 2010 and valencia et al 2012 identified downward trends in daily precipitation in the central area of the ebro catchment in the second half of the twentieth century acero et al 2012 studied trends in cumulative rainfall from one to seven days in the iberian peninsula for the period 1958 2004 providing varying results depending on the season in winter they identified significant negative trends for a large part of the iberian peninsula but positive trends for the south eastern mediterranean coast in spring a general negative trend was also detected except for some positive trends in the northeast however whereas positive trends were detected in the west of the peninsula in autumn negative trends were highlighted in the east some studies go further in the search for atmospheric drivers of flood changes in the iberian peninsula ramos et al 2015 also reported the impact of atmospheric rivers ars on hydrological processes their results show that the association between ars and extreme precipitation days is stronger in the western peninsula portugal minho tagus and duero and becomes weaker in the direction of southern basins ebro guadiana and guadalquivir they also conclude that the contribution from ars is more important in more extreme precipitation days such trends in hydrological time series are of major concern especially in a scenario of climate change where new climate regimes could affect the understanding of whether new hydro climatological regimes will persist increase or decline in the near future alfieri et al 2015 used euro cordex climate projections for the rcp8 5 to simulate river streamflows in europe in the period 1970 2100 the authors found a reduction of peak discharges in spain which is more evident in its southern region a reduction of average streamflows as low as 40 in some sites of southern spain and a reduction of the number of peaks over a threshold in the guadiana and guadalquivir river basins estrela et al 2012 overall reached similar conclusions finding runoff reductions between 10 and 30 for the country in summary in spain a generalised decreasing trend in flood magnitudes is expected those trends could be partially attributed to increased evapotranspiration and changes in the water balance however the contribution of atmospheric drivers is still unclear locally average precipitations are predominantly decreasing in addition weekly precipitation shows negative trends in winter and autumn mainly in the eastern part of spain there are also evidences that various precipitation intensities can be related to a set of atmospheric generation processes for instance in some parts of the iberian peninsula ars are predominant in more extreme precipitation days finally climate projections are still unclear but studies with cmip5 suggest that those trends can be intensified in the future given this scenario we propose a study that evaluates the role of atmospheric processes in flood generation in spain in this paper we propose an approach based on the identification of storm tracks linked to annual maximum flows by using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit draxler 1999 draxler e hess 1998 1997 its applications have involved the hydrology field in several studies of liquid and solid precipitation as well as chemical composition ming et al 2007 scarchilli et al 2011 vieira filho et al 2013 wai et al 2007 specifically in spain krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used the hysplit model in the identification of main sources of moisture to eagles cave located in central spain during the 2009 2011 period they found that moisture from the north atlantic and recycled within the iberian peninsula were its main sources of water vapour considering these previous studies it is assumed that the use of the aforementioned hysplit model is capable of studying the atmospheric processes that generate the annual maximum floods by identifying the tracks of the storms that generate such floods including for instance the ars in addition the main sources of moisture during such storm events can be identified offering important information to understand flood formation processes such results contribute to the attribution task and offer good insights into hydrological behaviour in the future furthermore they will be highly useful in producing physically based flood frequency analyses that consider flood samples as the result of a mixed population of different types of floods however the main purpose of this paper entails establishing a direct link between types of storms identified in spain characterized by their storm path and total moisture content transported through the atmosphere and flood events observed at hydrological gauging stations this study is organized as follows section 2 provides the description of the region of study including the sources of hydrological data section 3 offers the methodology including flood trend analysis storm tracking the k means clustering procedure and the evolution of circulation patterns in spain identified as a function of time section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 offers the conclusions of the study 2 region of study spanish catchments are managed by 16 river basin authorities rbas based on hydrologic and geographical boundaries mean daily discharge series are freely available at both the centre for hydrographic studies of cedex and the integrated system of water information the anuario de aforos in spanish however data obtained from gauging stations located in some of the regional rbas that do not report to the spanish ministry of environment are unavailable consequently spatial coverage shows some blank areas at the national scale in addition while most gauging stations are clustered in the northern part of spain the southern part shows a less dense coverage because of dam regulation and a less dense hydrometric network mediero et al 2014 from this data a set of gauging stations is selected the criteria of selection included the use of different regional patterns of floods in spain considering regions with mediterranean and atlantic behaviour coch and mediero 2016 also catchments with areas that are not large were selected as their hydrologic response are likely to be the result of one single storm event specifically the largest catchment area of 12 740 km2 has a time of concentration of 13 5 h areas with a relevant contribution of snowmelt to floods were excluded such as the pyrenees sierra nevada and others as flood generation processes could have a weaker connection with single storm events as a result 14 gauging stations were selected fig 1 the catchment areas range from 28 km2 to 12740 km2 the median is 998 km2 and the average is 2305 km2 the annual maximum daily flows were obtained a total of 548 floods resulted in the 14 gauging stations located across the country for the time window 1967 2014 this time window was selected as previous studies suggested that in some parts of europe mean sea level pressure mslp data collected in the national center for environmental protection national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar prior to 1967 provides unrealistically low surface pressure reid et al 2001 as mslp is the main feature that storm tracks are based on storm tracks generated prior to 1967 were not used 3 methods 3 1 flood trend analysis the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was selected to identify trends in flood series mk is a non parametric test widely used in hydrology to detect monotonic trends in time series it is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their time order hamed 2008 the mk test statistic s is given by eq 1 1 s i j a ij where 2 a ij s i g n x j x i 1 for x i x j 0 for x i x j 1 for x i x j where x i and x j are the observed values of the variable x in the time steps i and j if the data is independent and identically distributed the mean and variance of the s statistic is zero and its variance given by v a r s n n 1 2 n 8 18 hamed 2008 asymptotically s statistic converges to the normal distribution and the significance of the trends can be tested by comparing the value u eq 3 with the standard normal significance at a significance level α 3 u s 1 v a r s for s 0 0 for s 0 s 1 v a r s for s 0 a common requirement for both parametric and nonparametric trend tests is that the data should be independent hamed 2008 this study tested annual maximum flood time series for serial dependence by using the autocorrelation function time series are assumed to be uncorrelated for a significance level of 5 normality is not required in the mk test as the test statistic depends only on the ranks of the observations rather than on the actual values hamed 2008 3 2 storm tracking we used ncep ncar reanalysis data kalnay et al 1996 to estimate the storm tracks related to each flood event the atmospheric data available cover a period from 1948 until today in a grid of 2 5 2 5 despite this availability we used only the data after 1967 as previously discussed for each flood event the storm track on the day of the peak flow was generated by using the hysplit model draxler 1999 draxler e hess 1998 1997 seibert e frank 2004 stohl and james 2004 the estimation of the water budget in an atmospheric column in the lagrangian framework is obtained by dividing the atmosphere into a large number of n particles in this type of models the air particles are homogeneously distributed such that the number of particles is proportional to the air density so given a total atmospheric mass m a each particle represents a mass m m a n those particles are advected given the eq 4 stohl and james 2004 4 d x dt v x t in eq 4 x is the particle position and v is the wind velocity interpolated from the grid analysis x t water vapour gains and losses are captured by changes in specific moisture q with time t the moisture content is interpolated to its position at every time step by using eq 5 5 e p m dq dt where e and p are the rates of increase and reduction of specific moisture with time by evaporation and precipitation respectively these gains and losses occur along the trajectory of a particle of mass m stohl and james 2004 stated that a small error is introduced because the mass of a particle is assumed to be constant when in reality the mass changes slightly because of the gains and losses of water vapour a lagrangian water balance for a given time lapse is obtained after summing moisture changes for many k particles passing over an area a as displayed in eq 6 6 e p k 1 k e p a where e is the evaporation and p is the precipitation over the area a sodemann et al 2008 to obtain accurate estimates of e and p either the number of n or the area a must be large for instance krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used a grid of 0 5 0 5 degrees to achieve this prescription using the hysplit model in spain in the present study a grid 1 0 1 0 degrees is used so this area size is enough for an accurate estimate of e and p as a result of the application of the hysplit model it is estimated the position of the air packages latitude longitude and height pressure and specific humidity in grams of water vapour by each kilogram of air g kg in this study the hysplit model is used to identify the set of storm tracks linked to the atmospheric systems that generated the observed annual peak flows for a given flood it is assumed that the general characteristics of atmospheric circulation in the day of occurrence of the peak discharge are very similar to those of the storm that generated the flood which is a reasonable assumption because of the following reasons a catchment area are not large in the gauging sites considered in the study the time of concentration of the catchments is less than 13 5 h b atmospheric circulation data is collected at four times during the day 0 h 6 h 12 h and 18 h covering a time window that is enough to capture general circulation characteristics c precipitation data are collected at rainfall gauging sites in each catchment mean areal precipitation time series should be obtained by using an interpolation method that could increase uncertainties related to precipitation amounts and dates d the use of precipitation gridded time series such as the e obs haylock et al 2008 is not recommended for extreme precipitations as they smooth daily data recorded at rainfall gauging stations previous studies with hysplit in the iberian peninsula by krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used storm tracks in three altitudes above ground level 1000 2000 and 2500 m to estimate the principal sources of moisture to the study area this decision was based on the fact that most of the moisture in the atmosphere is thought to be in the first 2000 m wallace and hobbs 2006 in this study storm tracks were generated from 10 to 2010 m above ground level at every 400 m preliminary results suggested that storm tracks at higher altitudes added almost no information for the characterisation of the acting atmospheric systems consequently track heights were limited to 1210 m as a result 16 storm tracks were analysed for each flood event four times during the day and at four different heights as 548 flood events were studied 8768 storm tracks were obtained finally each track was calculated along the 72 h before the arrival of the air packages at the catchment on the day of peak flow krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used 120 hour tracks as most of the moisture uptake in the region occurs within this time interval gimeno et al 2010 matthews et al 2018 used the lagranto analysis tool sprenger and wernli 2015 and traced 240 hour trajectories however in the analysis of ars they used a 24 hour integrated vapour transport time window given that this is the minimum length of the ars in this study we concluded that the 240 hour tracks were excessively long and in some cases did not reflect the atmospheric processes related to the flood formation in spain some of these long storm tracks circulated around the globe and took part in different atmospheric processes in various continents even 120 hour storm tracks sometimes reflected processes that took place in continental north america northern africa and scandinavia crossing the atlantic ocean and reaching spain therefore long storm tracks do not reflect atmospheric processes related to the iberian peninsula therefore storm tracks back to 72 h before the arrival in the peninsula were used based on preliminary results this period is enough to characterise the atmospheric processes related to flood events although this procedure reduces the lead time of prediction models it increases the accuracy of the identification of the classification procedure described in the following section 3 3 clustering storm tracks and storm types a k means clustering algorithm was used to separate storm tracks in homogeneous groups hartigan and wong 1979 k means algorithm was used the preparation of the storm tracks in the clustering algorithm included the description of each storm track by using a set of features that summarises their main characteristics for instance each storm track that reaches a specific catchment has a starting point and a specific main direction e g north to south or west to east and describes a specific vertical track ascendant descendant or flat such features were selected by performing a preliminary exploratory analysis testing the k means algorithm with features in subsets of the entire data set and inspecting visually the entire set of storm images this process involves some subjectivity as there is a huge set of different configuration of features some other important elements of each storm track are its length and height although the original tracks traced the storms until 72 h prior to flood occurrences the reduction of this time window to 48 h could make a better representation of the atmospheric systems that generated them aditionally although storm tracks above 1210 m could be used tracks were limited to this height an important step in the k means clustering procedure entails the selection of the number of cluster centres k two approaches were used first in terms of the reduction of the variance with an increasing number of k second in terms of the capacity of the clustering procedure to represent the atmospheric patterns described in the published literature about the iberian peninsula regarding the latter for instance tout and kemp 1985 used five main wind types in spain vendaval that originated in the atlantic ocean during winter cierzo and galerna in the north atlantic north sea and the bay of biscay also during winter and lebeche and levante from the mediterranean sea both during spring and summer other recent studies have suggested a presence of some specific storm types that could contribute to the gain of the most part of moisture in the iberian peninsula for instance ramos et al 2015 examined the association of atmospheric rivers and intense precipitation in the iberian peninsula krklec and domínguez villar 2014 reported the importance of recycling humidity flows as a major source of humidity to the central part of spain blöschl et al 2017 and martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 reported the role of northern sea and mediterranean storms as one important pattern related to precipitation in northern and eastern peninsula lastly a proper criterion was defined to classify each storm as each storm is a composition of 16 storm tracks obtained at four times during the day and along a vertical column from 10 to 1210 m each storm was classified according to the largest number of tracks grouped into a specific group for instance for a given storm with ten tracks classified into cluster 1 four into cluster 2 two into cluster 3 and zero into cluster 4 the storm is classified in cluster 1 assuming that the flood was generated by this storm type 3 4 evolution of storm types a set of analyses was performed to evaluate the seasonal pattern magnitude and the evolution of storm classes according to the k means clustering the aim was to verify if it was possible to attribute observed flood trends in spain exclusively taking into account the atmospheric generation processes of floods we did not take into consideration other processes that affect the flood formation such as evapotranspiration or the water balance in the catchment mediero et al 2014 we did this considering that locally not only those processes were relevant but also the precipitation acero et al 2012 goodess and jones 2002 lópez moreno et al 2010 valencia et al 2012 and the different atmospheric flood formation mechanisms ramos et al 2015 the seasonal pattern of different flood types was evaluated by observing the number of occurrences of each storm type over time and comparing seasonal characteristics with those reported in the published literature to assess the differences in magnitudes of the floods generated by each storm type that is to say if the floods magnitudes suggested non homogeneous processes due to varying atmospheric mechanisms a t test was performed with a significance level of 5 at each gauging site the average flood magnitude of each storm type was compared flood magnitudes were also tested regionally grouping standardised floods in regions influenced by an atlantic or mediterranean climate standardized time series were obtained by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation the last part of this study considered how different types of floods could influence observed flood trends identified in spain by using logistic regressions in these models time is the sole explanatory variable of the probability of occurrence of each type of atmospheric circulation mode the model parameters are fit to the data using the maximum likelihood method in this case probabilities are modelled as a binomial distribution if the relationship between flood type and time is significant p values lower than 5 are expected in addition the relationship between flood trends and changes in the moisture content estimated by using hysplit was evaluated linear models between flood magnitudes and moisture content were fitted considering a level of significance of 5 these analyses were performed locally and regionally regional analyses were also performed by grouping flood types in regions with either an atlantic or mediterranean climate storm types were then examined to find if they were more or less frequent in those regions 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood trend analysis in fig 2 annual maximum time series with loess trend lines are presented to obtain a visual idea of the general trends in the 14 studied gauging stations the results obtained from the mk test for the null hypothesis of stationarity at the 5 significance level are presented in table 1 the set of time intervals was selected to compare the results with previous studies reported in the literature lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 mediero et al 2014 morán tejeda et al 2011 the results are consistent with those obtained by mediero et al 2014 that reported the period from 1961 to 2006 as the one with more noticeable negative trends the hydrologic regions with such negative trends are the tajo guadiana guadalquivir júcar and ebro located in central southern and eastern spain as presented in fig 3 they also confirm previous results offered by morán tejeda et al 2011 that reported negative trends in the douro river basin station 2015 the same results were confirmed when considering those obtained by lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 which analysing the period from 1945 to 2005 reported a general negative trend in central and southern spain the results presented in table 1 also shows that the mk test applied to the annual maximum flow time series may be sensitive to the period considered for instance in the douro river basin if the 1959 2009 time window were moved by five years the mk test would not reject the stationarity hypothesis a time series may behave differently when different periods are selected merz et al 2012 it can also be seen in other hydrologic regions such as the cantábrico station 1295 guadalquivir 5012 jucar 8027 8030 and ebro 9001 9007 9030 9033 river basins by observing the loess trend lines shown in fig 2 it may suggest that the linear trends detected by the mk test may be part of lower frequency cycles given that such linear trends are time dependent and conditioned to the time series length or starting and ending years this result is consistent with a study by hodgkins et al 2017 that suggested that any specific flood trend could be identified in europe according to the authors rather than long term linear trends observed local trends are likely to be part of multidecadal variability linked to a low frequency climatic index such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo 4 2 storm tracks and the clustering procedure storm tracks were obtained for each flood event each track is a composition of 72 points one point per hour that represents the journey of an atmospheric particle three days before the arrival of the storm at the gauging station in addition each storm is a composition of 24 such tracks as storm tracks are obtained at six different heights in four different times during the day of the flow peak fig 4 presents five typical examples of storm tracks reaching the 3005 gauging station in the tagus river located in the central part of spain the colour scale indicates specific humidity g of water vapour per kg of air bluish colours are related to higher humidity content while the red ones represent dry air packages before running the k means algorithm a variety of previous analyses were conducted to evaluate its performance regarding producing spatial and seasonally coherent groups of storms these analyses focus on four elements the most relevant storm track features to be used in the classification procedure ideal length of the storm tracks to be used number of tracks in the vertical column and number of clusters k to be used with respect to the first three elements the final configuration used on the k means algorithm is as follows length of storm tracks although there were available storm tracks from 72 h before the floods reducing the period to 48 h produced a more plausible separation among storm types storm track features the position of each storm track variables in the y axis was approximated by a polynomial of fourth degree in the case of latitude and longitude and of first degree in the case of to the vertical variation as a function of the time in the x axis given this procedure the coefficients of the polynomials allowed a good and more parsimonious representation of the origin and path of each storm track for example instead of using the entire set of the 147 position of each storm track points 49 times three in the clustering algorithm we used only 12 points that contained the necessary information about the location of the air parcels to be inputted track heights although storm tracks in higher levels were available they added a significant amount of noise to the k means clustering algorithm therefore only the tracks that reached the catchment from 10 to 1210 m were used with respect to the number of clusters k fig 5 shows that when k equals five more than 60 of the internal variance is reduced by that point the residual variance curve presents an elbow indicating that sufficient variance is explained and from there reduction is less significant visual inspection suggested five main patterns fig 4 1 northern sea storms 2 storms derived from the meridional atlantic ocean 3 tropical atlantic storms 4 mediterranean storms and 5 storms that indicated recycling of humidity in the iberian peninsula furthermore a similar storm classification was identified in spain in the published literature krklec and domínguez villar 2014 martin vide e lopez bustins 2006 ramos et al 2015 tout and kemp 1985 also the results for two three eight and 10 number of classes were analysed these results are presented as supplementary material the use of three classes suggests that some storm types reported in the literature are poorly described and mixed for instance the tropical atlantic mediterranean and moisture recycling storms the use of more than five classes produces redundant storm classes therefore the choice of five clusters in the k means algorithm seems a reasonable choice a summary of the classification procedure is presented in fig 6 it exhibits the starting point of each storm track 72 h prior to the observed flow peaks and the average direction of storm tracks within each cluster it can be seen that the existence of a rigid separation between clusters is unlikely for instance starting points from clusters one two and three are frequently superposed fig 6 a in addition clusters one and two have a similar vertical ascendant pattern fig 6 b the difference between them is that the storm tracks from cluster one start normally in the north sea and bay of biscay while cluster two starts in atlantic ocean in mid latitudes also tracks of cluster one have a more pronounced curvature in north atlantic cluster two shows a large degree of superposition with cluster three as they both originate in the atlantic ocean however cluster three initiates more frequently in the tropical atlantic while two four has its starting point in the mid latitudes in addition the storms that belong to cluster three are in general more flat or descendant moreover clusters one two and three have a similar pattern when compared to the description of atmospheric rivers barth et al 2017 in those clusters the storms have a more structured composition of storm tracks along the vertical column transporting water vapour in a well organised manner and running longer distances during the 48 h prior flow peak this is the same description of ars provided by barth et al 2017 storm tracks from clusters four and five are shorter have more curved paths when compared to the other clusters and recycle moisture around the iberian peninsula the mediterranean sea and parts of the atlantic ocean these storm types reflect in addition a higher degree of ocean continent interaction while in storm types one this interaction is less important and the oceanic dynamic is predominant due to similarities among clusters one two and three and clusters four and five the result of grouping together the five clusters into two larger groups was evaluated clusters one two and three are called oceanic storms and clusters four and five continental storms these terms were used as they reflect the main dynamic related to the formation of the storms although they did not always correspond to the starting point of each storm track the large groups of storm types were then linked to each observed flood spatially the two patterns in hydrological regimes based on mean monthly discharges in spain obtained by coch and mediero 2016 were considered the atlantic regime with average flows higher during the period december february and higher flows densely concentrated in winter months and the mediterranean region lower ebro catchment and júcar river basin with higher flows observed during the period april june a similar classification can also be found in mediero et al 2015 that separated the flood regimes based only on the monthly frequency of flood occurrence following mediero et al 2015 the 14 gauging stations may be split into two groups stations 4004 4201 8027 8030 9007 9030 and 9033 in the mediterranean region and the remaining in the atlantic region fig 7 shows the results considering the spatial classification in two flow regimes atlantic and mediterranean regimes and the two large groups of storm types continental and oceanic storms a clear seasonal pattern of the storm types can be observed oceanic floods are more frequent in winter and continental are more frequent in early autumn and spring fig 7 a it also shows a clear spatial pattern oceanic floods are more frequent in the stations in the atlantic region 54 7 of the floods fig 7 c while continental floods are more frequent in mediterranean region 76 of the floods fig 7 e it confers a coherence between two classification procedures that follow distinct approaches the analysis of flow seasonality coch and mediero 2016 mediero et al 2015 and the use of the storm classification adopted in this study when the seasonal patterns are observed in the bar plots of the spatial regions the seasonal patterns of flood become more evident the graph shows that most of the annual maximum floods in the atlantic region are generated by oceanic storms in winter 45 of the total storms while most of the annual maximum floods in the mediterranean region are generated by continental storms in autumn and spring 65 this seasonal pattern also exhibits the formation mechanism of each storm type for instance in general continental storms are influenced by warm and humid air masses from the mediterranean sea herrera et al 2010 in addition garcía ortega et al 2007 described the formation mechanisms of major storms in the ebro basin as a combination of humidity from the mediterranean with high temperatures recorded during late spring and early summer in the ebro basin regarding the magnitude of standardised floods there were no significant differences according to the double sided t test at a significance level of 5 although the t test indicated that standardised floods are homogeneous in these regional scales some significant differences are observed locally in six of the 14 studied stations 1295 3005 4004 5012 8027 and 9030 flood magnitudes are significantly different if conditioned to the different flood types the density plots of the flood magnitudes in some of these stations 1295 3005 and 5012 are presented in fig 8 stations 1295 3005 and 5012 are in the atlantic region among these stations continental floods magnitudes are higher than oceanic ones in stations 3005 and 5012 in station 1295 25 floods were classified as continental while 18 as oceanic in station 3005 19 storms were continental and 26 oceanic and in station 5012 18 were continental and 26 oceanic in station 4004 8027 and 9030 the number of oceanic storms is reduced 10 2 and 5 respectively given this condition the density plots in these stations are meaningless and were omitted as a result in these six gauging stations flood time series could be considered non homogeneous as a result of two generation mechanisms with different flood magnitudes also except for station 1295 all of these gauging stations have significant decreasing trends according to the mk test fig 3 table 2 presents a summary of the results of the flood classification process it presents frequencies of occurrence of each storm type in each station the mean flood magnitude is presented both separated in flood types and without the separation the average difference between storm types and the p value as an indicator of the significance of the difference in the mean flood values additionally except for station 1295 in all the gauging stations in the atlantic region oceanic floods are more frequent than continental floods and vice versa 4 3 evolution of storm types 4 3 1 changing pattern of storm types the streamflow records were converted into a time series of storm types oceanic equals one and continental equals zero given that the number one was attributed to oceanic storms the time series of probabilities corresponds to this storm type with one minus this probability being associated with continental floods fig 9 shows the moving average of such converted values as well as the logistic regression lines indicating the evolution of the probability of oceanic floods over time in these cases moving averages of consecutive 10 20 and 30 floods were used at the spanish scale the logistic regression gives the average probability of 41 of observing oceanic floods some cyclic behaviour is also observed as the probabilities of observing oceanic floods range from 20 to 70 with some long spells with a low probability of observing oceanic floods for instance during the 1975 1979 period the probability persisted at around 20 and periods of higher probabilities during the 1996 1999 period the probabilities were around 70 this cyclic behaviour is mostly due to the stations located in the atlantic region in the atlantic region a decreasing monotonic trend was identified p value of 0 02 suggesting that the probability of occurrence of oceanic storms has decreased during the studied period at the end of the 1960 the probability of observing oceanic floods was approximately 70 while in the year 2014 this probability was reduced to less than 50 however individually in none of the gauging stations a significant trend of more frequent continental storms using the logistic regression was found results presented as supplementary material although the graphics of the logistic regression in gauging stations analysed separately suggest monotonic trends the tests are highly sensitive to small samples besides the monotonic trends the moving averages indicate the possible existence of interannual to decadal cycles in the atlantic region in this region probabilities of around 30 during the 1975 1979 period increase to a maximum of 75 around 1983 and is reduced again in the beginning of 1990 this general pattern indicates the occurrence of types of storms may vary over time in this region especially in those sites where non homogeneous flood samples were found statistically significant in addition it could also indicate a different probability of flood magnitudes along time in the mediterranean region the long term cycles are less evident though probabilities range from 10 to 40 with an average frequency of around 24 the results are in line with research published by mediero et al 2014 that identified the period 1967 1978 as a flood rich period and the period 2009 2015 as a flood poor period in the douro and tagus catchments that present the atlantic flood regime they are also consistent with acero et al 2012 that observed trends in precipitation in winter for a significant part of the iberian peninsula except for the south eastern mediterranean coast locally this precipitation pattern could be partially explained by changes in the chances of occurrence of the oceanic storms this is more important in the atlantic region where the higher frequency of floods is observed in the winter time and the negative precipitation trends are observed this result indicates that locally the trends in flood occurrence can be partially explained by the trends observed in terms of storm types especially in atlantic region as oceanic floods have become less frequent in some sites and the two types of floods are significantly different fig 8 there could be a trend towards lower floods in the studied period it could also be concluded that the multi year oscillations in different storm types may induce oscillations in the flood magnitude at local scales specific to each gauging station 4 3 2 influence of moisture content the main sources of humidity in the storms that generate floods in spain were analysed table 3 presents the average moisture content of each storm type in the country as well as according to the two flow regimes on average continental storms carry more moisture 63 1 of total moisture content than oceanic storms 36 9 during floods this is because this type of storm is more frequent fourth and fifth columns in table 3 and its average moisture content along the storm tracks is higher than in the case of oceanic storms if the two storm types are separated in the five storm types considered initially the recycling storms are those that carry the most moisture content during floods to spain 40 8 of the total moisture in the studied events this result is in line with research published by krklec and domínguez villar 2014 that also by using the hysplit model showed that recycling of humidity inside the iberian peninsula is the main source of humidity to the region for the studied period on average continental storms carry the highest moisture content by event third column which is more important in the mediterranean region where the difference between the two types of storms is close to 38 this higher moisture content in the continental storms may be because storms are more frequent in warmer months with higher temperatures when the maximum moisture that can contain air at saturation is larger this storm formation mechanism in the mediterranean region is described by garcía ortega et al 2007 in the atlantic region this difference is attenuated in this region the average moisture content is similar during oceanic and continental storms however the relative frequency of oceanic storms is much higher with this circulation mode carrying a higher amount of water vapor these results indicate that a variety of criteria could be used to regionalise the country into two large regions one with atlantic regime and another with mediterranean if continental storms are linked to the mediterranean region and oceanic storms to the atlantic region the first one is the seasonal criteria used by coch and mediero 2016 the second is the frequency of storm types and the third is the moisture amount table 3 the magnitude of floods is not necessarily linked to this storm types as it is local specific lastly the study examined the possibility of there being any trends in moisture content however the linear relationship between the data is unclear for instance when standardised floods and a logarithmic transformation of the moisture content were used the flood magnitude increased by 23 with the logarithm of the moisture in average in spain p value equals 0 049 graphic not presented that is to say for each logarithmic unit of moisture content the standardised flood values increase 23 on average while this relationship is significant it remains weak as the residual variance is high the trends in the moisture content time series were also evaluated negative trends could be observed in the moisture content during continental storms fig 10 however the mk test shows no significant trends in any station at a significance level of 5 while only three sites at a significance level of 10 considering that the moisture content is weakly related to flood magnitudes given that the flood magnitude increases by 23 with the logarithm of the moisture content but still with high residual variance as stated above and also that there is no significant trend in moisture content it is unlikely that this average moisture content could explain any trends observed in spanish catchments 5 conclusions the stationary behaviour of annual maximum flows in spain was analysed by identifying storm tracks that drove such floods by using ncep ncar reanalysis data and the hysplit model the research analysed 548 storms from 1967 until 2014 classifying and grouping them into five storm types northern storms mediterranean storms humidity recycling storms westerly derived storms and tropical atlantic storms then these five classes were grouped into two larger ones oceanic storms and continental storms oceanic storms exhibited a general behaviour similar to that which characterises atmospheric rivers this framework helps the understanding of changing flood behaviour over time given that it aggregates information of the formation mechanism of the flood the study confirmed previous results that found that the period 1959 2009 has a noticeable negative trend as regards the k means clustering algorithm used in the storm classification the evaluation of the features to be used in the algorithm is of major importance as well as the identification of the number of clustering centres should have a proper statistical and physical meaning the k means clustering procedure produced a coherent temporal separation of different types of storms and also a coherent spatial separation of spain into atlantic and mediterranean regime regions therefore it might be argued that this type of analysis could be useful in performing for instance hydrological regionalisation studies when evaluating flood magnitudes the results at the regional scale show that there is no significant variation among standardised flood types if the analysis is focused on specific gauging stations at three of the 14 streamflow gauging stations the flood magnitudes are significantly different which suggests that the analyses are locally specific it also suggests that the differences between different storm types are clear and could be used for example to model those time series by using mixed distributions and for forecasting purposes it may indicate at least for these sites that the atmospheric compartment may play a significant role when explaining different patterns of floods along time it was concluded that on average 40 7 of the floods in the studied cases were caused by oceanic storms 59 3 by continental storms in the atlantic region this probability increases to 54 7 45 3 for continental storms and it decreases to 24 0 in the mediterranean region 76 0 for continental storms in addition those probabilities fluctuate over time in the form monotonic trends and of low frequency oscillations mostly in atlantic region continental floods were more frequent on average in the 1975 1979 period and oceanic floods were more frequent in the 1983 1987 and 1996 1999 periods this suggests that monotonic trends and multi year oscillations in storm types may be one of the factors that could induce fluctuations in the flood magnitude in local scales in atlantic region which is highly particular to each gauging station lastly when analysing the moisture content in storms on average continental storms carry more moisture to the case studies than oceanic storms 58 0 and 42 0 respectively the higher moisture content in continental storms can be caused by they are more frequent in warmer months and thus the maximum moisture that air can content at saturation is greater it was also examined the possibility that the observed negative trends in floods could be partially explained by a negative trend in the moisture amount that arrives at the peninsula which is evident during continental storms although not always significant acknowledgements this work has been supported by the brazilian geological survey cprm coordination for the

6877,the identification of storm tracks that generate the annual maximum floods and the quantification of their air moisture content is proposed to understand better the atmospheric generation processes of floods in spain as well as their decreasing trends identified previously in this work the role of the atmospheric component on hydrological changes on spain by using storm track data generated by the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit is examined storm tracks associated with annual maximum flood series from 14 streamflow gauges located across spain are obtained by using ncep ncar reanalysis data they are classified into five clusters through use of the k means algorithm it was also shown that the use of five clusters was able to reproduce the five major types of storms identified in spain reported in the literature the posterior grouping of the five associated storm types into two bigger groups oceanic and continental storms led to a coherent seasonal and spatial behaviour of hydrological regimes for some gauges it was observed that distinct flood statistics such as mean and variance differ significantly as a result of atmospherically distinct generation processes suggesting that local annual maximum flood series may be non homogeneous as a result of contrasting atmospheric generation processes by means of logistic regression it is estimated that the probability of occurrence of oceanic storms reduced significantly in the spanish atlantic region along the studied period furthermore the existence of low frequency cycles introduces significant variation in the occurrence of storm types in the country with them being much more frequent during the period 1975 1979 while oceanic storms were more frequent during the 1983 1987 and 1996 1999 periods those storms classified as continental are observed in 59 3 of the studied cases while those termed oceanic in 40 7 continental storms also contribute with more moisture in the studied cases that is to say 63 1 of total moisture content while oceanic storms contributed with 36 9 keywords floods storm tracks nonstationarity flood classification attribution 1 introduction the assumptions of homogeneity and stationarity considered in flood frequency studies have been frequently questioned koutsoyiannis 2002 lima et al 2017 mediero et al 2014 merz et al 2014 2012 2010 milly et al 2008 slater e villarini 2017 in the past few years this has become a topic of high interest with a significant amount of studies dealing with the characterisation of flood changes seeking to identify its drivers and attempting to model observed changing patterns merz et al 2012 in what concerns to the attribution of causes of observed flood changes merz et al 2012 and mediero et al 2014 suggest that flood trends can be the result of changes in at least one of four sets of drivers those sets are mostly related to precipitation patterns climatic drivers that influence the antecedent moisture content e g evapotranspiration and temperatures among others rainfall runoff generation processes e g changes in runoff coefficients and flood propagation processes in rivers such a case for instance has been identified by blöschl et al 2017 in a large scale study that used a flood database across europe the authors searched for flood changing patterns and sought to identify potential drivers of hydrological change they evaluated 4262 gauging stations over the past few decades and although no consistent large scale climate change signal was observed in flood magnitudes they found a clear pattern of change associated with flood timing in north eastern europe they found that warmer temperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods in regions influenced by the north sea and in some sectors of the mediterranean coast they found that delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winter floods these results highlight the existence of a clear climate change signal in flood timing at a european scale due to warmer temperatures blöschl et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2017 also performed a large scale flood study with a combined database of around 1200 gauging stations in europe and north america they fit a generalised extreme value gev distribution with l moments with return periods of 25 50 and 100 years and counted the number of exceedances of distinct return levels at each station the authors were unable to find a general flood trend in any of those large domains though they were able to conclude that changes over time in the occurrence of major floods were mostly due to multidecadal variability rather than long term trends the authors linked observed changes to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index in spain there is general agreement that there has been a negative trend in hydrological variables during the past decades for instance mediero et al 2014 identified a general decreasing trend in magnitude and frequency of floods in most parts of the country for the period 1942 2009 with more notable evidence in 1959 2009 the authors attributed those decreasing trends to an increased evapotranspiration that intensified water losses and decreased soil moisture content before the occurrence of floods in addition the water balance in the catchments given by the relationship between annual runoff and annual precipitation was also an important driver of flood change evaluating specifically the douro catchment morán tejeda et al 2011 found a generalised negative trend in flood series in the period 1961 2006 other studies analysed different hydrological variables in spain and identified these same general negative trends in annual and seasonal flows lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 and droughts coch and mediero 2016 in some more human impacted areas lópez moreno et al 2006 analysed daily discharge series in the central spanish pyrenees for the period 1959 1995 they found a decreasing trend in flood events and linked those trends to land use changes they found no relationship with rainfall patterns in this specific study area some other studies performed in spain have sought to question if changes in the precipitation patterns are a plausible cause for these observed changes in the streamflow series acero et al 2012 goodess and jones 2002 lópez moreno et al 2010 and valencia et al 2012 identified trends in rainfall series in some spanish regions suggesting that locally it may also be an important atmospheric component in the attribution of flood drivers goodess and jones 2002 identified a general trend towards decreasing mean rainfall amounts across the iberian peninsula the main exceptions occur along the south eastern mediterranean coast lópez moreno et al 2010 and valencia et al 2012 identified downward trends in daily precipitation in the central area of the ebro catchment in the second half of the twentieth century acero et al 2012 studied trends in cumulative rainfall from one to seven days in the iberian peninsula for the period 1958 2004 providing varying results depending on the season in winter they identified significant negative trends for a large part of the iberian peninsula but positive trends for the south eastern mediterranean coast in spring a general negative trend was also detected except for some positive trends in the northeast however whereas positive trends were detected in the west of the peninsula in autumn negative trends were highlighted in the east some studies go further in the search for atmospheric drivers of flood changes in the iberian peninsula ramos et al 2015 also reported the impact of atmospheric rivers ars on hydrological processes their results show that the association between ars and extreme precipitation days is stronger in the western peninsula portugal minho tagus and duero and becomes weaker in the direction of southern basins ebro guadiana and guadalquivir they also conclude that the contribution from ars is more important in more extreme precipitation days such trends in hydrological time series are of major concern especially in a scenario of climate change where new climate regimes could affect the understanding of whether new hydro climatological regimes will persist increase or decline in the near future alfieri et al 2015 used euro cordex climate projections for the rcp8 5 to simulate river streamflows in europe in the period 1970 2100 the authors found a reduction of peak discharges in spain which is more evident in its southern region a reduction of average streamflows as low as 40 in some sites of southern spain and a reduction of the number of peaks over a threshold in the guadiana and guadalquivir river basins estrela et al 2012 overall reached similar conclusions finding runoff reductions between 10 and 30 for the country in summary in spain a generalised decreasing trend in flood magnitudes is expected those trends could be partially attributed to increased evapotranspiration and changes in the water balance however the contribution of atmospheric drivers is still unclear locally average precipitations are predominantly decreasing in addition weekly precipitation shows negative trends in winter and autumn mainly in the eastern part of spain there are also evidences that various precipitation intensities can be related to a set of atmospheric generation processes for instance in some parts of the iberian peninsula ars are predominant in more extreme precipitation days finally climate projections are still unclear but studies with cmip5 suggest that those trends can be intensified in the future given this scenario we propose a study that evaluates the role of atmospheric processes in flood generation in spain in this paper we propose an approach based on the identification of storm tracks linked to annual maximum flows by using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit draxler 1999 draxler e hess 1998 1997 its applications have involved the hydrology field in several studies of liquid and solid precipitation as well as chemical composition ming et al 2007 scarchilli et al 2011 vieira filho et al 2013 wai et al 2007 specifically in spain krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used the hysplit model in the identification of main sources of moisture to eagles cave located in central spain during the 2009 2011 period they found that moisture from the north atlantic and recycled within the iberian peninsula were its main sources of water vapour considering these previous studies it is assumed that the use of the aforementioned hysplit model is capable of studying the atmospheric processes that generate the annual maximum floods by identifying the tracks of the storms that generate such floods including for instance the ars in addition the main sources of moisture during such storm events can be identified offering important information to understand flood formation processes such results contribute to the attribution task and offer good insights into hydrological behaviour in the future furthermore they will be highly useful in producing physically based flood frequency analyses that consider flood samples as the result of a mixed population of different types of floods however the main purpose of this paper entails establishing a direct link between types of storms identified in spain characterized by their storm path and total moisture content transported through the atmosphere and flood events observed at hydrological gauging stations this study is organized as follows section 2 provides the description of the region of study including the sources of hydrological data section 3 offers the methodology including flood trend analysis storm tracking the k means clustering procedure and the evolution of circulation patterns in spain identified as a function of time section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 offers the conclusions of the study 2 region of study spanish catchments are managed by 16 river basin authorities rbas based on hydrologic and geographical boundaries mean daily discharge series are freely available at both the centre for hydrographic studies of cedex and the integrated system of water information the anuario de aforos in spanish however data obtained from gauging stations located in some of the regional rbas that do not report to the spanish ministry of environment are unavailable consequently spatial coverage shows some blank areas at the national scale in addition while most gauging stations are clustered in the northern part of spain the southern part shows a less dense coverage because of dam regulation and a less dense hydrometric network mediero et al 2014 from this data a set of gauging stations is selected the criteria of selection included the use of different regional patterns of floods in spain considering regions with mediterranean and atlantic behaviour coch and mediero 2016 also catchments with areas that are not large were selected as their hydrologic response are likely to be the result of one single storm event specifically the largest catchment area of 12 740 km2 has a time of concentration of 13 5 h areas with a relevant contribution of snowmelt to floods were excluded such as the pyrenees sierra nevada and others as flood generation processes could have a weaker connection with single storm events as a result 14 gauging stations were selected fig 1 the catchment areas range from 28 km2 to 12740 km2 the median is 998 km2 and the average is 2305 km2 the annual maximum daily flows were obtained a total of 548 floods resulted in the 14 gauging stations located across the country for the time window 1967 2014 this time window was selected as previous studies suggested that in some parts of europe mean sea level pressure mslp data collected in the national center for environmental protection national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar prior to 1967 provides unrealistically low surface pressure reid et al 2001 as mslp is the main feature that storm tracks are based on storm tracks generated prior to 1967 were not used 3 methods 3 1 flood trend analysis the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was selected to identify trends in flood series mk is a non parametric test widely used in hydrology to detect monotonic trends in time series it is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their time order hamed 2008 the mk test statistic s is given by eq 1 1 s i j a ij where 2 a ij s i g n x j x i 1 for x i x j 0 for x i x j 1 for x i x j where x i and x j are the observed values of the variable x in the time steps i and j if the data is independent and identically distributed the mean and variance of the s statistic is zero and its variance given by v a r s n n 1 2 n 8 18 hamed 2008 asymptotically s statistic converges to the normal distribution and the significance of the trends can be tested by comparing the value u eq 3 with the standard normal significance at a significance level α 3 u s 1 v a r s for s 0 0 for s 0 s 1 v a r s for s 0 a common requirement for both parametric and nonparametric trend tests is that the data should be independent hamed 2008 this study tested annual maximum flood time series for serial dependence by using the autocorrelation function time series are assumed to be uncorrelated for a significance level of 5 normality is not required in the mk test as the test statistic depends only on the ranks of the observations rather than on the actual values hamed 2008 3 2 storm tracking we used ncep ncar reanalysis data kalnay et al 1996 to estimate the storm tracks related to each flood event the atmospheric data available cover a period from 1948 until today in a grid of 2 5 2 5 despite this availability we used only the data after 1967 as previously discussed for each flood event the storm track on the day of the peak flow was generated by using the hysplit model draxler 1999 draxler e hess 1998 1997 seibert e frank 2004 stohl and james 2004 the estimation of the water budget in an atmospheric column in the lagrangian framework is obtained by dividing the atmosphere into a large number of n particles in this type of models the air particles are homogeneously distributed such that the number of particles is proportional to the air density so given a total atmospheric mass m a each particle represents a mass m m a n those particles are advected given the eq 4 stohl and james 2004 4 d x dt v x t in eq 4 x is the particle position and v is the wind velocity interpolated from the grid analysis x t water vapour gains and losses are captured by changes in specific moisture q with time t the moisture content is interpolated to its position at every time step by using eq 5 5 e p m dq dt where e and p are the rates of increase and reduction of specific moisture with time by evaporation and precipitation respectively these gains and losses occur along the trajectory of a particle of mass m stohl and james 2004 stated that a small error is introduced because the mass of a particle is assumed to be constant when in reality the mass changes slightly because of the gains and losses of water vapour a lagrangian water balance for a given time lapse is obtained after summing moisture changes for many k particles passing over an area a as displayed in eq 6 6 e p k 1 k e p a where e is the evaporation and p is the precipitation over the area a sodemann et al 2008 to obtain accurate estimates of e and p either the number of n or the area a must be large for instance krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used a grid of 0 5 0 5 degrees to achieve this prescription using the hysplit model in spain in the present study a grid 1 0 1 0 degrees is used so this area size is enough for an accurate estimate of e and p as a result of the application of the hysplit model it is estimated the position of the air packages latitude longitude and height pressure and specific humidity in grams of water vapour by each kilogram of air g kg in this study the hysplit model is used to identify the set of storm tracks linked to the atmospheric systems that generated the observed annual peak flows for a given flood it is assumed that the general characteristics of atmospheric circulation in the day of occurrence of the peak discharge are very similar to those of the storm that generated the flood which is a reasonable assumption because of the following reasons a catchment area are not large in the gauging sites considered in the study the time of concentration of the catchments is less than 13 5 h b atmospheric circulation data is collected at four times during the day 0 h 6 h 12 h and 18 h covering a time window that is enough to capture general circulation characteristics c precipitation data are collected at rainfall gauging sites in each catchment mean areal precipitation time series should be obtained by using an interpolation method that could increase uncertainties related to precipitation amounts and dates d the use of precipitation gridded time series such as the e obs haylock et al 2008 is not recommended for extreme precipitations as they smooth daily data recorded at rainfall gauging stations previous studies with hysplit in the iberian peninsula by krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used storm tracks in three altitudes above ground level 1000 2000 and 2500 m to estimate the principal sources of moisture to the study area this decision was based on the fact that most of the moisture in the atmosphere is thought to be in the first 2000 m wallace and hobbs 2006 in this study storm tracks were generated from 10 to 2010 m above ground level at every 400 m preliminary results suggested that storm tracks at higher altitudes added almost no information for the characterisation of the acting atmospheric systems consequently track heights were limited to 1210 m as a result 16 storm tracks were analysed for each flood event four times during the day and at four different heights as 548 flood events were studied 8768 storm tracks were obtained finally each track was calculated along the 72 h before the arrival of the air packages at the catchment on the day of peak flow krklec and domínguez villar 2014 used 120 hour tracks as most of the moisture uptake in the region occurs within this time interval gimeno et al 2010 matthews et al 2018 used the lagranto analysis tool sprenger and wernli 2015 and traced 240 hour trajectories however in the analysis of ars they used a 24 hour integrated vapour transport time window given that this is the minimum length of the ars in this study we concluded that the 240 hour tracks were excessively long and in some cases did not reflect the atmospheric processes related to the flood formation in spain some of these long storm tracks circulated around the globe and took part in different atmospheric processes in various continents even 120 hour storm tracks sometimes reflected processes that took place in continental north america northern africa and scandinavia crossing the atlantic ocean and reaching spain therefore long storm tracks do not reflect atmospheric processes related to the iberian peninsula therefore storm tracks back to 72 h before the arrival in the peninsula were used based on preliminary results this period is enough to characterise the atmospheric processes related to flood events although this procedure reduces the lead time of prediction models it increases the accuracy of the identification of the classification procedure described in the following section 3 3 clustering storm tracks and storm types a k means clustering algorithm was used to separate storm tracks in homogeneous groups hartigan and wong 1979 k means algorithm was used the preparation of the storm tracks in the clustering algorithm included the description of each storm track by using a set of features that summarises their main characteristics for instance each storm track that reaches a specific catchment has a starting point and a specific main direction e g north to south or west to east and describes a specific vertical track ascendant descendant or flat such features were selected by performing a preliminary exploratory analysis testing the k means algorithm with features in subsets of the entire data set and inspecting visually the entire set of storm images this process involves some subjectivity as there is a huge set of different configuration of features some other important elements of each storm track are its length and height although the original tracks traced the storms until 72 h prior to flood occurrences the reduction of this time window to 48 h could make a better representation of the atmospheric systems that generated them aditionally although storm tracks above 1210 m could be used tracks were limited to this height an important step in the k means clustering procedure entails the selection of the number of cluster centres k two approaches were used first in terms of the reduction of the variance with an increasing number of k second in terms of the capacity of the clustering procedure to represent the atmospheric patterns described in the published literature about the iberian peninsula regarding the latter for instance tout and kemp 1985 used five main wind types in spain vendaval that originated in the atlantic ocean during winter cierzo and galerna in the north atlantic north sea and the bay of biscay also during winter and lebeche and levante from the mediterranean sea both during spring and summer other recent studies have suggested a presence of some specific storm types that could contribute to the gain of the most part of moisture in the iberian peninsula for instance ramos et al 2015 examined the association of atmospheric rivers and intense precipitation in the iberian peninsula krklec and domínguez villar 2014 reported the importance of recycling humidity flows as a major source of humidity to the central part of spain blöschl et al 2017 and martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 reported the role of northern sea and mediterranean storms as one important pattern related to precipitation in northern and eastern peninsula lastly a proper criterion was defined to classify each storm as each storm is a composition of 16 storm tracks obtained at four times during the day and along a vertical column from 10 to 1210 m each storm was classified according to the largest number of tracks grouped into a specific group for instance for a given storm with ten tracks classified into cluster 1 four into cluster 2 two into cluster 3 and zero into cluster 4 the storm is classified in cluster 1 assuming that the flood was generated by this storm type 3 4 evolution of storm types a set of analyses was performed to evaluate the seasonal pattern magnitude and the evolution of storm classes according to the k means clustering the aim was to verify if it was possible to attribute observed flood trends in spain exclusively taking into account the atmospheric generation processes of floods we did not take into consideration other processes that affect the flood formation such as evapotranspiration or the water balance in the catchment mediero et al 2014 we did this considering that locally not only those processes were relevant but also the precipitation acero et al 2012 goodess and jones 2002 lópez moreno et al 2010 valencia et al 2012 and the different atmospheric flood formation mechanisms ramos et al 2015 the seasonal pattern of different flood types was evaluated by observing the number of occurrences of each storm type over time and comparing seasonal characteristics with those reported in the published literature to assess the differences in magnitudes of the floods generated by each storm type that is to say if the floods magnitudes suggested non homogeneous processes due to varying atmospheric mechanisms a t test was performed with a significance level of 5 at each gauging site the average flood magnitude of each storm type was compared flood magnitudes were also tested regionally grouping standardised floods in regions influenced by an atlantic or mediterranean climate standardized time series were obtained by subtracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation the last part of this study considered how different types of floods could influence observed flood trends identified in spain by using logistic regressions in these models time is the sole explanatory variable of the probability of occurrence of each type of atmospheric circulation mode the model parameters are fit to the data using the maximum likelihood method in this case probabilities are modelled as a binomial distribution if the relationship between flood type and time is significant p values lower than 5 are expected in addition the relationship between flood trends and changes in the moisture content estimated by using hysplit was evaluated linear models between flood magnitudes and moisture content were fitted considering a level of significance of 5 these analyses were performed locally and regionally regional analyses were also performed by grouping flood types in regions with either an atlantic or mediterranean climate storm types were then examined to find if they were more or less frequent in those regions 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood trend analysis in fig 2 annual maximum time series with loess trend lines are presented to obtain a visual idea of the general trends in the 14 studied gauging stations the results obtained from the mk test for the null hypothesis of stationarity at the 5 significance level are presented in table 1 the set of time intervals was selected to compare the results with previous studies reported in the literature lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 martínez fernández et al 2013 mediero et al 2014 morán tejeda et al 2011 the results are consistent with those obtained by mediero et al 2014 that reported the period from 1961 to 2006 as the one with more noticeable negative trends the hydrologic regions with such negative trends are the tajo guadiana guadalquivir júcar and ebro located in central southern and eastern spain as presented in fig 3 they also confirm previous results offered by morán tejeda et al 2011 that reported negative trends in the douro river basin station 2015 the same results were confirmed when considering those obtained by lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 which analysing the period from 1945 to 2005 reported a general negative trend in central and southern spain the results presented in table 1 also shows that the mk test applied to the annual maximum flow time series may be sensitive to the period considered for instance in the douro river basin if the 1959 2009 time window were moved by five years the mk test would not reject the stationarity hypothesis a time series may behave differently when different periods are selected merz et al 2012 it can also be seen in other hydrologic regions such as the cantábrico station 1295 guadalquivir 5012 jucar 8027 8030 and ebro 9001 9007 9030 9033 river basins by observing the loess trend lines shown in fig 2 it may suggest that the linear trends detected by the mk test may be part of lower frequency cycles given that such linear trends are time dependent and conditioned to the time series length or starting and ending years this result is consistent with a study by hodgkins et al 2017 that suggested that any specific flood trend could be identified in europe according to the authors rather than long term linear trends observed local trends are likely to be part of multidecadal variability linked to a low frequency climatic index such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo 4 2 storm tracks and the clustering procedure storm tracks were obtained for each flood event each track is a composition of 72 points one point per hour that represents the journey of an atmospheric particle three days before the arrival of the storm at the gauging station in addition each storm is a composition of 24 such tracks as storm tracks are obtained at six different heights in four different times during the day of the flow peak fig 4 presents five typical examples of storm tracks reaching the 3005 gauging station in the tagus river located in the central part of spain the colour scale indicates specific humidity g of water vapour per kg of air bluish colours are related to higher humidity content while the red ones represent dry air packages before running the k means algorithm a variety of previous analyses were conducted to evaluate its performance regarding producing spatial and seasonally coherent groups of storms these analyses focus on four elements the most relevant storm track features to be used in the classification procedure ideal length of the storm tracks to be used number of tracks in the vertical column and number of clusters k to be used with respect to the first three elements the final configuration used on the k means algorithm is as follows length of storm tracks although there were available storm tracks from 72 h before the floods reducing the period to 48 h produced a more plausible separation among storm types storm track features the position of each storm track variables in the y axis was approximated by a polynomial of fourth degree in the case of latitude and longitude and of first degree in the case of to the vertical variation as a function of the time in the x axis given this procedure the coefficients of the polynomials allowed a good and more parsimonious representation of the origin and path of each storm track for example instead of using the entire set of the 147 position of each storm track points 49 times three in the clustering algorithm we used only 12 points that contained the necessary information about the location of the air parcels to be inputted track heights although storm tracks in higher levels were available they added a significant amount of noise to the k means clustering algorithm therefore only the tracks that reached the catchment from 10 to 1210 m were used with respect to the number of clusters k fig 5 shows that when k equals five more than 60 of the internal variance is reduced by that point the residual variance curve presents an elbow indicating that sufficient variance is explained and from there reduction is less significant visual inspection suggested five main patterns fig 4 1 northern sea storms 2 storms derived from the meridional atlantic ocean 3 tropical atlantic storms 4 mediterranean storms and 5 storms that indicated recycling of humidity in the iberian peninsula furthermore a similar storm classification was identified in spain in the published literature krklec and domínguez villar 2014 martin vide e lopez bustins 2006 ramos et al 2015 tout and kemp 1985 also the results for two three eight and 10 number of classes were analysed these results are presented as supplementary material the use of three classes suggests that some storm types reported in the literature are poorly described and mixed for instance the tropical atlantic mediterranean and moisture recycling storms the use of more than five classes produces redundant storm classes therefore the choice of five clusters in the k means algorithm seems a reasonable choice a summary of the classification procedure is presented in fig 6 it exhibits the starting point of each storm track 72 h prior to the observed flow peaks and the average direction of storm tracks within each cluster it can be seen that the existence of a rigid separation between clusters is unlikely for instance starting points from clusters one two and three are frequently superposed fig 6 a in addition clusters one and two have a similar vertical ascendant pattern fig 6 b the difference between them is that the storm tracks from cluster one start normally in the north sea and bay of biscay while cluster two starts in atlantic ocean in mid latitudes also tracks of cluster one have a more pronounced curvature in north atlantic cluster two shows a large degree of superposition with cluster three as they both originate in the atlantic ocean however cluster three initiates more frequently in the tropical atlantic while two four has its starting point in the mid latitudes in addition the storms that belong to cluster three are in general more flat or descendant moreover clusters one two and three have a similar pattern when compared to the description of atmospheric rivers barth et al 2017 in those clusters the storms have a more structured composition of storm tracks along the vertical column transporting water vapour in a well organised manner and running longer distances during the 48 h prior flow peak this is the same description of ars provided by barth et al 2017 storm tracks from clusters four and five are shorter have more curved paths when compared to the other clusters and recycle moisture around the iberian peninsula the mediterranean sea and parts of the atlantic ocean these storm types reflect in addition a higher degree of ocean continent interaction while in storm types one this interaction is less important and the oceanic dynamic is predominant due to similarities among clusters one two and three and clusters four and five the result of grouping together the five clusters into two larger groups was evaluated clusters one two and three are called oceanic storms and clusters four and five continental storms these terms were used as they reflect the main dynamic related to the formation of the storms although they did not always correspond to the starting point of each storm track the large groups of storm types were then linked to each observed flood spatially the two patterns in hydrological regimes based on mean monthly discharges in spain obtained by coch and mediero 2016 were considered the atlantic regime with average flows higher during the period december february and higher flows densely concentrated in winter months and the mediterranean region lower ebro catchment and júcar river basin with higher flows observed during the period april june a similar classification can also be found in mediero et al 2015 that separated the flood regimes based only on the monthly frequency of flood occurrence following mediero et al 2015 the 14 gauging stations may be split into two groups stations 4004 4201 8027 8030 9007 9030 and 9033 in the mediterranean region and the remaining in the atlantic region fig 7 shows the results considering the spatial classification in two flow regimes atlantic and mediterranean regimes and the two large groups of storm types continental and oceanic storms a clear seasonal pattern of the storm types can be observed oceanic floods are more frequent in winter and continental are more frequent in early autumn and spring fig 7 a it also shows a clear spatial pattern oceanic floods are more frequent in the stations in the atlantic region 54 7 of the floods fig 7 c while continental floods are more frequent in mediterranean region 76 of the floods fig 7 e it confers a coherence between two classification procedures that follow distinct approaches the analysis of flow seasonality coch and mediero 2016 mediero et al 2015 and the use of the storm classification adopted in this study when the seasonal patterns are observed in the bar plots of the spatial regions the seasonal patterns of flood become more evident the graph shows that most of the annual maximum floods in the atlantic region are generated by oceanic storms in winter 45 of the total storms while most of the annual maximum floods in the mediterranean region are generated by continental storms in autumn and spring 65 this seasonal pattern also exhibits the formation mechanism of each storm type for instance in general continental storms are influenced by warm and humid air masses from the mediterranean sea herrera et al 2010 in addition garcía ortega et al 2007 described the formation mechanisms of major storms in the ebro basin as a combination of humidity from the mediterranean with high temperatures recorded during late spring and early summer in the ebro basin regarding the magnitude of standardised floods there were no significant differences according to the double sided t test at a significance level of 5 although the t test indicated that standardised floods are homogeneous in these regional scales some significant differences are observed locally in six of the 14 studied stations 1295 3005 4004 5012 8027 and 9030 flood magnitudes are significantly different if conditioned to the different flood types the density plots of the flood magnitudes in some of these stations 1295 3005 and 5012 are presented in fig 8 stations 1295 3005 and 5012 are in the atlantic region among these stations continental floods magnitudes are higher than oceanic ones in stations 3005 and 5012 in station 1295 25 floods were classified as continental while 18 as oceanic in station 3005 19 storms were continental and 26 oceanic and in station 5012 18 were continental and 26 oceanic in station 4004 8027 and 9030 the number of oceanic storms is reduced 10 2 and 5 respectively given this condition the density plots in these stations are meaningless and were omitted as a result in these six gauging stations flood time series could be considered non homogeneous as a result of two generation mechanisms with different flood magnitudes also except for station 1295 all of these gauging stations have significant decreasing trends according to the mk test fig 3 table 2 presents a summary of the results of the flood classification process it presents frequencies of occurrence of each storm type in each station the mean flood magnitude is presented both separated in flood types and without the separation the average difference between storm types and the p value as an indicator of the significance of the difference in the mean flood values additionally except for station 1295 in all the gauging stations in the atlantic region oceanic floods are more frequent than continental floods and vice versa 4 3 evolution of storm types 4 3 1 changing pattern of storm types the streamflow records were converted into a time series of storm types oceanic equals one and continental equals zero given that the number one was attributed to oceanic storms the time series of probabilities corresponds to this storm type with one minus this probability being associated with continental floods fig 9 shows the moving average of such converted values as well as the logistic regression lines indicating the evolution of the probability of oceanic floods over time in these cases moving averages of consecutive 10 20 and 30 floods were used at the spanish scale the logistic regression gives the average probability of 41 of observing oceanic floods some cyclic behaviour is also observed as the probabilities of observing oceanic floods range from 20 to 70 with some long spells with a low probability of observing oceanic floods for instance during the 1975 1979 period the probability persisted at around 20 and periods of higher probabilities during the 1996 1999 period the probabilities were around 70 this cyclic behaviour is mostly due to the stations located in the atlantic region in the atlantic region a decreasing monotonic trend was identified p value of 0 02 suggesting that the probability of occurrence of oceanic storms has decreased during the studied period at the end of the 1960 the probability of observing oceanic floods was approximately 70 while in the year 2014 this probability was reduced to less than 50 however individually in none of the gauging stations a significant trend of more frequent continental storms using the logistic regression was found results presented as supplementary material although the graphics of the logistic regression in gauging stations analysed separately suggest monotonic trends the tests are highly sensitive to small samples besides the monotonic trends the moving averages indicate the possible existence of interannual to decadal cycles in the atlantic region in this region probabilities of around 30 during the 1975 1979 period increase to a maximum of 75 around 1983 and is reduced again in the beginning of 1990 this general pattern indicates the occurrence of types of storms may vary over time in this region especially in those sites where non homogeneous flood samples were found statistically significant in addition it could also indicate a different probability of flood magnitudes along time in the mediterranean region the long term cycles are less evident though probabilities range from 10 to 40 with an average frequency of around 24 the results are in line with research published by mediero et al 2014 that identified the period 1967 1978 as a flood rich period and the period 2009 2015 as a flood poor period in the douro and tagus catchments that present the atlantic flood regime they are also consistent with acero et al 2012 that observed trends in precipitation in winter for a significant part of the iberian peninsula except for the south eastern mediterranean coast locally this precipitation pattern could be partially explained by changes in the chances of occurrence of the oceanic storms this is more important in the atlantic region where the higher frequency of floods is observed in the winter time and the negative precipitation trends are observed this result indicates that locally the trends in flood occurrence can be partially explained by the trends observed in terms of storm types especially in atlantic region as oceanic floods have become less frequent in some sites and the two types of floods are significantly different fig 8 there could be a trend towards lower floods in the studied period it could also be concluded that the multi year oscillations in different storm types may induce oscillations in the flood magnitude at local scales specific to each gauging station 4 3 2 influence of moisture content the main sources of humidity in the storms that generate floods in spain were analysed table 3 presents the average moisture content of each storm type in the country as well as according to the two flow regimes on average continental storms carry more moisture 63 1 of total moisture content than oceanic storms 36 9 during floods this is because this type of storm is more frequent fourth and fifth columns in table 3 and its average moisture content along the storm tracks is higher than in the case of oceanic storms if the two storm types are separated in the five storm types considered initially the recycling storms are those that carry the most moisture content during floods to spain 40 8 of the total moisture in the studied events this result is in line with research published by krklec and domínguez villar 2014 that also by using the hysplit model showed that recycling of humidity inside the iberian peninsula is the main source of humidity to the region for the studied period on average continental storms carry the highest moisture content by event third column which is more important in the mediterranean region where the difference between the two types of storms is close to 38 this higher moisture content in the continental storms may be because storms are more frequent in warmer months with higher temperatures when the maximum moisture that can contain air at saturation is larger this storm formation mechanism in the mediterranean region is described by garcía ortega et al 2007 in the atlantic region this difference is attenuated in this region the average moisture content is similar during oceanic and continental storms however the relative frequency of oceanic storms is much higher with this circulation mode carrying a higher amount of water vapor these results indicate that a variety of criteria could be used to regionalise the country into two large regions one with atlantic regime and another with mediterranean if continental storms are linked to the mediterranean region and oceanic storms to the atlantic region the first one is the seasonal criteria used by coch and mediero 2016 the second is the frequency of storm types and the third is the moisture amount table 3 the magnitude of floods is not necessarily linked to this storm types as it is local specific lastly the study examined the possibility of there being any trends in moisture content however the linear relationship between the data is unclear for instance when standardised floods and a logarithmic transformation of the moisture content were used the flood magnitude increased by 23 with the logarithm of the moisture in average in spain p value equals 0 049 graphic not presented that is to say for each logarithmic unit of moisture content the standardised flood values increase 23 on average while this relationship is significant it remains weak as the residual variance is high the trends in the moisture content time series were also evaluated negative trends could be observed in the moisture content during continental storms fig 10 however the mk test shows no significant trends in any station at a significance level of 5 while only three sites at a significance level of 10 considering that the moisture content is weakly related to flood magnitudes given that the flood magnitude increases by 23 with the logarithm of the moisture content but still with high residual variance as stated above and also that there is no significant trend in moisture content it is unlikely that this average moisture content could explain any trends observed in spanish catchments 5 conclusions the stationary behaviour of annual maximum flows in spain was analysed by identifying storm tracks that drove such floods by using ncep ncar reanalysis data and the hysplit model the research analysed 548 storms from 1967 until 2014 classifying and grouping them into five storm types northern storms mediterranean storms humidity recycling storms westerly derived storms and tropical atlantic storms then these five classes were grouped into two larger ones oceanic storms and continental storms oceanic storms exhibited a general behaviour similar to that which characterises atmospheric rivers this framework helps the understanding of changing flood behaviour over time given that it aggregates information of the formation mechanism of the flood the study confirmed previous results that found that the period 1959 2009 has a noticeable negative trend as regards the k means clustering algorithm used in the storm classification the evaluation of the features to be used in the algorithm is of major importance as well as the identification of the number of clustering centres should have a proper statistical and physical meaning the k means clustering procedure produced a coherent temporal separation of different types of storms and also a coherent spatial separation of spain into atlantic and mediterranean regime regions therefore it might be argued that this type of analysis could be useful in performing for instance hydrological regionalisation studies when evaluating flood magnitudes the results at the regional scale show that there is no significant variation among standardised flood types if the analysis is focused on specific gauging stations at three of the 14 streamflow gauging stations the flood magnitudes are significantly different which suggests that the analyses are locally specific it also suggests that the differences between different storm types are clear and could be used for example to model those time series by using mixed distributions and for forecasting purposes it may indicate at least for these sites that the atmospheric compartment may play a significant role when explaining different patterns of floods along time it was concluded that on average 40 7 of the floods in the studied cases were caused by oceanic storms 59 3 by continental storms in the atlantic region this probability increases to 54 7 45 3 for continental storms and it decreases to 24 0 in the mediterranean region 76 0 for continental storms in addition those probabilities fluctuate over time in the form monotonic trends and of low frequency oscillations mostly in atlantic region continental floods were more frequent on average in the 1975 1979 period and oceanic floods were more frequent in the 1983 1987 and 1996 1999 periods this suggests that monotonic trends and multi year oscillations in storm types may be one of the factors that could induce fluctuations in the flood magnitude in local scales in atlantic region which is highly particular to each gauging station lastly when analysing the moisture content in storms on average continental storms carry more moisture to the case studies than oceanic storms 58 0 and 42 0 respectively the higher moisture content in continental storms can be caused by they are more frequent in warmer months and thus the maximum moisture that air can content at saturation is greater it was also examined the possibility that the observed negative trends in floods could be partially explained by a negative trend in the moisture amount that arrives at the peninsula which is evident during continental storms although not always significant acknowledgements this work has been supported by the brazilian geological survey cprm coordination for the

6878,thermal regime and its response to meteorological and hydrological forcings play an important role in controlling water quality and ecosystem of lakes many large floodplain lakes are subjected to significant river lake interactions and could benefit greatly from hydrodynamic modeling the current work presents a first attempt to use a 3d hydrodynamic model and statistical methods to explore spatiotemporal variations and primary causal factors of thermal stability within a large river lake floodplain system poyang lake china the hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics through a comparative analysis of field measurements simulation results revealed that the thermal stability of poyang lake exhibits similar spatial patterns between seasons however the lake is generally stratified during summer and early autumn it is classified as partial mixed and full mixed during winter and spring the thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay area of the lake while the full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels statistics and simulations indicate that the air temperature solar radiation and evaporation trigger a positive effect on the thermal stability of poyang lake whereas a negative relationship is recognized due to the catchment river temperature the responses of thermal stability to the meteorological and hydrological changes are much stronger in summer than other seasons producing a significant seasonal thermal regime in the floodplain lake additionally the dynamics in the lake water depth and associated hydrological regime are a major factor in maintaining the seasonal thermal stability of poyang lake the findings of this study can support management of poyang lake as well as other similar floodplain lakes by providing information on both water quality and ecosystem succession keywords 3d hydrodynamic model water temperature mixing and stratification thermal stability floodplain system poyang lake 1 introduction thermal regime characteristics such as water temperature thermal mixing and stratification play an important role in controlling water quality e g chemical and biological processes vertical exchange of water borne particles of various kinds and ecosystem succession e g cyanobacterial growth and dominance of lakes and reservoirs wahl and peeters 2014 wu et al 2016 barrett et al 2018 feng et al 2018 considerable attention to the impacts of rapid climate change and anthropogenic processes of the thermal regime has made headlines as politicians discuss global warming however climate change does affect heat and mass transport in many of the world s lakes wang et al 2012 kirillin and shatwell 2016 thermal stratification and mixing in lakes are driven by several factors ranging from lake morphometric characteristics kling 1988 hanna 1990 to lake hydrological conditions martin and mccutcheon 1999 lawson and anderson 2007 through to meteorological and climatic forcings stainsby et al 2011 read et al 2014 wahl and peeters 2014 lakes can be classified as stratified partially stratified mixed or vertically mixed and the variability associated with stratification ranges from hours to decades and varies on global and regional scales read et al 2011 bertone et al 2015 most lakes are in climatic zones with strong shifts between dry and wet seasons hence seasonal thermal conditions are fundamental for all physical chemical and biological processes in lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 therefore an improved understanding of thermal regimes is a key objective of limnology and can substantially aid in future assessment and management of the environmental state of lakes thermal regime and its causal factors in lakes have been extensively examined using field measurements and hydrodynamic models previous investigation includes the field based study of chowdhury et al 2015 who used a chain of fast response temperature loggers to examine the stratification and mixing in lake simcoe canada they found that the lake s mixing exhibits large spatial and temporal variability lawson and anderson 2007 used water temperature profiles to investigate the thermal regime in lake elsinore california they concluded that thermal stability strongly depends upon variations in lake water level changes to the thermal stability of lakes such as shorter duration of ice cover earlier onset of stratification and an increase in the length of the stratified period have already been observed in some lakes in north america and europe e g magnuson et al 2000 winder and schindler 2004 wilhelm and adrian 2008 stainsby et al 2011 many previous studies have applied a vertical 1d hydrodynamic model to explore the thermal stability and associated external responses for several lakes danis et al 2004 herb and stefan 2005 mackay 2009 read et al 2011 2014 hydrodynamic investigations include the application of heat exchange equations by tuan et al 2009 to model the 1d thermal stratification in shikinawa lake japan it was found that diurnal stratification is mainly affected by wind action while thermal heating plays a minor role during strong wind events in cases where the lake exhibits a complexity of lake bathymetry and a wide and continuous range of hydrodynamic variations analyses based on 1d models can become complicated wahl and peeters 2014 li et al 2017a indeed horizontal transport in such lakes may limit the accuracy of 1d models by assuming a vertical mixing process herb and stefan 2005 wahl and peeters 2014 therefore 3d hydrodynamic models are convenient and useful tools to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the lake thermal regime and its response to external forcings wang et al 2012 investigated the effects of climate and hydrological conditions on the thermal stability of the liuxihe reservoir china using a 3d elcom hydrodynamic model showing that water column stability is influenced by both natural factors and anthropogenic factors xue et al 2015 developed a 3d fvcom hydrodynamic model to explore the thermal response to meteorological forcings in lake superior at the america canada border they found that spatiotemporal variability of heat fluxes can have an important influence on the lake s 3d thermal structure arifin et al 2016 used a 3d efdc hydrodynamic model to simulate thermal behavior in lake ontario covering an area along the america canada border they concluded that the hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the temperature profiles and thermal bar evolution additionally wu et al 2016 used the 3d efdc model to focus on the impact of thermal stability on pollutant transport in the hongfeng reservoir china showing that the spatiotemporal variations in stability are primarily affected by air temperature and water depth and hence control water age differences these previous efforts to elucidate thermal regime have mainly focused on lakes that do not exhibit complex floodplain characteristic zhang et al 2017 found that most floodplain lakes have considerable fluctuations in water level and often have highly variable hydrological and thermal dynamics floodplain lakes are generally large with many surrounding rivers which serve as inlets and outlets and constitute significant river lake floodplain systems zhang et al 2018 the thermal regime of floodplain lakes quickly respond to the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological and meteorological conditions and are therefore prone to changes in the external environment townsend 2006 wiklund et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 such knowledge of large floodplain lakes have received little attention compared with deeper lake systems li et al 2017b poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china shankman et al 2006 and represents significant biodiversity and ecological values that are of interest to the international wetland system yang et al 2018 thus poyang lake has become recognized as a significant floodplain system with complex river lake interactions zhang et al 2014 li et al 2015a which leads to highly dynamic hydrological and thermal regimes li et al 2017a b the natural fluctuations of the lake water level have attracted considerable public attention during the past decade hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 2014 li et al 2017a due to climate change and human activities that have resulted in significantly detrimental ecological and economic outcomes mei et al 2016 more importantly steadily deteriorating water quality and rapid environmental degradation have already intensified cheng and li 2006 and may be impacted further by operation of the three gorges dam and the proposed hydraulic dam located in the yangtze river s upstream and the lake s downstream respectively yang et al 2016 many studies have suggested that the floodplain poyang lake is vulnerable to hydrological alterations and thermal dynamics wu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 therefore knowledge of thermal regime behavior may have significant implications for water quality and nutrient exchange of the floodplain lake in previous studies of poyang lake several 2d hydrodynamic models of the lake were constructed and used to investigate lake hydrodynamics and or thermal dynamics e g lai et al 2013 cham li et al 2014 2017b yao et al 2018 mike 21 wang et al 2015 efdc mainly due to lack the information regarding the vertical thermal structures for example li et al 2017b used the depth averaged mike 21 model to examine the spatiotemporal behavior and primary causal factors of water surface temperature in poyang lake they concluded that the water surface temperature exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability and is mainly influenced by air temperature solar radiation wind speed and river temperature however the vertical processes of transport and mixing in these 2d hydrodynamic models have generally been oversimplified based on the assumption that the shallow and wide characteristics of the lake do not have enough substance or change to be modeled li et al 2014 in other words the circulation pattern and the associated thermal stratification of the lake were neglected in previous 2d modeling studies recently the thermal stratification and its causal factors have been of keen interest li et al 2016b investigated the thermal stratification and mixing of poyang lake using the depth profile measurements of water temperature they found that the lake has isothermal mixed layers from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion however even though their results may reasonably represent the thermal conditions in the lake s main flow channels the results did not apply to other regions of the lake the work was thus incomplete because it only focused on the limited observation points in the main flow channels at specific sampling periods this lack of sufficient records on environmental changes in floodplain lakes zhang et al 2018 left information gaps regarding thermal stability and its responses in the floodplain of poyang lake despite several previous studies into the thermal regime and its implications of poyang lake this study is the first to use a 3d hydrodynamic model and hence provides the first attempt to examine thermal stability within a large floodplain lake system our specific objectives were 1 to construct and validate a 3d hydrodynamic model to simulate the thermodynamics of the lake 2 to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of the thermal stability throughout the lake and 3 to investigate the influence of primary external changes on thermal stability using statistical and hydrodynamic approaches 2 study area poyang lake 28 4 29 46 n 115 49 116 46 e is an internationally recognized wetland system kanai et al 2002 with a significant seasonal shift between dry and wet seasons it is also the largest freshwater lake located at the south bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 poyang lake is one of the few lakes in china that remains naturally connected to its surrounding rivers zhang et al 2014 according to statistics the region s subtropical monsoon climate produces a mean annual precipitation and pan evaporation of 1485 mm yr and 1428 mm yr respectively poyang lake receives catchment runoffs from the ganjiang average 2585 m3 s fuhe 526 m3 s xinjiang 744 m3 s raohe 642 m3 s and xiushui 463 m3 s rivers fig 1 subsequently discharging into the yangtze river through a narrow outlet at the northern end of the lake shankman et al 2006 hu et al 2007 generally the five rivers provide around 89 of the inflow for the lake while the backflow from the yangtze river contributes approximately 3 of the inflow with the remaining sources made up mainly of minor streams groundwater discharge and rainfall to the lake surface li et al 2015a consequently the hydrological regime of poyang lake is mainly controlled by seasonal variations in both catchment river inflows and yangtze river water levels guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2017a these result in water level fluctuations range from 8 to 22 m each year and are associated with the dynamics in the water surface area of 1000 to 3000 km2 feng et al 2012 the lake is a prominent example of a highly dynamic system that expands and contracts annually creating extensive floodplain areas of 3000 km2 feng et al 2012 poyang lake serves industrial agricultural urban and environmental functions for 12 4 million residents in jiangxi province zhen et al 2011 it plays an important role in flood mitigation storage and biodiversity protection huang et al 2018 poyang lake is a geometrically complex lake with winding shorelines and an incised bottom morphology that is the lake has complex topographical features including main flow channels floodplains bays and islands fig 1 the topography of the lake varies from upland areas around the lake s floodplains at elevations of 28 m above sea level to lake s main channels at elevations of about 8 m fig 1 poyang lake has a maximum length and width of 173 km and 74 km respectively the lake is generally shallow with 85 of the lake less than about 6 m deep during flood seasons li et al 2017a in dry seasons spatial differences in the water surface elevation of the lake can reach up to 5 m with an incline to the north whereas the water surface profile is almost horizontal during flood periods li et al 2014 poyang lake exhibits spatially heterogeneous residence times that range from 20 to 300 days throughout the lake depending upon lake topography and associated hydrodynamic conditions li et al 2015b the water velocities in the lake s main flow channels are distinctly higher than their adjacent floodplains and other lake regions as observed from velocity profile measurements li et al 2016b 3 materials and methods a 3d hydrodynamic modeling was constructed and applied in this study to characterize hydrodynamics and thermodynamics in poyang lake hydrodynamic modeling is expected to provide insights into the characteristics of thermal regime and to investigate the effects of external changes on the thermal regime of the lake two stability indices of thermal stratification were applied to available hydrodynamic results to evaluate physical stratification and or mixing in the lake statistical and hydrodynamic analyses were selected to identify relationships between thermal stability and likely causal factors 3 1 data availability 3 1 1 routine observations meteorological conditions i e air temperature relative humidity solar radiation cloud cover wind speed wind direction precipitation and evaporation were observed at xingzi duchang and kangshan gauging stations fig 1 and data on these conditions were required to force the hydrodynamic model because none of these stations provide data on all the meteorological parameters meteorological data were retrieved from various stations table 1 river discharge and water temperature were collected from the six downstream gauging stations of the lake s catchment and were used to represent the five river inflows fig 1 the water levels and temperatures in poyang lake were obtained from the hukou xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations fig 1 these stations were selected to represent the spatial and temporal responses in lake conditions in this study all hydrometeorological data surrounding the lake see fig 1 and table 1 were available for the period of 2015 and were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province 3 1 2 in situ measurements the in situ measurements include water velocity and water temperature near the northern lake table 1 the velocity and temperature profiles were made at four locations xz1 xz2 xz3 and hk fig 1 on 4 february 14 april and 20 july 2015 velocity profiles were measured using an rdi 3 mhz workhorse sentinel from the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp line teledyne technologies inc usa in the bottom track mode the instrument was attached on a boat with the transducers submerged around 20 cm below the water surface to obtain an accurate profile during the entire period of measurement the temperature profiles were measured at the same locations using a hand held levelogger sensor solinst canada with an accuracy of 0 05 c the depth profiles were recorded at approximately 2 m increments from the surface of the water column down to the bottom point measurements of water temperature near the lake surface 0 5 m were conducted on 15 january 22 points 10 april 24 points 15 july 73 points and 15 october 22 points 2015 locations are shown in fig 5 water temperature was measured using a hydrolab datasonde 5 multiprobe sensor sutron corporation usa throughout different lake regions 3 2 3d hydrodynamic model 3 2 1 model description and setup this study used a 3d hydrodynamic model mike 3 2012 version powered by dhi denmark to investigate the flow characteristics and thermal stratification of poyang lake the mike 3 model is based on a cell centered finite volume method with an unstructured mesh to permit accurate representation of complex surface water bodies danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 the momentum equations used are the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations employing hydrostatic pressure and the boussinesq assumption danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 this model has been used to study a number of rivers reservoirs lakes and estuaries and has proven effective in simulating transport and mixing processes zeinoddini et al 2009 venugopal and nemalidinne 2014 waldman et al 2017 the current mike 3 model is constructed and based on a previous 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model of poyang lake li et al 2014 2017a the simulated domain of the lake covers the maximum flood inundation area of 3124 km2 fig 2 the bathymetry is thought to have been relatively stable during the previous 40 years lai et al 2014 albeit bathymetry changes were observed in the vicinity of the outlet channel due to human activities yao et al 2018 therefore the bathymetry in 2000 30 m 30 m was interpolated to a total of 20 450 triangular elements the element sizes were adjusted by trial and error and varied from 70 m in the flow channels to 1500 m in the floodplains fig 2 regarding the vertical discretization the model displayed low sensitivity to the number of vertical layers hence 10 equidistant sigma layers were used across the water depth 3 2 2 model boundary and initial conditions the lake shoreline was defined throughout as an impermeable zero normal velocity boundary while the lake bottom was an impermeable boundary with spatial resistance specified by variable roughness heights for vegetation area marshland and permanent water the lake upstream boundaries were specified as time varying river inflows and temperatures using the gauge observations and the lower boundary condition was specified as the observations of water levels and temperature at the hukou gauging station see black dots in fig 1 although meteorological parameters on the lake surface are highly seasonal the spatial variability is thought to have a limited effect on the lake hydrodynamics yao et al 2016 li et al 2017a therefore spatially uniform but time varying meteorological parameters included air temperature relative humidity solar radiation cloud cover wind speed wind direction precipitation and evaporation table 1 these were used to represent atmosphere conditions in the hydrodynamic model the water temperature is invoked from the specification of baroclinic condition i e density depends on temperature the simulation period covered 365 days from 1 january to 31 december 2015 the initial values of water elevation were prescribed as the lake water surface using observations from hukou xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations fig 1 while the initial water velocities were set to zero all through the model domain the initial values of water temperature were set to 10 c throughout the domain a spin up time of two weeks included meteorological and hydrological conditions which were used to avoid the effects of initial conditions on modeling results the minimum time step is restricted to 0 1 s to keep the target courant friedrich levy cfl condition number of 1 0 the numerical option of wetting and drying in the model was adopted and followed the rule h dry 0 005 m h flood 0 05 m h wet 0 1 m danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 the horizontal eddy viscosity is presented by the smagorinsky formulation and vertical eddy viscosity is by the standard k epsilon turbulence model in which transport equations are solved for both turbulent kinetic energy and energy dissipation other key parameters used in the current 3d hydrodynamic model of poyang lake are presented in table 2 these are based on values from published studies on poyang lake li et al 2014 2017a b and from other modeling investigations from weinberger and vetter 2012 bueche and vetter 2014 and alosairi et al 2018 3 3 index of thermal stratification 3 3 1 schmidt stability the resistance to mechanical mixing due to the potential energy inherent in the stratification of the water column was defined by idso 1973 we present idso s version of the schmidt stability index j m2 here as idso 1973 1 s g a 0 z 0 z m a z z z ρ z ρ d z where a 0 is the surface area of the lake m2 a z is the lake area at water depth z m ρ z is the density kg m3 calculated from the temperature at depth z ρ is the volume weighted mean density of the water column z is the depth where the mean density occurs dz is the depth interval and g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 the density of water ρ t at any given temperature t c was calculated as martin and mccutcheon 1999 2 ρ t 1000 1 t 288 9414 508929 2 t 68 12963 t 3 9863 2 the schmidt stability function has been extensively applied to evaluate the thermal stratification strength and found a range of stability of 0 5784 j m2 read et al 2011 schmidt stability is a measure of water column stability and indicates the amount of work required to mix the lake to an isothermal condition wetzel 2001 lawson and anderson 2007 the zero value indicates the water column is isothermal and the maximum value indicates the water column is most strongly stratified stainsby et al 2011 wang et al 2012 3 3 2 richardson s layer number the physical interpretation of the richardson s layer number dimensionless can be used to identify the lake mixing partial mixing stratification and stratification dyer and new 1986 bárcena et al 2016 the classical richardson s layer number is linked to the hydrodynamic key variables water levels velocities and densities and can be expressed as follows bowden 1978 3 r i l t g h t δ ρ t ρ t u t 2 where t is the time h t is the depth of the water column m δ ρ t is the density at the bottom minus that at the surface kg m3 ρ t is the vertical depth averaged density kg m3 and u t is the vertical depth averaged velocity m s for ril 20 the water column is highly stable with low vertical mixing i e stratification for 20 ril 2 mixing is increasingly active due to turbulence partial mixing stratification for ril 2 fully developed mixing occurs mixing and the threshold value of ril provides a reasonable estimate of water column stability dyer and new 1986 3 4 model validation and simulation scenario the 3d hydrodynamic model was validated using the observed lake water levels xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations the near surface water temperature xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan the depth profiles of water velocity and temperature xz1 xz2 xz3 and hk and the measured water temperature throughout the lake 141 points to evaluate the model s performance three statistical methods were used to compare simulated and measured data li et al 2017b including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse the ideal value for ens and r 2 is 1 and the ideal value for rmse is 0 the 3d hydrodynamic model was used to examine the effects of variations in external factors air temperature solar radiation evaporation and river temperature see section 4 3 for more details on the thermal regime in poyang lake the validated model was selected to represent the baseline conditions ms0 in the lake where the external factors followed an observed time series in 2015 other scenarios ms1 ms8 were intended to simulate the effect of input conditions by adding offset values to the observed daily data or multiplying them by a factor table 3 the modifications of the local climate and hydrological conditions and forcing functions are similar to a previous approach by li et al 2017b 4 results 4 1 validation of modeling results time series comparisons between the observed and modeled lake water levels at xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations are shown in fig 3 the ens of the four gauging stations varied from 0 96 to 0 99 and r 2 ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 the rmse values of all stations were less than about 0 4 m suggesting an accurate agreement in both phase and magnitude for the four gauging stations the mike 3 model predicted well the observed daily water temperatures at the four gauging stations producing r 2 and rmse in ranges of 0 96 0 99 and 1 4 1 7 c respectively fig 4 the values of ens at all stations can reach up to 0 96 suggesting a satisfactory accuracy in the model results however the water levels and temperatures led to estimates that were somewhat underestimated and overestimated as illustrated by the dry seasons in figs 3 and 4 it is expected that the water temperature is likely to exhibit more complex responses than the water level to the external changes overall these results demonstrate that the mike 3 model has the ability to capture dynamic changes of the hydrodynamic and thermal regime of poyang lake based on visual inspection and statistical evaluation fig 5 shows the regression analysis and coefficient of determination for the measured and modeled temperature 0 5 m below the surface at different time periods the scatter plots show the r 2 value for the line of best fit to be between 0 80 and 0 90 at the four periods evidenced by more scattered points in 15 january and 15 october and less scattered but systematically shifted points in the other two periods the results on the other hand show better agreement with smaller bias and a better spatial pattern of near surface water temperature fig 6 shows that the simulated results closely match the measured velocity profiles and indicate that the model has the capability to predict the hydrodynamic field in the lake discrepancies 0 2 m s between model and measurements can be observed at a shallow water depth 2 m below the surface of the lake this could be due to the spatially uniform wind forcing which does not consider local effects the surface layer of the lake is prone to respond to an accelerated wave velocity responding rapidly to wind forcing the physical variation of the lake such as irregular shoreline and bathymetry characteristics may lead to intrinsic differences between the model and the field data fig 7 shows the temperature profiles of simulated and field measurements for the three time periods of the lake at different locations an almost isothermal temperature profile i e difference 1 c in the entire water column was satisfactorily reproduced by the model on 4 february and 14 april 2015 the simulation underestimated and or overestimated the water temperatures by up to 1 c especially in the surface and bottom layers of the lake in summer 20 july the strong stratification 3 4 c difference and the depth of the thermocline position 6 m below the surface are reasonably captured by the model at different locations although the intensity of the simulated stratification appears to be weaker than the observed conditions e g 20 july the current simulations are assumed to be acceptable for reproducing the seasonal water temperature variation and relevant mixing and transport processes 4 2 spatiotemporal pattern of thermal stability fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of the seasonal schmidt stability index calculated from temperature profiles throughout the lake during the springtime fig 8a the lake wide schmidt stability shows distinct spatial variability where the index can reach up to 131 j m2 stratification is likely to occur in the lake center area especially in the eastern bay adjacent to the main flow channel while the possible mixing areas are observed in the river mouth the floodplains and the northern flow channel of the lake in summer the mean schmidt stability shows a large spatial variability with an index in the range of 4 1314 j m2 fig 8b the stability pattern appears to reflect signatures of longitude variation with the most likely stratification in most areas in the center and eastern area of the lake index 600 j m2 although the schmidt stability in the lake shows relatively complex distributions during the autumn and winter seasons fig 8c and d the thermal stability exhibited a similar spatial pattern to that in spring and summer fig 8a and b additionally it is expected that the water temperature profile in the summer presents more stratification up to 4 c difference than that in other seasons 1 c as shown in fig 9 a d in general the most likely thermal stratification may develop in the center and eastern bay of the lake while the mixing is likely to occur in other lake regions e g the floodplains and the northern flow channels fig 9e it is noteworthy that the seasonal change of the lake water levels see fig 3 shows very similar variations to that of the thermal stabilities in different lake regions fig 9e it follows that the lake bathymetry or water depth and hydrological alterations may be at least partly responsible for affecting the spatial pattern of thermal stability at a seasonal scale richardson s layer number calculations were made using the simulated temperature profiles for the four representative areas of the lake fig 10 at different lake regions results show that the layer numbers were generally observed to be low in the winter months typically 2 and often in range of 2 20 indicating a vertically mixed 70 time of the year or partially mixed type 10 time of the year while much higher layer numbers are presented in summer and early autumn values were often 20 and occasionally ranged from 2 to 20 suggesting a seasonal stratification 20 time of the year in general the lake is mixed and partial mixed in winter and spring then stratified later in summer and autumn the area covered by the vertical stratification type was largest in the center and the eastern bay of the lake i e the layer number which can go up to 180 fig 10b and d where the strong temperature differences can reach up to 4 c for both the two sections i e the ip2 ip3 and ip3 ip4 fig 11 while the lake s main flow channel and the shallow floodplain areas appear to be fully mixed due to the fast water flows with an isothermal water column 1 c for the ip1 ip2 section fig 11 these results indicate that the spatial and temporal patterns of thermal stratification are generally consistent with those of the schmidt stability figs 8 and 9e suggesting a reasonable estimation of the thermal stability 4 3 effects of causal factors on thermal stability the relationship between schmidt stability and associated causal factors is illustrated in fig 12 statistical results show that there are close relationships between the air temperature solar radiation evaporation river temperature maximum lake depth and the schmidt stability as reflected in the absolute values of pearson s r in the range of 0 33 0 67 p 0 01 fig 12 it was therefore concluded that the thermal regime of the lake is attributable to the combined effect of local meteorological conditions and hydrological forcings thus indicating how their impact in triggering the lake mixing process is limited in that they do not provide information about how thermal stability has changed over time to better understand the temporal response of the lake thermal regime to variations in external factors of poyang lake the air temperature solar radiation evaporation and river temperature were selected fig 12 and investigated in more detail in what follows the schmidt stability is used to examine the influence of external factors on thermal stability based on the outputs of the different model scenarios table 3 in general the simulation results show that the effects of external factors on the schmidt stability during the summer months are stronger than other months of the year fig 13 in the summer scenarios with high air temperature ms1 high solar radiation ms3 and high evaporation ms5 result in a more likely stratification than the baseline condition ms0 as reflected in an increased schmidt stability in the range of 10 20 j m2 these results coincide with the fact that a rapid response of water surface temperatures to climate is expected to accelerate the warming of the lake surface and strengthen thermal stratification in summer the high river inflow temperatures ms7 may facilitate water mixing and reduce temperature difference across the water column moreover the higher temperatures can also be associated with a decrease in thermal stability in contrast river inflow with low temperatures ms8 is likely to promote stronger stability and formation of stratification during other months of the year it can be observed that these external factors tend to have little effect on thermal stability fig 13 mainly because fast water flow dominates the preferred choices of factors that help maintain the water stability of poyang lake it is expected that the lake may exhibit different response to variations in external factors albeit the four representative areas of interest were selected for analysis in this study for example the stability in the lake bay has a more obvious response 10 20 j m2 to external changes than the other regions 10 j m2 fig 13 5 discussion floodplain lakes are highly dynamic systems that provide various ecosystem and environmental services for the local human and society zhang et al 2018 numerous studies have pointed out that the hydrological and thermal conditions are key factors influencing the physical chemical and biological properties in the floodplain lakes engle and melack 2000 townsend 2006 li et al 2016b the current study used a 3d hydrodynamic model to successfully reproduce the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics in the large floodplain of poyang lake to our knowledge this study is the first to simulate thermal stability in the lake water depths within the lake are generally less than 30 m li et al 2017a and modeling the thermal structure in the shallow areas of such floodplain lakes is a very challenging task beletsky and schwab 2001 as discussed by li et al 2014 it is reasonable to expect some amount of thermal stratification in poyang lake considering the outcomes of this study it is absolutely necessary to be aware of the approach of 3d hydrodynamic modeling for the simulations of lake water levels the 3d hydrodynamic model ens 0 96 0 99 r 2 0 95 0 99 and rmse 0 15 0 44 m fig 3 shows a slight improvement compared to the previous 2d model ens 0 95 0 99 r 2 0 97 0 99 and rmse 0 21 0 49 m by li et al 2017b additionally the present 3d model also indicates a slight improved water temperature simulations ens 0 96 r 2 0 96 0 99 and rmse 1 4 1 7 c relative to the previous 2d model ens 0 92 0 96 r 2 0 94 0 99 and rmse 1 5 1 9 c the good agreement between model and measurement demonstrates that thermal stratification with 3d models are reliable and hence an appropriate tool to evaluate the influences of climate changes and human activities on lake thermal structure and vertical stratification however some portion of the differences between modeled and measured data can be attributed to the simplification of spatial variability in meteorological forcings imberger 1985 the inappropriate choice of a turbulence submodel and or insufficient horizontal or vertical grid resolution beletsky and schwab 2001 it should be noted that the 1 year simulation of the current 3d model requires about 210 h on an intel core i7 pc while the previous 2d model takes only 12 h in addition some temperature related inputs variables and depth profile measurements are required to force and validate the 3d model which are not necessary to the 2d model however coupling meteorological and 3d lake hydrodynamic models is the next logical step in improving atmosphere forcings used in lake simulations further research and field work are also needed to improve 3d simulation of the lake using extended profile measurements across the lake climate change will also bring more frequent drastic events such as floods and droughts which is of high importance when managing water quality and the aquatic ecosystem as it may affect the circulation pattern and thermal stratification of lakes livingstone 2003 bertone et al 2015 the seasonal shift between dry and wet seasons in the poyang lake region is expected to accelerate the hydrological cycle fig 14 and increase the water holding capacity throughout the atmosphere previous studies indicate an increasing trend of annual mean air temperature up to 1 4 c and inflow volumes average 1 2 in the poyang lake catchment under future climate change fig 14 li et al 2016a such changes in climate and hydrological conditions are more likely to have a direct effect on the thermal stability of poyang lake which can be expected to have significant impacts on the transport and mixing processes of the lake therefore model simulations suggest that the lake water quality needs to be monitored more frequently in years with warming climate and unstable hydrological forcings further work planned for poyang lake should include the assessment of future climate and hydrological change effects on the seasonal dynamics of the thermal regime water quality aquatic ecosystem and lake health anthropogenic factors are expected to affect the thermal stability and hydrodynamic characteristics of lakes wang et al 2012 tuo et al 2018 many lakes in the middle and lower yangtze river that were once naturally connected with surrounding rivers have become dam regulated or isolated liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 backflow from the yangtze river and lowering river levels caused by the three gorges dam have already intensified the wet and dry processes of poyang lake li et al 2017a it is anticipated that the proposed hydraulic dam located in the downstream channel of poyang lake fig 15 will be designed to hold back water in dry seasons li 2009 in these cases the hydrodynamics water residence time thermal stability and transport processes e g nutrient and sediment are more likely to be disturbed throughout the lake fig 15 for example the proposed hydraulic dam will increase the lake water depths and reduce the water velocities wang et al 2015 this may result in strong spatial and temporal variations in thermal stability e g duration and degree of stratification during the dry seasons a new hydraulic dam can also have significant ecological impacts on the water quality and ecosystem of the lake consequently future studies are required to evaluate the influence of dam operation on the lake thermal dynamics and further to link some ecological models for exploring the ecological conditions of poyang lake fig 15 6 conclusions thermal regime in lakes has been shown previously to have significant implications for the lake s water quality and ecosystem the present study is the first to interrogate the spatiotemporal variations in thermal stability and the influence of key external changes on thermal stability within a large floodplain lake system poyang lake china the thermal stability and its causal factors in the lake were investigated using a 3d hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods overall the 3d model mike 3 successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics based on extensive field measurements during 2015 the simulations provide new insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of the thermal stability in poyang lake results show that the spatial variability of thermal stability exhibits similar pattern between the seasons that thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay of the lake while full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels in general the lake is stratified in summer and autumn partial mixed and mixed in winter and spring which occurs 20 10 and 70 time of the year respectively statistical and simulation results indicate positive relationships between the average stability and air temperature solar radiation and evaporation whereas a negative relationship with the river temperature was observed the responses of thermal stability to these external factors are much stronger in summer than other seasons of the year indicating a significant seasonal thermal regime in floodplain lakes additionally the lake bathymetry or water depth and associated hydrological alterations may be partly responsible for affecting the seasonal thermal stability of poyang lake

6878,thermal regime and its response to meteorological and hydrological forcings play an important role in controlling water quality and ecosystem of lakes many large floodplain lakes are subjected to significant river lake interactions and could benefit greatly from hydrodynamic modeling the current work presents a first attempt to use a 3d hydrodynamic model and statistical methods to explore spatiotemporal variations and primary causal factors of thermal stability within a large river lake floodplain system poyang lake china the hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics through a comparative analysis of field measurements simulation results revealed that the thermal stability of poyang lake exhibits similar spatial patterns between seasons however the lake is generally stratified during summer and early autumn it is classified as partial mixed and full mixed during winter and spring the thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay area of the lake while the full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels statistics and simulations indicate that the air temperature solar radiation and evaporation trigger a positive effect on the thermal stability of poyang lake whereas a negative relationship is recognized due to the catchment river temperature the responses of thermal stability to the meteorological and hydrological changes are much stronger in summer than other seasons producing a significant seasonal thermal regime in the floodplain lake additionally the dynamics in the lake water depth and associated hydrological regime are a major factor in maintaining the seasonal thermal stability of poyang lake the findings of this study can support management of poyang lake as well as other similar floodplain lakes by providing information on both water quality and ecosystem succession keywords 3d hydrodynamic model water temperature mixing and stratification thermal stability floodplain system poyang lake 1 introduction thermal regime characteristics such as water temperature thermal mixing and stratification play an important role in controlling water quality e g chemical and biological processes vertical exchange of water borne particles of various kinds and ecosystem succession e g cyanobacterial growth and dominance of lakes and reservoirs wahl and peeters 2014 wu et al 2016 barrett et al 2018 feng et al 2018 considerable attention to the impacts of rapid climate change and anthropogenic processes of the thermal regime has made headlines as politicians discuss global warming however climate change does affect heat and mass transport in many of the world s lakes wang et al 2012 kirillin and shatwell 2016 thermal stratification and mixing in lakes are driven by several factors ranging from lake morphometric characteristics kling 1988 hanna 1990 to lake hydrological conditions martin and mccutcheon 1999 lawson and anderson 2007 through to meteorological and climatic forcings stainsby et al 2011 read et al 2014 wahl and peeters 2014 lakes can be classified as stratified partially stratified mixed or vertically mixed and the variability associated with stratification ranges from hours to decades and varies on global and regional scales read et al 2011 bertone et al 2015 most lakes are in climatic zones with strong shifts between dry and wet seasons hence seasonal thermal conditions are fundamental for all physical chemical and biological processes in lakes boehrer and schultze 2008 therefore an improved understanding of thermal regimes is a key objective of limnology and can substantially aid in future assessment and management of the environmental state of lakes thermal regime and its causal factors in lakes have been extensively examined using field measurements and hydrodynamic models previous investigation includes the field based study of chowdhury et al 2015 who used a chain of fast response temperature loggers to examine the stratification and mixing in lake simcoe canada they found that the lake s mixing exhibits large spatial and temporal variability lawson and anderson 2007 used water temperature profiles to investigate the thermal regime in lake elsinore california they concluded that thermal stability strongly depends upon variations in lake water level changes to the thermal stability of lakes such as shorter duration of ice cover earlier onset of stratification and an increase in the length of the stratified period have already been observed in some lakes in north america and europe e g magnuson et al 2000 winder and schindler 2004 wilhelm and adrian 2008 stainsby et al 2011 many previous studies have applied a vertical 1d hydrodynamic model to explore the thermal stability and associated external responses for several lakes danis et al 2004 herb and stefan 2005 mackay 2009 read et al 2011 2014 hydrodynamic investigations include the application of heat exchange equations by tuan et al 2009 to model the 1d thermal stratification in shikinawa lake japan it was found that diurnal stratification is mainly affected by wind action while thermal heating plays a minor role during strong wind events in cases where the lake exhibits a complexity of lake bathymetry and a wide and continuous range of hydrodynamic variations analyses based on 1d models can become complicated wahl and peeters 2014 li et al 2017a indeed horizontal transport in such lakes may limit the accuracy of 1d models by assuming a vertical mixing process herb and stefan 2005 wahl and peeters 2014 therefore 3d hydrodynamic models are convenient and useful tools to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the lake thermal regime and its response to external forcings wang et al 2012 investigated the effects of climate and hydrological conditions on the thermal stability of the liuxihe reservoir china using a 3d elcom hydrodynamic model showing that water column stability is influenced by both natural factors and anthropogenic factors xue et al 2015 developed a 3d fvcom hydrodynamic model to explore the thermal response to meteorological forcings in lake superior at the america canada border they found that spatiotemporal variability of heat fluxes can have an important influence on the lake s 3d thermal structure arifin et al 2016 used a 3d efdc hydrodynamic model to simulate thermal behavior in lake ontario covering an area along the america canada border they concluded that the hydrodynamic model successfully reproduced the temperature profiles and thermal bar evolution additionally wu et al 2016 used the 3d efdc model to focus on the impact of thermal stability on pollutant transport in the hongfeng reservoir china showing that the spatiotemporal variations in stability are primarily affected by air temperature and water depth and hence control water age differences these previous efforts to elucidate thermal regime have mainly focused on lakes that do not exhibit complex floodplain characteristic zhang et al 2017 found that most floodplain lakes have considerable fluctuations in water level and often have highly variable hydrological and thermal dynamics floodplain lakes are generally large with many surrounding rivers which serve as inlets and outlets and constitute significant river lake floodplain systems zhang et al 2018 the thermal regime of floodplain lakes quickly respond to the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological and meteorological conditions and are therefore prone to changes in the external environment townsend 2006 wiklund et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 such knowledge of large floodplain lakes have received little attention compared with deeper lake systems li et al 2017b poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china shankman et al 2006 and represents significant biodiversity and ecological values that are of interest to the international wetland system yang et al 2018 thus poyang lake has become recognized as a significant floodplain system with complex river lake interactions zhang et al 2014 li et al 2015a which leads to highly dynamic hydrological and thermal regimes li et al 2017a b the natural fluctuations of the lake water level have attracted considerable public attention during the past decade hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 2014 li et al 2017a due to climate change and human activities that have resulted in significantly detrimental ecological and economic outcomes mei et al 2016 more importantly steadily deteriorating water quality and rapid environmental degradation have already intensified cheng and li 2006 and may be impacted further by operation of the three gorges dam and the proposed hydraulic dam located in the yangtze river s upstream and the lake s downstream respectively yang et al 2016 many studies have suggested that the floodplain poyang lake is vulnerable to hydrological alterations and thermal dynamics wu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 therefore knowledge of thermal regime behavior may have significant implications for water quality and nutrient exchange of the floodplain lake in previous studies of poyang lake several 2d hydrodynamic models of the lake were constructed and used to investigate lake hydrodynamics and or thermal dynamics e g lai et al 2013 cham li et al 2014 2017b yao et al 2018 mike 21 wang et al 2015 efdc mainly due to lack the information regarding the vertical thermal structures for example li et al 2017b used the depth averaged mike 21 model to examine the spatiotemporal behavior and primary causal factors of water surface temperature in poyang lake they concluded that the water surface temperature exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability and is mainly influenced by air temperature solar radiation wind speed and river temperature however the vertical processes of transport and mixing in these 2d hydrodynamic models have generally been oversimplified based on the assumption that the shallow and wide characteristics of the lake do not have enough substance or change to be modeled li et al 2014 in other words the circulation pattern and the associated thermal stratification of the lake were neglected in previous 2d modeling studies recently the thermal stratification and its causal factors have been of keen interest li et al 2016b investigated the thermal stratification and mixing of poyang lake using the depth profile measurements of water temperature they found that the lake has isothermal mixed layers from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion however even though their results may reasonably represent the thermal conditions in the lake s main flow channels the results did not apply to other regions of the lake the work was thus incomplete because it only focused on the limited observation points in the main flow channels at specific sampling periods this lack of sufficient records on environmental changes in floodplain lakes zhang et al 2018 left information gaps regarding thermal stability and its responses in the floodplain of poyang lake despite several previous studies into the thermal regime and its implications of poyang lake this study is the first to use a 3d hydrodynamic model and hence provides the first attempt to examine thermal stability within a large floodplain lake system our specific objectives were 1 to construct and validate a 3d hydrodynamic model to simulate the thermodynamics of the lake 2 to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of the thermal stability throughout the lake and 3 to investigate the influence of primary external changes on thermal stability using statistical and hydrodynamic approaches 2 study area poyang lake 28 4 29 46 n 115 49 116 46 e is an internationally recognized wetland system kanai et al 2002 with a significant seasonal shift between dry and wet seasons it is also the largest freshwater lake located at the south bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 poyang lake is one of the few lakes in china that remains naturally connected to its surrounding rivers zhang et al 2014 according to statistics the region s subtropical monsoon climate produces a mean annual precipitation and pan evaporation of 1485 mm yr and 1428 mm yr respectively poyang lake receives catchment runoffs from the ganjiang average 2585 m3 s fuhe 526 m3 s xinjiang 744 m3 s raohe 642 m3 s and xiushui 463 m3 s rivers fig 1 subsequently discharging into the yangtze river through a narrow outlet at the northern end of the lake shankman et al 2006 hu et al 2007 generally the five rivers provide around 89 of the inflow for the lake while the backflow from the yangtze river contributes approximately 3 of the inflow with the remaining sources made up mainly of minor streams groundwater discharge and rainfall to the lake surface li et al 2015a consequently the hydrological regime of poyang lake is mainly controlled by seasonal variations in both catchment river inflows and yangtze river water levels guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2017a these result in water level fluctuations range from 8 to 22 m each year and are associated with the dynamics in the water surface area of 1000 to 3000 km2 feng et al 2012 the lake is a prominent example of a highly dynamic system that expands and contracts annually creating extensive floodplain areas of 3000 km2 feng et

storage and biodiversity protection huang et al 2018 poyang lake is a geometrically complex lake with winding shorelines and an incised bottom morphology that is the lake has complex topographical features including main flow channels floodplains bays and islands fig 1 the topography of the lake varies from upland areas around the lake s floodplains at elevations of 28 m above sea level to lake s main channels at elevations of about 8 m fig 1 poyang lake has a maximum length and width of 173 km and 74 km respectively the lake is generally shallow with 85 of the lake less than about 6 m deep during flood seasons li et al 2017a in dry seasons spatial differences in the water surface elevation of the lake can reach up to 5 m with an incline to the north whereas the water surface profile is almost horizontal during flood periods li et al 2014 poyang lake exhibits spatially heterogeneous residence times that range from 20 to 300 days throughout the lake depending upon lake topography and associated hydrodynamic conditions li et al 2015b the water velocities in the lake s main flow channels are distinctly higher than their adjacent floodplains and other lake regions as observed from velocity profile measurements li et al 2016b 3 materials and methods a 3d hydrodynamic modeling was constructed and applied in this study to characterize hydrodynamics and thermodynamics in poyang lake hydrodynamic modeling is expected to provide insights into the characteristics of thermal regime and to investigate the effects of external changes on the thermal regime of the lake two stability indices of thermal stratification were applied to available hydrodynamic results to evaluate physical stratification and or mixing in the lake statistical and hydrodynamic analyses were selected to identify relationships between thermal stability and likely causal factors 3 1 data availability 3 1 1 routine observations meteorological conditions i e air temperature relative humidity solar radiation cloud cover wind speed wind direction precipitation and evaporation were observed at xingzi duchang and kangshan gauging stations fig 1 and data on these conditions were required to force the hydrodynamic model because none of these stations provide data on all the meteorological parameters meteorological data were retrieved from various stations table 1 river discharge and water temperature were collected from the six downstream gauging stations of the lake s catchment and were used to represent the five river inflows fig 1 the water levels and temperatures in poyang lake were obtained from the hukou xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations fig 1 these stations were selected to represent the spatial and temporal responses in lake conditions in this study all hydrometeorological data surrounding the lake see fig 1 and table 1 were available for the period of 2015 and were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province 3 1 2 in situ measurements the in situ measurements include water velocity and water temperature near the northern lake table 1 the velocity and temperature profiles were made at four locations xz1 xz2 xz3 and hk fig 1 on 4 february 14 april and 20 july 2015 velocity profiles were measured using an rdi 3 mhz workhorse sentinel from the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp line teledyne technologies inc usa in the bottom track mode the instrument was attached on a boat with the transducers submerged around 20 cm below the water surface to obtain an accurate profile during the entire period of measurement the temperature profiles were measured at the same locations using a hand held levelogger sensor solinst canada with an accuracy of 0 05 c the depth profiles were recorded at approximately 2 m increments from the surface of the water column down to the bottom point measurements of water temperature near the lake surface 0 5 m were conducted on 15 january 22 points 10 april 24 points 15 july 73 points and 15 october 22 points 2015 locations are shown in fig 5 water temperature was measured using a hydrolab datasonde 5 multiprobe sensor sutron corporation usa throughout different lake regions 3 2 3d hydrodynamic model 3 2 1 model description and setup this study used a 3d hydrodynamic model mike 3 2012 version powered by dhi denmark to investigate the flow characteristics and thermal stratification of poyang lake the mike 3 model is based on a cell centered finite volume method with an unstructured mesh to permit accurate representation of complex surface water bodies danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 the momentum equations used are the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations employing hydrostatic pressure and the boussinesq assumption danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 this model has been used to study a number of rivers reservoirs lakes and estuaries and has proven effective in simulating transport and mixing processes zeinoddini et al 2009 venugopal and nemalidinne 2014 waldman et al 2017 the current mike 3 model is constructed and based on a previous 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model of poyang lake li et al 2014 2017a the simulated domain of the lake covers the maximum flood inundation area of 3124 km2 fig 2 the bathymetry is thought to have been relatively stable during the previous 40 years lai et al 2014 albeit bathymetry changes were observed in the vicinity of the outlet channel due to human activities yao et al 2018 therefore the bathymetry in 2000 30 m 30 m was interpolated to a total of 20 450 triangular elements the element sizes were adjusted by trial and error and varied from 70 m in the flow channels to 1500 m in the floodplains fig 2 regarding the vertical discretization the model displayed low sensitivity to the number of vertical layers hence 10 equidistant sigma layers were used across the water depth 3 2 2 model boundary and initial conditions the lake shoreline was defined throughout as an impermeable zero normal velocity boundary while the lake bottom was an impermeable boundary with spatial resistance specified by variable roughness heights for vegetation area marshland and permanent water the lake upstream boundaries were specified as time varying river inflows and temperatures using the gauge observations and the lower boundary condition was specified as the observations of water levels and temperature at the hukou gauging station see black dots in fig 1 although meteorological parameters on the lake surface are highly seasonal the spatial variability is thought to have a limited effect on the lake hydrodynamics yao et al 2016 li et al 2017a therefore spatially uniform but time varying meteorological parameters included air temperature relative humidity solar radiation cloud cover wind speed wind direction precipitation and evaporation table 1 these were used to represent atmosphere conditions in the hydrodynamic model the water temperature is invoked from the specification of baroclinic condition i e density depends on temperature the simulation period covered 365 days from 1 january to 31 december 2015 the initial values of water elevation were prescribed as the lake water surface using observations from hukou xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations fig 1 while the initial water velocities were set to zero all through the model domain the initial values of water temperature were set to 10 c throughout the domain a spin up time of two weeks included meteorological and hydrological conditions which were used to avoid the effects of initial conditions on modeling results the minimum time step is restricted to 0 1 s to keep the target courant friedrich levy cfl condition number of 1 0 the numerical option of wetting and drying in the model was adopted and followed the rule h dry 0 005 m h flood 0 05 m h wet 0 1 m danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 the horizontal eddy viscosity is presented by the smagorinsky formulation and vertical eddy viscosity is by the standard k epsilon turbulence model in which transport equations are solved for both turbulent kinetic energy and energy dissipation other key parameters used in the current 3d hydrodynamic model of poyang lake are presented in table 2 these are based on values from published studies on poyang lake li et al 2014 2017a b and from other modeling investigations from weinberger and vetter 2012 bueche and vetter 2014 and alosairi et al 2018 3 3 index of thermal stratification 3 3 1 schmidt stability the resistance to mechanical mixing due to the potential energy inherent in the stratification of the water column was defined by idso 1973 we present idso s version of the schmidt stability index j m2 here as idso 1973 1 s g a 0 z 0 z m a z z z ρ z ρ d z where a 0 is the surface area of the lake m2 a z is the lake area at water depth z m ρ z is the density kg m3 calculated from the temperature at depth z ρ is the volume weighted mean density of the water column z is the depth where the mean density occurs dz is the depth interval and g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 the density of water ρ t at any given temperature t c was calculated as martin and mccutcheon 1999 2 ρ t 1000 1 t 288 9414 508929 2 t 68 12963 t 3 9863 2 the schmidt stability function has been extensively applied to evaluate the thermal stratification strength and found a range of stability of 0 5784 j m2 read et al 2011 schmidt stability is a measure of water column stability and indicates the amount of work required to mix the lake to an isothermal condition wetzel 2001 lawson and anderson 2007 the zero value indicates the water column is isothermal and the maximum value indicates the water column is most strongly stratified stainsby et al 2011 wang et al 2012 3 3 2 richardson s layer number the physical interpretation of the richardson s layer number dimensionless can be used to identify the lake mixing partial mixing stratification and stratification dyer and new 1986 bárcena et al 2016 the classical richardson s layer number is linked to the hydrodynamic key variables water levels velocities and densities and can be expressed as follows bowden 1978 3 r i l t g h t δ ρ t ρ t u t 2 where t is the time h t is the depth of the water column m δ ρ t is the density at the bottom minus that at the surface kg m3 ρ t is the vertical depth averaged density kg m3 and u t is the vertical depth averaged velocity m s for ril 20 the water column is highly stable with low vertical mixing i e stratification for 20 ril 2 mixing is increasingly active due to turbulence partial mixing stratification for ril 2 fully developed mixing occurs mixing and the threshold value of ril provides a reasonable estimate of water column stability dyer and new 1986 3 4 model validation and simulation scenario the 3d hydrodynamic model was validated using the observed lake water levels xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations the near surface water temperature xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan the depth profiles of water velocity and temperature xz1 xz2 xz3 and hk and the measured water temperature throughout the lake 141 points to evaluate the model s performance three statistical methods were used to compare simulated and measured data li et al 2017b including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse the ideal value for ens and r 2 is 1 and the ideal value for rmse is 0 the 3d hydrodynamic model was used to examine the effects of variations in external factors air temperature solar radiation evaporation and river temperature see section 4 3 for more details on the thermal regime in poyang lake the validated model was selected to represent the baseline conditions ms0 in the lake where the external factors followed an observed time series in 2015 other scenarios ms1 ms8 were intended to simulate the effect of input conditions by adding offset values to the observed daily data or multiplying them by a factor table 3 the modifications of the local climate and hydrological conditions and forcing functions are similar to a previous approach by li et al 2017b 4 results 4 1 validation of modeling results time series comparisons between the observed and modeled lake water levels at xingzi duchang sheshan and kangshan gauging stations are shown in fig 3 the ens of the four gauging stations varied from 0 96 to 0 99 and r 2 ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 the rmse values of all stations were less than about 0 4 m suggesting an accurate agreement in both phase and magnitude for the four gauging stations the mike 3 model predicted well the observed daily water temperatures at the four gauging stations producing r 2 and rmse in ranges of 0 96 0 99 and 1 4 1 7 c respectively fig 4 the values of ens at all stations can reach up to 0 96 suggesting a satisfactory accuracy in the model results however the water levels and temperatures led to estimates that were somewhat underestimated and overestimated as illustrated by the dry seasons in figs 3 and 4 it is expected that the water temperature is likely to exhibit more complex responses than the water level to the external changes overall these results demonstrate that the mike 3 model has the ability to capture dynamic changes of the hydrodynamic and thermal regime of poyang lake based on visual inspection and statistical evaluation fig 5 shows the regression analysis and coefficient of determination for the measured and modeled temperature 0 5 m below the surface at different time periods the scatter plots show the r 2 value for the line of best fit to be between 0 80 and 0 90 at the four periods evidenced by more scattered points in 15 january and 15 october and less scattered but systematically shifted points in the other two periods the results on the other hand show better agreement with smaller bias and a better spatial pattern of near surface water temperature fig 6 shows that the simulated results closely match the measured velocity profiles and indicate that the model has the capability to predict the hydrodynamic field in the lake discrepancies 0 2 m s between model and measurements can be observed at a shallow water depth 2 m below the surface of the lake this could be due to the spatially uniform wind forcing which does not consider local effects the surface layer of the lake is prone to respond to an accelerated wave velocity responding rapidly to wind forcing the physical variation of the lake such as irregular shoreline and bathymetry characteristics may lead to intrinsic differences between the model and the field data fig 7 shows the temperature profiles of simulated and field measurements for the three time periods of the lake at different locations an almost isothermal temperature profile i e difference 1 c in the entire water column was satisfactorily reproduced by the model on 4 february and 14 april 2015 the simulation underestimated and or overestimated the water temperatures by up to 1 c especially in the surface and bottom layers of the lake in summer 20 july the strong stratification 3 4 c difference and the depth of the thermocline position 6 m below the surface are reasonably captured by the model at different locations although the intensity of the simulated stratification appears to be weaker than the observed conditions e g 20 july the current simulations are assumed to be acceptable for reproducing the seasonal water temperature variation and relevant mixing and transport processes 4 2 spatiotemporal pattern of thermal stability fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of the seasonal schmidt stability index calculated from temperature profiles throughout the lake during the springtime fig 8a the lake wide schmidt stability shows distinct spatial variability where the index can reach up to 131 j m2 stratification is likely to occur in the lake center area especially in the eastern bay adjacent to the main flow channel while the possible mixing areas are observed in the river mouth the floodplains and the northern flow channel of the lake in summer the mean schmidt stability shows a large spatial variability with an index in the range of 4 1314 j m2 fig 8b the stability pattern appears to reflect signatures of longitude variation with the most likely stratification in most areas in the center and eastern area of the lake index 600 j m2 although the schmidt stability in the lake shows relatively complex distributions during the autumn and winter seasons fig 8c and d the thermal stability exhibited a similar spatial pattern to that in spring and summer fig 8a and b additionally it is expected that the water temperature profile in the summer presents more stratification up to 4 c difference than that in other seasons 1 c as shown in fig 9 a d in general the most likely thermal stratification may develop in the center and eastern bay of the lake while the mixing is likely to occur in other lake regions e g the floodplains and the northern flow channels fig 9e it is noteworthy that the seasonal change of the lake water levels see fig 3 shows very similar variations to that of the thermal stabilities in different lake regions fig 9e it follows that the lake bathymetry or water depth and hydrological alterations may be at least partly responsible for affecting the spatial pattern of thermal stability at a seasonal scale richardson s layer number calculations were made using the simulated temperature profiles for the four representative areas of the lake fig 10 at different lake regions results show that the layer numbers were generally observed to be low in the winter months typically 2 and often in range of 2 20 indicating a vertically mixed 70 time of the year or partially mixed type 10 time of the year while much higher layer numbers are presented in summer and early autumn values were often 20 and occasionally ranged from 2 to 20 suggesting a seasonal stratification 20 time of the year in general the lake is mixed and partial mixed in winter and spring then stratified later in summer and autumn the area covered by the vertical stratification type was largest in the center and the eastern bay of the lake i e the layer number which can go up to 180 fig 10b and d where the strong temperature differences can reach up to 4 c for both the two sections i e the ip2 ip3 and ip3 ip4 fig 11 while the lake s main flow channel and the shallow floodplain areas appear to be fully mixed due to the fast water flows with an isothermal water column 1 c for the ip1 ip2 section fig 11 these results indicate that the spatial and temporal patterns of thermal stratification are generally consistent with those of the schmidt stability figs 8 and 9e suggesting a reasonable estimation of the thermal stability 4 3 effects of causal factors on thermal stability the relationship between schmidt stability and associated causal factors is illustrated in fig 12 statistical results show that there are close relationships between the air temperature solar radiation evaporation river temperature maximum lake depth and the schmidt stability as reflected in the absolute values of pearson s r in the range of 0 33 0 67 p 0 01 fig 12 it was therefore concluded that the thermal regime of the lake is attributable to the combined effect of local meteorological conditions and hydrological forcings thus indicating how their impact in triggering the lake mixing process is limited in that they do not provide information about how thermal stability has changed over time to better understand the temporal response of the lake thermal regime to variations in external factors of poyang lake the air temperature solar radiation evaporation and river temperature were selected fig 12 and investigated in more detail in what follows the schmidt stability is used to examine the influence of external factors on thermal stability based on the outputs of the different model scenarios table 3 in general the simulation results show that the effects of external factors on the schmidt stability during the summer months are stronger than other months of the year fig 13 in the summer scenarios with high air temperature ms1 high solar radiation ms3 and high evaporation ms5 result in a more likely stratification than the baseline condition ms0 as reflected in an increased schmidt stability in the range of 10 20 j m2 these results coincide with the fact that a rapid response of water surface temperatures to climate is expected to accelerate the warming of the lake surface and strengthen thermal stratification in summer the high river inflow temperatures ms7 may facilitate water mixing and reduce temperature difference across the water column moreover the higher temperatures can also be associated with a decrease in thermal stability in contrast river inflow with low temperatures ms8 is likely to promote stronger stability and formation of stratification during other months of the year it can be observed that these external factors tend to have little effect on thermal stability fig 13 mainly because fast water flow dominates the preferred choices of factors that help maintain the water stability of poyang lake it is expected that the lake may exhibit different response to variations in external factors albeit the four representative areas of interest were selected for analysis in this study for example the stability in the lake bay has a more obvious response 10 20 j m2 to external changes than the other regions 10 j m2 fig 13 5 discussion floodplain lakes are highly dynamic systems that provide various ecosystem and environmental services for the local human and society zhang et al 2018 numerous studies have pointed out that the hydrological and thermal conditions are key factors influencing the physical chemical and biological properties in the floodplain lakes engle and melack 2000 townsend 2006 li et al 2016b the current study used a 3d hydrodynamic model to successfully reproduce the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics in the large floodplain of poyang lake to our knowledge this study is the first to simulate thermal stability in the lake water depths within the lake are generally less than 30 m li et al 2017a and modeling the thermal structure in the shallow areas of such floodplain lakes is a very challenging task beletsky and schwab 2001 as discussed by li et al 2014 it is reasonable to expect some amount of thermal stratification in poyang lake considering the outcomes of this study it is absolutely necessary to be aware of the approach of 3d hydrodynamic modeling for the simulations of lake water levels the 3d hydrodynamic model ens 0 96 0 99 r 2 0 95 0 99 and rmse 0 15 0 44 m fig 3 shows a slight improvement compared to the previous 2d model ens 0 95 0 99 r 2 0 97 0 99 and rmse 0 21 0 49 m by li et al 2017b additionally the present 3d model also indicates a slight improved water temperature simulations ens 0 96 r 2 0 96 0 99 and rmse 1 4 1 7 c relative to the previous 2d model ens 0 92 0 96 r 2 0 94 0 99 and rmse 1 5 1 9 c the good agreement between model and measurement demonstrates that thermal stratification with 3d models are reliable and hence an appropriate tool to evaluate the influences of climate changes and human activities on lake thermal structure and vertical stratification however some portion of the differences between modeled and measured data can be attributed to the simplification of spatial variability in meteorological forcings imberger 1985 the inappropriate choice of a turbulence submodel and or insufficient horizontal or vertical grid resolution beletsky and schwab 2001 it should be noted that the 1 year simulation of the current 3d model requires about 210 h on an intel core i7 pc while the previous 2d model takes only 12 h in addition some temperature related inputs variables and depth profile measurements are required to force and validate the 3d model which are not necessary to the 2d model however coupling meteorological and 3d lake hydrodynamic models is the next logical step in improving atmosphere forcings used in lake simulations further research and field work are also needed to improve 3d simulation of the lake using extended profile measurements across the lake climate change will also bring more frequent drastic events such as floods and droughts which is of high importance when managing water quality and the aquatic ecosystem as it may affect the circulation pattern and thermal stratification of lakes livingstone 2003 bertone et al 2015 the seasonal shift between dry and wet seasons in the poyang lake region is expected to accelerate the hydrological cycle fig 14 and increase the water holding capacity throughout the atmosphere previous studies indicate an increasing trend of annual mean air temperature up to 1 4 c and inflow volumes average 1 2 in the poyang lake catchment under future climate change fig 14 li et al 2016a such changes in climate and hydrological conditions are more likely to have a direct effect on the thermal stability of poyang lake which can be expected to have significant impacts on the transport and mixing processes of the lake therefore model simulations suggest that the lake water quality needs to be monitored more frequently in years with warming climate and unstable hydrological forcings further work planned for poyang lake should include the assessment of future climate and hydrological change effects on the seasonal dynamics of the thermal regime water quality aquatic ecosystem and lake health anthropogenic factors are expected to affect the thermal stability and hydrodynamic characteristics of lakes wang et al 2012 tuo et al 2018 many lakes in the middle and lower yangtze river that were once naturally connected with surrounding rivers have become dam regulated or isolated liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 backflow from the yangtze river and lowering river levels caused by the three gorges dam have already intensified the wet and dry processes of poyang lake li et al 2017a it is anticipated that the proposed hydraulic dam located in the downstream channel of poyang lake fig 15 will be designed to hold back water in dry seasons li 2009 in these cases the hydrodynamics water residence time thermal stability and transport processes e g nutrient and sediment are more likely to be disturbed throughout the lake fig 15 for example the proposed hydraulic dam will increase the lake water depths and reduce the water velocities wang et al 2015 this may result in strong spatial and temporal variations in thermal stability e g duration and degree of stratification during the dry seasons a new hydraulic dam can also have significant ecological impacts on the water quality and ecosystem of the lake consequently future studies are required to evaluate the influence of dam operation on the lake thermal dynamics and further to link some ecological models for exploring the ecological conditions of poyang lake fig 15 6 conclusions thermal regime in lakes has been shown previously to have significant implications for the lake s water quality and ecosystem the present study is the first to interrogate the spatiotemporal variations in thermal stability and the influence of key external changes on thermal stability within a large floodplain lake system poyang lake china the thermal stability and its causal factors in the lake were investigated using a 3d hydrodynamic modeling and statistical methods overall the 3d model mike 3 successfully reproduced the lake hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics based on extensive field measurements during 2015 the simulations provide new insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of the thermal stability in poyang lake results show that the spatial variability of thermal stability exhibits similar pattern between the seasons that thermal stratification may develop in the center area and eastern bay of the lake while full mixing is likely to occur in the floodplains and the main flow channels in general the lake is stratified in summer and autumn partial mixed and mixed in winter and spring which occurs 20 10 and 70 time of the year respectively statistical and simulation results indicate positive relationships between the average stability and air temperature solar radiation and evaporation whereas a negative relationship with the river temperature was observed the responses of thermal stability to these external factors are much stronger in summer than other seasons of the year indicating a significant seasonal thermal regime in floodplain lakes additionally the lake bathymetry or water depth and associated hydrological alterations may be partly responsible for affecting the seasonal thermal stability of poyang lake

6879,in this paper a model is proposed for the assessment of the effectiveness of various mulches in increasing deep percolation of rainfalls for enhancing arid zones aquifers for this purpose 8 precipitations were selected from the intensity duration frequency idf curves of the study area with a return period of 2 and 5 years the deep percolation of these precipitations were examined in lysimeters with gravel sand and mixed mulches and without any mulch then 192 data of soil moisture daily maximum air temperature and deep percolation were measured for driving empirical equations moreover the efficiency and accuracy of these empirical equations were investigated using coefficient of determination cd and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsec the results showed that the obtained empirical equations could estimate deep percolation and evaporation with an acceptable accuracy using these equations and the soil water balance equation a soil moisture model was developed for the assessment of deep percolation then it was examined to evaluate the efficiency of the mulched soils in increasing soil moisture and aquifer recharging of three years precipitations in shahrekord plain iran the results showed that the deep percolation increased in all examined mulched soils compared to unmulched soil its maximum and cumulative increase were in gravel mulch with 21 3 and 30 respectively furthermore groundwater modeling results showed that the mulching could improve groundwater level as 0 34 m over a three year period finally this paper proposes soil mulching for enhancing groundwater resources and a model to assess it keywords assessment model mulch recharge lysimeter shahrekord plain gms 1 introduction groundwater is one of the main sources of water supply in arid and semi arid regions of the world given the growing demand of the world s population the use of groundwater is increasing in arid areas around the world taylor and howard 1996 due to the high contribution of groundwater to water supply in arid and semi arid regions of the world it is essential to enhance these valuable water resources on the other hand the role of deep percolation of precipitations is very important for groundwater recharging and directly impacts on groundwater balance liu et al 2011 since the deep percolation of surface water and precipitation are the main cause of groundwater recharge barrett et al 1999 increasing deep percolation can enhance groundwater resources furthermore in arid and semi arid regions of the world where surface water is rare the deep percolation of precipitation even in small amounts can be significant for recharging aquifers gao et al 2018 therefore the investigation of possible solutions to increase the amount of percolation of precipitations into the aquifers may have appropriate effects on the conservation and restoration of groundwater resources high evaporation rate is one of the greatest key factors which causes water losses especially in dry areas moreover the high evaporation losses in these areas can lead to a drop in groundwater level piri et al 2009 thus controlling and decreasing evaporation rate as one of the key factors of water loss can have an effective role in preserving water resources in these areas soheylifar et al 2013 one of the traditional methods for reducing evaporation from the soil surface is applying mulches li et al 2018 peng et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 any material that covers soil surface and protects it from sunlight for decreasing evaporation is called mulch yaghi et al 2013 literature review showed the positive effect of mulch on reducing the evaporation from the soil surface hou et al 2010 wang et al 2014a wang et al 2014b decreasing wind erosion hagen 2010 he et al 2008 control of dust storm edvardsson 2010 goodrich et al 2009 and reducing soil erosion by runoff adekalu et al 2007 huang et al 2013 however mulch s effect on deep percolation to increase aquifer recharge is not yet reported for example in a study by hou et al 2010 the effects of plastic mulch on soil temperature evapotranspiration rate plant growth and crop yield were examined in a dry area in china the results showed an increase of 2 to 9 degrees celsius c in soil temperature and decrease in the rate of evapotranspiration during 60 days of the experiment in another study wang et al 2014a examined the effect of vegetation mulch on groundwater recharge in this research the increasing effect of using lawn and straw cover on the ground surface on groundwater recharge was appraised in a sand box of 1 5 1 3 1 m in this research the groundwater flow was experimentally tested in the box the results indicated that the groundwater recharge by irrigation increased up to 39 1 and 42 2 respectively by using lawn and straw mulch wang et al 2014b examined the effect of sandy mulch thickness on a silty loam soil temperature evaporation from soil surface water productivity and watermelon yield in a semi arid region in china the results showed that mulch thickness has a positive effect on reducing evaporation depth and control of soil temperature fluctuations in another study chen et al 2015 examined the impact of using another type of mulch plastic mulch with straw mulch on the crop yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in a dry climate of china their results showed that the use of mulch could increase water use efficiency ranged from 25 to 35 at different time intervals in most studies considering the positive effect of mulch on reducing evaporation and keeping more water in the soil it has been attempted to investigate the effect of mulch on the crop yields and reducing irrigation water consumption however less attention has been paid to the positive effect of mulch on storing rainwater in soil by reducing evaporation as well as increasing the deep percolation of precipitation in some studies the permeability rate was investigated to determine the effect of mulch on preventing soil erosion and runoff formation adekalu et al 2007 huang et al 2013 the effectiveness of these mulches in reducing evaporation and increasing soil moisture has been well studied in previous studies and the results show their positive effect on maintaining soil moisture chakraborty et al 2010 li et al 2009 li et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 in most of these researches studies were carried out on experimental models like laboratory channels with high longitude and less than one meter depth of soil in most cases less than 30 to 40 cm cm soil depth however direct groundwater recharge is always due to the percolating rainwater into the depth more than crops root zone which is known as deep percolation the higher depth of precipitation has higher deep percolation and as a result the higher volume of groundwater recharge orr et al 2002 counting the root depth of some plants which reaches even one meter measuring the percolation rate in laboratory flumes with less than one meter depths cannot be a good supposition for measuring the groundwater recharge caused by rainwater considering above reviewed papers the effect of mulch on soil moisture crop yield and soil erosion prevention have been investigated nevertheless the effect of mulch on the aquifer recharge rate by the deep percolation of rainwater by soil mulching has not been simulated physically and numerically consequently in this paper the efficiency of gravel sand and mixed mulches on increasing the groundwater recharge by soil mulching is assessed in a semi arid region aquifer shahrekord aquifer iran therefore it reveals how mulches can be effective in maintaining soil moisture reducing evaporation and increasing the deep percolation rate of rainwater into the soil thus recharging aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the study area is in the central regions of iran between 32 5 32 34 n latitudes and 50 33 51 10 e longitude namely shahrkord aquifer fig 1 shows the location of the study area in the center of iran in this research to simulate precipitation and performing experiments the precipitation data of the shahrekord rainfall gauge was used which is near the center of study area the average annual temperature of this area is 11 c and the average annual precipitation is 414 8 mm mm 2 2 tested mulch crop residues leaves straw and etc plastic gravel and sand zeolite paper liquid mulches and textiles are the most commonly used mulch which have been reported in studies to reduce evaporation and prevent soil erosion since the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of mulches in increasing the deep percolating of rainwater it is necessary that the investigated mulch be able to prevent water evaporation from the soil surface and to have enough permeability for the deep percolation of rainwater furthermore the selected mulch should be low cost and available in the region to be practically applicable and economic according to the investigations conducted in the study area the suitable mulch for these purposes are gravel and sand mulches in this research three types of gravel and sand compounds were used as mulches 100 gravel 100 sand and gravel and sand 50 50 mixture the thickness of each mulch layer was 7 cm sand grain size varied from 0 07 to 4 mm and gravel grain size varied from 4 to 20 mm the shape factor of both sand and gravel were 0 7 2 3 experimental setup and analysis in this research circular volumetric lysimeters with depths of 1 4 m and 40 cm diameter were used to assess the mulches efficiency in increasing the rainwater percolation into the vadose zone and aquifer media the use of 1 4 meter depth lysimeters provides the possibility of measuring deep percolation to control similarity of soil bulk density in lysimeters the same weight of soil used for the same volume of lysimeters moreover to control soil bulk density in various depths of lysimeters the same weight of soil used in each layer of lysimeters thus lysimeters had the same distribution of soil bulk density in their depths to evaluate mulch efficiency in increasing rainwater percolation into the soil it is necessary to create artificial rain with different intensity and duration for this purpose a rain simulator with similar dimensions to the area of lysimeters was made in this research fig 2 this rain simulator consists of three parts tank flow control valve and sprinkler nozzles in this experimental setup a nozzle was considered for each lysimeter which was connected to the tank through a separate path the task of the tank is to create a constant water head on each sprinkler and for this purpose a floater valve was used to control water level this tank was connected to the urban water flow and controlling water level prevented possible fluctuations in the heads of the nozzles furthermore in the water transfer path from the tank to the sprinklers of each lysimeter a flow control valve was placed that provides the possibility for changing water pressure on the nozzles flow separately accordingly by adjusting water pressure of nozzles it is possible to adjust the amount of their discharge and thus regulate the intensity of simulated rainfall to increase the accuracy of the simulation the soil texture of the lysimeters was selected using the average of drilling logs in the study area and the rainfall intensity was determined using the intensity duration frequency idf curves of the study area for this purpose four precipitation durations 2 4 6 and 8 h were tested the precipitation intensity proportional to these durations was obtained using idf curves of the study area for two return periods of 2 and 5 years which have high occurrence frequency and these rainfall intensities were created artificially by the rainfall simulator in the experiments in this way each of the three mulches and a control lysimeter the lysimeter without mulch were tested using eight different combinations of precipitation intensity and duration which the precipitation depths are shown in table 1 to measure soil water storage during the experiment five gypsum block sensors were installed at depths of 30 60 90 110 and 125 cm of the lysimeter soil surface and using these blocks soil moisture were measured and recorded during the experiments detail of calibration of by gypsum block sensors and measurement by them can be found in keyhani 2010 the effect of using mulch on increasing the rainwater deep percolation was investigated by measuring the outflows from the bottom of the lysimeters with mulch cover and comparing it with the non mulched lysimeter control lysimeter the effect of using mulch on groundwater recharge was investigated by measuring the soil water storage and the outflows from the bottom of the lysimeters the evaporation from the lysimeters were determined using water balance in soil eq 1 piri et al 2009 1 e p o δ s where e is the evaporation depth p is the precipitation depth o is the outflow depth from a lysimeter deep percolation depth and δ s is change in soil water storage all parameters are in mm therefore by measuring values of o and δ s during the experiment and given the known amount of p which is artificial rainfall e can be obtained for an experiment in this paper by measuring these parameters two empirical equations were developed using the experimental results to estimate the precipitation deep percolation and evaporation depths in soils with mulch and without mulch accordingly the deep percolation depth was determined as a function of precipitation depth and soil moisture eq 2 moreover the evaporation depth was determined as a function of daily maximum air temperature and soil moisture eq 3 curve expert professional 2 6 3 software was used to find the best equation that expresses the relation between dependent and independent variables eqs 2 and 3 this software is able fit different equations on experimental data 2 o f s p 3 e f s t to evaluate the efficiency of the obtained empirical equations coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe

respectively the mean of observed and simulated values of the examined parameter and m is the number of experimental data singh 1988 furthermore for verifying the obtained empirical equations the mean

temperature and precipitation data of the study area were obtained for a period of three years 2010 2013 and by solving the eq 1 and using the empirical equations eqs 2 and 3 the daily depth of precipitation evaporation and deep percolation were modeled then the daily values of evaporation from the soil and precipitation deep percolation were calculated using the daily values of daily maximum air temperature and precipitation of the study area by using the empirical equations eqs 2 and 3 next using eq 1 the soil moisture was determined for the next day using this algorithm the soil moisture precipitation deep percolation and evaporation for each day of the studied three years and for each tested mulch and unmulched soil were computed for the study area 2 4 numerical modeling in the final step of this research the modflow code was used to assess the effect of using mulch on groundwater level conceptual model of shahrekord aquifer was considered using aquifer recharge discharge sources and boundary conditions in modflow model with 500 500 m grid for steady and unsteady conditions the aquifer was simulated for a 3 year period from september 2010 to september 2013 which the first 2 years were for calibration and the last year was for model validation the simulation time step was monthly september 2010 was used for initial condition the values obtained for deep percolation were calculated for each precipitation daily for three years were used as input recharge data for the modflow model finally the groundwater levels were evaluated monthly for each of the three mulched and unmulched soils 3 results and discussion during the experiments soil moisture was measured at 5 different depths and maximum air temperature along with precipitation deep percolation measured on daily basis thus 192 data were recorded for the parameters using these data and eq 2 an empirical equation was established to estimate the aquifer recharge using soil moisture and precipitation rate for each mulched and unmulched soil which is shown as eq 8 the coefficients of this empirical equation for different mulches are according to table 2 8 o p s a b p c s where o is the drained water depth from the soil groundwater recharge p is the precipitation depth and s is the soil water storage all in mm using eq 8 and the coefficients of table 2 it is possible to estimate the deep percolation caused by different precipitations in each studied mulched and unmulched soils in various soil profiles it is possible to calibrate eq 8 and obtain the corresponding coefficients in the same way later the efficiency and accuracy of the obtained empirical equations were evaluated by calculating cd and nsec using eqs 4 and 5 respectively the results are shown in table 2 table 2 shows the values of cd in all studied mulched and unmulched soils are between 0 97 and 0 98 which indicates that the eq 8 defines experimental data properly it is worth mentioning the highest value obtained for cd is for mixed mulch and the lowest is for unmulched soil furthermore the calculated nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients indicate the high efficiency of the obtained empirical equation eq 8 for estimating the amount of water drained from the soil and consequently the groundwater recharge an unit value for this index indicates a perfect match between the simulated value and the observed data singh 1988 according to table 2 the highest value of this index is for gravel mulch and the lowest is for unmulched soil therefore according to the high values of the used two evaluation indices it seems that in all three mulched soils and the unmulched soil the eq 8 can estimate the rate of deep percolation with acceptable accuracy consequently this equation can be used to estimate the amount of deep percolation for various precipitations consequently the evaporation depths of the lysimeters which determined using eq 1 were used to develop an empirical equation to compute the evaporation depth of three mulched and unmulched soils using daily maximum air temperature and soil water storage this empirical equation is shown in eq 9 and the coefficients of this empirical equation for each of the soil mulches are in table 3 9 e a s b t c s t 0 where e is the evaporation depth in mm t is daily maximum air temperature c and s is the soil water storage mm thus using eq 9 and its coefficients in table 3 the evaporation depth for each of the mulched soils as well as unmulched soil can be assessed using daily maximum air temperature and soil moisture then the efficiency of obtained empirical equation was evaluated using cd and nsec eqs 4 and 5 the evaluation results are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the values of cd in all studied mulched and unmulched soils are between 0 92 and 0 96 which indicates the good fit of the eq 9 on experimental data the highest value obtained for cd is for gravel mulch and the lowest is for unmulched soil the calculated values for nsec also indicate the high efficiency of the obtained empirical equation eq 9 for estimating the evaporation depth according to table 3 the highest value of this index is for mixed mulch and the lowest for unmulched soil according to the values of table 3 it seems that the eq 9 could estimate the evaporation depth using soil moisture and daily maximum air temperature with acceptable accuracy in all mulched and unmulched soils subsequently eqs 8 and 9 were validated with observed data for this purpose four different precipitation durations of 2 4 6 and 8 h were examined the rainfall intensities corresponding to these durations were also obtained from idf curves of the study area for the return period of 50 years then the values of daily maximum air temperature soil moisture and precipitation deep percolation were recorded daily the results were compared with the calculated results from eqs 8 and 9 fig 3 the estimation error of these empirical equations was also calculated by using eqs 6 and 7 as shown in table 4 according to table 4 the highest mbe index value in estimating evaporation is for unmulched soil 0 34 and the lowest value is for sand and mixed mulch 0 11 the negative value of this index in sand mulch indicates that the average of the estimated values for evaporation is lower than observed values conversely the positive value of this index indicates that in mixed mulch the average of the estimated values for evaporation parameter is higher than the observed values besides the lowest value of rmse index in estimating evaporation is for mixed mulch 0 02 the highest value of mbe index in estimating depth percolation is for mixed mulch 0 25 and the lowest value is for unmulched soil and sand mulch with 0 14 the negativity of these values indicates that the average of estimated values is lower than observed values considering the values of the mbe and rmse indices as well as fig 3 which indicates the concentration of data around the bisector it can be concluded that the proposed models have been able to estimate the parameters of evaporation and deep percolation in each of the examined mulched and unmulched soils with an acceptable accuracy accordingly the daily values of evaporation and deep percolation were computed by solving the eqs 1 8 and 9 from the daily maximum air temperature and precipitation data of the study area that were obtained for three years fig 4 shows the daily values of depth and deep percolation percentages from 9 23 2010 to 4 30 2011 in unmulched soil and gravel mulch gravel mulch had the best efficiency in increasing the daily deep percolation in this research as discussed above in this paper in this figure the dry period of year without precipitation are not displayed in fig 4 the horizontal axes show days of the rainy period during the first year of modeling 9 23 2010 to 4 30 2011 the daily precipitation depth and the deep percolation are shown in the upper and lower diagrams respectively according to fig 4 the precipitations that occurred at the beginning of the period have longer intervals between occurrences than the precipitations in the middle of the period from the hundredth day to the last day in both of gravel mulch and unmulched soils the percentage of deep percolation is higher in the middle precipitations of the period shorter intervals between rainfall occurrences than the initial precipitations longer intervals between rainfall occurrences for instance precipitations with a depth of less than 10 mm at the beginning of the period had percolation rate of less than 5 but toward the middle of the period this value is gradually increased to more than 10 therefore it can be said that the percentage of deep percolation is higher in precipitation with shorter intervals between their occurrences than the same precipitation with longer intervals between occurrences fig 5 presents the increase rate in soil moisture decrease rate in evaporation and increase rate in deep percolation in the examined mulches compared to the unmulched soil for monthly precipitation depth in the first year of modeling as shown in fig 5c the monthly precipitation depth in september is about one millimeter and much lower than the other months therefore when the amount of precipitation is insignificant there is no significant change in soil moisture increase evaporation reduction or increase in deep percolation when using mulch compared to soil without mulch in october increase in precipitation depth and the low soil water storage in the soil a significant percentage of precipitation is stored in soil as shown in fig 5b the gravel and mixed mulches increase the soil moisture compared to unmulched soil by 40 where this value for sand mulch was 10 evaporation depths also decreased in this month by using gravel and mixed mulch by more than 30 compared to unmulched soil fig 5a therefore in this month the use of mulch was able to preserve precipitation water in the soil and reduce the amount of evaporation loss compared to unmulched soil in november although the total precipitation depth was decreased compared to the previous month fig 5c the deep percolation of precipitation in all three examined mulches increased compared to the previous month fig 5d this could be due to preservation of soil water storage in the soil by using mulch in the previous month and thus increasing deep percolation of precipitation in this month according to fig 5d the increase in deep percolation in november was gravel mulch and mixed by 1 3 compared to unmulched soil increase in precipitation depth in december january and february fig 5c the deep percolation also increased in all three examined mulches in these months the greatest effect on increasing deep percolation is gravel mulch the highest value is in february of more than 4 compared to unmulched soil fig 5d for gravel mulch february soil water storage was increased by more than 5 and evaporation was decreased by more than 10 compared to unmulched soil fig 5b and a respectively this shows that during the cold months of the year when the amount of evaporation decreases and the precipitation depth increases for the mulched soils compared to soil without mulch the increase can be due to increase in moisture storage of mulched soils caused by precipitations with a lower depth and higher time intervals that occurred in the previous and warmer months of the year as mentioned earlier the evaporation depth from mulched soils decreases and this increases the soil water storage in these months in mulched soils when compared to unmulched soil thus it increased deep percolation in mulched soils in december january and february furthermore due to increase in daily maximum air temperature in march the increase of moisture storage caused by precipitation was 40 and the reduction in evaporation depth was the same amount comparing to unmulched soil it means by increasing temperature in the end of winter the impact of gravel mulch becomes more significant april s largest amount of increase was for gravel mulch 2 5 compared to unmulched soil therefore it can be concluded that the use of mulch increases soil moisture from precipitation reduces evaporation and increases deep percolation of precipitation in soil values vary based on precipitation depth time of occurrence and daily maximum air temperature in table 5 the deep percolation soil moisture and evaporation losses from 870 5 mm of precipitation during the studied three year period for all soils are shown using the results of modeling to find the percentage of deep percolation increased soil moisture and evaporation losses their absolute values are divided by the precipitation during the three year period 870 5 mm and multiplied by 100 according to table 5 the highest value for deep percolation is for gravel mulch with 185 56 mm depth and the lowest is for unmulched soil with 142 68 mm depth deep percolation increased in all the mulched soils compared to unmulched soil the highest value of deep percolation rate is for the gravel mulched soil by 21 3 which is 1 30 times of unmulched soil moreover the evaporation loss decreased in all three mulched soils and the highest values of reduction is for gravel and mixed mulches which are lower than unmulched soil by 26 and 19 7 respectively this reduction in evaporation losses in gravel and mixed mulches eventually led to increase in soil moisture during the studied period gravel and mixed mulches increase soil moisture by 21 1 and 15 8 respectively although the sand mulch could reduce the evaporation loss compared to unmulched soil it failed to maintain soil moisture at the end of the studied period additionally the soil moisture in sand mulch was not increased compared to the unmulched soil it seems the more air space in bulk the volume of gravel mulch keeps soil moisture better than sand mulch detail investigation of table 5 can be used for explanation of the improvement in deep percolation by the mulches comparison of evaporation losses in unmulched soil with sand mulch shows that the mulch decreased evaporation as 1 this decreased evaporation caused the same increase to the percolation this means sand mulch increases deep percolation by decreasing evaporation from soil comparison of evaporation losses in unmulched soil with the other mulches shows that the mulches decreased evaporation and similar percentage are added to the percolation or the increased soil moisture this means that the decreased evaporation losses transferred to deep percolation and caused increase in soil moisture above comparisons of the water balance values also show that sand much acts more like soil and only added small amount of deep percolation where the other mulches enhanced considerably both deep percolation and soil moisture to investigate the effect of mulching on the groundwater level the numerical simulation of the studied aquifer was modeled by using modflow code of gms10 2 software in this modeling the rmse of calibration in the steady state was 0 43 m and in unsteady state was 1 28 m which indicated that the modeling errors rate are acceptable in fig 6 the observed and calculated values of the model is shown in selected observation wells at the plain these observation wells were selected because they are scattered on the plain having observation wells from various parts of the plain north south east and west fig 6 represents a suitable estimation for groundwater level of observation wells for different time steps to identify suitable areas in the plain for mulching the land use map of shahrekord plain was prepared fig 7 to model the impact of mulching on the groundwater level it was assumed that in the plain area the agricultural land and rangeland were fully covered by the gravel mulch using this assumption the groundwater level was modeled by applying gms to find the impact of mulching on the groundwater level in fig 8 the increase in groundwater level at the end of the three year period is shown for each of the examined mulches as shown in fig 8 the mulching could increase the groundwater level compared to unmulched soil the values of increase in groundwater level for gravel sand and mixed mulches are equal to 0 9 0 2 and 0 7 m respectively in order to determine the exact values of increase in groundwater level during the three year period the average of groundwater level change throughout the aquifer due to mulching was calculated monthly for each of the examined mulches fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the increase in groundwater level for examined mulched soils compared to unmulched soil at the beginning of the period starts from zero and reaches its maximum value in march 2013 in the three examined mulches these changes begin from lowest values at the beginning of each year and at the end of the rainy season reach their maximum values and then begin to decrease at the end of the wet months the maximum groundwater level increase is 0 34 m in gravel mulch and the lowest groundwater level increase is 0 09 m in sand mulch therefore it can be said that the gravel mulched soil could increase the mean groundwater level compared to unmulched soil with a maximum of 0 34 m over a 3 year period this means that gravel mulch can be proposed to restore aquifers in arid regions among the examined mulches 4 conclusions in this study using the data obtained from the experiment two empirical equations were developed to estimate the deep percolation of precipitations using the soil moisture and precipitation depth and soil evaporation using the daily maximum air temperature and soil water storage for the examined mulched soils as well as unmulched soil to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed empirical equations cd and nsec were used the results of this evaluation showed that the obtained empirical equations were able to estimate deep percolation and evaporation from mulched and unmulched soils with an acceptable accuracy using the proposed empirical equations and the soil water balance equation the soil moisture model was developed then this model was tested using three year precipitation and daily maximum air temperature data of the region to evaluate the efficiency of mulching in increasing soil moisture and deep percolation of precipitation the results of the model showed that applying the mulches increases soil moisture caused by precipitation decreases evaporation and increases the deep percolation of precipitation the highest percentage of increase in deep percolation was in gravel mulch with 21 3 which is 30 increase compared to unmulched soil furthermore the evaporation loss decreases in all three mulched soils compared to unmulched soil and the highest values of reduction was for gravel and mixed mulches as gravel and mixed mulches increased soil moisture by 21 1 and 15 8 respectively according to the results of this study it was found that the percentage of deep percolation is higher in precipitation with shorter time intervals between rainfall occurrences than the same precipitation with longer intervals between occurrences groundwater modeling results showed that the mulched soils could improve deep percolation and increase the groundwater level by 0 34 m in a three year period in conclusion by using gravel mulch groundwater as one of the water supply sources in arid areas can be improved by maintaining soil moisture and increasing deep percolation of precipitation and thus gravel mulch can be proposed for restoring aquifers acknowledgements the authors appreciate rashelle duersch of utah state university for checking english writing of this paper 
6879,in this paper a model is proposed for the assessment of the effectiveness of various mulches in increasing deep percolation of rainfalls for enhancing arid zones aquifers for this purpose 8 precipitations were selected from the intensity duration frequency idf curves of the study area with a return period of 2 and 5 years the deep percolation of these precipitations were examined in lysimeters with gravel sand and mixed mulches and without any mulch then 192 data of soil moisture daily maximum air temperature and deep percolation were measured for driving empirical equations

shahrekord plain iran the results showed that the deep percolation increased in all examined mulched soils compared to unmulched soil its maximum and cumulative increase were in gravel mulch with 21 3 and 30 respectively furthermore groundwater modeling results showed that the mulching could improve groundwater level as 0 34 m over a three year period finally this paper proposes soil mulching for enhancing groundwater resources and a model to assess it keywords assessment model mulch recharge lysimeter shahrekord plain gms 1 introduction groundwater is one of the main sources of water supply in arid and semi arid regions of the world given the growing demand of the world s population the use of groundwater is increasing in arid areas around the world taylor and howard 1996 due to the high contribution of groundwater to water supply in arid and semi arid regions of the world it is essential to enhance these valuable water resources on the other hand the role of deep percolation of precipitations is very important for groundwater recharging and directly impacts on groundwater balance liu et al 2011 since the deep percolation of surface water and precipitation are the main cause of groundwater recharge barrett et al 1999 increasing deep percolation can enhance groundwater resources furthermore in arid and semi arid regions of the world where surface water is rare the deep percolation of precipitation even in small amounts can be significant for recharging aquifers gao et al 2018 therefore the investigation of possible solutions to increase the amount of percolation of precipitations into the aquifers may have appropriate effects on the conservation and restoration of groundwater resources high evaporation rate is one of the greatest key factors which causes water losses especially in dry areas moreover the high evaporation losses in these areas can lead to a drop in groundwater level piri et al 2009 thus controlling and decreasing evaporation rate as one of the key factors of water loss can have an effective role in preserving water resources in these areas soheylifar et al 2013 one of the traditional methods for reducing evaporation from the soil surface is applying mulches li et al 2018 peng et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 any material that covers soil surface and protects it from sunlight for decreasing evaporation is called mulch yaghi et al 2013 literature review showed the positive effect of mulch on reducing the evaporation from the soil surface hou et al 2010 wang et al 2014a wang et al 2014b decreasing wind erosion hagen 2010 he et al 2008 control of dust storm edvardsson 2010 goodrich et al 2009 and reducing soil erosion by runoff adekalu et al 2007 huang et al 2013 however mulch s effect on deep percolation to increase aquifer recharge is not yet reported for example in a study by hou et al 2010 the effects of plastic mulch on soil temperature evapotranspiration rate plant growth and crop yield were examined in a dry area in china the results showed an increase of 2 to 9 degrees celsius c in soil temperature and decrease in the rate of evapotranspiration during 60 days of the experiment in another study wang et al 2014a examined the effect of vegetation mulch on groundwater recharge in this research the increasing effect of using lawn and straw cover on the ground surface on groundwater recharge was appraised in a sand box of 1 5 1 3 1 m in this research the groundwater flow was experimentally tested in the box the results indicated that the groundwater recharge by irrigation increased up to 39 1 and 42 2 respectively by using lawn and straw mulch wang et al 2014b examined the effect of sandy mulch thickness on a silty loam soil temperature evaporation from soil surface water productivity and watermelon yield in a semi arid region in china the results showed that mulch thickness has a positive effect on reducing evaporation depth and control of soil temperature fluctuations in another study chen et al 2015 examined the impact of using another type of mulch plastic mulch with straw mulch on the crop yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in a dry climate of china their results showed that the use of mulch could increase water use efficiency ranged from 25 to 35 at different time intervals in most studies considering the positive effect of mulch on reducing evaporation and keeping more water in the soil it has been attempted to investigate the effect of mulch on the crop yields and reducing irrigation water consumption however less attention has been paid to the positive effect of mulch on storing rainwater in soil by reducing evaporation as well as increasing the deep percolation of precipitation in some studies the permeability rate was investigated to determine the effect of mulch on preventing soil erosion and runoff formation adekalu et al 2007 huang et al 2013 the effectiveness of these mulches in reducing evaporation and increasing soil moisture has been well studied in previous studies and the results show their positive effect on maintaining soil moisture chakraborty et al 2010 li et al 2009 li et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 in most of these researches studies were carried out on experimental models like laboratory channels with high longitude and less than one meter depth of soil in most cases less than 30 to 40 cm cm soil depth however direct groundwater recharge is always due to the percolating rainwater into the depth more than crops root zone which is known as deep percolation the higher depth of precipitation has higher deep percolation and as a result the higher volume of groundwater recharge orr et al 2002 counting the root depth of some plants which reaches even one meter measuring the percolation rate in laboratory flumes with less than one meter depths cannot be a good supposition for measuring the groundwater recharge caused by rainwater considering above reviewed papers the effect of mulch on soil moisture crop yield and soil erosion prevention have been investigated nevertheless the effect of mulch on the aquifer recharge rate by the deep percolation of rainwater by soil mulching has not been simulated physically and numerically consequently in this paper the efficiency of gravel sand and mixed mulches on increasing the groundwater recharge by soil mulching is assessed in a semi arid region aquifer shahrekord aquifer iran therefore it reveals how mulches can be effective in maintaining soil moisture reducing evaporation and increasing the deep percolation rate of rainwater into the soil thus recharging aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the study area is in the central regions of iran between 32 5 32 34 n latitudes and 50 33 51 10 e longitude namely shahrkord aquifer fig 1 shows the location of the study area in the center of iran in this research to simulate precipitation and performing experiments the precipitation data of the shahrekord rainfall gauge was used which is near the center of study area the average annual temperature of this area is 11 c and the average annual precipitation is 414 8 mm mm 2 2 tested mulch crop residues leaves straw and etc plastic gravel and sand zeolite paper liquid mulches and textiles are the most commonly used mulch which have been reported in studies to reduce evaporation and prevent soil erosion since the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of mulches in increasing the deep percolating of rainwater it is necessary that the investigated mulch be able to prevent water evaporation from the soil surface and to have enough permeability for the deep percolation of rainwater furthermore the selected mulch should be low cost and available in the region to be practically applicable and economic according to the investigations conducted in the study area the suitable mulch for these purposes are gravel and sand mulches in this research three types of gravel and sand compounds were used as mulches 100 gravel 100 sand and gravel and sand 50 50 mixture the thickness of each mulch layer was 7 cm sand grain size varied from 0 07 to 4 mm and gravel grain size varied from 4 to 20 mm the shape factor of both sand and gravel were 0 7 2 3 experimental setup and analysis in this research circular volumetric lysimeters with depths of 1 4 m and 40 cm diameter were used to assess the mulches efficiency in increasing the rainwater percolation into the vadose zone and aquifer media the use of 1 4 meter depth lysimeters provides the possibility of measuring deep percolation to control similarity of soil bulk density in lysimeters the same weight of soil used for the same volume of lysimeters moreover to control soil bulk density in various depths of lysimeters the same weight of soil used in each layer of lysimeters thus lysimeters had the same distribution of soil bulk density in their depths to evaluate mulch efficiency in increasing rainwater percolation into the soil it is necessary to create artificial rain with different intensity and duration for this purpose a rain simulator with similar dimensions to the area of lysimeters was made in this research fig 2 this rain simulator consists of three parts tank flow control valve and sprinkler nozzles in this experimental setup a nozzle was considered for each lysimeter which was connected to the tank through a separate path the task of the tank is to create a constant water head on each sprinkler and for this purpose a floater valve was used to control water level this tank was connected to the urban water flow and controlling water level prevented possible fluctuations in the heads of the nozzles furthermore in the water transfer path from the tank to the sprinklers of each lysimeter a flow control valve was placed that provides the possibility for changing water pressure on the nozzles flow separately accordingly by adjusting water pressure of nozzles it is possible to adjust the amount of their discharge and thus regulate the intensity of simulated rainfall to increase the accuracy of the simulation the soil texture of the lysimeters was selected using the average of drilling logs in the study area and the rainfall intensity was determined using the intensity duration frequency idf curves of the study area for this purpose four precipitation durations 2 4 6 and 8 h were tested the precipitation intensity proportional to these durations was obtained using idf curves of the study area for two return periods of 2 and 5 years which have high occurrence frequency and these rainfall intensities were created artificially by the rainfall simulator in the experiments in this way each of the three mulches and a control lysimeter the lysimeter without mulch were tested using eight different combinations of precipitation intensity and duration which the precipitation depths are shown in table 1 to measure soil water storage during the experiment five gypsum block sensors were installed at depths of 30 60 90 110 and 125 cm of the lysimeter soil surface and using these blocks soil moisture were measured and recorded during the experiments detail of calibration of by gypsum block sensors and measurement by them can be found in keyhani 2010 the effect of using mulch on increasing the rainwater deep percolation was investigated by measuring the outflows from the bottom of the lysimeters with mulch cover and comparing it with the non mulched lysimeter control lysimeter the effect of using mulch on groundwater recharge was investigated by measuring the soil water storage and the outflows from the bottom of the lysimeters the evaporation from the lysimeters were determined using water balance in soil eq 1 piri et al 2009 1 e p o δ s where e is the evaporation depth p is the precipitation depth o is the outflow depth from a lysimeter deep percolation depth and δ s is change in soil water storage all parameters are in mm therefore by measuring values of o and δ s during the experiment and given the known amount of p which is artificial rainfall e can be obtained for an experiment in this paper by measuring these parameters two empirical equations were developed using the experimental results to estimate the precipitation deep percolation and evaporation depths in soils with mulch and without mulch accordingly the deep percolation depth was determined as a function of precipitation depth and soil moisture eq 2 moreover the evaporation depth was determined as a function of daily maximum air temperature and soil moisture eq 3 curve expert professional 2 6 3 software was used to find the best equation that expresses the relation between dependent and independent variables eqs 2 and 3 this software is able fit different equations on experimental data 2 o f s p 3 e f s t to evaluate the efficiency of the obtained empirical equations coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe

respectively the mean of observed and simulated values of the examined parameter and m is the number of experimental data singh 1988 furthermore for verifying the obtained empirical equations the mean bias error mbe and root mean square error rmse indices were used according to the eqs 6 and 7 respectively jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 willmott 1982 6 mbe t 1 n x sim x obs n 7 rmse t 1 n x obs x sim 2 n in these equations x obs and x sim are respectively the observed and simulated values of examined parameters and n is the number of experimental data in the next step the daily maximum air temperature and precipitation data of the study area were obtained for a period of three years 2010 2013 and by solving the eq 1 and using the empirical equations eqs 2 and 3 the daily depth of precipitation evaporation and deep percolation were modeled then the daily values of evaporation from the soil and precipitation deep percolation were calculated using the daily values of daily maximum air temperature and precipitation of the study area by using the empirical equations eqs 2 and 3 next using eq 1 the soil moisture was determined for the next day using this algorithm the soil moisture precipitation deep percolation and evaporation for each day of the studied three years and for each tested mulch and unmulched soil were computed for the study area 2 4 numerical modeling in the final step of this research the modflow code was used to assess the effect of using mulch on groundwater level conceptual model of shahrekord aquifer was considered using aquifer recharge discharge sources and boundary conditions in modflow model with 500 500 m grid for steady and unsteady conditions the aquifer was simulated for a 3 year period from september 2010 to september 2013 which the first 2 years were for calibration and the last year was for model validation the simulation time step was monthly september 2010 was used for initial condition the values obtained for deep percolation were calculated for each precipitation daily for three years were used as input recharge data for the modflow model finally the groundwater levels were evaluated monthly for each of the three mulched and unmulched soils 3 results and discussion during the experiments soil moisture was measured at 5 different depths and maximum air temperature along with precipitation deep percolation measured on daily basis thus 192 data were recorded for the parameters using these data and eq 2 an empirical equation was established to estimate the aquifer recharge using soil moisture and precipitation rate for each mulched and unmulched soil which is shown as eq 8 the coefficients of this empirical equation for different mulches are according to table 2 8 o p s a b p c s where o is the drained water depth from the soil groundwater recharge p is the precipitation depth and s is the soil water storage all in mm using eq 8 and the coefficients of table 2 it is possible to estimate the deep percolation caused by different precipitations in each studied mulched and unmulched soils in various soil profiles it is possible to calibrate eq 8 and obtain the corresponding coefficients in the same way later the efficiency and accuracy of the obtained empirical equations were evaluated by calculating cd and nsec using eqs 4 and 5 respectively the results are shown in table 2 table 2 shows the values of cd in all studied mulched and unmulched soils are between 0 97 and 0 98 which indicates that the eq 8 defines experimental data properly it is worth mentioning the highest value obtained for cd is for mixed mulch and the lowest is for unmulched soil furthermore the calculated nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients indicate the high efficiency of the obtained empirical equation eq 8 for estimating the amount of water drained from the soil and consequently the groundwater recharge an unit value for this index indicates a perfect match between the simulated value and the observed data singh 1988 according to table 2 the highest value of this index is for gravel mulch and the lowest is for unmulched soil therefore according to the high values of the used two evaluation indices it seems that in all three mulched soils and the unmulched soil the eq 8 can estimate the rate of deep percolation with acceptable accuracy consequently this equation can be used to estimate the amount of deep percolation for various precipitations consequently the evaporation depths of the lysimeters which determined using eq 1 were used to develop an empirical equation to compute the evaporation depth of three mulched and unmulched soils using daily maximum air temperature and soil water storage this empirical equation is shown in eq 9 and the coefficients of this empirical equation for each of the soil mulches are in table 3 9 e a s b t c s t 0 where e is the evaporation depth in mm t is daily maximum air temperature c and s is the soil water storage mm thus using eq 9 and its coefficients in table 3 the evaporation depth for each of the mulched soils as well as unmulched soil can be assessed using daily maximum air temperature and soil moisture then the efficiency of obtained empirical equation was evaluated using cd and nsec eqs 4 and 5 the evaluation results are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the values of cd in all studied mulched and unmulched soils are between 0 92 and 0 96 which indicates the good fit of the eq 9 on experimental data the highest value obtained for cd is for gravel mulch and the lowest is for unmulched soil the calculated values for nsec also indicate the high efficiency of the obtained empirical equation eq 9 for estimating the evaporation depth according to table 3 the highest value of this index is for mixed mulch and the lowest for unmulched soil according to the values of table 3 it seems that the eq 9 could estimate the evaporation depth using soil moisture and daily maximum air temperature with acceptable accuracy in all mulched and unmulched soils subsequently eqs 8 and 9 were validated with observed data for this purpose four different precipitation durations of 2 4 6 and 8 h were examined the rainfall intensities corresponding to these durations were also obtained from idf curves of the study area for the return period of 50 years then the values of daily maximum air temperature soil moisture and precipitation deep percolation were recorded daily the results were compared with the calculated results from eqs 8 and 9 fig 3 the estimation error of these empirical equations was also calculated by using eqs 6 and 7 as shown in table 4 according to table 4 the highest mbe index value in estimating evaporation is for unmulched soil 0 34 and the lowest value is for sand and mixed mulch 0 11 the negative value of this index in sand mulch indicates that the average of the estimated values for evaporation is lower than observed values conversely the positive value of this index indicates that in mixed mulch the average of the estimated values for evaporation parameter is higher than the observed values besides the lowest value of rmse index in estimating evaporation is for mixed mulch 0 02 the highest value of mbe index in estimating depth percolation is for mixed mulch 0 25 and the lowest value is for unmulched soil and sand mulch with 0 14 the negativity of these values indicates that the average of estimated values is lower than observed values considering the values of the mbe and rmse indices as well as fig 3 which indicates the concentration of data around the bisector it can be concluded that the proposed models have been able to estimate the parameters of evaporation and deep percolation in each of the examined mulched and unmulched soils with an acceptable accuracy accordingly the daily values of evaporation and deep percolation were computed by solving the eqs 1 8 and 9 from the daily maximum air temperature and precipitation data of the study area that were obtained for three years fig 4 shows the daily values of depth and deep percolation percentages from 9 23 2010 to 4 30 2011 in unmulched soil and gravel mulch gravel mulch had the best efficiency in increasing the daily deep percolation in this research as discussed above in this paper in this figure the dry period of year without precipitation are not displayed in fig 4 the horizontal axes show days of the rainy period during the first year of modeling 9 23 2010 to 4 30 2011 the daily precipitation depth and the deep percolation are shown in the upper and lower diagrams respectively according to fig 4 the precipitations that occurred at the beginning of the period have longer intervals between occurrences than the precipitations in the middle of the period from the hundredth day to the last day in both of gravel mulch and unmulched soils the percentage of deep percolation is higher in the middle precipitations of the period shorter intervals between rainfall occurrences than the initial precipitations longer intervals between rainfall occurrences for instance precipitations with a depth of less than 10 mm at the beginning of the period had percolation rate of less than 5 but toward the middle of the period this value is gradually increased to more than 10 therefore it can be said that the percentage of deep percolation is higher in precipitation with shorter intervals between their occurrences than the same precipitation with longer intervals between occurrences fig 5 presents the increase rate in soil moisture decrease rate in evaporation and increase rate in deep percolation in the examined mulches compared to the unmulched soil for monthly precipitation depth in the first year of modeling as shown in fig 5c the monthly precipitation depth in september is about one millimeter and much lower than the other months therefore when the amount of precipitation is insignificant there is no significant change in soil moisture increase evaporation reduction or increase in deep percolation when using mulch compared to soil without mulch in october increase in precipitation depth and the low soil water storage in the soil a significant percentage of precipitation is stored in soil as shown in fig 5b the gravel and mixed mulches increase the soil moisture compared to unmulched soil by 40 where this value for sand mulch was 10 evaporation depths also decreased in this month by using gravel and mixed mulch by more than 30 compared to unmulched soil fig 5a therefore in this month the use of mulch was able to preserve precipitation water in the soil and reduce the amount of evaporation loss compared to unmulched soil in november although the total precipitation depth was decreased compared to the previous month fig 5c the deep percolation of precipitation in all three examined mulches increased compared to the previous month fig 5d this could be due to preservation of soil water storage in the soil by using mulch in the previous month and thus increasing deep percolation of precipitation in this month according to fig 5d the increase in deep percolation in november was gravel mulch and mixed by 1 3 compared to unmulched soil increase in precipitation depth in december january and february fig 5c the deep percolation also increased in all three examined mulches in these months the greatest effect on increasing deep percolation is gravel mulch the highest value is in february of more than 4 compared to unmulched soil fig 5d for gravel mulch february soil water storage was increased by more than 5 and evaporation was decreased by more than 10 compared to unmulched soil fig 5b and a respectively this shows that during the cold months of the year when the amount of evaporation decreases and the precipitation depth increases for the mulched soils compared to soil without mulch the increase can be due to increase in moisture storage of mulched soils caused by precipitations with a lower depth and higher time intervals that occurred in the previous and warmer months of the year as mentioned earlier the evaporation depth from mulched soils decreases and this increases the soil water storage in these months in mulched soils when compared to unmulched soil thus it increased deep percolation in mulched soils in december january and february furthermore due to increase in daily maximum air temperature in march the increase of moisture storage caused by precipitation was 40 and the reduction in evaporation depth was the same amount comparing to unmulched soil it means by increasing temperature in the end of winter the impact of gravel mulch becomes more significant april s largest amount of increase was for gravel mulch 2 5 compared to unmulched soil therefore it can be concluded that the use of mulch increases soil moisture from precipitation reduces evaporation and increases deep percolation of precipitation in soil values vary based on precipitation depth time of occurrence and daily maximum air temperature in table 5 the deep percolation soil moisture and evaporation losses from 870 5 mm of precipitation during the studied three year period for all soils are shown using the results of modeling to find the percentage of deep percolation increased soil moisture and evaporation losses their absolute values are divided by the precipitation during the three year period 870 5 mm and multiplied by 100 according to table 5 the highest value for deep percolation is for gravel mulch with 185 56 mm depth and the lowest is for unmulched soil with 142 68 mm depth deep percolation increased in all the mulched soils compared to unmulched soil the highest value of deep percolation rate is for the gravel mulched soil by 21 3 which is 1 30 times of unmulched soil moreover the evaporation loss decreased in all three mulched soils and the highest values of reduction is for gravel and mixed mulches which are lower than unmulched soil by 26 and 19 7 respectively this reduction in evaporation losses in gravel and mixed mulches eventually led to increase in soil moisture during the studied period gravel and mixed mulches increase soil moisture by 21 1 and 15 8 respectively although the sand mulch could reduce the evaporation loss compared to unmulched soil it failed to maintain soil moisture at the end of the studied period additionally the soil moisture in sand mulch was not increased compared to the unmulched soil it seems the more air space in bulk the volume of gravel mulch keeps soil moisture better than sand mulch detail investigation of table 5 can be used for explanation of the improvement in deep percolation by the mulches comparison of evaporation losses in unmulched soil with sand mulch shows that the mulch decreased evaporation as 1 this decreased evaporation caused the same increase to the percolation this means sand mulch increases deep percolation by decreasing evaporation from soil comparison of evaporation losses in unmulched soil with the other mulches shows that the mulches decreased evaporation and similar percentage are added to the percolation or the increased soil moisture this means that the decreased evaporation losses transferred to deep percolation and caused increase in soil moisture above comparisons of the water balance values also show that sand much acts more like soil and only added small amount of deep percolation where the other mulches enhanced considerably both deep percolation and soil moisture to investigate the effect of mulching on the groundwater level the numerical simulation of the studied aquifer was modeled by using modflow code of gms10 2 software in this modeling the rmse of calibration in the steady state was 0 43 m and in unsteady state was 1 28 m which indicated that the modeling errors rate are acceptable in fig 6 the observed and calculated values of the model is shown in selected observation wells at the plain these observation wells were selected because they are scattered on the plain having observation wells from various parts of the plain north south east and west fig 6 represents a suitable estimation for groundwater level of observation wells for different time steps to identify suitable areas in the plain for mulching the land use map of shahrekord plain was prepared fig 7 to model the impact of mulching on the groundwater level it was assumed that in the plain area the agricultural land and rangeland were fully covered by the gravel mulch using this assumption the groundwater level was modeled by applying gms to find the impact of mulching on the groundwater level in fig 8 the increase in groundwater level at the end of the three year period is shown for each of the examined mulches as shown in fig 8 the mulching could increase the groundwater level compared to unmulched soil the values of increase in groundwater level for gravel sand and mixed mulches are equal to 0 9 0 2 and 0 7 m respectively in order to determine the exact values of increase in groundwater level during the three year period the average of groundwater level change throughout the aquifer due to mulching was calculated monthly for each of the examined mulches fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the increase in groundwater level for examined mulched soils compared to unmulched soil at the beginning of the period starts from zero and reaches its maximum value in march 2013 in the three examined mulches these changes begin from lowest values at the beginning of each year and at the end of the rainy season reach their maximum values and then begin to decrease at the end of the wet months the maximum groundwater level increase is 0 34 m in gravel mulch and the lowest groundwater level increase is 0 09 m in sand mulch therefore it can be said that the gravel mulched soil could increase the mean groundwater level compared to unmulched soil with a maximum of 0 34 m over a 3 year period this means that gravel mulch can be proposed to restore aquifers in arid regions among the examined mulches 4 conclusions in this study using the data obtained from the experiment two empirical equations were developed to estimate the deep percolation of precipitations using the soil moisture and precipitation depth and soil evaporation using the daily maximum air temperature and soil water storage for the examined mulched soils as well as unmulched soil to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed empirical equations cd and nsec were used the results of this evaluation showed that the obtained empirical equations were able to estimate deep percolation and evaporation from mulched and unmulched soils with an acceptable accuracy using the proposed empirical equations and the soil water balance equation the soil moisture model was developed then this model was tested using three year precipitation and daily maximum air temperature data of the region to evaluate the efficiency of mulching in increasing soil moisture and deep percolation of precipitation the results of the model showed that applying the mulches increases soil moisture caused by precipitation decreases evaporation and increases the deep percolation of precipitation the highest percentage of increase in deep percolation was in gravel mulch with 21 3 which is 30 increase compared to unmulched soil furthermore the evaporation loss decreases in all three mulched soils compared to unmulched soil and the highest values of reduction was for gravel and mixed mulches as gravel and mixed mulches increased soil moisture by 21 1 and 15 8 respectively according to the results of this study it was found that the percentage of deep percolation is higher in precipitation with shorter time intervals between rainfall occurrences than the same precipitation with longer intervals between occurrences groundwater modeling results showed that the mulched soils could improve deep percolation and increase the groundwater level by 0 34 m in a three year period in conclusion by using gravel mulch groundwater as one of the water supply sources in arid areas can be improved by maintaining soil moisture and increasing deep percolation of precipitation and thus gravel mulch can be proposed for restoring aquifers acknowledgements the authors appreciate rashelle duersch of utah state university for checking english writing of this paper
