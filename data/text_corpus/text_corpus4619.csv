23095,in this paper the target tracking control problem is addressed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auv with a prescribed performance for this purpose the range and bearing angles of the auv relative to an underwater target are transformed to a second order open loop error dynamic model by using the prescribed performance bound technique then a new tracking controller is proposed such that the tracking errors converge to an arbitrary small ultimate bound and their transient performance are guaranteed with a pre specified maximum overshoot and the convergence rate to overcome unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances that are imposed on the vehicle by the wind waves and ocean currents a multi layer neural network and an adaptive robust controller are adopted a lyapunov stability synthesis shows that all signals of the control system are bounded and tracking errors converge to a small region containing the origin with a prescribed performance finally simulations are performed in matlab software and a comparative study verifies the theoretical results keywords adaptive robust control guaranteed transient performance neural network prescribed performance bound underwater vehicle 1 introduction the motion control problem of autonomous underactuated underwater vehicles auvs has been a topic of interest over past few decades some typical applications of auvs include rescue search surveillance reconnaissance mine counter measures inspection identification oceanography and so on in contrast to fully actuated underwater vehicles the underactuated ones possess less actuators than the degrees of freedom accordingly the tracking control problem of these vehicles is more difficult and more complex than that of the fully actuated ones this limitation is due to the intentional decrease of the independent actuators to lessen the cost and maintenance of the system shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 motivated by the vast applications and the challenging nature of underactuated auvs most of researchers have proposed valuable methods for the motion control of underactuated ocean vehicles reference shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 has developed a robust dynamic surface control for underactuated underwater vehicles in shojaei 2017 a novel trajectory tracking controller is introduced under thesaturation constraint in do et al 2004 and do 2015 the robust controllers are designed based on the backstepping method a cooperative line of sight target tracking is proposed in glotzbach et al 2015 reference shojaei and arefi 2015 has proposed a neural adaptive feedback control for underactuated underwater vehicles to deal with the uncertain parameters since stochastic obstacles may appear in the desired trajectory some collision avoidance control algorithms are proposed in li and wang 2013 lin et al 2017 ataei and yousefi koma 2015 conti et al 2015 to cope with unknown parameters model based adaptive controllers are developed in sarhadi et al 2016a 2016b hassanein et al 2016 to deal with unstructured uncertainties the sliding mode based controllers are proposed in xu et al 2015 esfahani et al 2015 cui et al 2016 elmokadem et al 2017 gao et al 2017 bessa et al 2010 in miao et al 2017 a spatial curvilinear path following controller has been proposed for underactuated auvs by using the backstepping technique and the active disturbance rejection control reference peymani and fossen 2015 has proposed a novel path following controller for auvs by employing the lagrange multiplier method to satisfy pre specified constraints moreover the leader follower formation controllers are designed in shojaei 2016a cui et al 2010 park 2015 for the cooperation of multiple auvs recently some novel controllers have been proposed in the literature to address the motion control of auvs yan and yu 2018 li et al 2018 karkoub et al 2017 from a review of the previous works shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 shojaei 2016a 2017 do et al 2004 do 2015 glotzbach et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 li and wang 2013 lin et al 2017 ataei and yousefi koma 2015 conti et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2016a 2016b hassanein et al 2016 xu et al 2015 esfahani et al 2015 cui et al 2010 2016 elmokadem et al 2017 gao et al 2017 bessa et al 2010 miao et al 2017 peymani and fossen 2015 park 2015 yan and yu 2018 li et al 2018 karkoub et al 2017 it turns out that the previous controllers cannot ensure the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the tracking errors in other words the transient and steady state responses specifications such as the convergence rate maximum overshoot undershoot and final tracking accuracy cannot be specified before the beginning of the tracking mission in previous controllers in the design of tracking controllers the stability problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles under structured and unstructured uncertainties is a challenging problem besides the conventional nonlinear controllers are not able to guarantee the stability of these systems with a prescribed performance in certain cases the adjustment of the transient response parameters such as overshoot and convergence rate are essential factors to design nonlinear controllers and the most of the classical nonlinear controllers are not able to guarantee the stability with a prescribed performance furthermore auvs are highly nonlinear and in practice structured and unstructured uncertainties cannot be ignored since their effects cause the instability in the control system as a result the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles have to be controlled by methods that compensate model uncertainties such as the robust and adaptive controllers in such techniques it is difficult to obtain a desirable transient response because of the parameters estimation and rough control signals that are produced by the robust controller consequently the stability guarantee for underactuated auvs with a prescribed performance still remains a challenging open problem toward this end an approximation free trajectory tracking controller is proposed in bechlioulis et al 2017 for underactuated auvs with the prescribed performance technique which is originally introduced for feedback linearizable mimo nonlinear systems in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 and its successful applications are available in the literature wang et al 2017 bechlioulis et al 2014 bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 however the reference bechlioulis et al 2017 ignores the advantages of approximation based methods such as neural network and adaptive techniques which are the main topic of this paper it should be noted that the approximation based methods including a combination of neural networks and adaptive robust techniques provide a powerful solution to compensate for the different types of uncertainties including unknown parameters unmodeled dynamics measurement noise and time varying external disturbances in practice in contrast to bechlioulis et al 2017 our proposed neural network adaptive robust controller is capable to learn every level of uncertainties by the online adaptation therefore the proposed controller maintains its robust performance with increasing the level of uncertainties and the amplitude of external disturbances at the expense of more control activities moreover compared with bechlioulis et al 2017 our proposed controller not only restricts the time evolution of the tracking errors within prescribed performance bounds but also it improves the final tracking accuracy within these bounds by using the neural adaptive robust method according to the above literature review the neural adaptive tracking control of uncertain underactuated auvs with a guaranteed prescribed performance has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 shojaei 2016a 2017 do et al 2004 do 2015 glotzbach et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 li and wang 2013 lin et al 2017 ataei and yousefi koma

and fossen 2015 park 2015 yan and yu 2018 li et al 2018 karkoub et al 2017 bechlioulis et al 2017 compared with all of previously proposed controllers shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 shojaei 2016a 2017 do et al 2004 do 2015 glotzbach et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 li and wang 2013 lin et al 2017 ataei and yousefi koma 2015 conti et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2016a 2016b hassanein et al 2016 xu et al 2015

bechlioulis et al 2017 for autonomous auvs this paper proposes a neural adaptive robust controller to achieve the tracking of a desired target in the presence of unmodeled dynamics unknown parameters and environmental disturbances which are induced by waves ocean currents and high pressure water by the prescribed performance technique to obtain the control objectives a second order open loop error dynamic model is developed under a nonlinear transformation next the controller is proposed by using a filtered tracking error a multi layer neural network and an adaptive robust controller are simultaneously employed to compensate both structured and unstructured uncertainties as a result the proposed controller guarantees the robust stability with a prescribed performance against unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances hence the main contributions of this paper is summarized as follows a target tracking controller is proposed for underactuated auvs in three dimensional space with the prescribed transient and steady state performance by employing a nonlinear transformation a new second order euler lagrange formulation of auvs is developed in terms of prescribed performance errors for the first time which preserves all properties of auv dynamics then a robust tracking controller is designed without any singularity by an effective combination of multi layer neural networks and an adaptive robust controller which compensate all types of model uncertainties the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section the problem formulation is presented in

2009 and fossen 2002 for a detailed description of auv modelling and parameters definitions the auv dynamics may be written in the actuated and non actuated directions as follows 3 m 1 υ a c 1 υ n υ a

that τ w u λ w u τ w q λ w q τ w r λ w r τ w v λ w v and τ w w λ w w where λ w u λ w q λ w r λ w v and λ w w are unknown positive constants assumption 3 the pitch angle satisfies θ t π 2 t 0 to prevent any singularity in the closed loop system assumption 4 fossen 2002 li et al 2008 the sway and heave velocities in non actuated directions are passive bounded t 0 in the sense that that sup t 0 v t λ v and sup t 0 w t λ w assumption 5 the posture and velocities of the underactuated underwater vehicle are available for the feedback in real time remark 1 similar to shojaei 2016a the effects of thrusters dynamics are considered as unmodeled dynamics in this paper remark 2 by referring to the literature do and pan 2009 fossen 2002 auvs do not enter to the neighborhood of θ π 2 because of the metacentric restoring forces thus θ t θ max π 2 remark 3 since the hydrodynamic damping forces in the second and third equations of 2 are dominant in the sway and heave directions in practical situations the sway and heave velocities are damped out by these forces hence by referring to literature fossen 2002 li et al 2008 the passive boundedness of these velocities can be easily analyzed similar to surface vessels in li et al 2008 consequently assumption 4 is adopted in this paper remark 4 in practice the roll dynamics are neglected in kinematic and dynamic equations of auvs in 1 and 2 when these vehicles are operating at low speeds and they are equipped with independent external or internal roll actuators the interested readers are referred to do and pan 2009 for further details 2 3 control objectives the control objective of this paper is to design the control input τ a t for the underactuated auv such that the target tracking errors in the spherical coordinates ρ e ϕ and γ according to fig 1 are stabilized at the origin with a pre assigned transient maximum overshoot convergence rate and the steady state error in the presence of the structured and unstructured uncertainties applied to auv including unknown parameters unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances due to waves and ocean currents here it is assumed that the auv is equipped with sensors which are able to measure range ρ e and heading angles ϕ γ of the auv for this purpose the following tracking errors are defined according to fig 1 7 ρ e 2 x e 2 y e 2 z e 2 γ arctan y e x e ϕ arctan z e x e 2 y e 2 where x e y e and z e are the position errors which are defined as follows based on fig 1 8 x e ρ e cos ϕ cos γ y e ρ e cos ϕ sin γ z e ρ e sin ϕ to proceed with the design procedure the position and orientation errors between the auv and target vehicle in the earth fixed frame are transformed into the body fixed frame as follows 9 x e y e z e cos θ cos ψ cos θ sin ψ sin θ sin ψ cos ψ 0 sin θ cos ψ sin θ sin ψ cos θ x x d y y d z z d then taking the time derivative of 9 leads to the following error dynamics at the kinematic level 10 x e u q z e r y e d 1 t y e v r x e r z e tan θ d 2 t z e w q x e r y e tan θ d 3 t where d 1 d 2 and d 3 are given as follows 11 d 1 t x d t cos θ cos ψ y d t cos θ sin ψ z d t sin θ d 2 t x d t sin ψ y d t cos ψ d 3 t x d t sin θ cos ψ y d t sin θ sin ψ z d t cos θ now by differentiating 7 with respect to the time and combining the resulting equation with 8 and 10 the error dynamic equations in spherical coordinates are obtained as follows 12 ρ

converge to a pre assigned residual set and guarantee any arbitrary prescribed maximum overshoot undershoot convergence rate and steady state error which strictly evolve within a bounded decreasing function of time called performance function that will be defined in the sequel mathematical definitions of prescribed performance are stated as follows bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 wang et al 2017 15 α 1 η 1 ρ e t β 1 η 1 16 α 2 η 2 ϕ t β 2 η 2 17 α 3 η 3 γ t β 3 η 3 where β 1 α 1 β 2 α 2 β 3 and α 3 are positive design constants which guarantee any transient and steady state response of the tracking errors in general the performance functions are defined as η i t η i 0 η i e a i t η i i 1 2 3 where η i is chosen small enough which is a candidate for the ultimate bound of the tracking error and its accuracy depends on the measuring device a i 0 provides some arbitrary lower bound on the convergence rate of the tracking errors and η i 0 η i 0 are some positive design constants the aforesaid definitions are illustrated by fig 2 remark 5 from 12 14 it can be seen that tracking errors are ill defined if ϕ π 2 and ρ e 0 moreover if γ π 2 the system loses its controllability in the actuated directions since ϕ t and γ t are defined as the orientation tracking errors which should converge to zero as t sufficient conditions are ϕ t π 2 and γ t π 2 t 0 to avoid a probable singularity and to preserve the controllability in the control system these conditions can be satisfied if ϕ t and γ t evolve within the bounds in 16 and 17 moreover if the bound in 15 is satisfied the distance error ρ e t converges to a small neighborhood of the origin such that ρ e ε 0 as t consequently the tracking errors become well defined if we restrict them in the prescribed bounds 15 17 t 0 and as a result the possible singularities will be avoidable to satisfy control objectives and to guarantee a prescribed performance for the transient and steady state responses of the tracking errors three strictly increasing functions f 1 ε ρ e f 2 ε ϕ and f 3 ε γ should be designed with the following properties 18 α 1 f 1 ε ρ e β 1 α 2 f 2 ε ϕ β 2 α 3 f 3 ε γ β 3 19 lim ε ρ e f 1 ε ρ e β

equations 15 17 it is obvious that ρ e η 1 f 1 ε ρ e ϕ η 2 f 2 ε ϕ and γ η 3 f 3 ε γ because of the strict monotonicity property of f 1 f 2 and f 3 and the fact that η i t 0 the inverse transformation functions ε ρ e f 1 1 ρ e t η 1 t ε ϕ f 2 1 ϕ t η 2 t and ε γ f 3 1 γ t η 3 t exist which are given as follows wang et al 2017 23 ε ρ e 0 5 p 1 1 ln ρ ˆ e t α 1 0 5 p 1 1 ln β 1 α 1 ε 1 0 5 p 1 1 ln β

ϕ cos θ cos θ 0 the following conditions verify that det r 0 i since η i 0 the terms ζ 1 ζ 2 and ζ 3 are non zero t 0 ii from remarks 2 and 5 one concludes that θ t θ max π 2 ϕ t π 2 and γ t π 2 t 0 which mean that cos k t 0 k γ ϕ θ iii the initial conditions should be selected such that tan ϕ tan θ cos γ since γ tends to a neighborhood of the zero exponentially fast as t this condition is reduced to tan ϕ tan θ 1 which means that ϕ θ π 2 since ϕ tends to a neighborhood of the zero exponentially fast as t this condition is reduced to θ π 2 which is impossible due to the metacentric restoring forces according to remark 2 therefore the possible singularity is prevented as long as the initial conditions are selected such that tan ϕ 0 tan θ 0 cos γ 0 hence r q e does not lose its

induce any restriction to system ge et al 2009 peng et al 2013 wang and huang 2002 therefore the unknown uncertain function ς p may be approximated by a three layer neural network as ς p w t σ v t x ε

together with 49 yields 58 x p t max v t 0 λ u χ c λ l as a result inequalities 49 56 and 57 imply that v t is strictly negative outside the compact set 59 ω x x p t 0 x p t max v t 0 λ u χ c λ l as a result as long as ξ c 0 5 ℓ 3 0 5 ℓ 4 x w 2 is satisfied x p t is decreasing whenever x p t is outside the set ω x according to 49 λ x x w t 2 v t v 0 λ u x p 0 2 t 0 and consequently one obtains x w

made arbitrarily large to contain every initial condition by choosing appropriate parameters of the proposed controller from the above discussion x p t is sguub and converges to a small neighborhood of the origin for this reason q e t e f t w 11 w n h 1 n o v 11 v n 1 1 n h θ t l which implies that the tracking errors and parameter estimation errors are sguub as well therefore by recalling 33 one concludes q e l besides by recalling assumption 7 and the control law 37 one gets ε ρ e ε ϕ ε γ w ˆ 11 w ˆ n h 1 n o v ˆ 11 v ˆ n 1 1 n h θ ˆ τ a l since ε ρ e ε ϕ ε γ l α 1 η 1 0 ρ e 0 β 1 η 1 0 α 2 η 2 0 ϕ 0 β 2 η 2 0 and α 3 η 3 0 γ 0 β 3 η 3 0 the conditions in 15 17 are satisfied by recalling 21 since ε ρ e t ε ϕ t and ε γ t converge to a neighborhood of the origin the tracking errors ρ e t ϕ t and γ t also tend to a ball around the zero this statement completes this proof remark 7 the results of the above stability analysis imply that the proposed control system not only stabilizes the tracking errors around the origin but also guarantees arbitrary prescribed performance criteria for the tracking errors which are determined by the expert designer via the adjustment of the controller parameters in practical situations before the beginning of the tracking mission 3 3 control parameters selection a correct parameter tuning is necessary to obtain a desirable tracking performance of the proposed control system in practice the adjustment of control parameters are carried out based on trial and error method however the theoretical and stability analysis may be used to extract some guidelines which are given as follows i ppf parameters the performance function parameters α i β i η i 0 i 1 2 3 are chosen large enough to ensure α 1 η 10 ρ e 0 β 1 η 10 α 2 η 20 ϕ 0 β 2 η 20 and α 3 η 30 γ 0 β 3 η 30 the parameters η i i 1 2 3 are used to specify the ultimate bound of the tracking error which are set large enough at the beginning and then they are decreased a small value is selected for the convergence rate a i 0 at the start then the user increases its value ii control parameters larger values of gains k p k v and λ increase the convergence rate c and improve the final tracking accuracy by increasing the adaptive gain γ θ in 46 the tracking accuracy and the robustness will be improved at the cost of a high control action and more chattering which is not desirable from a practical viewpoint the parameter ε 2 in the adaptive robust controller 43 may be adjusted to compromise between the smoothness of the control signal and the final tracking accuracy if large values of ε 2 are selected the generated control signals can be made smoother and the value of χ in 56 is increased and thus a larger ultimate bound is obtained and the tracking accuracy will be degraded iii nn parameters a small number of hidden layer neurons is set in the first simulation then the user should increase the neurons number gradually to obtain a desirable performance once the tracking performance is not improved further the increase of neurons number is stopped however a very large number of neurons will result in more computational burden and finally the tracking performance is degraded due to an over estimation the increase of γ w and γ v in nn update rules 38 improve the learning rate however very large values of them may cause an instability and their very small values extremely degrade the nn learning rate small amounts of δ w and δ v decrease χ in 54 which improves the final tracking accuracy however the robustness of nn update rules 38 is degraded by choosing very small values of δ w and δ v this means that the user should make a trade off between the robustness and final tracking accuracy the initial values of weights matrix i e w ˆ 0 is set to zero and v ˆ 0 is selected randomly in the next section simulation results show that the control objectives are satisfied in a real world environment in the presence of model uncertainties 4 numerical

by figs 5 7 the initial values of unknown parameters are θ 0 1 1 1 1 t and other initial values are set to zero the following bounded external disturbance is added to the vehicle dynamics to simulate ocean currents and waves 60 τ w j 0 25 s i g n j 0 5 sin 0 1 t j u v w q r the unknown nonlinearities of auv are considered as follows for this simulation shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 61 f i i a i 1 i a i 2 i i a i 3 i 3 i u v w q r where a i 1 0 5 a i 2 0 25 and a i 3 0 15 besides auv parameters are assumed to be unknown in this simulation the total elapsed time is about 7 5 s by using a 2 4 ghz intel core i5 processor while the sampling time and the number of iterations have been selected as 7 ms and 10 000 respectively fig 5 shows that the tracking errors exponentially converge to zero with a prescribed performance and the control objectives are fully satisfied thus by a fine tuning of the parameters in the performance functions and 15 17 a prescribed performance is obtained and the transient response parameters such as the maximum overshoot convergence rate and the ultimate bound are adjustable to achieve a desired tracking performance in fig 6 the auv and target trajectories are also depicted fig 7 a shows the input signals which are generated by the proposed controller fig 7 b shows the posture errors as shown by fig 7 c the filtered error signals converge to a neighborhood of the origin fig 7 d f illustrate the estimations of uncertain nonlinearities nn weights and parameters form these figures it is clear that the proposed controller has successfully forced the auv to track the desired target while it compensates the structured and unstructured uncertainties all of figures also point out that all signals in the resulting closed loop system are bounded 4 2 a comparative simulation study in this section the proposed controller is compared with the proposed controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 for this purpose same initial conditions are set for both controllers and all of the closed loop signals are evaluated with respect to the proposed controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 simulation results are provided by figs 8 10 1 1 in figs 8 10 1 is referred to shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 it can be observed that the distance and orientation tracking errors of the proposed controller of this paper converge to zero faster than the controller shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 in fig 8 moreover the proposed controller preserves a prescribed performance with a less steady state error as a result the vehicle is placed in a more accurate position along the desired trajectory than controller shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 in fig 10 a it is obvious that tracking performance of the proposed controller is better than that of shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 fig 10 shows that postures of the auv which utilizes the proposed controller significantly possess less overshoot than the auv which uses controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 in the last simulation the proposed controller is compared with the proposed controller in reference shojaei 2017 to this end same initial conditions are set for both controllers fig 11 2 2 in figs 11 12 2 is referred to shojaei 2017 shows that the proposed controller preserves a better maximum overshoot convergence rate and steady state error with respect to controller shojaei 2017 moreover the command control signals that are generated by the proposed controller are smoother than controller shojaei 2017 in fig 11 d as shown by fig 12 the auv which utilizes the proposed controller significantly converges faster to the desired trajectory than the auv which uses controller in shojaei 2017 consequently the simulation results confirm that the tracking performance has been improved by the proposed controller in this paper for a detailed investigation a quantitative comparison between three controllers are provided by tables 1 3 moreover the following performance indexes are used in this paper xu and yao 2001 as well rms t 1 t f 0 t f t 2 d t denotes the root mean square of the tracking errors e f max t f 5 t t f t represents the final accuracy of the tracking errors in the last 5 s the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed controller has a better performance with respect to the controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 and shojaei 2017 4 3 measurement noise and actuator saturation effects in this section the effects of the measurement noise and actuators saturation limits on the proposed control system are investigated a circular desired trajectory is considered for this simulation to evaluate the controller performance the control signals are saturated as τ k 80 k u q r in addition a gaussian white noise with zero mean and standard deviation 0 003 is added to all auv signals including posture and velocities to simulate real sensors measurements the simulation results are depicted by fig 13 as shown by the figure the controller performs the tracking mission well however further simulations show that the controller performance degrades by increasing the noise level and decreasing the saturation limits in the case that the sensors deliver very noisy measurements they may be removed from the system by designing an observer based controller in the case that the actuator saturation degrades the controller performance the design of a saturated controller is of interest the interested readers are referred to shojaei 2016b and shojaei 2015b for the design of saturated observer based controllers 5 conclusions in this paper a neural adaptive robust prescribed performance controller was proposed to solve the tracking problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the three dimensional space a three layer neural network and an adaptive robust controller with online estimators were employed to compensate structured and unstructured uncertainties respectively including unknown parameters unmodeled dynamics and unwanted

23095,in this paper the target tracking control problem is addressed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auv with a prescribed performance for this purpose the range and bearing angles of the auv relative to an underwater target are transformed to a second order open loop error dynamic model by using the prescribed performance bound technique then a new tracking controller is proposed such that the tracking errors converge to an arbitrary small ultimate bound and their transient performance are guaranteed with a pre specified maximum overshoot and the convergence rate to overcome unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances that are imposed on the vehicle by the wind waves and ocean currents a multi layer neural network and an adaptive robust controller are adopted a lyapunov stability synthesis shows that all signals of the control system are bounded and tracking errors converge to a small region containing the origin with a prescribed performance finally simulations are performed in matlab software and a comparative study verifies the theoretical results keywords adaptive robust control guaranteed transient performance neural network prescribed performance bound underwater vehicle 1 introduction the motion control problem of autonomous underactuated underwater vehicles auvs has been a topic of interest over past few decades some typical applications of auvs include rescue search surveillance reconnaissance mine counter measures inspection identification oceanography and so on in contrast to fully actuated underwater vehicles the underactuated ones possess less actuators than the degrees of freedom accordingly the tracking control problem of these vehicles is more difficult and more complex than that of the fully actuated ones this limitation is due to the intentional decrease of the independent actuators to lessen the cost and maintenance of the system shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 motivated by the vast applications and the challenging nature of underactuated auvs most of researchers have proposed valuable methods for the motion control of underactuated ocean vehicles reference shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 has developed a robust dynamic surface control for underactuated underwater vehicles in shojaei 2017 a novel trajectory tracking controller is introduced under thesaturation constraint in do et al 2004 and do 2015 the robust controllers are designed based on the backstepping method a cooperative line of sight target tracking is proposed in glotzbach et al 2015 reference shojaei and arefi 2015 has proposed a neural adaptive feedback control for underactuated underwater vehicles to deal with the uncertain parameters since stochastic obstacles may appear in the desired trajectory some collision avoidance control algorithms are proposed in li and wang 2013 lin et al 2017 ataei and yousefi koma 2015 conti et al 2015 to cope with unknown parameters model based adaptive controllers are developed in sarhadi et al 2016a 2016b hassanein et al 2016 to deal with unstructured uncertainties the sliding mode based controllers are proposed in xu et al 2015 esfahani et al 2015 cui et al 2016 elmokadem et al 2017 gao et al 2017 bessa et al 2010 in miao et al 2017 a spatial curvilinear path following controller has been proposed for underactuated auvs by using the backstepping technique and the active disturbance rejection control reference peymani and fossen 2015 has proposed a novel path following controller for auvs by employing the lagrange multiplier method to satisfy pre specified constraints moreover the leader follower formation controllers are designed in shojaei 2016a cui et al 2010 park 2015 for the cooperation of multiple auvs recently some novel controllers have been proposed in the literature to address the motion control of auvs yan and yu 2018 li et al 2018 karkoub et al 2017 from a review of the previous works shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 shojaei 2016a 2017 do et al 2004 do 2015 glotzbach et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 li and wang 2013 lin et al 2017 ataei and yousefi koma 2015 conti et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2016a 2016b hassanein et al 2016 xu et al 2015 esfahani et al 2015 cui et al 2010 2016 elmokadem et al 2017 gao et al 2017 bessa et al 2010 miao et al 2017 peymani and fossen 2015 park 2015 yan and yu 2018 li et al 2018 karkoub et al 2017 it turns out that the previous controllers cannot ensure the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the tracking errors in other words the transient and steady state responses specifications such as the convergence rate maximum overshoot undershoot and final tracking accuracy cannot be specified before the beginning of the tracking mission in previous controllers in the design of tracking controllers the stability problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles under structured and unstructured uncertainties is a challenging problem besides the conventional nonlinear controllers are not able to guarantee the stability of these systems with a prescribed performance in certain cases the adjustment of the transient response parameters such as overshoot and convergence rate are essential factors to design nonlinear controllers and the most of the classical nonlinear controllers are not able to guarantee the stability with a prescribed performance furthermore auvs are highly nonlinear and in practice structured and unstructured uncertainties cannot be ignored since their effects cause the instability in the control system as a result the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles have to be controlled by methods that compensate model uncertainties such as the robust and adaptive controllers in such techniques it is difficult to obtain a desirable transient response because of the parameters estimation and rough control signals that are produced by the robust controller consequently the stability guarantee for underactuated auvs with a prescribed performance still remains a challenging open problem toward this end an approximation free trajectory tracking controller is proposed in bechlioulis et al 2017 for underactuated auvs with the prescribed performance technique which is originally introduced for feedback linearizable mimo nonlinear systems in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 and its successful applications are available in the literature wang et al 2017 bechlioulis et al 2014 bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 however the reference bechlioulis et al 2017 ignores the advantages of approximation based methods such as neural network and adaptive techniques which are the main topic of this paper it should be noted that the approximation based methods including a combination of neural networks and adaptive robust techniques provide a powerful solution to compensate for the different types of uncertainties including unknown parameters unmodeled dynamics measurement noise and time varying external disturbances in practice in contrast to bechlioulis et al 2017 our proposed neural network adaptive robust controller is capable to learn every level of uncertainties by the online adaptation therefore the proposed controller maintains its robust performance with increasing the level of uncertainties and the amplitude of external disturbances at the expense of more control activities moreover compared with bechlioulis et al 2017 our proposed controller not only restricts the time evolution of the tracking errors within prescribed performance bounds but also it improves the final tracking accuracy within these bounds by using the neural adaptive robust method according to the above literature review the neural adaptive tracking control of uncertain underactuated auvs with a guaranteed prescribed performance has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 shojaei 2016a 2017 do et al 2004 do 2015 glotzbach et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 li and wang 2013 lin et al 2017 ataei and yousefi koma

bechlioulis et al 2017 for autonomous auvs this paper proposes a neural adaptive robust controller to achieve the tracking of a desired target in the presence of unmodeled dynamics unknown parameters and environmental disturbances which are induced by waves ocean currents and high pressure water by the prescribed performance technique to obtain the control objectives a second order open loop error dynamic model is developed under a nonlinear transformation next the controller is proposed by using a filtered tracking error a multi layer neural network and an adaptive robust controller are simultaneously employed to compensate both structured and unstructured uncertainties as a result the proposed controller guarantees the robust stability with a prescribed performance against unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances hence the main contributions of this paper is summarized as follows a target tracking controller is proposed for underactuated auvs in three dimensional space with the prescribed transient and steady state performance by employing a nonlinear transformation a new second order euler lagrange formulation of auvs is developed in terms of prescribed performance errors for the first time which preserves all properties of auv dynamics then a robust tracking controller is designed without any singularity by an effective combination of multi layer neural networks and an adaptive robust controller which compensate all types of model uncertainties the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section the problem formulation is presented in

of auv velocities including nonlinear hydrodynamic damping forces are considered by unknown functions f u u f v v f w w f q q and f r r in this paper the interested readers are referred to do and pan 2009 and fossen 2002 for a detailed description of auv modelling and parameters definitions the auv dynamics may be written in the actuated and non actuated directions as follows 3 m 1 υ a c 1 υ n υ a d 1 υ a f a υ a g 1 q τ w 1 t τ a t 4 m 1 υ n c 1 υ a υ a d 1 υ n f n υ n τ w 1 t 0 where 5 m 1 m 11 0 0 0 m 55 0 0 0 m 66 c 1 υ n 0 m 33 w m 22 v m 11 m 33 w 0 0 m 22 m 11 v 0 0 d 1 d 11 0 0 0 d 55 0

v τ w w where m 1 ℜ 3 3 is a positive definite inertia matrix c 1 υ n υ a ℜ 3 1 represents the centripetal and coriolis forces vector d 1 ℜ 3 3 denotes the positive definite damping matrix g 1 θ ℜ 3 1 stands for the gravity forces vector f a υ a ℜ 3 1 denotes nonlinear in parameter uncertain functions and unmodeled dynamics of the vehicle in the actuated directions τ w 1 ℜ 3 1 is a vector of

to follow a desired target υ a u q r t denotes the vector of velocities in the actuated directions and υ n v w t is the vector of velocities in the non actuated directions assumption 1 the desired trajectory and its derivatives up to the second order i e x d y d z d x d y d z d x d y d and z d are bounded and continuous signals assumption 2 the exogenous disturbance signals are bounded such that τ w u λ w u τ w q λ w q τ w r λ w r τ w v λ w v and τ w w λ w w where λ w u λ w q λ w r λ w v and λ w w are unknown positive constants assumption 3 the pitch angle satisfies θ t π 2 t 0 to prevent any singularity in the closed loop system assumption 4 fossen 2002 li et al 2008 the sway and heave velocities in non actuated directions are passive bounded t 0 in the sense that that sup t 0 v t λ v and sup t 0 w t λ w assumption 5 the posture and velocities of the underactuated underwater vehicle are available for the feedback in real time remark 1 similar to shojaei 2016a the effects of thrusters dynamics are considered as unmodeled dynamics in this paper remark 2 by referring to the literature do and pan 2009 fossen 2002 auvs do not enter to the neighborhood of θ π 2 because of the metacentric restoring forces thus θ t θ max π 2 remark 3 since the hydrodynamic damping forces in the second and third equations of 2 are dominant in the sway and heave directions in practical situations the sway and heave velocities are damped out by these forces hence by referring to literature fossen 2002 li et al 2008 the passive boundedness of these velocities can be easily analyzed similar to surface vessels in li et al 2008 consequently assumption 4 is adopted in this paper remark 4 in practice the roll dynamics are neglected in kinematic and dynamic equations of auvs in 1 and 2 when these vehicles are operating at low speeds and they are equipped with independent external or internal roll actuators the interested readers are referred to do and pan 2009 for further details 2 3 control objectives the control objective of this paper is to design the control input τ a t for the underactuated auv such that the target tracking errors in the spherical coordinates ρ e ϕ and γ according to fig 1 are stabilized at the origin with a pre assigned transient maximum overshoot convergence rate and the steady state error in the presence of the structured and unstructured uncertainties applied to auv including unknown parameters unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances due to waves and ocean currents here it is assumed that the auv is equipped with sensors which are able to measure range ρ e and heading angles ϕ γ of the auv for this purpose the following tracking errors are defined according to fig 1 7 ρ e 2 x e 2 y e 2 z e 2 γ arctan y e x e ϕ arctan z e x e 2 y e 2 where x e y e and z e are the position errors which are defined as follows based on fig 1 8 x e ρ e cos ϕ cos γ y e ρ e cos ϕ sin γ z e ρ e sin ϕ to proceed with the design procedure the position and orientation errors between the auv and target vehicle in the earth fixed frame are transformed into the body fixed frame as follows 9 x e y e z e cos θ cos ψ cos θ sin ψ sin θ sin ψ cos ψ 0 sin θ cos ψ sin θ sin ψ cos θ x x d y y d z z d then taking the time derivative of 9 leads to the following error dynamics at the kinematic level 10 x e u q z e r y e d 1 t y e v r x e r z e tan θ d 2 t z e w q x e r y e tan θ d 3 t where d 1 d 2 and d 3 are given as follows 11 d 1 t x d t cos θ cos ψ y d t cos θ sin ψ z d t sin θ d 2 t x d t sin ψ y d t cos ψ d 3 t x d t sin θ cos ψ y d t sin θ sin ψ z d t cos θ now by differentiating 7 with respect to the time and combining the resulting equation with 8 and 10 the error dynamic equations in spherical coordinates are obtained as follows 12 ρ

converge to a pre assigned residual set and guarantee any arbitrary prescribed maximum overshoot undershoot convergence rate and steady state error which strictly evolve within a bounded decreasing function of time called performance function that will be defined in the sequel mathematical definitions of prescribed performance are stated as follows bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 wang et al 2017 15 α 1 η 1 ρ e t β 1 η 1 16 α 2 η 2 ϕ t β 2 η 2 17 α 3 η 3 γ t β 3 η 3 where β 1 α 1 β 2 α 2 β 3 and α 3 are positive design constants which guarantee any transient and steady state response of the tracking errors in general the performance functions are defined as η i t η i 0 η i e a i t η i i 1 2 3 where η i is chosen small enough which is a candidate for the ultimate bound of the tracking error and its accuracy depends on the measuring device a i 0 provides some arbitrary lower bound on the convergence rate of the tracking errors and η i 0 η i 0 are some positive design constants the aforesaid definitions are illustrated by fig 2 remark 5 from 12 14 it can be seen that tracking errors are ill defined if ϕ π 2 and ρ e 0 moreover if γ π 2 the system loses its controllability in the actuated directions since ϕ t and γ t are defined as the orientation tracking errors which should converge to zero as t sufficient conditions are ϕ t π 2 and γ t π 2 t 0 to avoid a probable singularity and to preserve the controllability in the control system these conditions can be satisfied if ϕ t and γ t evolve within the bounds in 16 and 17 moreover if the bound in 15 is satisfied the distance error ρ e t converges to a small neighborhood of the origin such that ρ e ε 0 as t consequently the tracking errors become well defined if we restrict them in the prescribed bounds 15 17 t 0 and as a result the possible singularities will be avoidable to satisfy control objectives and to guarantee a prescribed performance for the transient and steady state responses of the tracking errors three strictly increasing functions f 1 ε ρ e f 2 ε ϕ and f 3 ε γ should be designed with the following properties 18 α 1 f 1 ε ρ e β 1 α 2 f 2 ε ϕ β 2 α 3 f 3 ε γ β 3 19 lim ε ρ e f 1 ε ρ e β

for the tracking errors such that all signals in the closed loop system remain bounded and tracking errors are stabilized in the neighborhood of the origin with prescribed transient and steady state

equations 15 17 it is obvious that ρ e η 1 f 1 ε ρ e ϕ η 2 f 2 ε ϕ and γ η 3 f 3 ε γ because of the strict monotonicity property of f 1 f 2 and f 3 and the fact that η i t 0 the inverse transformation functions ε ρ e f 1 1 ρ e t η 1 t ε ϕ f 2 1 ϕ t η 2 t and ε γ f 3 1 γ t η 3 t exist which are given as follows wang et al 2017 23 ε ρ e 0 5 p 1 1 ln ρ ˆ e t α 1 0 5 p 1 1 ln β 1 α 1 ε 1 0 5 p 1 1 ln β

ϕ cos θ cos θ 0 the following conditions verify that det r 0 i since η i 0 the terms ζ 1 ζ 2 and ζ 3 are non zero t 0 ii from remarks 2 and 5 one concludes that θ t θ max π 2 ϕ t π 2 and γ t π 2 t 0 which mean that cos k t 0 k γ ϕ θ iii the initial conditions should be selected such that tan ϕ tan θ cos γ since γ tends to a neighborhood of the zero exponentially fast as t this condition is reduced to tan ϕ tan θ 1 which means that ϕ θ π 2 since ϕ tends to a neighborhood of the zero exponentially fast as t this condition is reduced to θ π 2 which is impossible due to the metacentric restoring forces according to remark 2 therefore the possible singularity is prevented as long as the initial conditions are selected such that tan ϕ 0 tan θ 0 cos γ 0 hence r q e does not lose its

induce any restriction to system ge et al 2009 peng et al 2013 wang and huang 2002 therefore the unknown uncertain function ς p may be approximated by a three layer neural network as ς p w t σ v t x ε

guarantee that all signals in the closed loop system remain bounded as t and the tracking errors ρ e t ϕ t and γ t are semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded sguub and converge to a small ball

and recalling lemma 2 one achieves 53 v t λ min k p d e f 2 λ min k v λ q e 2 ε 2 c 1 θ 2 c 2 w f 2 c 3 v f 2 1 2 δ θ k 2 θ 2 1 2 δ v k 2 v f 2 1 2 δ w k 2 w f 2 1 2 ℓ 3 e f 2 1 2 ℓ 3 x w 2 1 2 ℓ 4 e f 2 1 2 ℓ 4 x w 4 where c 1 δ θ 1 0 5 k 2 c 2 δ w 1 0 5 k 2 and c 3 δ v 1 0 5 k 2 are positive constants provided that λ min k p d 0 5 ℓ 3 ℓ 4 one obtains 54 v t c 1 θ 2 c 2 w f 2 c 3 v f 2 ξ c 0 5 ℓ

c 2 c 3 c 4 and x p q e t e f t w 11 w n h 1 n o v 11 v n 1 1 n h θ t by solving 56 one gets 57 0 v t λ u χ c v t 0 λ u χ c e c t λ u t 0 from 57 it is clear that v t max v t 0 λ u χ c t 0 which together with 49 yields 58 x p t max v t 0 λ u χ c λ l as a result inequalities 49 56 and 57 imply that v t is strictly negative outside the compact set 59 ω x x p t 0 x p t max v t 0 λ u χ c λ l as a result as long as ξ c 0 5 ℓ 3 0 5 ℓ 4 x w 2 is satisfied x p t is decreasing whenever x p t is outside the set ω x according to 49 λ x x w t 2 v t v 0 λ u x p 0 2 t 0 and consequently one obtains x w

made arbitrarily large to contain every initial condition by choosing appropriate parameters of the proposed controller from the above discussion x p t is sguub and converges to a small neighborhood of the origin for this reason q e t e f t w 11 w n h 1 n o v 11 v n 1 1 n h θ t l which implies that the tracking errors and parameter estimation errors are sguub as well therefore by recalling 33 one concludes q e l besides by recalling assumption 7 and the control law 37 one gets ε ρ e ε ϕ ε γ w ˆ 11 w ˆ n h 1 n o v ˆ 11 v ˆ n 1 1 n h θ ˆ τ a l since ε ρ e ε ϕ ε γ l α 1 η 1 0 ρ e 0 β 1 η 1 0 α 2 η 2 0 ϕ 0 β 2 η 2 0 and α 3 η 3 0 γ 0 β 3 η 3 0 the conditions in 15 17 are satisfied by recalling 21 since ε ρ e t ε ϕ t and ε γ t converge to a neighborhood of the origin the tracking errors ρ e t ϕ t and γ t also tend to a ball around the zero this statement completes this proof remark 7 the results of the above stability analysis imply that the proposed control system not only stabilizes the tracking errors around the origin but also guarantees arbitrary prescribed performance criteria for the tracking errors which are determined by the expert designer via the adjustment of the controller parameters in practical situations before the beginning of the tracking mission 3 3 control parameters selection a correct parameter tuning is necessary to obtain a desirable tracking performance of the proposed control system in practice the adjustment of control parameters are carried out based on trial and error method however the theoretical and stability analysis may be used to extract some guidelines which are given as follows i ppf parameters the performance function parameters α i β i η i 0 i 1 2 3 are chosen large enough to ensure α 1 η 10 ρ e 0 β 1 η 10 α 2 η 20 ϕ 0 β 2 η 20 and α 3 η 30 γ 0 β 3 η 30 the parameters η i i 1 2 3 are used to specify the ultimate bound of the tracking error which are set large enough at the beginning and then they are decreased a small value is selected for the convergence rate a i 0 at the start then the user increases its value ii control parameters larger values of gains k p k v and λ increase the convergence rate c and improve the final tracking accuracy by increasing the adaptive gain γ θ in 46 the tracking accuracy and the robustness will be improved at the cost of a high control action and more chattering which is not desirable from a practical viewpoint the parameter ε 2 in the adaptive robust controller 43 may be adjusted to compromise between the smoothness of the control signal and the final tracking accuracy if large values of ε 2 are selected the generated control signals can be made smoother and the value of χ in 56 is increased and thus a larger ultimate bound is obtained and the tracking accuracy will be degraded iii nn parameters a small number of hidden layer neurons is set in the first simulation then the user should increase the neurons number gradually to obtain a desirable performance once the tracking performance is not improved further the increase of neurons number is stopped however a very large number of neurons will result in more computational burden and finally the tracking performance is degraded due to an over estimation the increase of γ w and γ v in nn update rules 38 improve the learning rate however very large values of them may cause an instability and their very small values extremely degrade the nn learning rate small amounts of δ w and δ v decrease χ in 54 which improves the final tracking accuracy however the robustness of nn update rules 38 is degraded by choosing very small values of δ w and δ v this means that the user should make a trade off between the robustness and final tracking accuracy the initial values of weights matrix i e w ˆ 0 is set to zero and v ˆ 0 is selected randomly in the next section simulation results show that the control objectives are satisfied in a real world environment in the presence of model uncertainties 4 numerical simulation examples 4 1 simulation results in this section the computer simulation of the proposed controller has been performed in matlab software and the performance of the proposed controller is evaluated the effects of ocean currents waves high pressure water and actuator dynamics are considered as unmodeled dynamics in the vector of bounded external signals the auv parameters are given by m

are selected as a 1 0 13 a 2 0 6 a 3 0 6 η 10 1 η 20 4 η 30 5 η 1 0 006 η 2 0 08 and η 3 0 08 in addition the error transformation functions parameters are chosen as α 1 1 β 1 35 α 2 β 2 0 6 α 3 1 β 3 0 7 p 1 p 2 p 3 1 and ε 1 13 the initial state vector of the vehicle is given by x 0 y 0 z 0 θ 0 ψ 0 t 15 15 0 0 0 t the nn parameters are also given by n h 10 γ w 1 i n h 1 γ v 1 i n i 1 δ w 0 9 δ v 0 9 and w ˆ ℜ 11 3 and v ˆ ℜ 24 10 the controller parameters are set to λ d i a g 5 5 5 k p 5 d i a g 1 1 1 k v 1 d i a g 1 1 1 γ θ d i a g 1 4 1 1 δ θ 1 and ε 2 30 simulation results are illustrated by figs 5 7 the initial values of unknown parameters are θ 0 1 1 1 1 t and other initial values are set to zero the following bounded external disturbance is added to the vehicle dynamics to simulate ocean currents and waves 60 τ w j 0 25 s i g n j 0 5 sin 0 1 t j u v w q r the unknown nonlinearities of auv are considered as follows for this simulation shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 61 f i i a i 1 i a i 2 i i a i 3 i 3 i u v w q r where a i 1 0 5 a i 2 0 25 and a i 3 0 15 besides auv parameters are assumed to be unknown in this simulation the total elapsed time is about 7 5 s by using a 2 4 ghz intel core i5 processor while the sampling time and the number of iterations have been selected as 7 ms and 10 000 respectively fig 5 shows that the tracking errors exponentially converge to zero with a prescribed performance and the control objectives are fully satisfied thus by a fine tuning of the parameters in the performance functions and 15 17 a prescribed performance is obtained and the transient response parameters such as the maximum overshoot convergence rate and the ultimate bound are adjustable to achieve a desired tracking performance in fig 6 the auv and target trajectories are also depicted fig 7 a shows the input signals which are generated by the proposed controller fig 7 b shows the posture errors as shown by fig 7 c the filtered error signals converge to a neighborhood of the origin fig 7 d f illustrate the estimations of uncertain nonlinearities nn weights and parameters form these figures it is clear that the proposed controller has successfully forced the auv to track the desired target while it compensates the structured and unstructured uncertainties all of figures also point out that all signals in the resulting closed loop system are bounded 4 2 a comparative simulation study in this section the proposed controller is compared with the proposed controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 for this purpose same initial conditions are set for both controllers and all of the closed loop signals are evaluated with respect to the proposed controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 simulation results are provided by figs 8 10 1 1 in figs 8 10 1 is referred to shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 it can be observed that the distance and orientation tracking errors of the proposed controller of this paper converge to zero faster than the controller shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 in fig 8 moreover the proposed controller preserves a prescribed performance with a less steady state error as a result the vehicle is placed in a more accurate position along the desired trajectory than controller shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 in fig 10 a it is obvious that tracking performance of the proposed controller is better than that of shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 fig 10 shows that postures of the auv which utilizes the proposed controller significantly possess less overshoot than the auv which uses controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 in the last simulation the proposed controller is compared with the proposed controller in reference shojaei 2017 to this end same initial conditions are set for both controllers fig 11 2 2 in figs 11 12 2 is referred to shojaei 2017 shows that the proposed controller preserves a better maximum overshoot convergence rate and steady state error with respect to controller shojaei 2017 moreover the command control signals that are generated by the proposed controller are smoother than controller shojaei 2017 in fig 11 d as shown by fig 12 the auv which utilizes the proposed controller significantly converges faster to the desired trajectory than the auv which uses controller in shojaei 2017 consequently the simulation results confirm that the tracking performance has been improved by the proposed controller in this paper for a detailed investigation a quantitative comparison between three controllers are provided by tables 1 3 moreover the following performance indexes are used in this paper xu and yao 2001 as well rms t 1 t f 0 t f t 2 d t denotes the root mean square of the tracking errors e f max t f 5 t t f t represents the final accuracy of the tracking errors in the last 5 s the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed controller has a better performance with respect to the controller in shojaei and dolatshahi 2017 and shojaei 2017 4 3 measurement noise and actuator saturation effects in this section the effects of the measurement noise and actuators saturation limits on the proposed control system are investigated a circular desired trajectory is considered for this simulation to evaluate the controller performance the control signals are saturated as τ k 80 k u q r in addition a gaussian white noise with zero mean and standard deviation 0 003 is added to all auv signals including posture and velocities to simulate real sensors measurements the simulation results are depicted by fig 13 as shown by the figure the controller performs the tracking mission well however further simulations show that the controller performance degrades by increasing the noise level and decreasing the saturation limits in the case that the sensors deliver very noisy measurements they may be removed from the system by designing an observer based controller in the case that the actuator saturation degrades the controller performance the design of a saturated controller is of interest the interested readers are referred to shojaei 2016b and shojaei 2015b for the design of saturated observer based controllers 5 conclusions in this paper a neural adaptive robust prescribed performance controller was proposed to solve the tracking problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the three dimensional space a three layer neural network and an adaptive robust controller with online estimators were employed to compensate structured and unstructured uncertainties respectively including unknown parameters unmodeled dynamics and unwanted time varying external disturbance signals a lyapunov stability analysis was used to show that all of the closed loop signals are bounded and tracking errors are sguub simulation results have shown the performance and effectiveness of the proposed controller a comparative study has been carried out to show a better performance of the proposed controller versus previous controllers in the literature numerical simulations demonstrated that the tracking errors settled inside the predefined exponential bounds and a prescribed performance has been satisfied the future works will be focused on the redesign of the proposed controller with only range and heading sensors which is very vital for the real implementation purposes acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge najafabad branch

23096,harsh weather and deep waters create challenging environments for offshore drilling and production facilities resulting in increased chances of failure these necessitate improving the resilience of engineering systems having a robust power system is an essential element of an offshore facility a power management system interacts with other engineering systems to maximize performance and limit potential failures ensuring a safe and continuous operation requires technological advancement increased reliability of integrated operations and improvement of power system resiliency this paper identifies the main requirements for an improved resilience of an offshore power management scheme different potential failure scenarios are identified and analyzed to quantify the resilience of the system the object oriented bayesian network format is adopted to model resilience as a function of anticipated reactions system adaptability absorptive capability and restoration sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the impact and interdependencies among different variables and strategies used to quantify resilience of an offshore power system and also to improve the system performance during certain failures by adapting control measures keywords resilience object oriented bayesian network oobn integrated operations power system 1 introduction the failure of an electrical power system has been identified as the most prominent common cause of failure for many engineering systems for offshore facilities such as floating production storage and offloading fpso vessels and drilling ships the prevailing high power demands necessitate the provision of an integrated power supply system that is largely dependent on parallel and synchronized generators weingarth et al 2009 to ensure successful operations it is of utmost importance to improve the overall efficiency and stability of the electrical power system otherwise the occurrence of any common mode fault could result in a total blackout the development of a control and power management system pms is critical to improving the system s resilience to power failures governance of major systematic faults and minimal stress in all operational conditions volts donald a islam moni chaney 2008 in harsh offshore environments dynamic positioning of drilling rigs is the preferred technology in such tumultuous settings undesirable electrical system outages or blackouts could lead to economic losses increased risk of environmentally devastating incidents and the attendant company s reputational loss consequently an improved resilience of the power supply system is desired to forestall the occurrence of blackouts at offshore facilities particularly due to severe weather conditions in this study a model of an electrical power system resilience is proposed using the object oriented bayesian network oobn the quantification of resilience is performed by means of integration of several operations such as the integrated control system and its maintainability the major factors that contribute to resilience are divided into two main categories reliability factors and recoverability factors recoverability factors are functions of both vulnerability and restorative factors vulnerability factors are those that may bring susceptibility to the power system whereas the restorative factors are those that mitigate the effects of vulnerability sarwar et al 2018 cai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the study uses known risk factors and employs important safety measures to estimate the probability of having a resilient system particularly fault tolerance capability quick response recoverability and avoiding vulnerability are emphasized a sensitivity analysis is conducted for the developed model to study the importance of the various process parameters and altering field observations in real time the oobn based model enables both predictive and diagnostic analysis with the help of intermediate nodes in the respective bayesian network bn model and estimates the posterior probabilities as new evidence is obtained section 2 presents the literature review of resilience modeling and its concept oobn and noisy or gate formats section 3 discusses the proposed methodology the development of resilience modeling and its contributing factors for an offshore electrical power system the proposed oobn model is also presented along with a description of the basic events failure probabilities which are used to assign prior probabilities to the oobn model discussed in section 3 section 4 presents the results and discussion and employs sensitivity analysis to identify the influence of system parameters applications of the proposed model to two different incident scenarios related to the offshore oil and gas industry are also presented in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 literature review this section reviews resilience modeling concepts the use of object oriented bayesian networks and the noisy or gate which will be applied to assess resilience in this study 2 1 resilience modeling and its concept resilience is the ability to minimize the magnitude and or duration of disruptive events the measure of the effectiveness of an infrastructures resilience depends upon its ability to anticipate absorb adapt to and or rapidly recover from a potentially catastrophic event berkeley iii r alfred wallace 2010 from the perspective of critical infrastructure resilience refers to coordinate planning taking place responsive behavior and the implementation of flexible and timely recovery measures as well as the development of a professional environment that requires minimal service during severe disruptions emergencies and disasters to quickly return operations back to their original state arsenault and sood 2007 defined the concept of a resilient organization as one capable of deflecting deliberate attacks and environmental disruptions or their effects absorbing unavoidable damages and resuming operations to pre event levels all with utmost speed according to haimes 2009 infrastructural resilience is the ability of the system to withstand major disruptions within acceptable degradation parameters and recover them with maintainability features within an acceptable time composite costs and risks moreover keogh and cody 2013 defined resilience as the robustness and recovering characteristics of utility infrastructure and operations that avoid or minimize the interruptions of service during an extraordinary and hazardous event fig 1 shows how resilience r t as a concept evolves as a function of time given that a disturbance event occurs in the event of a disruption say harsh weather at the time t de the power system should be able to adapt to the emergent conditions r t 0 represents the assessment of resilience at time t 0 which is the initial state resilience demands that the system hold a high value of r t at t t 0 for better adaptability with an initial failure event the resilience decreases significantly to r t ds now the impact of a failure event can be estimated by the difference r t ds r t 0 that helps to determine the appropriate corrective measures before applying them at t sr the initial restoration to state r t ns is an intermediate arrangement because the system may take longer to be fully restored i e t n t ns t ns t sr to the final steady state r t n the way for example how fast and how many intermediate post restoration states there might be a system progresses from state r t ns to r t n depends on various factors such as the strength of the system to withstand a disruptive event the severity of the disruption the adaptability of the system and the response processes which are divided into stages such as t 0 t t de that show the resilience during normal operations the prevalent concept of a system resilience reported in panteli mathaios mancarella 2015 cai et al 2017 2018 is extended here by introducing the concept of anticipation parallel to system absorption before any disruptive event system anticipation involves discovering potential risks and preparing preventive measures the condition t de t t ds denotes the damage propagation interval after an initial failure that mainly reflects the absorptive and adaptive capacity to minimize the initial damages and consequences such as cascading failures the condition t sr t t n is the recovering stage where extremis information is collected for assessment and resources are distributed to restore a new steady state quickly and effectively further discussion on resilience assessment can be found in sarwar et al 2018 2 2 object oriented bayesian network oobn the resilience assessment framework is based on an object oriented modeling approach where sub networks instance nodes are created in a model representing another bayesian network khakzad et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 the oobn allows an effective communication between sub networks avoids repetition of the same node structure by enabling reusable networks and achieves a reduced conditional probability tables and computationally efficient networks which are the primary objective in dealing with complex systems these sub network causal factors with the explicit labeling of output are linked with the top level of the model where the output of the instance node provides interfacing functionality to become the input of the top level model weber and jouffe 2006 cai et al 2017 2018 the sub nets input node accepts the same probability of its immediate parent node thus each input node should have one parent node in contrast output nodes convey the probabilistic value to other input nodes or affect the probabilities of other usual nodes as a result the output can have more than one child node khakzad et al 2013 cai et al 2017 fig 2 illustrates an example where the input nodes are represented by dashed lines output nodes are denoted with bold lines and instance nodes classes are also provided as is evident in fig 2 from left to right bayesian networks systems are simplified by using oobn methodology this work is developed in section 3 by converting the bn resilience model into oobn 2 3 noisy or gate the noisy or function is used in the model to interact between varying factors in terms of cause and effect of binary states true or false noisy or describes diverse interactions between n number of causes x 1 x 2 x n and their common effect represented by y which means noisy or assumes that the causes of x i influence y independently suppose the probability distribution of n number of causal factors p 1 p 2 p n where p i denotes the probability for y being true if one causal factor x i is true and the rest of the parameters are false such as x j j i onisko et al 2001 hosseini and barker 2016 the mathematical expression will be eq 1 1 p i p y true x i true x j false for each j i equation 2 is utilized for the probability of having y from the given subset x p of the x i which is true 2 p y true x p i x i x p 1 p i the noisy or function is also defined in eq 3 fenton norman neil 2012 where the term l denotes the leaky factor as shown in eq 4 which represents a situation where the probability of a system here expressed as y could fail if all its causal factors are true and vice versa this extended feature of the binary noisy or gate is appropriate to the system criteria where all causal factors of y are not considered bobbio et al 2001 adedigba et al 2016 cai et al 2016 2017 2018 liu et al 2018 normally such types of scenario are represented as 3 noisy or x 1 p 1 x2 p 2 xn p n l 4 l p y true x 1 false x n false xn false the estimated conditional probability of y with the given subset x p of x i can be achieved through the noisy or function by using the following eq 5 hosseini and barker 2016 adedigba et al 2016 5 p y true x p 1 l i x i x p 1 p i 3 methodlogy 3 1 proposed methodology framework of resilience modeling fig 3 explains the basic strategy that is adopted here to model system resilience the first step is to identify the pertinent case study factors the second step is to arrange intermediate nodes to model and integrate strategies that are used to reduce vulnerability and increase maintainability of the system then different strategies are classified in terms of operational and design levels the nodes obtained are used to construct various classes which are later combined to form the oobn model see fig 4 then prior probabilities see table 1 are assigned to the input nodes and based on these the posterior probability of resilience is obtained 3 2 modeling system resilience in this work and partly discussed in cai et al 2016 2017 2018 sarwar et al 2018 maintainability is discussed as the key factor in restoring the system to a workable state based on this assumption resilience is defined as a function of system reliability vulnerability v and maintainability m because vulnerability indicates negative effects of system disruptions maintainability is required to lower or cancel out the effects of vulnerability resilience φ is expressed as the aggregation of a system s passive and proactive survival rates as shown in eq 6 sarwar et al 2018 6 r e s i l i e n c e ϕ r e l i a b i l i t y r r e c o v e r a b i l i t y η where recoverability ƞ is a function of vulnerability v represented as 1 r and restoration ρ restoration ρ defines the ability of an engineered system to sustain its performance and restorative capacity when subjected to a disruption the restorative capacity of a system is a function of its maintainability m substituting for the recoverability function in eq 6 the resilience of an engineered system can be reformulated as shown in eq 7 sarwar et al 2018 7 ϕ r η 1 r m fig 4 presents the oobn model for the resilience assessment of offshore power system it highlights the reliability vulnerability and maintainability influencing factors the factors influencing the reliability of a system are embodied in the anticipatory and absorptive capacities of the system while the vulnerability and the maintainability influencing factors are defined by the adaptive and restorative capacities of the system 3 3 resilience modeling factors for offshore electrical power system 3 3 1 integrated

etc the continuity of power generation is most important so the critical components which must be considered in the generation system are energy storage devices generators uninterrupted power supply ups systems and main voltage mv switch gears 3 3 1 2 power management system as shown in fig 6 the focus of power management systems is to improve the electrical system robustness during disruption increase the capability to deal with major failures maximize the performance of the system and maintain the critical components under minimal stress in operational conditions the power management system plays a crucial part in automation and power systems on marine vessels are especially important for the vessels with electric propulsion systems and station keeping thrusters it also provides an integrated set of control supervision and management functions for engines generators switchgears and overall electrical control systems in the model four major factors on which depend the power management system are considered these include the power distribution system the blackout prevention strategy the load limit control system and the electric propulsion system power distribution system the interconnecting point for all installed power equipment is the power distribution system power distribution is entirely dependent on the power generation and power management systems the integrated power management system with high power and high voltage for floating facilities offers additional regulation challenges with many unknown problem areas in electrical generation and its distribution volts donald a islam moni chaney 2008 the allocation of power can be divided into the following categories normal power distribution which is the distribution of the electrical load to normal processes of the facility via operating generators functioning through dual fuels with the primary sources being fuel gas and the backup or secondary source being diesel offshore structures are usually equipped with an automatic transfer system so that the units switch to diesel upon the loss of fuel gas without affecting the platform load which provides redundancy of fuel sources emergency power distribution refers to the designated emergency loads required for emergency power distribution which are connected via emergency service transformers and feeds from normal and emergency generators in the case of power loss from topside power generation resulting in an emergency a dead bus relay picks up the power from emergency generators through emergency power distribution the emergency power distribution ensures that the energy storage technology can be adapted for the uninterrupted operation of the control system alarm management system the initial start of emergency generators etc blackout prevention strategy a blackout in electrical power systems normally occurs due to short circuits system overload a fault in active and reactive load sharing between power generators etc the blackout condition presents significant safety hazards as it will result in a total loss of the vessel s propulsion system as well as the vital auxiliary systems which may lead to catastrophe when the facility is operating in rough seas and in proximity to other vessels in the case of an offshore supply vessel or drilling platform this concern is magnified given the increased dependency on dynamic positioning systems during drilling operations a loss of power during these critical operations could potentially threaten the failure of subsurface well connections the major risk factors or the common causes of the blackout that need to be avoided are as follows a load fluctuation hossain m a kelly s j ahmed m f roa 2013 defined as malfunctioning in a power operation or the surging of electrical power distribution among critical equipment such as propulsion motors thrusters drilling equipment etc the frequent energizing and de energizing of the heavy load equipment causes certain changes in power demands and disturbs the steady state power flow to the electrical system the load fluctuation ultimately contributes to the degradation of connected equipment which may cause a breakdown in control and monitoring systems resulting in power failure of the vessel to prevent the effects of power surging or fluctuation the designer of the vessel or platform needs to consider the careful application of surge protection to sensitive equipment that may be affected by sudden and transient load fluctuations the b warning or alarms failure refers to a significant function of power management systems that increases the blackout prevention capabilities by informing power management systems to prevent sudden engine loss the pre warning alarms should initiate the next available generators backup or emergency automatically if any conditions occur that seem to approach critical limits or will lead to the shutdown of the engine the c cascading failures an unstable generator can result from mechanical failures load sharing malfunction voltage regulator or reactive load sharing malfunction overloading maloperation of protective relays or any other cause that contributes to a significant load imbalance for generators operating in parallel one unhealthy generator prime mover may lead to cascading failures of all online generators resulting in a blackout of the vessel generator prime movers large consumers and their associated auxiliary support systems should be properly maintained and effectively monitored to quickly isolate unhealthy generators or large consumers before the abnormal operation or failure can precipitate a blackout the d engine shutdown the gas diesel engines are prominent machinery that provide the initial driving force for generating electrical power the size and number of the engines which are utilized for generating electrical power depend on the amount of electrical power that is consumed by vessels onboard the failure of one or more engines can cause the shortage of electrical power or even a total blackout which can affect several parts of a dynamic positioning system such as the auxiliary machinery for main propulsion computers referencing systems electromotors for driving thrusters etc the availability of backup generators and related parts need to be monitored and atomized to achieve safe operation by using control devices continuously monitoring the load demand and automatically starting the standby generators or removing operating generators s from service based on load demand is of vital importance hossain m a kelly s j ahmed m f roa 2013 finally the e system monitoring automation provide unique automated solutions to ensure the reliable and stable supply of shipboard power they also allow integrated sets of controls supervision and management functions for engines generators switchboards and the control system load limit control system the optimum operation and control of the power distribution system are essential for safe operation and minimal fuel consumption this load limiting control system is based on switching off the group of non essential consumers or distributing the load to the critical equipment when there is a deficit of generated power the load control system mainly performs the following tasks a controllable consumer with respect to controllability of load consumers the manageable consumers are capable of precisely setting the load within the machine electrical mechanical limits these consumers with frequency converter drives are used in thrusters along with other integrating loads such as drilling activity loads compressors etc the b sheddable loads can be used for system load limiting and optimal load management the non essential consumers can be regarded as sheddable switching off the non essential group of load consumers is necessary to transfer that load to critical and important equipment such as navigational equipment accommodation the auxiliary machinery load etc c event based load monitors the network generating system and reacts based on unwanted events such as the tripping of the generating set by using event based fast load reduction for example if any component fails or the generator breaker trips in the switchboard the signal is hardwired to the remote i o unit or is transmitted to the load limit controller and initiates the event based load reduction program within a short period to avoid disruptions lauvdal trygve adnanes 2000 furthermore the d load forecast must be done efficiently based on total system connections and demand load calculations are completed based on equipment listed with special care and attention to the demand and diversity factors a careful study must be made of the parallel operations a system sized for the worst case operating scenario with consideration to the worst case environmental situation to ensure that the load forecast design is fit for the purpose craig c islam 2012 electric propulsion system the electric propulsion system is composed of the a dynamic positioning controller which uses high level controllers to compute surge and sway as yawing required to cancel the environmental effect in order to keep track of desired paths b integrated power automation systems and necessary for optimal and safe operations to cut maintenance costs by protecting against faults and malfunctions c thrust controllers are the allocated controllers which calculate the thrust set points for each propulsion unit with optimized criteria aiding in the reduction of extra power consumption and d vessel environment observer which defines the guidelines for the classification of environmental and climate conditions where the facility will operate such as the vibration level of critical equipment station keeping mechanical conditions chemical substances temperature humidity etc hansen j f wendt 2015 3 3 1 3 integrated control system the integrated control system emphasizes building maximum integration of system design and the operation of the current system this helps to manage overall functionality of a power system by optimizing steady state performance and provides the possibility for future expansion and continuous improvement radan 2008 subbarao m v srinagesh 2012 the system has the potential to monitor control and safeguard the system operation through the following features a autonomous smart grid that utilizes a digital information network to help maintain efficient power generation its transmission and consumption montoya 2010 the b abnormal situation management facilitates quick reactions especially during operational emergencies or breakers tripping that may further lead to a catastrophic situation blackout through c integrated alarm management system emergency shutdown of the system can be achieved the d enhanced information sharing refers to high speed dedicated and redundant information network sharing and managing the information to the control system for operators maintenance staff and external users to monitor and prevent disturbances in the electrical system allowing peak performance and efficiency subbarao m v srinagesh 2012 cai et al 2016 2018 system synchronization between equipment and standby generators is performed and checked by control systems before the generator circuit breakers are closed hossain m a kelly s j ahmed m f roa 2013 cai et al 2016 liu et al 2018 3 3 1 4 maintenance the maintenance activities include runtime maintenance and repair scheduling for the main electrical equipment and ensuring the availability of spare equipment which will strengthen the resilience and maintainability of power system operations subbarao m v srinagesh 2012 cai et al 2016 2017 2018 the active operational maintenance can be performed through a preventive maintenance which is the key to any successful assets management program and can be effectively implemented to reduce the reactive maintenance by applying standard conservation procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of the overall system and equipment b predictive maintenance meaning that high availability of the system can be accomplished by improved planning increased predictive reactive maintenance ratios and setting proper priority checks for maintenance activities c availability of maintenance staff and spare equipment on site and d good practice guidance including operator training simulators which can be used to train the operational staff in normal and abnormal situations 4 results and discussion the schematics of the proposed oobn models are shown in figs 4 and 5 the power system consists of many subsystems such as the electrical and electromechanical the electronic sensors and the communication system due to the complex infrastructure and integrated operating system involved many risk factors may affect a power system to achieve high efficiency and robustness of the system requires building resilient system and its quantification needs to be conducted considering its relevant variables with failure probabilities adopted from different sources and using expert judgments for rare events as shown in table 1 to analyze and monitor system performance all the variables used in the model are boolean variables that measure a dichotomous response of the parent nodes such as true false present absent and yes no this includes system anticipation system absorption the integrated control system and the categorized variables where true represents a successful positive outcome and false represents a negative outcome similarly yes and no of resilience improvement represents the counterparts of true and false for example the blackout prevention control in a true state means that the system can be prevented from being a blackout scenario by achieving system monitoring through automation minimizing cascaded failures while a false state shows the system has failed to achieve blackout prevention the posterior probability distribution of an intermediate event is determined by the impact of the weighted sum of probabilities on its parent nodes the weighted impact of each node represents the influence or effect on the parent node such weights are obtained based on the degree of belief using techniques such as an analytic hierarchy process and swing weights the mean weight variable w mean is presented in eq 8 where i represents the number of variables connected to the weight averaged child node w i is the weight associated with the ith variable in present study two subject area experts were consulted to help define the weights 8 w m e a n i 1 n w i x i 0 w i 1 x i 1 n w i 1 the posterior probability distribution of an intermediate event is based on boolean logic considering for example the association between the integrated control system and its sub system i e emergency shutdown if emergency shutdown system true true false indicates that an emergency shutdown is performed successfully due to failure of any synchronized generators or electrical equipment to avoid an increasingly chaotic situation that can occur at a facility by short circuits sudden voltage drops and others the integrated control system can be actively achieved by providing a backup generator to start without interrupting an operation the same interpretation can be used for other contributing elements of the resilience operation model to achieve high resilience the baseline scenario comprises the standard mode in which all the involved factors are working perfectly this reflects the best design and operation of the power system for example the probability table for the integrated control system includes true 9 82e 01 and false 1 80e 02 suggesting that integration of the control system is 98 2 successful while 1 8 failure of an operation negatively affects system design and operational performance furthermore system vulnerability has two states present 5 10e 02 and absent 9 49e 01 which means the system has 5 vulnerability which may affect the overall system or cause the failure of the operation although there is a 95 chance that it works perfectly this helps to calculate the overall resilience of the system the standard mode depicts a perfect system resilience with negligible power system failure and which achieves a successful performance of the operation 4 1 sensitivity analysis one if the methods to check the validity of the model is to perform sensitivity analysis on the specific nodes and check the impact of a set of variables on the selected nodes in this case the node system resilience is considered as the target node and the impact of its causal factors is measured in terms of conditional probability the sensitivity of the power system resilience to the identified nodes in table 2 is conducted by instantiating the individual node to a false state scenario 1 from table 2 and fig 7 for one failure event such as system absorptivity the negative impact on system resilience is lower than the impact of two or more failure events scenario 2 several scenarios are performed to analyze the result of system resilience in the extreme right column of table 2 are the observations made in terms of the number of failure events and the second right most column are the observed consequences on the resilience of the system fig 7 depicts the graphical representation of observed scenarios and their impact on the expected system resilience note that the graph of expected resilience is going down from scenario 1 to scenario 8 by considering the impacts of more failure events this signifies the contribution of each factor to the system performance the investigation and measurement of the individual impact of a failure event on the expected system resilience is shown in fig 8 from this study the impact of each disrupted event can be measured systematically along with the maintainability required to achieve the desired resilience of electric power for critical infrastructures especially systems designed for harsh environments it can also be concluded from the given case study that the integrated control system is the most sensitive subsystem and greatly affects the system performance because it is dependent on the integrated system design and operational system the power distribution system has less impact on system resilience however a combination of different failure events might have an adverse effect on system resilience 4 2 application of the proposed model for major incidents in the offshore oil and gas industry case 1 goliat fpso blackout incident of barents sea norge 2016 occurred in an oil and gas field located in the northwest of hammerfest supplied with onshore hydro generated electricity through a subsea cable on august 26 2016 at 22 30 production was stopped due to a complete loss of power for several hours the production capacity was approximately 110 000 barrels per day hence a great loss of revenue and stability of the platform the power failure halted the barents sea production and increased the safety risk which resulted in economic loss the proposed model discussed in section 3 is applied to assess the impact of the power failure on system resilience where the data in table 1 is used for the analysis due to the paucity of data from this particular incident the model presented in this section provided possible causal factors that increased system vulnerability and control measures that could help in protecting the system from disruptions and increase the system maintainability in the given analysis the following factors system absorptive capability blackout prevention control and integrated control system were considered to be unsuccessful during system design and operational activities and the effects of the failure of these factors could be observed on the system resilience of the goliat oil and gas field the absorptive capability of a system can be affected by its dependent features including the backup power generation and storage and backup power capability to energize critical equipment environmental condition monitoring the stability of installed equipment equipment virataion and ageing infrastructure each of these factors have different effects on the disruption of the absorptive capability of the oil and gas field and their importance is determined using the weight sum of probabilities of its parent nodes considering a noisy or gate with a leak of 1 00e 02 for the system resilience node the system resilience was observed to reduce from 9 49e 01 to 5 73e 01 case 2 hibernia production halted by power outage cbc 2010 an oil production platform located about 315 km southeast of st john s newfoundland suspended its production due to a power outage during periodic maintenance of the main generator which knocked out the alarm system the emergency power restored the essential operations of the platform but production was halted for day cbc 2010 by applying the resilience model to this case study and considering that the system restorative capability and blackout prevention control did not function because of an induced failure due to a maintenance operation the system resilience for the hibernia platform was assessed the failure of the system restorative capacity occurred due to the non performance of the following factors the engineering workstation onsite repair resources power outage management scheme and retrieving early the detection of faults similarly sensitivity of the system restoration to its components was analyzed these 4 causal factors were considered for the system restoration using the noisy or formalism with a leak probability of 1 00e 02 in this analysis the system vulnerability chance of power loss due to these factors increased from 4 0e 02 to 2 7e 01 and the overall system resilience for the degraded state was reduced from 9 49e 01 to 7 14e 01 the desired resilience of system performance can be maintained and improved upon by applying additional control measures including availability of stand by generators at site proper implementation of an energy management system integrated power management of the complex system and its efficient power optimization and the installation of protection relays for the critical equipment the model quantified system resilience and its dependent features to aid designers and energy planners dealing with the shortcomings of the design and operation 5 conclusions this study has developed a methodology for assessing the resilience of a power management system to disruptive events using object oriented bayesian network formalism this enables system designers in exploiting different strategies to assess resilience while investigating the impact of contributing risk factors on system performance through sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis has revealed that the resilience of the power management system is highly dependent on the integrated control system system restoration system and the system absorptive capability the resilience of offshore facilities has been discussed as a function of system reliability vulnerability and maintainability which have been assessed through an integrated system design and its operation extra control measures and different scenarios have been suggested in this study to reduce the negative impact of the vulnerability of the system and achieve higher maintainability the adopted bayesian network modeling approach has enabled probability updating as well as conducting both predictive and diagnostic analysis acknowledgments the authors greatly acknowledge the financial support provided by the collaboration between

23096,harsh weather and deep waters create challenging environments for offshore drilling and production facilities resulting in increased chances of failure these necessitate improving the resilience of engineering systems having a robust power system is an essential element of an offshore facility a power management system interacts with other engineering systems to maximize performance and limit potential failures ensuring a safe and continuous operation requires technological advancement increased reliability of integrated operations and improvement of power system resiliency this paper identifies the main requirements for an improved resilience of an offshore power management scheme different potential failure scenarios are identified and analyzed to quantify the resilience of the system the object oriented bayesian network format is adopted to model resilience as a function of anticipated reactions system adaptability absorptive capability and restoration sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the impact and interdependencies among different variables and strategies used to quantify resilience of an offshore power system and also to improve the system performance during certain failures by adapting control measures keywords resilience object oriented bayesian network oobn integrated operations power system 1 introduction the failure of an electrical power system has been identified as the most prominent common cause of failure for many engineering systems for offshore facilities such as floating production storage and offloading fpso vessels and drilling ships the prevailing high power demands necessitate the provision of an integrated power supply system that is largely dependent on parallel and synchronized generators weingarth et al 2009 to ensure successful operations it is of utmost importance to improve the overall efficiency and stability of the electrical power system otherwise the occurrence of any common mode fault could result in a total blackout the development of a control and power management system pms is critical to improving the system s resilience to power failures governance of major systematic faults and minimal stress in all operational conditions volts donald a islam moni chaney 2008 in harsh offshore environments dynamic positioning of drilling rigs is the preferred technology in such tumultuous settings undesirable electrical system outages or blackouts could lead to economic losses increased risk of environmentally devastating incidents and the attendant company s reputational loss consequently an improved resilience of the power supply system is desired to forestall the occurrence of blackouts at offshore facilities particularly due to severe weather conditions in this study a model of an electrical power system resilience is proposed using the object oriented bayesian network oobn the quantification of resilience is performed by means of integration of several operations such as the integrated control system and its maintainability the major factors that contribute to resilience are divided into two main categories reliability factors and recoverability factors recoverability factors are functions of both vulnerability and restorative factors vulnerability factors are those that may bring susceptibility to the power system whereas the restorative factors are those that mitigate the effects of vulnerability sarwar et al 2018 cai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the study uses known risk factors and employs important safety measures to estimate the probability of having a resilient system particularly fault tolerance capability quick response recoverability and avoiding vulnerability are emphasized a sensitivity analysis is conducted for the developed model to study the importance of the various process parameters and altering field observations in real time the oobn based model enables both predictive and diagnostic analysis with the help of intermediate nodes

results and discussion and employs sensitivity analysis to identify the influence of system parameters applications of the proposed model to two different incident scenarios related to the offshore oil and gas industry are also presented in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 literature review this section reviews resilience modeling concepts the use of object oriented bayesian networks and the noisy or gate which will be applied to assess resilience in this study 2 1 resilience modeling and its concept resilience is the ability to minimize the magnitude and or duration of disruptive events the measure of the effectiveness of an infrastructures resilience depends upon its ability to anticipate absorb adapt to and or rapidly recover from a potentially catastrophic event berkeley iii r alfred wallace 2010 from the perspective of critical infrastructure resilience refers to coordinate planning taking place responsive behavior and the implementation of flexible and timely recovery measures as well as the development of a professional environment that requires minimal service during severe disruptions emergencies and disasters to quickly return operations back to their original state arsenault and sood 2007 defined the concept of a resilient organization as one capable of deflecting deliberate attacks and environmental disruptions or their effects absorbing unavoidable damages and resuming operations to pre event levels all with utmost speed according to haimes 2009 infrastructural resilience is the ability of the system to withstand major disruptions within acceptable degradation parameters and recover them with maintainability features within an acceptable time composite costs and risks moreover keogh and cody 2013 defined resilience as the robustness and recovering characteristics of utility infrastructure and operations that avoid or minimize the interruptions of service during an extraordinary and hazardous event fig 1 shows how resilience r t as a concept evolves as a function of time given that a disturbance event occurs in the event of a disruption say harsh weather at the time t de the power system should be able to adapt to the emergent conditions r t 0 represents the assessment of resilience at time t 0 which is the initial state resilience demands that the system hold a high value of r t at t t 0 for better adaptability with an initial failure event the resilience decreases significantly to r t ds now the impact of a failure event can be estimated by the difference r t ds r t 0 that helps to determine the appropriate corrective measures before applying them at t sr the initial restoration to state r t ns is an intermediate arrangement because the system may take longer to be fully restored i e t n t ns t ns t sr to the final steady state r t n the way for example how fast and how many intermediate post restoration states there might be a system progresses from state r t ns to r t n depends on various factors such as the strength of the system to withstand a disruptive event the severity of the disruption the adaptability of the system and the response processes which are divided into stages such as t 0 t t de that show the resilience during normal operations the prevalent concept of a system resilience reported in panteli mathaios mancarella 2015 cai et al 2017 2018 is extended here by introducing the concept of anticipation parallel to system absorption before any disruptive event system anticipation involves discovering potential risks and preparing preventive measures the condition t de t t ds denotes the damage propagation interval after an initial failure that mainly reflects the absorptive and adaptive capacity to minimize the initial damages and consequences such as cascading failures the condition t sr t t n is the recovering stage where extremis information is collected for assessment and resources are distributed to restore a new steady state quickly and effectively further discussion on resilience assessment can be found in sarwar et al 2018 2 2 object oriented bayesian network oobn the resilience assessment framework is based on an object oriented modeling approach where sub networks instance nodes are created in a model representing another bayesian network khakzad et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 the oobn allows an effective communication between sub networks avoids repetition of the same node structure by enabling reusable networks and achieves a reduced conditional probability tables and computationally efficient networks which are the primary objective in dealing with complex systems these sub network causal factors with the explicit labeling of output are linked with the top level of the model where the output of the instance node provides interfacing functionality to become the input of the top level model weber and jouffe 2006 cai et al 2017 2018 the sub nets input node accepts the same probability of its immediate parent node thus each input node should have one parent node in contrast output nodes convey the probabilistic value to other input nodes or affect the probabilities of other usual nodes as a result the output can have more than one child node khakzad et al 2013 cai et al 2017 fig 2 illustrates an example where the input nodes are represented by dashed lines output nodes are denoted with bold lines and instance nodes classes are also provided as is evident in fig 2 from left to right bayesian networks systems are simplified by using oobn methodology this work is developed in section 3 by converting the bn resilience model into oobn 2 3 noisy or gate the noisy or function is used in the model to interact between varying factors in terms of cause and effect of binary states true or false noisy or describes diverse interactions between n number of causes x 1 x 2 x n and their common effect represented by y which means noisy or assumes that the causes of x i influence y independently suppose the probability distribution of n number of causal factors p 1 p 2 p n where p i denotes the probability for y being true if one causal factor x i is true and the rest of the parameters are false such as x j j i onisko et al 2001 hosseini and barker 2016 the mathematical expression will be eq 1 1 p i p y true x i true x j false for each j i equation 2 is utilized for the probability of having y from the given subset x p of the x i which is true 2 p y true x p i x i x p 1 p i the noisy or function is also defined in eq 3 fenton norman neil 2012 where the term l denotes the leaky factor as shown in eq 4 which represents a situation where the probability of a system here expressed as y could fail if all its causal factors are true and vice versa this extended feature of the binary noisy or gate is appropriate to the system criteria where all causal factors of y are not considered bobbio et al 2001 adedigba et al 2016 cai et al 2016 2017 2018 liu et al 2018 normally such types of scenario are represented as 3 noisy or x 1 p 1 x2 p 2 xn p n l 4 l p y true x 1 false x n false xn false the estimated conditional probability of y with the given subset x p of x i can be achieved through the noisy or function by using the following eq 5 hosseini and barker 2016 adedigba et al 2016 5 p y true x p 1 l i x i x p 1 p i 3 methodlogy 3 1 proposed methodology framework of resilience modeling fig 3 explains the basic strategy that is adopted here to model system resilience the first step is to identify the pertinent case study factors the second step is to arrange intermediate nodes to model and integrate strategies that are used to reduce vulnerability and increase maintainability of the system then different strategies are classified in terms of operational and design levels the nodes obtained are used to construct various classes which are later combined to form the oobn model see fig 4 then prior probabilities see table 1 are assigned to the input nodes and based on these the posterior probability of resilience is obtained 3 2 modeling system resilience in this work and partly discussed in cai et al 2016 2017 2018 sarwar et al 2018 maintainability is discussed as the key factor in restoring the system to a workable state based on this assumption resilience is defined as a function of system reliability vulnerability v and maintainability m because vulnerability indicates negative effects of system disruptions maintainability is required to lower or cancel out the effects of vulnerability resilience φ is expressed as the aggregation of a system s passive and proactive survival rates as shown in eq 6 sarwar et al 2018 6 r e s i l i e n c e ϕ r e l i a b i l i t y r r e c o v e r a b i l i t y η where recoverability ƞ is a function of vulnerability v represented as 1 r and restoration ρ restoration ρ defines the ability of an engineered system to sustain its performance and restorative capacity when subjected to a disruption the restorative capacity of a system is a function of its maintainability m substituting for the recoverability function in eq 6 the resilience of an engineered system can be reformulated as shown in eq 7 sarwar et al 2018 7 ϕ r η 1 r m fig 4 presents the oobn model for the resilience assessment of offshore power system it highlights the reliability vulnerability and maintainability influencing factors the factors influencing the reliability of a system are embodied in the anticipatory and absorptive capacities of the system while the vulnerability and the maintainability influencing factors are defined by the adaptive and restorative capacities of the system 3 3 resilience modeling factors for offshore electrical power system 3 3 1 integrated operational system the integration of work processes and technology enable the system to make smarter decisions and achieve better execution by using real time information collaborative advanced technology and multiple expertise across multiple disciplines lima et al 2015 the exploration of new offshore oil and gas fields pushes workers and structures into deeper waters and harsher environments so an integrated power system design for these offshore energy vessels and deep water rigs is required for a modern oil and gas vessel there is an array of dependent factors subsystems and interfaces the integrated marine power operation mainly relies on four subsystems a power generation system b power management system c integrated control system and d maintenance 3 3 1 1 power generation system the power generation system is the most vital system on board the generated power is supplied to electrically driven thrusters and provides energy to the facility drilling activities etc the continuity of power generation is most important so the critical components which must be considered in the generation system are energy storage devices generators uninterrupted power supply ups systems and main voltage mv switch gears 3 3 1 2 power management system as shown in fig 6 the focus of power management systems is to improve the electrical system robustness during disruption increase the capability to deal with major failures maximize the performance of the system and maintain the critical components under minimal stress in operational conditions the power management system plays a crucial part in automation and power systems on marine vessels are especially important for the vessels with electric propulsion systems and station keeping thrusters it also provides an integrated set of control supervision and management functions for engines generators switchgears and overall electrical control systems in the model four major factors on which depend the power management system are considered these include the power distribution system the blackout prevention strategy the load limit control system and the electric propulsion system power distribution system the interconnecting point for all installed power equipment is the power distribution system power distribution is entirely dependent on the power generation and power management systems the integrated power management system with high power and high voltage for floating facilities offers additional regulation challenges with many unknown problem areas in electrical generation and its distribution volts donald a islam moni chaney 2008 the allocation of power can be divided into the following categories normal power distribution which is the distribution of the electrical load to normal processes of the facility via operating generators functioning through dual fuels with the primary sources being fuel gas and the backup or secondary source being diesel offshore structures are usually equipped with an automatic transfer system so that the units switch to diesel upon the loss of fuel gas without affecting the platform load which provides redundancy of fuel sources emergency power distribution refers to the designated emergency loads required for emergency power distribution which are connected via emergency service transformers and feeds from normal and emergency generators in the case of power loss from topside power generation resulting in an emergency a dead bus relay picks up the power from emergency generators through emergency power distribution the emergency power distribution ensures that the energy storage technology can be adapted for the uninterrupted operation of the control system alarm management system the initial start of emergency generators etc blackout prevention strategy a blackout in electrical power systems normally occurs due to short circuits system overload a fault in active and reactive load sharing between power generators etc the blackout condition presents significant safety hazards as it will result in a total loss of the vessel s propulsion system as well as the vital auxiliary systems which may lead to catastrophe when the facility is operating in rough seas and in proximity to other vessels in the case of an offshore supply vessel or drilling platform this concern is magnified given the increased dependency on dynamic positioning systems during drilling operations a loss of power during these critical operations could potentially threaten the failure of subsurface well connections the major risk factors or the common causes of the blackout that need to be avoided are as follows a load fluctuation hossain m a kelly s j ahmed m f roa 2013 defined as malfunctioning in a power operation or the surging of electrical power distribution among critical equipment such as propulsion motors thrusters drilling equipment etc the frequent energizing and de energizing of the heavy load equipment causes certain changes in power demands and disturbs the steady state power flow to the electrical system the load fluctuation ultimately contributes to the degradation of connected equipment which may cause a breakdown in control and monitoring systems resulting in power failure of the vessel to prevent the effects of power surging or fluctuation the designer of the vessel or platform needs to consider the careful application of surge protection to sensitive equipment that may be affected by sudden and transient load fluctuations the b warning or alarms failure refers to a significant function of power management systems that increases the blackout prevention capabilities by informing power management systems to prevent sudden engine loss the pre warning alarms should initiate the next available generators backup or emergency automatically if any conditions occur that seem to approach critical limits or will lead to the shutdown of the engine the c cascading failures an unstable generator can result from mechanical failures load sharing malfunction voltage regulator or reactive load sharing malfunction overloading maloperation of protective relays or any other cause that contributes to a significant load imbalance for generators operating in parallel one unhealthy generator prime mover may lead to cascading failures of all online generators resulting in a blackout of the vessel generator prime movers large consumers and their associated auxiliary support systems should be properly maintained and effectively monitored to quickly isolate unhealthy generators or large consumers before the abnormal operation or failure can precipitate a blackout the d engine shutdown the gas diesel engines are prominent machinery that provide the initial driving force for generating electrical power the size and number of the engines which are utilized for generating electrical power depend on the amount of electrical power that is consumed by vessels onboard the failure of one or more engines can cause the shortage of electrical power or even a total blackout which can affect several parts of a dynamic positioning system such as the auxiliary machinery for main propulsion computers referencing systems electromotors for driving thrusters etc the availability of backup generators and related parts need to be monitored and atomized to achieve safe

also allow integrated sets of controls supervision and management functions for engines generators switchboards and the control system load limit control system the optimum operation and control of the power distribution system are essential for safe operation and minimal fuel consumption this load limiting control system is based on switching off the group of non essential consumers or distributing the load to the critical equipment when there is a deficit of generated power the load control system mainly performs the following tasks a controllable consumer with respect to controllability of load consumers the manageable consumers are capable of precisely setting the load within the machine electrical mechanical limits these consumers with frequency converter drives are used in thrusters along with other integrating loads such as drilling activity loads compressors etc the b sheddable loads can be used for system load limiting and optimal load management the non essential consumers can be regarded as sheddable switching off the non essential group of load consumers is necessary to transfer that load to critical and important equipment such as navigational equipment accommodation the auxiliary machinery load etc c event based load monitors the network generating system and reacts based on unwanted events such as the tripping of the generating set by using event based fast load reduction for example if any component fails or the generator breaker trips in the switchboard the signal is hardwired to the remote i o unit or is transmitted to the load limit controller and initiates the event based load reduction program within a short period to avoid disruptions lauvdal trygve adnanes 2000 furthermore the d load forecast must be done efficiently

schematics of the proposed oobn models are shown in figs 4 and 5 the power system consists of many subsystems such as the electrical and electromechanical the electronic sensors and the communication system due to the complex infrastructure and integrated operating system involved many risk factors may affect a power system to achieve high efficiency and robustness of the system requires building resilient system and its quantification needs to be conducted considering its relevant variables with failure probabilities adopted from different sources and using expert judgments for rare events as shown in table 1 to analyze and monitor system performance all the variables used in the model are boolean variables that measure a dichotomous response of the parent nodes such as true false present absent and yes no this includes system anticipation system absorption the integrated control system and the categorized variables where true represents a successful positive outcome and false represents a negative outcome similarly yes and no of resilience improvement represents the counterparts of true and false for example the blackout prevention control in a true state means that the system can be prevented from being a blackout scenario by achieving system monitoring through automation minimizing cascaded failures while a false state shows the system has failed to achieve blackout prevention the posterior probability distribution of an intermediate event is determined by the impact of the weighted sum of probabilities on its parent nodes the weighted impact of each node represents the influence or effect on the parent node such weights are obtained based on the degree of belief using techniques such as an analytic hierarchy process and swing weights the mean weight variable w mean is presented in eq 8 where i represents the number of variables connected to the weight averaged child node w i is the weight associated with the ith variable in present study two subject area experts were consulted to help define the weights 8 w m e a n i 1 n w i x i 0 w i 1 x i 1 n w i 1 the posterior probability distribution of an intermediate event is based on boolean logic considering for example the association between the integrated control system and its sub system i e emergency shutdown if emergency shutdown system true true false indicates that an emergency shutdown is performed successfully due to failure of any synchronized generators or electrical equipment to avoid an increasingly chaotic situation that can occur at a facility by short circuits sudden voltage drops and others the integrated control system can be actively achieved by providing a backup generator to start without interrupting an operation the same interpretation can be used for other contributing elements of the resilience operation model to achieve high resilience the baseline scenario comprises the standard mode in which all the involved factors are working perfectly this reflects the best design and operation of the power system for example the probability table for the integrated control system includes true 9 82e 01 and false 1 80e 02 suggesting that integration of the control system is 98 2 successful while 1 8 failure of an operation negatively affects system design and operational performance furthermore system vulnerability has two states present 5 10e 02 and absent 9 49e 01 which means the system has 5 vulnerability which may affect the overall system or cause the failure of the operation although there is a 95 chance that it works perfectly this helps to calculate the overall resilience of the system the standard mode depicts a perfect system resilience with negligible power system failure and which achieves a successful performance of the operation 4 1 sensitivity analysis one if the methods to check the validity of the model is to perform sensitivity analysis on the specific nodes and check the impact of a set of variables on the selected nodes in this case the node system resilience is considered as the target node and the impact of its causal factors is measured in terms of conditional probability the sensitivity of the power system resilience to the identified nodes in table 2 is conducted by instantiating the individual node to a false state scenario 1 from table 2 and fig 7 for one failure event such as system absorptivity the negative impact on system resilience is lower than the impact of two or more failure events scenario 2 several scenarios are performed to analyze the result of system resilience in the extreme right column of table 2 are the observations made in terms of the number of failure events and the second right most column are the observed consequences on the resilience of the system fig 7 depicts the graphical representation of observed scenarios and their impact on the expected system resilience note that the graph of expected resilience is going down from scenario 1 to scenario 8 by considering the impacts of more failure events this signifies the contribution of each factor to the system performance the investigation and measurement of the individual impact of a failure event on the expected system resilience is shown in fig 8 from this study the impact of each disrupted event can be measured systematically along with the maintainability required to achieve the desired resilience of electric power for critical infrastructures especially systems designed for harsh environments it can also be concluded from the given case study that the integrated control system is the most sensitive subsystem and greatly affects the system performance because it is dependent on the integrated system design and operational system the power distribution system has less impact on system resilience however a combination of different failure events might have an adverse effect on system resilience 4 2 application of the proposed model for major incidents in the offshore oil and gas industry case 1 goliat fpso blackout incident of barents sea norge 2016 occurred in an oil and gas field located in the northwest of hammerfest supplied with onshore hydro generated electricity through a subsea cable on august 26 2016 at 22 30 production was stopped due to a complete loss of power for several hours the production capacity was approximately 110 000 barrels per day hence a great loss of revenue and stability of the platform the power failure halted the barents sea production and increased the safety risk which resulted in economic loss the proposed model discussed in section 3 is applied to assess the impact of the power failure on system resilience where the data in table 1 is used for the analysis due to the paucity of data from this particular incident the model presented in this section provided possible causal factors that increased system vulnerability and control measures that could help in protecting the system from disruptions and increase the system maintainability in the given analysis the following factors system absorptive capability blackout prevention control and integrated control system were considered to be unsuccessful during system design and operational activities and the effects of the failure of these factors could be observed on the system resilience of the goliat oil and gas field the absorptive capability of a system can be affected by its dependent features including the backup power generation and storage and backup power capability to energize critical equipment environmental condition monitoring the stability of installed equipment equipment virataion and ageing infrastructure each of these factors have different effects on the disruption of the absorptive capability of the oil and gas field and their importance is determined using the weight sum of probabilities of its parent nodes considering a noisy or gate with a leak of 1 00e 02 for the system resilience node the system resilience was observed to reduce from 9 49e 01 to 5 73e 01 case 2 hibernia production halted by power outage cbc 2010 an oil production platform located about 315 km southeast of st john s newfoundland suspended its production due to a power outage during periodic maintenance of the main generator which knocked out the alarm system the emergency power restored the essential operations of the platform but production was halted for day cbc 2010 by applying the resilience model to this case study and considering that the system restorative capability and blackout prevention control did not function because of an induced failure due to a maintenance operation the system resilience for the hibernia platform was assessed the failure of the system restorative capacity occurred due to the non performance of the following factors the engineering workstation onsite repair resources power outage management scheme and retrieving early the detection of faults similarly sensitivity of the system restoration to its components was analyzed these 4 causal factors were considered for the system restoration using the noisy or formalism with a leak probability of 1 00e 02 in this analysis the system vulnerability chance of power loss due to these factors increased from 4 0e 02 to 2 7e 01 and the overall system resilience for the degraded state was reduced from 9 49e 01 to 7 14e 01 the desired resilience of system performance can be maintained and improved upon by applying additional control measures including availability of stand by generators at site proper implementation of an energy management system integrated power management of the complex system and its efficient power optimization and the installation of protection relays for the critical equipment the model quantified system resilience and its dependent features to aid designers and energy planners dealing with the shortcomings of the design and operation 5 conclusions this study has developed a methodology for assessing the resilience of a power management system to disruptive events using object oriented bayesian network formalism this enables system designers in exploiting different strategies to assess resilience while investigating the impact of contributing risk factors on system performance through sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis has revealed that the resilience of the power management system is highly dependent on the integrated control system system restoration system and the system absorptive capability the resilience of offshore facilities has been discussed as a function of system reliability vulnerability and maintainability which have been assessed through an integrated system design and its operation extra control measures and different scenarios have been suggested in this study to reduce the negative impact of the vulnerability of the system and achieve higher maintainability the adopted bayesian network modeling approach has enabled probability updating as well as conducting both predictive and diagnostic analysis acknowledgments the authors greatly acknowledge the financial support provided by the collaboration between

operator 1 introduction the dynamic response of structures in contact with fluid can be very different from the response in vacuum this is because the fluid adds inertia to the system reducing the natural frequencies of the system in order to avoid resonance phenomena an accurate analysis with hydrodynamic structural coupling is required many approaches have been used for this purpose varying from analytical to semi analytical methods as well as the finite element method while finite element models can deal with arbitrary geometries analytical methods are more appropriate for performing parametric studies and obtaining insight in the problem the vibration of structures coupled to a fluid domain has been studied considering various geometries and physical assumptions the hydroelastic vibration of circular plates has been analyzed considering an incompressible fluid domain jeong et al 2009 and a compressible fluid domain jeong and kim 2005 as well as asymmetric conditions tariverdilo et al 2013 a study of the vibration of annular plates coupled to a compressible fluid domain has been presented by jeong 2006 the vibration of cylindrical askari and jeong 2010 thinh and nguyen 2016 paak et al 2014 alijani and amabili 2014 and conical rahmanian et al 2016 kerboua et al 2010 structures in contact with fluid has been studied considering shell kinematic assumptions using various simplifications it is possible to introduce viscosity in an analytical hydroelastic model as presented by phan et al 2013 atkinson et al atkinson and manrique de lara 2007 and kozlovsky 2009 a finite element approach using 2d plate elements has been developed by kerboua et al 2008 and bermudez et al 2001 the hydroelastic vibration of rectangular plates using the velocity potential and classical plate theory was presented by cheng and zhou cheung and zhou 2000 this approach has been extended in order to consider plate stiffeners cho et al 2015 fluid compressibility liao and ma 2016 plates in elastic foundations and with in plane loads hashemi et al 2010a 2010b shahbaztabar and ranji 2016 and geometric non linearity combined with sloshing effects khorshid and farhadi 2013 the frequency response of plates in contact with a fluid domain and subjected to excitation forces has been presented by cho et al seung cho et al 2015 most of the references about the hydroelastic vibration of plates consider the kirchhoff plate theory also known as the classical plate theory or the mindlin plate theory also known as the first order deformation theory due to simplicity and low computational cost however more accurate results can be obtained by using higher order shear deformation theories hsdts albeit at a higher computational cost the analysis of composite plates using an isogeometric analysis and hsdts is presented in refs thai et al 2013 2014 2016 while many different hsdts can be proposed and developed a compact formulation is preferable allowing the user to obtain a theory of arbitrary order according to the accuracy desired the carrera unified formulation cuf is a formulation that condenses classical and refined plate theories in a compact manner using index notation this formulation is capable of reaching an accuracy similar to that obtained via 3d analysis while retaining the computational efficiency of 1d and 2d models the formulation was presented by carrera 2003 and has been applied for thermal stress analysis of plates carrera 2002 2005 robaldo et al 2005 multifield problems carrera et al 2007 2008a 2009 robaldo et al 2006 analysis of structures with functionally graded materials carrera et al 2008b and shell geometries cinefra et al 2012 2013 the displacements are interpolated in the thickness direction with either simple polynomials or more complex functions as presented in refs carrera et al 2013 filippi et al 2016 the formulation is presented in detail in refs carrera et al 2011a 2011b 2014 in order to obtain approximations of the displacement variables the ritz method is popular due to the capability of considering arbitrary boundary conditions while having lower computational cost than a 2d finite element model the fundamentals of the ritz method is described in detail in refs leissa 2005 gander and wanner 2012 ilanko et al 2014 the accuracy of this method is highly dependent on the choice of shape functions used the dry modes of the structure are a common choice for the mode shapes although the addition of the fluid may change considerable the mode shapes kwon et al 2013 and consequently compromise the convergence characteristics of the method within the framework of cuf trigonometric shape functions have been used by fazzolari and carrera 2011 2013a 2013b 2014 for the analysis of simply supported plates shell geometries have also been considered in refs fazzolari 2016 fazzolari and banerjee 2014 fazzolari and carrera 2013c plates with arbitrary boundary conditions can be analyzed using polynomial shape functions as presented by dozio 2010 2011a 2011b 2013 vescovini and dozio 2016 and in the work by dozio and carrera 2011 while the compressibility of liquids is often neglected the error incurred due to this assumption may not be justified in all the cases some examples where the error between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is considerable in the vibration of isotropic plates in contact with a fluid domain have been presented in refs jeong and kim 2005 and liao and ma 2016 however a study of laminated plates coupled to a compressible fluid domain is currently not available in the literature nor is there assessment of the error due to fluid incompressibility assumptions recently the authors have used the compact formulation known as cuf to perform an accurate hydroelastic vibrational analysis of laminated plates considering incompressible fluid theory canales and mantari 2017 in the present work the model developed previously is extended in order to consider fluid compressibility the novelties of the present work are as follows the natural frequencies of a laminated composite plate coupled to a compressible fluid domain are presented for a variety of arrangements the error due to the fluid incompressibility assumption in the vibration of laminated plates coupled to a fluid domain is assessed considering various stacking sequences the accuracy of the formulation when compared with 3d solutions is demonstrated in the comparison study afterwards parametric studies are done in order to evaluate the influence of various geometric and material parameters 2 analytical modeling 2 1 preliminaries a rectangular plate with length a width b and thickness h is considered as shown in fig 1 the coordinates x y describe the motion of the plate it is assumed that the plate is in contact with a compressible inviscid and irrotational fluid bounded by a rectangular domain with length c width d and depth e as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system x y z is used to describe the fluid motion sloshing effects are neglected and only bulging modes are analyzed in the present study consequently a simplified free surface condition is sufficient the vertical walls and the bottom of the fluid domain are assumed to be rigid except for the region in contact with the top surface of the plate at z 0 or z h 2 the plate is assumed to be linearly elastic and the amplitude of motion is assumed to be small the energy functional is used to obtain the eigenvalue problem the structural model develops the plate potential energy u and kinetic energy t as in dozio and carrera dozio 2011b however within the nomenclature used in the present manuscript afterwards a hydrodynamic model for the compressible fluid domain is developed in order to obtain the fluid potential energy u w and kinetic energy t w and the coupled fluid structure problem is solved in the frequency domain in order to obtain the natural frequencies of the system for convenience the derivation of the structural model is given in non dimensional form the x y domain 0 x a 0 y b of the rectangular plate is mapped into a computational ξ η domain 1 ξ η 1 by using a transformation of coordinates given by 1 ξ 2 x a 1 η 2 y b 1 this transformation scales the coordinates with respect to the length and width of the plate but does not modify the orientation of the coordinate axes the derivatives in the two coordinate systems can be related by differentiating eq 1 using the chain rule and noting that ξ y η x 0 same axis orientation 2 x 2 a ξ y 2 b η a general displacement vector is introduced 3 u ξ η z t u ξ η z t v ξ η z t w ξ η z t t where u v and w are the displacement components in ξ η and z axes respectively and t is time the engineering stress and strain components are expressed in vector form as follows σ σ x x σ y y σ x y σ x z σ y z σ z z t 4 ε ε x x ε y y ε x y ε x z ε y z ε z z t the constitutive equation in the linear regime can be written as follows 5 σ c ε where c is a matrix of stiffness coefficients for an orthotropic material it is given by 6 c c 11 c 12 c 16 0 0 c 13 c 12 c 22 c 26 0 0 c 23 c 16 c 26 c 66 0 0 c 36 0 0 0 c 55 c 45 0 0

book on composite materials such as in reddy 2004 for convenience the stress and strain components are grouped as follows 7 σ p σ x x σ y y σ x y t ε p ε x x ε y y ε x y t σ n σ x z σ y z σ z z t ε n ε x z ε y z ε z z t considering small displacements the strain displacement relations are 8 ε p d p u ε n d n p d n z u where the linear differential operators d p d n p and d n z are given by 9 d p x

consider two dimensional displacement variables that vary across the plate thickness according to a certain function for example the mindlin or first order plate theory assumes that the plate longitudinal displacements vary linearly across the plate thickness resulting in the following displacement field 13 u u 0 z φ y v v 0 z φ x w w 0 where φ x and φ y are the rotations with respect to the x and y axis respectively many higher order plate theories can be proposed such as the following 14 u u 0 z u 1 z 2 u 2 v v 0 z v 1 z 2 v 2 w w 0 z w 1 z 2 w 2 within the framework of cuf the displacement field is expressed in a compact manner as follows 15 u ξ η z t f τ z u τ ξ η t τ 0 1 n where f τ are functions of the coordinate z on the thickness of the plate n stands for the number of terms used in the expansion u τ is the vector of the generalized displacements and the repeated subscript τ indicates summation a simple polynomial expansion is used to determine the functions f τ for example the displacement field of the second order n 2 expansion model can be expressed as 16 u f 0 u 0 f 1 u 1 f 2 u 2 u 0 z u 1 z 2 u 2 v f 0 v 0 f 1 v 1 f 2 v 2 v 0 z v 1 z 2 v 2 w f 0 w 0 f 1 w 1 f 2 w 2 w 0 z w 1 z 2 w 2 other choices for the functions f τ can be made filippi et al 2016 but they are not considered here reduced order plate theories such as that given by eq 11 can be obtained by using a suitable expansion order and eliminating certain displacement variables via elimination of rows and columns first order deformation theories exhibit a phenomena known as poisson locking which produces inaccurate results the poisson locking correction is used in the present paper for first order theories following carrera and brischetto 2008 the potential energy u of the plate in the computational domain can be written as follows 17 u 1 2 1 1 1 1 h 2 h 2 ε p t σ p ε n t σ n j d z d ξ d η where j stands for the jacobian of the coordinate transformation given by eq 1 substituting eqs 11 and 8 in eq 17 the potential energy is given by 18 u 1 2 1 1 1 1 h 2 h 2 d p u t c p p d p u c p n d n p u c p n d n z u d n p u t c n p d p u c n n d n p u c n n d n z u d n z u t c n p d p u c n n d n p u c n n d n z u j d z d ξ d η the kinetic energy t of the plate is given by the following expression 19 t 1 2 1 1 1 1 h 2 h 2 ρ u t t u t j d z d ξ d η where ρ is the mass density of the plate 2 3 hydrodynamic model the fluid is considered to be compressible inviscid and irrotational a simplified surface condition is considered appropriate since sloshing effects are neglected the velocity potential φ x y z t is used to describe the motion in the fluid domain ω in a compressible fluid the velocity potential must satisfy the acoustic wave equation kinsler et al 2000 20 2 φ 1 c 0 2 2 φ t 2 in ω where c 0 is the speed of sound in the fluid the boundary conditions in the fluid domain are given by a zero velocity normal to the rigid walls and the rigid bottom except for the plate surface and no surface waves on the top of the fluid domain it is assumed that the fluid particles are perfectly attached to the plate surface with no diffusion or cavitation 21 φ x 0 on x 0 c rigid

the hydrodynamic model to the structural model the amplitude w of the transverse plate displacement and the amplitude φ of the velocity potential are defined as follows 25 w ξ η z t w ξ η z exp j ω t 26 φ x y z t j ω φ x y z exp j ω t where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the natural frequency substituting eqs 25 and 26 in the acoustic wave equation 20 and in the boundary conditions 21 24 the new

the energy functional is given by 81 π u max t max q w max substituting eqs 62 64 and 68 in eq 81 and minimizing the functional with respect to the undetermined coefficients c τ i the following equation is obtained 82 k ω 2 m f c 0 where c is a vector of unknown coefficients c s j by solving eq 82 the fundamental frequencies and mode shapes of vibration can be obtained since the matrix f is a function of the wavenumber k and thus depends on the frequency ω a nonlinear eigenvalue problem must be solved the inverse iteration algorithm is used which is detailed in ref hamdaoui et al 2016 the initial eigenvalue and eigenvector are obtained by considering the incompressible fluid case i e setting k 0 when the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is high the algorithm must produce a larger eigenvalue modification with respect to the initial incompressible solution consequently large changes in the eigenvalues during each iteration are expected this can produce oscillatory divergence between two different vibration modes for example this behavior is observed when a fluid with a low sound velocity is considered a modified version of the algorithm was successful in obtaining the first three natural frequencies which is based in the following modifications setting a limit in the maximum change of the eigenvalue during each iteration using an under relaxation factor when oscillatory behavior is detected in order to reduce the change of the eigenvalue in each subsequent iteration in order to obtain the j vibrational mode it is required to perform a summation of the set of admissible functions evaluated at the point of interest times the term with indices τ i of the eigenvector x j for each of the generalized displacement variables afterwards the use of eq 15 is required in order to obtain the plate displacement amplitudes for the displacement in the z axis the vibrational mode is given by 83 m o d e j ξ η z τ 0 n i 1 m x w τ i j f τ z ψ w

described using a four letter symbolic notation letters s and c denote simply supported and clamped edges respectively the boundaries of the plate are numbered in a counterclockwise manner starting from x 0 the plate geometric center is assumed to be coincident with the geometric center of the bottom of the fluid domain in all the numerical results unless otherwise stated the fluid is considered as water with density ρ w 1000 k g m 3 and sound speed c 0 1490 m s table 1 presents the material properties of the three composite materials considered in the present work balanced and symmetric laminates are considered in the numerical examples 3 1 convergence study in the present sub section the stability of the results as the number of trigonometric terms p q and the polynomial degree of the ritz expansion p increases is analyzed a cccc 45 45 s mat1 square plate with a b c d e 1 m is considered table 2 presents the natural frequencies of the coupled system for various cuf expansions orders n as the polynomial degree p is increased considering p q 10 the convergence is slightly slower as higher expansion orders are used for the purposes of the present work a polynomial degree p 10 is considered sufficiently accurate with accuracy up to four significant digits and is used in the remainder of the manuscript a similar plate fluid system as the one used previously is considered in order to study the convergence as the number of trigonometric terms p q is increased previous studies have found that the appropriate choice of p q depends on the fluid domain size with respect to the plate cheung and zhou 2000 due to this various fluid domain width plate width ratios d b are considered table 3 presents the natural frequencies of the coupled system as the parameters p q are increased the optimal choice of p q is seen to be highly dependent on the ratio d b in the numerical examples given further below the number of trigonometric terms p q is set according to the last row presented for each value of d b in tables 3 and i e when a fluid domain with plate width ratio d b 1 is considered then the number of trigonometric terms used is p q 8 and so on 3 2 validation of the results in this sub section validation is performed by developing a numerical example and comparing results between the present theory and 3d finite element software ansys general purpose program is used to obtain the natural frequencies of a plate coupled to a compressible fluid domain the three dimensional model is built using 20 node 3d fluid elements fluid220 and 20 node 3d solid elements solid186 the geometrical parameters and fluid properties used are given in table 4 the fluid domain is divided into 48000 40 40 x 30 elements and the plate is segmented into 11200 20 28 x 20 elements as shown in fig 3 since a four layer composite plate will be considered in the numerical example 5 elements are used along the thickness of each layer the viscosity of the fluid is neglected the boundary conditions for the fluid domain are given in eqs 21 23 the fluid structure coupling is taken into account by activating the fluid structure interaction flag in the fluid elements adjacent to the solid elements in order to satisfy eq 24 table 5 presents the natural frequencies of a cscc 30 30 s mat1 plate in contact with a compressible fluid considering parameters given in table 4 the 3d finite element solution is compared to the present method considering various cuf expansion orders n results obtained using first order deformation theory fsdt also known as mindlin plate theory are also shown the average and maximum error are also given and these values are calculated using the fem 3d solution as a reference as the expansion order increases a closer agreement is observed accurate results are obtained using n 5 which validate the present method on the other hand significant discrepancies arise when using fsdt or low expansion orders fig 4 shows a comparison of the first three mode shapes obtained via ansys software and by the present method where good agreement is observed 3 3 influence of higher order kinematics in this sub section the necessity of using higher cuf expansion orders is evaluated table 6 presents the natural frequencies of a cccc 45 45 s mat1 square plate in contact with a compressible fluid considering a b c d e 1 m results within 1 of the reference solution are obtained with n 3 when a side to thickness ratio b h 20 is considered however as the plate becomes thicker higher order kinematics are required table 7 present the natural frequencies of a cccc 30 30 s square plate coupled to a fluid domain with a b c d e 1 m considering b h 20 and using materials mat2 and mat3 the first order deformation theory is closer in agreement to the reference solution when mat2 is used as compared to the other materials arguably the necessity of higher order kinematics is related to the orthotropicity ratio e 1 e 2 since mat2 has the lowest e 1 e 2 ratio among the materials analyzed while using an expansion order n 5 has been proven to give a very close agreement with the 3d solution it may lead to numerical instabilities when thin plates are analyzed due to this the expansion order n 3 is deemed appropriate and is used in the remainder of the manuscript 3 4 parametric studies in the present sub section the effect of various parameters in the natural frequencies of the coupled system is analyzed a plate fluid coupled system with a b c d e 1 m and b h 20 is considered as a baseline case the parameters will be varied one at a time in order to evaluate their influence the discrepancy between incompressible fluid theory ift and compressible fluid theory cft is defined as follows 84 discrepancy results from ift results from cft results from cft 100 the present model can reproduce an incompressible fluid as a special case when the speed of sound in the fluid is infinite considering c 0 inf in eq 20 85 2 φ 0 in ω eq 85 describes the velocity potential associated to an incompressible fluid as it is well known from fluid mechanics 3 4 1 effect of plate thickness ratio and material properties table 8 presents the first three natural frequencies of a cccc mat1 30 30 s plate in contact with a fluid domain for various plate side to thickness ratios b h and two plate materials considering b h 1 as a fixed parameter results considering an incompressible ift and compressible cft fluid are given as well as the discrepancy it is observed that as the plate becomes thinner the error rapidly diminishes and for plates with b h 50 the discrepancy of the fundamental frequency is below 1 on the other hand for a plate with b h 15 the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility can be as high as 13 in addition the discrepancy is dependent on the material properties since higher errors are observed when a mat3 plate is considered arguably the higher stiffness of the mat3 material leads to higher discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory fig 5 shows the discrepancy for the first natural frequency as a function of the ratio b h for the three composite materials analyzed in this work when stiffer materials are used higher discrepancies appear 3 4 2 effect of fluid domain depth fig 6 shows the first three natural frequencies of a cccc mat1 plate in contact with a fluid domain for various fluid domain depth plate width ratios and various laminate stacking sequences the following remarks can be made the lamination angle only has a small influence in ω 1 the fluid domain depth has significant effect on ω 1 the lamination angle has a large effect on ω 2 the fluid domain depth has only a slight influence on ω 2 up to e b 1 further increases of e b do not affect ω 2 the lamination angle has a considerable effect on ω 3 the extent of the influence of the fluid domain depth on ω 2 depends on the lamination angle while it is expected that larger fluid domain depths should result in reduced natural frequencies due to the added mass of the fluid this effect appears to be dependent on the mode shape of vibration fig 7 shows the first three mode shapes of vibration of the plate for e b 2 and for various lamination angles for the cases analyzed here the following comments arise the mode ω 1 is always doubly symmetric the mode ω 2 is always antisymmetric the symmetry of the mode ω 3 changes depending on the lamination angle it is doubly symmetric for laminations 0 and 15 15 s but changes to a antisymmetric mode for laminations 30 30 s and 45 45 s arguably the influence of the fluid domain depth on the natural frequencies depends on the symmetry or antisymmetry of the mode shape at least for the first few natural frequencies doubly symmetric modes are highly influenced by the fluid domain depth while antisymmetric modes are only slightly influenced by the ratio e b up to e b 1 fig 8 shows the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory for ω 1 and ω 3 considering various fluid domain depth plate width ratios e b and various lamination angles the discrepancy of ω 1 increases with the fluid domain depth for all the laminations considered on the other hand the extent of the influence of the fluid domain depth on the discrepancy of ω 3 is dependent on the lamination angle when a lamination which produces an antisymmetric mode ω 3 is considered such as 30 30 s and 45 45 s the fluid domain depth has minimal influence on the discrepancy of ω 3 3 4 3 effect of fluid domain length and width fig 9 shows the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and fluid domain plate width ratios d b with b 1 m and c d it is observed that as the fluid width and length increases the natural frequencies increase arguably by moving the lateral walls further away from the plate the fluid motion is less restricted which causes the increase in the frequency of vibration the lamination angle only has a slight influence on the natural frequency fig 10 shows the discrepancy for the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and fluid domain plate width ratios d b the discrepancy is reduced when wide fluid domains are considered and the lamination angle only has a small effect 3 4 4 effect of plate aspect ratio fig 11 shows the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and plate aspect ratios a b with b 1 m and a c as the plate length a increases in the x axis the natural frequencies decrease in addition by considering a lamination angle oriented along the short side of the plate y axis 90 the natural frequencies are higher this effect becomes more important as the plate aspect ratio a b increases fig 12 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and plate aspect ratios a b the discrepancy decreases when the aspect ratio increases moreover when a lamination angle along the short side of the plate 90 is used the discrepancy is higher 3 4 5 effect of plate boundary conditions fig 13 shows the first natural frequency of cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angle and various boundary conditions the natural frequencies decrease when simply supported plates are considered if mixed boundary conditions are used higher frequencies of vibration are obtained when the lamination angle is oriented normal to the side with rigid supports for example when a csss plate is considered the clamped support is located at x 0 and higher natural frequencies are obtained when the lamination angle is oriented along the x axis 0 fig 14 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angle and various boundary conditions the use of more rigid supports results in higher discrepancies in addition when the lamination angle is oriented along the normal of the rigid supports similar to the previous case 4 conclusions a solution for the free vibration analysis of laminated composite plates coupled with a compressible bounded fluid has been presented the influence of the compressibility and the lamination angles in the natural frequencies has been studied by performing parametric studies in addition the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory has been assessed for a variety of cases the following conclusions can be stated higher kinematics are necessary when thick plates made of composite materials with a high orthotropicity ratio e 1 e 2 are used the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility is higher when thick plates with stiff materials are used the influence of the fluid domain depth on the natural frequencies and the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory depends on the symmetric or antisymmetric nature of the mode shapes at least for the first few natural frequencies wider fluid domains results in higher natural frequencies and lower discrepancies between ift and cft increasing the plate aspect ratio a b or using less rigid supports results in lower natural frequencies and lower errors due to neglecting fluid compressibility higher natural frequencies can be obtained by using a lamination angle along the short side of a rectangular plate and normal to the rigid supports however this also increases the discrepancy between ift and cft

operator 1 introduction the dynamic response of structures in contact with fluid can be very different from the response in vacuum this is because the fluid adds inertia to the system reducing the natural frequencies of the system in order to avoid resonance phenomena an accurate analysis with hydrodynamic structural coupling is required many approaches have been used for this purpose varying from analytical to semi analytical methods as well as the finite element method while finite element models can deal with arbitrary geometries analytical methods are more appropriate for performing parametric studies and obtaining insight in the problem the vibration of structures coupled to a fluid domain has been studied considering various geometries and physical assumptions the hydroelastic vibration of circular plates has been analyzed considering an incompressible fluid domain jeong et al 2009 and a compressible fluid domain jeong and kim 2005 as well as asymmetric conditions tariverdilo et al 2013 a study of the vibration of annular plates coupled to a compressible fluid domain has been presented by jeong 2006 the vibration of cylindrical askari and jeong 2010 thinh and nguyen 2016 paak et al 2014 alijani and amabili 2014 and conical rahmanian et al 2016 kerboua et al 2010 structures in contact with fluid has been studied considering shell kinematic assumptions using various simplifications it is possible to introduce viscosity in an analytical hydroelastic model as presented by phan et al 2013 atkinson et al atkinson and manrique de lara 2007 and kozlovsky 2009 a finite element approach using 2d plate elements has been developed by kerboua et al 2008 and bermudez et al 2001 the hydroelastic vibration of rectangular plates using the velocity potential and classical plate theory was presented by cheng and zhou cheung and zhou 2000 this approach has been extended in order to consider plate stiffeners cho et al 2015 fluid compressibility liao and ma 2016 plates in elastic foundations and with in plane loads hashemi et al 2010a 2010b shahbaztabar and ranji 2016 and geometric non linearity combined with sloshing effects khorshid and farhadi 2013 the frequency response of plates in contact with a fluid domain and subjected to excitation forces has been presented by cho et al seung cho et al 2015 most of the references about the hydroelastic vibration of plates consider the kirchhoff plate theory also known as the classical plate theory or the mindlin plate theory also known as the first order deformation theory due to simplicity and low computational cost however more accurate results can be obtained by using higher order shear deformation theories hsdts albeit at a higher computational cost the analysis of composite plates using an isogeometric analysis and hsdts is presented in refs thai et al 2013 2014 2016 while many different hsdts can be proposed and developed a compact formulation is preferable allowing the user to obtain a theory of arbitrary order according to the accuracy desired the carrera unified formulation cuf is a formulation that condenses classical and refined plate theories in a compact manner using index notation this formulation is capable of reaching an accuracy similar to that obtained via 3d analysis while retaining the computational efficiency of 1d and 2d models the formulation was presented by carrera 2003 and has been applied for thermal stress analysis of plates carrera 2002 2005 robaldo et al 2005 multifield problems carrera et al 2007 2008a 2009 robaldo et al 2006 analysis of structures with functionally graded materials carrera et al 2008b and shell geometries cinefra et al 2012 2013 the displacements are interpolated in the thickness direction with either simple polynomials or more complex functions as presented in refs carrera et al 2013 filippi et al 2016 the formulation is presented in detail in refs carrera et al 2011a 2011b 2014 in order to obtain approximations of the displacement variables the ritz method is popular due to the capability of considering arbitrary boundary conditions while having lower computational cost than a 2d finite element model the fundamentals of the ritz method is described in detail in refs leissa 2005 gander and wanner 2012 ilanko et al 2014 the accuracy of this method is highly dependent on the choice of shape functions used the dry modes of the structure are a common choice for the mode shapes although the addition of the fluid may change considerable the mode shapes kwon et al 2013 and consequently compromise the convergence characteristics of the method within the framework of cuf trigonometric shape functions have been used by fazzolari and carrera 2011 2013a 2013b 2014 for the analysis of simply supported plates shell geometries have also been considered in refs fazzolari 2016 fazzolari and banerjee 2014 fazzolari and carrera 2013c plates with arbitrary boundary conditions can be analyzed using polynomial shape functions as presented by dozio 2010 2011a 2011b 2013 vescovini and dozio 2016 and in the work by dozio and carrera 2011 while the compressibility of liquids is often neglected the error incurred due to this assumption may not be justified in all the cases some examples where the error between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is considerable in the vibration of isotropic plates in contact with a fluid domain have been presented in refs jeong and kim 2005 and liao and ma 2016 however a study of laminated plates coupled to a compressible fluid domain is currently not available in the literature nor is there assessment of the error due to fluid incompressibility assumptions recently the authors have used the compact formulation known as cuf to perform an accurate hydroelastic vibrational analysis of laminated plates considering incompressible fluid theory canales and mantari 2017 in the present work the model developed previously is extended in order to consider fluid compressibility the novelties of the present work are as follows the natural frequencies of a laminated composite plate coupled to a compressible fluid domain are presented for a variety of arrangements the error due to the fluid incompressibility assumption in the vibration of laminated plates coupled to a fluid domain is assessed considering various stacking sequences the accuracy of the formulation when compared with 3d solutions is demonstrated in the comparison study afterwards parametric studies are done in order to evaluate the influence of various geometric and material parameters 2 analytical modeling 2 1 preliminaries a rectangular plate with length a width b and thickness h is considered as shown in fig 1 the coordinates x y describe the motion of the plate it is assumed that the plate is in contact with a compressible inviscid and irrotational fluid bounded by a rectangular domain with length c width d and depth e as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system x y z is used to describe the fluid motion sloshing effects are neglected and only bulging modes are analyzed in the present study consequently a simplified free surface condition is sufficient the vertical walls and the bottom of the fluid domain are assumed to be rigid except for the region in contact with the top surface of the plate at z 0 or z h 2 the plate is assumed to be linearly elastic and the amplitude of motion is assumed to be small the energy functional is used to obtain the eigenvalue problem the structural model develops the plate potential energy u and kinetic energy t as in dozio and carrera dozio 2011b however within the nomenclature used in the present manuscript afterwards a hydrodynamic model for the compressible fluid domain is developed in order to obtain the fluid potential energy u w and kinetic energy t w and the coupled fluid structure problem is solved in the frequency domain in order to obtain the natural frequencies of the system for convenience the derivation of the structural model is given in non dimensional form the x y domain 0 x a 0 y b of the rectangular plate is mapped into a computational ξ η domain 1 ξ η 1 by using a transformation of coordinates given by 1 ξ 2 x a 1 η 2 y b 1 this transformation scales the coordinates with respect to the length and width of the plate but does not modify the orientation of the coordinate axes the derivatives in the two coordinate systems can be related by differentiating eq 1 using the chain rule and noting that ξ y η x 0 same axis orientation 2 x 2 a ξ y 2 b η a general displacement vector is introduced 3 u ξ η z t u ξ η z t v ξ η z t w ξ η z t t where u v and w are the displacement components in ξ η and z axes respectively and t is time the engineering stress and strain

consider two dimensional displacement variables that vary across the plate thickness according to a certain function for example the mindlin or first order plate theory assumes that the plate longitudinal displacements vary linearly across the plate thickness resulting in the following displacement field 13 u u 0 z φ y v v 0 z φ x w w 0 where φ x and φ y are the rotations with respect to the x and y axis respectively many higher order plate theories can be proposed such as the following 14 u u 0 z u 1 z 2 u 2 v v 0 z v 1 z 2 v 2 w w 0 z w 1 z 2 w 2 within the framework of cuf the displacement field is expressed in a compact manner as follows 15 u ξ η z t f τ z u τ ξ η t τ 0 1 n where f τ are functions of the coordinate z on the thickness of the plate n stands for the number of terms used in the expansion u τ is the vector of the generalized displacements and the repeated subscript τ indicates summation a simple polynomial expansion is used to determine the functions f τ for example the displacement field of the second order n 2 expansion model can be expressed as 16 u f 0 u 0 f 1 u 1 f 2 u 2 u 0 z u 1 z 2 u 2 v f 0 v 0 f 1 v 1 f 2 v 2 v 0 z v 1 z 2 v 2 w f 0 w 0 f 1 w 1 f 2 w 2 w 0 z w 1 z 2 w 2 other choices for the functions f τ can be made filippi et al 2016 but they are not considered here reduced order plate theories such as that given by eq 11 can be obtained by using a suitable expansion order and eliminating certain displacement variables via elimination of rows and columns first order deformation theories exhibit a phenomena known as poisson locking which produces inaccurate results the poisson locking correction is used in the present paper for first order theories following carrera and brischetto 2008 the potential energy u of the plate in the computational domain can be written as follows 17 u 1 2 1 1 1 1 h 2 h 2 ε p t σ p ε n t σ n j d z d ξ d η where j stands for the jacobian of the coordinate transformation given by eq 1 substituting

equation is obtained 82 k ω 2 m f c 0 where c is a vector of unknown coefficients c s j by solving eq 82 the fundamental frequencies and mode shapes of vibration can be obtained since the matrix f is a function of the wavenumber k and thus depends on the frequency ω a nonlinear eigenvalue problem must be solved the inverse iteration algorithm is used which is detailed in ref hamdaoui et al 2016 the initial eigenvalue and eigenvector are obtained by considering the incompressible fluid case i e setting k 0 when the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is high the algorithm must produce a larger eigenvalue modification with respect to the initial incompressible solution consequently large changes in the eigenvalues during each iteration are expected this can produce oscillatory divergence between two different vibration modes for example this behavior is observed when a fluid with a low sound velocity is considered a modified version of the algorithm was successful in obtaining the first three natural frequencies which is based in the following modifications setting a limit in the maximum change of the eigenvalue during each iteration using an under relaxation factor when oscillatory behavior is detected in order to reduce the change of the eigenvalue in each subsequent iteration in order to obtain the j vibrational mode it is required to perform a summation of the set of admissible functions evaluated at the point of interest times the term with indices τ i of the eigenvector x j for each of the generalized displacement variables afterwards

laminates are considered in the numerical examples 3 1 convergence study in the present sub section the stability of the results as the number of trigonometric terms p q and the polynomial degree of the ritz expansion p increases is analyzed a cccc 45 45 s mat1 square plate with a b c d e 1 m is considered table 2 presents the natural frequencies of the coupled system for various cuf expansions orders n as the polynomial degree p is increased considering p q 10 the convergence is slightly slower as higher expansion orders are used for the purposes of the present work a polynomial degree p 10 is considered sufficiently accurate with accuracy up to four significant digits and is used in the remainder of the manuscript a similar plate fluid system as the one used previously is considered in order to study the convergence as the number of trigonometric terms p q is increased previous studies have found that the appropriate choice of p q depends on the fluid domain size with respect to the plate cheung and zhou 2000 due to this various fluid domain width plate width ratios d b are considered table 3 presents the natural frequencies of the coupled system as the parameters p q are increased the optimal choice of p q is seen to be highly dependent on the ratio d b in the numerical examples given further below the number of trigonometric terms p q is set according to the last row presented for each value of d b in tables 3 and i e when a fluid domain with plate width ratio d b 1 is considered then the number of trigonometric terms used is p q 8 and so on 3 2 validation of the results in this sub section validation is performed by developing a numerical example and comparing results between the present theory and 3d finite element software ansys general purpose program is used to obtain the natural frequencies of a plate coupled to a compressible fluid domain the three dimensional model is built using 20 node 3d fluid elements fluid220 and 20 node 3d solid elements solid186 the geometrical parameters and fluid properties used are given in table 4 the fluid domain is divided into 48000 40 40 x 30 elements and the plate is segmented into 11200 20 28 x 20 elements as shown in fig 3 since a four layer composite plate will be considered in the numerical example 5 elements are used along the thickness of each layer the viscosity of the fluid is neglected the boundary conditions for the fluid domain are given in eqs 21 23 the fluid structure coupling is taken into account by activating the fluid structure interaction flag in the fluid elements adjacent to the solid elements in order to satisfy eq 24 table 5 presents the natural frequencies of a cscc 30 30 s mat1 plate in contact with a compressible fluid considering parameters given in table 4 the 3d finite element solution is compared to the present method considering various cuf expansion orders n results obtained using first order deformation theory fsdt also known as mindlin plate theory are also shown the average and maximum error are also given and these values are calculated using the fem 3d solution as a reference as the expansion order increases a closer agreement is observed accurate results are obtained using n 5 which validate the present method on the other hand significant discrepancies arise when using fsdt or low expansion orders fig 4 shows a comparison of the first three mode shapes obtained via ansys software and by the present method where good agreement is observed 3 3 influence of higher order kinematics in this sub section the necessity of using higher cuf expansion orders is evaluated table 6 presents the natural frequencies of a cccc 45 45 s mat1 square plate in contact with a compressible fluid considering a b c d e 1 m results within 1 of the reference solution are obtained with n 3 when a side to thickness ratio b h 20 is considered however as the plate becomes thicker higher order kinematics are required table 7 present the natural frequencies of a cccc 30 30 s square plate coupled to a fluid domain with a b c d e 1 m considering b h 20 and using materials mat2 and mat3 the first order deformation theory is closer in agreement to the reference solution when mat2 is used as compared to the other materials arguably the necessity of higher order kinematics is related to the orthotropicity ratio e 1 e 2 since mat2 has the lowest e 1 e 2 ratio among the materials analyzed while using an expansion order n 5 has been proven to give a very close agreement with the 3d solution it may lead to numerical instabilities when thin plates are analyzed due to this the expansion order n 3 is deemed appropriate and is used in the remainder of the manuscript 3 4 parametric studies in the present sub section the effect of various parameters in the natural frequencies of the coupled system is analyzed a plate fluid coupled system with a b c d e 1 m and b h 20 is considered as a baseline case the parameters will be varied one at a time in order to evaluate their influence the discrepancy between incompressible fluid theory ift and compressible fluid theory cft is defined as follows 84 discrepancy results from ift results from cft results from cft 100 the present model can reproduce an incompressible fluid as a special case when the speed of sound in the fluid is infinite considering c 0 inf in eq 20 85 2 φ

presents the first three natural frequencies of a cccc mat1 30 30 s plate in contact with a fluid domain for various plate side to thickness ratios b h and two plate materials considering b h 1 as a fixed parameter results considering an incompressible ift and compressible cft fluid are given as well as the discrepancy it is observed that as the plate becomes thinner the error rapidly diminishes and for plates with b h 50 the discrepancy of the fundamental frequency is below 1 on the other hand for a plate with b h 15 the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility can be as high as 13 in addition the discrepancy is dependent on the material properties since higher errors are observed when a mat3 plate is considered arguably the higher stiffness of the mat3 material leads to higher discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory fig 5 shows the discrepancy for the first natural frequency as a function of the ratio b h for the three composite materials analyzed in this work when stiffer materials are used higher discrepancies appear 3 4 2 effect of fluid domain depth fig 6 shows the first three natural frequencies of a cccc mat1 plate in contact with a fluid domain for various fluid domain depth plate width ratios and various laminate stacking sequences the following remarks can be made the lamination angle only has a small influence in ω 1 the fluid domain depth has significant effect on ω 1 the lamination angle has a large effect on ω 2 the fluid domain depth has only a slight influence on ω 2 up to e b 1 further increases of e b do not affect ω 2 the lamination angle has a considerable effect on ω 3 the extent of the influence of the fluid domain depth on ω 2 depends on the lamination angle while it is expected that larger fluid domain depths should result in reduced natural frequencies due to the added mass of the fluid this effect appears to be dependent on the mode shape of vibration fig 7 shows the first three mode shapes of vibration of the plate for e b 2 and for various lamination angles for the cases analyzed here the following comments arise the mode ω 1 is always doubly symmetric the mode ω 2 is always antisymmetric the symmetry of the mode ω 3 changes depending on the lamination angle it is doubly symmetric for laminations 0 and 15 15 s but changes to a antisymmetric mode for laminations 30 30 s and 45 45 s arguably the influence of the fluid domain depth on the natural frequencies depends on the symmetry or antisymmetry of the mode shape at least for the first few natural frequencies doubly symmetric modes are highly influenced by the fluid domain depth while antisymmetric modes are only slightly influenced by the ratio e b up to e b 1 fig 8 shows the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory for ω 1 and ω 3 considering various fluid domain depth plate width ratios e b and various lamination angles the discrepancy of ω 1 increases with the fluid domain depth for all the laminations considered on the other hand the extent of the influence of the fluid domain depth on the discrepancy of ω 3 is dependent on the lamination angle when a lamination which produces an antisymmetric mode ω 3 is considered such as 30 30 s and 45 45 s the fluid domain depth has minimal influence on the discrepancy of ω 3 3 4 3 effect of fluid domain length and width fig 9 shows the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and fluid domain plate width ratios d b with b 1 m and c d it is observed that as the fluid width and length increases the natural frequencies increase arguably by moving the lateral walls further away from the plate the fluid motion is less restricted which causes the increase in the frequency of vibration the lamination angle only has a slight influence on the natural frequency fig 10 shows the discrepancy for the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and fluid domain plate width ratios d b the discrepancy is reduced when wide fluid domains are considered and the lamination angle only has a small effect 3 4 4 effect of plate aspect ratio fig 11 shows the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and plate aspect ratios a b with b 1 m and a c as the plate length a increases in the x axis the natural frequencies decrease in addition by considering a lamination angle oriented along the short side of the plate y axis 90 the natural frequencies are higher this effect becomes more important as the plate aspect ratio a b increases fig 12 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angles and plate aspect ratios a b the discrepancy decreases when the aspect ratio increases moreover when a lamination angle along the short side of the plate 90 is used the discrepancy is higher 3 4 5 effect of plate boundary conditions fig 13 shows the first natural frequency of cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angle and various boundary conditions the natural frequencies decrease when simply supported plates are considered if mixed boundary conditions are used higher frequencies of vibration are obtained when the lamination angle is oriented normal to the side with rigid supports for example when a csss plate is considered the clamped support is located at x 0 and higher natural frequencies are obtained when the lamination angle is oriented along the x axis 0 fig 14 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of cccc mat3 plate considering various lamination angle and various boundary conditions the use of more rigid supports results in higher discrepancies in addition when the lamination angle is oriented along the normal of the rigid supports similar to the previous case 4 conclusions a solution for the free vibration analysis of laminated composite plates coupled with a compressible bounded fluid has been presented the influence of the compressibility and the lamination angles in the natural frequencies has been studied by performing parametric studies in addition the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory has been assessed for a variety of cases the following conclusions can be stated higher kinematics are necessary when thick plates made of composite materials with a high orthotropicity ratio e 1 e 2 are used the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility is higher when thick plates with stiff materials are used the influence of the fluid domain depth on the natural frequencies and the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory depends on the symmetric or antisymmetric nature of the mode shapes at least for the first few natural frequencies wider fluid domains results in higher natural frequencies and lower discrepancies between ift and cft increasing the plate aspect ratio a b or using less rigid supports results in lower natural frequencies and lower errors due to neglecting fluid compressibility higher natural frequencies can be obtained by using a lamination angle along the short side of a rectangular plate and normal to the rigid supports however this also increases the discrepancy between ift and cft 
23098,this study uses laboratory experiments and a large eddy simulation les model to investigate the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles the kinematic motion of the water surface was solved by the volume of fluid vof method the simulation results were verified by the measured wave heights in a water tank installed on a shaking table the numerical model was employed to systematically determine the effects of the spacing and height of the baffles on the sloshing phenomenon the simulation results indicate that the natural frequency of the tank was altered by the multiple baffles and was related to the effective water depth above the baffles the diminishing effect of multiple baffles on the hydrodynamic force is better than that of a single baffle in addition the sloshing force on the sidewalls of the tank can be characterized by the excitation amplitude frequency and water depth while the sloshing height and hydrodynamic force decrease

excitation caused by earthquakes and hurricanes fujino et al 1992 the dynamic pressure on the sidewalls of storage tanks generated by the sloshing could damage the tanks and or reduce the building vibration the amplitude of the sloshing wave and dynamic pressure are dependent upon the tank geometry liquid depth amplitude and frequency of the external excitation lamb 1932 the classic sloshing problem is sloshing in a rectangular water tank without baffles the wave frequency and velocity field under the assumption of incompressible and inviscid flow could be predicted by the potential flow theory for example fujino et al 1992 used shaking table experiments to study the vibration of a single degree of freedom structure with an attached tuned liquid damper tld based on the shallow water wave theory they developed a nonlinear model to describe the liquid motion inside a rectangular water tank and semi analytically included the damping effect of the liquid motion using their model the response of a structure with tld subjected to the harmonic external force can be predicted pal et al 2003 used a finite element numerical model to simulate the sloshing problem without baffle their numerical scheme was developed on the basis of a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach with the velocity potential as the unknown nodal variable in the fluid domain and the displacements as the unknowns in the structure domain wu et al 2013 proposed a three dimensional finite difference model to study the oblique sloshing in a square water tank without baffle under oblique horizontal excitation they tested different computational meshes and time steps and validated their simulation results via experimental measurements they also investigated the dynamic pressure on the tank walls and found that the dynamic pressure was dominated by the added mass effect when the excitation frequency was much larger than the natural frequency in order to mitigate the sloshing induced forces on storage tanks baffles have been installed in the storage tanks to damp out the sloshing liu and lin 2009 celebi and akyildiz 2002 experimentally investigated the nonlinear sloshing inside a partially filled rectangular tank with one vertical baffle their results revealed that the baffle produced a shear layer and dissipated energy by the viscous term they concluded that in an increased water depth the rolling amplitude and frequency of the tank with or without baffle configurations directly affect the degree of nonlinearity of the sloshing phenomena panigrahy et al 2009 used shaking table experiments to investigate the mitigating effects of different kinds of baffles on sloshing in a square water tank they found that the ring baffles on the tank walls were more effective than horizontal baffles due to the ring baffles absorbing and dissipating energy in all directions rather than being concentrated in particular directions liu and lin 2009 summarized the previous studies on the effect of baffles on sloshing and adopted a large eddy simulation les model to simulate the three dimensional sloshing in a rectangular tank with baffle they found that the vertical baffle is more effective than the horizontal baffle in reducing the sloshing and pressure on the wall akyildiz 2012 used a finite difference numerical model to study the liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with one vertical baffle at the tank bottom they adopted a moving coordinate system to solve the navier stokes equations but ignored the wave breaking and turbulence in the tank they validated their simulation results by the laboratory experiments of akyildiz and ünal 2005 and demonstrated that both the maximum wave height and dynamic pressure decreased as the baffle height increased wu et al 2012 used a time independent finite difference scheme with fictitious cell technique to study sloshing in water tanks with bottom mounted baffles and surface piercing baffles they analyzed the response frequency of the baffled tank and found that the asymptotic formula is inadequate to predict the effect of baffles on the fundamental frequency when the baffle height is large jung et al 2012 applied the standard k ε turbulence model and the volume of fluid vof method to simulate the liquid sloshing in a rectangular water tank with one vertical baffle in the middle of the tank their results demonstrated that the vortices generated by the flow separation from the baffle tip became weaker as the baffle height increased nevertheless their simulation result over estimated the peak pressure on the side wall of the tank as compared to the experimental result of kang and lee 2005 xue et al 2012 and xue et al 2017 used numerical model and laboratory experiments to study the liquid sloshing in a square tank with different types of baffles the compared the effects of vertical horizontal and perforated baffles on the sloshing their simulation results revealed that the baffles could change the natural frequency of the tank and reduce the amplitude of sloshing and the maximum dynamic pressure occurred near the free surface zhang et al 2014 and chen et al 2017 compared the simulation results of sloshing flows computed by a meshless moving particle semi implicit mps method and a grid based level set method they considered two violent sloshing cases and the simulation results demonstrated that both methods can be used to simulate the sloshing flows nevertheless the mps method has better accuracy than the level set method in capturing the second pressure peak as well as the splashing cao et al 2014 used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model to simulate the liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with one baffle the above studies whether by laboratory experiments and or by numerical models did not examine the influence of baffle spacing or number on the mitigating effect of multiple baffles nor did they provide a quantitative method to estimate the sloshing induced hydrodynamic forces on the sidewalls such information is needed for the design of baffles in storage tanks and the tuned liquid dampers in high rise buildings this study combined a large eddy simulation les model and the volume of fluid vof method to simulate the sloshing in a rectangular tank with vertical baffles on the tank bottom a series of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the effects of baffle spacing and height on the sloshing induced hydrodynamic forces of the tank walls 2 numerical model this study employed an in

meneveau 1997 for wake flows in addition the projection method delong 1997 was employed to solve the poisson pressure equation ppe and to decouple the velocity and pressure in the navier stokes equations the kinematic motion of the water surface was explicated by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 the volume fraction f m occupied by the water in a cell was described by 7 f m t u i f m x i 0 the value of f m 1 indicates that the cell is full of water f m 0 when the cell is full of air and 0 f m 1 when the cell contains the air water interface the computational domain was discretized by the finite volume method fvm the solid baffles in the computational domain were treated by the method of partial cell treatment pct liu et al 2005 the pct is used when a cell is

sloshing experiments were carried out in a rectangular water tank with the internal dimension length l 500 mm width w 300 mm and height h 400 mm the liquid inside the tank was pure water and the initial water depth was h w 80 mm the water tank was installed on a shaking table driven by a hydraulic actuator a capacitance type wave gauge net 030 nijin co with a resolution of 0 03 mm see fig 1 was used to measure the wave height in the tank the measured signal was processed by an amplifier net 406 nijin co and transmitted to a data logger 34970 a agilent inc the sampling frequency was 100 hz and the sampling duration of each experiment was 90 s the wave gauge was installed on the central line y 0 of the tank and at a distance 60 mm to one sidewall of the tank the excitation direction was along the length x direction of the tank the amplitude of excitation was fixed at a e 15 mm and the excitation frequency was set as f e 0 50 1 30 hz before starting each experiment the water tank was placed stationary for about 5 min to let the water waves calm down the fundamental natural frequency f n of sloshing can be predicted by the following equation lamb 1932 11 f n 1 2 π π g l tanh π h w l in this study the length of the tank l 500 mm and water depth h w 80 mm therefore the natural frequency was f n 0 85 hz the first part of the experiment was to study the sloshing in the tank without baffles and the second part of the experiment was to investigate the sloshing with five vertical baffles number of baffle n b 5 mounted at the tank bottom the width of the baffles was 300 mm same width as the water tank the height h b 40 mm the thickness t b 5 mm and the spacing between two adjacent baffles was s 80 mm the water depth excitation amplitude and frequency were the same as the case of without baffle fig 2 a compares the measured maximum wave heights in the tank without and with five baffles under different excitation frequencies the wave heights were normalized by the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and the excitation frequencies were normalized by the natural frequency f n 0 85 hz when the excitation frequency f e f n 0 59 the maximum wave heights in the tank with and without baffles were almost the same however in the absence of the baffle and the excitation frequency f e f n 1 06 the wave amplitude grew with time and water was splashing out of the tank without top when t 15 s the average water depth in the tank changed with time and the sloshing became an unsteady phenomenon when the excitation frequency was close to the first mode natural frequency f n 0 85 hz of the tank with five baffles in the tank the wave amplitudes were drastically diminished especially when the excitation frequency was close to the natural frequency the spectral density function of measured surface displacement under the excitation frequency f e 1 10 hz and n b 0 analyzed by the fast fourier transform fft was shown in fig 2 b as can be seen the first mode frequency occurred at 1 123 hz and the second mode occurred at 2 246 hz twice of the first mode frequency fig 2 c shows the first mode response frequencies of the water tank without and with five baffles it demonstrates that the dominant response frequency in the tank equals to the excitation frequency regardless of the baffles 4 model validation in order to validate the present les model the simulation results for the cases without and with baffles were compared with the measured wave heights for the validation cases the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 10 hz and water depth h w 80 mm the reynolds number was calculated as 12 re 2 π f e a e h w ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the water and the reynolds number re 8300 fig 3 shows the computational domain length 0 5 m width 0 3 m and height 0 2 m and the grid arrangement the computational domain was divided into three zones and the water surface was in zone ii which adopted a uniform grid with the smallest grid size δx 2 5 mm δy 10 mm and δz 2 0 mm zones i and iii employed non uniform grids with the stretching ratio 1 03 and 1 05 respectively the courant number was set as cr 0 85 and the average time step was δt 0 0036 s the grid sensitivity was checked by comparing the simulation results of five computational different grids see table 1 the difference δ between the measured wave height ηm and predicted wave height ηp was calculated as 13 δ η m η p η p 100 the maximum ηmax and average wave height η at a distance 60 mm to the sidewall were computed from the simulation results between 40 and 60 s for the case without baffle the simulation results of grid 4 50 30 80 with the error δ 1 1 and 3 9 for the maximum ηmax and average wave height η respectively therefore grid 4 was used to simulate the flow condition without baffle in order to obtain a sufficient precision and to save computational time for the validation case with baffles the flow parameters were water depth h w 80 mm baffle height h b 40 mm baffle number n b 5 excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and frequency f e 1 10 hz fig 4 a and b compare the measured and simulated surface displacements of different computational grids for the cases without and with five baffles respectively the surface displacements shown in fig 4 are the results after the surface waves became stationary t 30 s the good agreement between the measured and simulated surface waves demonstrates that the present les model and vof method are capable of simulating the sloshing phenomenon inside the water tank table 2 summarizes the differences between the measured and predicted wave height the simulation result of grid 4 90 30 80 has the smallest error δ 2 9 and 4 0 for the maximum ηmax and average wave height η respectively thus grid 4 was used to simulate the flow conditions with baffles in the tank 5 results and discussion this study used the validated les model to investigate the influences of baffle height and spacing on the sloshing phenomenon the simulation results revealed that the average and maximum wave heights were very close therefore only the results of maximum wave height were discussed 5 1 baffle number this section discusses the influence of baffle number on the sloshing frequency and amplitude the water depth h w 80 mm baffle height h b 40 mm excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and frequency f e 1 30 hz 1 53f n were all fixed the numerical model was used to simulate the sloshing with several different baffle numbers n b 1 3 5 7 and 9 since the length of the water tank was fixed l 0 50 m the spacing between two adjacent baffles s decreased as the number of the baffles n b increased figs 5 7 show the simulated velocity vectors on the central plane y w 0 50 of the tank without baffle with one baffle n b 1 spacing s l 0 5 and five baffles n b 5 s l 0 16 respectively at four different phases of one cycle the period t 0 77 s and the reference time to 44 8 s the interaction between the baffle and the vortices became more complicated as the number of baffle increased during the first half period t to t 4 and to t 2 the water was moving from left to right the water moved in the opposite direction in the second half of the period t to 3t 4 and to t note that in figs 6 and 7 vortices were generated by the flow separation at the baffle tip furthermore the wave height and wave induced velocity for the case of one baffle n b 1 was larger than that of n b 0 besides with only one baffle in the tank there was wave breaking at phases t to t 4 and t to 3t 4 when the baffle number n b 5 fig 7 the wave amplitude and velocity in the tank became moderate as compared to that of n b 0 and 1 the vortices originated by the baffle tip became weaker with increasing baffle number n b fig 8 compares the simulated horizontal velocities at location x l 0 5 y w 0 5 for baffle number n b 1 9 the excitation frequency f e 1 30 hz amplitude a e 15 mm and the baffle height h b h w 0 50 the horizontal velocity was positive when t to t 4 and to t 2 and velocity became negative when t to 3t 4 and to t without the baffle n b 0 in the tank the velocity profile was close to a uniform distribution the velocity distribution became non uniform when there were baffles the large velocity gradient near the baffle tip was the source of the vortex also note that the maximum horizontal velocity occurred at n b 1 and the magnitude of the velocity decreased as the number of baffle n b increased fig 9 shows the relationship between the maximum wave height ηmax and baffle number for the baffle height h b h w 0 50 the measured wave heights of n b 0 and 5 were also plotted in the figure for comparison the good agreement of simulated and measured wave heights again demonstrates the capability of the present les model to simulate the sloshing phenomenon as expected the wave height decreased as the baffle number increased and the wave height of nine baffles n b 9 was about half of the wave height without baffle n b 0 note that the thickness of the baffles is 5 mm and the total length of the tank is 500 mm therefore the effective tank length was l 475 mm when there were five baffles in the tank and the change of the tank length was 5 this will change the natural frequency from 0 85 hz to 0 89 hz about 4 5 the influence of effective length increased as the number of baffles n b increased nevertheless the mitigating effect of baffles on the sloshing is more significant than the influence of effective length the influence of the multiple baffles on the natural frequency of the water tank is discussed in section 5 3 5 2 baffle height in order to investigate the effect of baffle height on the sloshing phenomenon the flow fields of several different baffle heights h b 20 mm 40 mm 60 mm and 70 mm relative baffle height h b h w 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 0 875 respectively were simulated by the present les model the number of baffle n b 5 water depth h w 80 mm excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and frequency f e 1 30 hz 1 53f n were fixed fig 10 shows the relationship between the maximum wave heights ηmax and the relative baffle height h b h w for baffle number n b 5 the baffle height h b 0 represents that the water tank had no baffle it reveals that the wave height decreased as the baffle height increased this finding is similar to the simulation results of akyildiz 2012 and jung et al 2012 nonetheless the wave heights were almost the same when the baffle height h b h w 0 75 and 0 875 in other words the effect of baffle height lessened when the relative height h b h w 0 75 when the relative height h b h w 0 75 the maximum wave height was about 50 of the wave height without baffle h b 0 5 3 excitation frequency this section examines the effect of excitation frequency f e on the wave height the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm water depth hw 80 mm baffle height h b h w 0 50 and baffle number n b 5 the excitation frequency f e was in the range of 0 50 hz 1 5 hz fig 11 displays the simulated and measured maximum wave heights of different frequencies f e the largest wave height occurred when the excitation frequency was 0 70 hz compared to the largest wave height occurred at 0 90 hz for the tank without baffle see fig 2 this indicates that the natural frequency of the tank is altered by the baffles this can be explained by the fact that the water between two adjacent baffles merely moved between the baffles while the water above the baffle could move freely from one side of the tank to another side the effective water depth can be calculated as h w h b 40 mm by substituting this effective water depth and the length of the tank l 500 mm into eq 11 one can get the new natural frequency f n 0 65 hz this value is close to the frequency f e 0 70 hz that has the largest observed wave height in other words the natural frequency of baffled tank can be tuned by changing the effective water depth in the tank 5 4 hydrodynamic force the sloshing forces acting on the sidewalls of the tanks during earthquakes are essential for the design of storage tanks and tuned liquid dampers however the previous studies did not provide a quantitative method to estimate the sloshing induced hydrodynamic forces based on the simulation results the dynamic pressures pd z p ps z of the sidewalls normal to the motion of the tank were calculated where ps z ρg h z is the hydrostatic pressure in the water h is the water depth ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water and g is the gravitational accelertaion fig 12 shows the distribution of dynamic pressure on the sidewall of the tank x 0 y w 0 5 for baffle numbers n b 0 1 3 and 5 with the baffle height h b h w 0 50 the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 30 hz and water depth h w 80 mm when time t to 3t 4 and t to t the dynamic pressure with one baffle n b 1 is larger than that of without baffle n b 0 especially near the water surface as the baffle number increased the dynamic pressure on the sidewall substantially decreased when n b 3 the hydrodynamic force on the sidewall x 0 is calculated as 14 f i 1 n p i δ z i w where p i is the dynamic pressure at the ith grid point on the sidewall δz i is the grid size of the ith grid and w 0 3 m is the width of the tank since the hydrodynamic pressure is proportional to the amplitude of the excitation acceleration a e 2 π f e 2 the dimensionless force coefficient is defined as 15 c f f 0 5 ρ a e 2 π f e 2 h w w h w where h w is the average water depth and w is the width of the water tank fig 13 shows the time variation of force coefficients on the sidewall of the tank x 0 under different numbers of baffle the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 30 hz h w 80 mm and h b h w 0 50 as can be seen the maximum force coefficient c f of one baffle n b 1 is slightly larger than that of no baffle n b 0 in other words the diminishing effect of single baffle on the sloshing force is not very effective when n b 1 the force coefficient decreased as the number of n b increased fig 14 depicts the relationship between the maximum force coefficient c f and baffle number n b the maximum force coefficient c f is about 104 70 60 56 and 46 for n b 1 3 5 7 and 9 respectively compared with the no baffle case n b 0 the maximum force coefficients on the sidewall x 0 for different baffle heights h b h w are shown in fig 15 the amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 30 hz h w 80 mm and n b 5 as expected the force coefficient decreased as the baffle height h b increased nevertheless the effect of baffle height lessened when the relative height h b h w 0 75 when the relative height h b h w 0 75 and baffle number n b 5 the maximum force coefficient is about 55 of that without baffle n b 0 fig 16 shows the relationship between the maximum force coefficient and the excitation frequency the baffle height h b h w 0 50 and baffle number n b 5 it demonstrates that the largest force coefficient occurred when the excitation frequency f e 0 70 hz which is close to the new natural frequency 0 65 hz with the effective water depth h w h b 40 mm the force coefficients of other excitation frequencies are much smaller than that of the frequency f e 0 70 hz the dimensionless force coefficients shown in figs 14 16 can be utilized for the optimal design in terms of the height and number of the baffles of the tuned liquid dampers in high rise buildings 6 conclusions this study used a large eddy simulation model and volume of fluid vof method to investigate liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with multiple vertical baffles mounted on the tank bottom the simulated wave heights were validated by the results of shaking table experiments then the numerical model was used to study the influences of the excitation frequency baffle number and height on the sloshing force of the tank walls the simulation results can be summarized into following points 1 the baffles have pronounced mitigating effect on the sloshing phenomenon when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the tank the first mode response frequency was very close to the excitation frequency regardless of the baffles 2 the natural frequency of the tank with multiple vertical baffles is related to the effective water depth total water depth h w subtracting the baffle height h b in other words the natural frequency of baffled tank can be tuned by varying the effective water depth in the tank 3 when the relative baffle height h b h w 0 50 the maximum sloshing force on the sidewalls of the tank with single baffle n b 1 is slightly larger than that of without baffle n b 0 case when n b 3 the wave height and sloshing force decrease as the baffle number increases namely the mitigating effect of multiple baffles is better than that of one baffle 4 the wave height and the sloshing force decrease as the baffle height increases but the effect of baffle height is lessened when the relative height h b h w 0 75 when the relative height h b h w 0 75 and baffle number n b 5 the hydrodynamic force is about 55 of that without the baffle 5 the sloshing force on the sidewalls of the tank can be described by the excitation frequency amplitude and the average water depth the dimensionless force coefficient can be used for the design of the tuned liquid dampers tld in high rise buildings acknowledgment this

23098,this study uses laboratory experiments and a large eddy simulation les model to investigate the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles the kinematic motion of the water surface was solved by the volume of fluid vof method the simulation results were verified by the measured wave heights in a water tank installed on a shaking table the numerical model was employed to systematically determine the effects of the spacing and height of the baffles on the sloshing phenomenon the simulation results indicate that the natural frequency of the tank was altered by the multiple baffles and was related to the effective water depth above the baffles the diminishing effect of multiple baffles on the hydrodynamic force is better than that of a single baffle in addition the sloshing force on the sidewalls of the tank can be characterized by the excitation amplitude frequency and water depth while the sloshing height and hydrodynamic force decrease as the baffle number or baffle height increase the effect of baffles on the sloshing lessens when the relative baffle height h b h w 0 75 keywords sloshing baffle tuned liquid damper large eddy simulation volume of fluid 1 introduction the liquid sloshing in moving tanks is of great practical importance to the design of storage tanks oil tankers and liquid fuel in spacecraft graham and rodriquez 1952 armenio and la rocca 1996 ibrahim 2005 in addition the water storage tanks on the roofs of high rise buildings could be used as tuned liquid dampers tld to mitigate the external excitation caused by earthquakes and hurricanes fujino et al 1992 the dynamic pressure on the sidewalls of storage tanks generated by the sloshing could damage the tanks and or reduce the building vibration the amplitude of the sloshing wave and dynamic pressure are dependent upon the tank geometry liquid depth amplitude and frequency of the external excitation lamb 1932 the classic sloshing problem is sloshing in a rectangular water tank without baffles the wave frequency and velocity field under the assumption of incompressible and inviscid flow could be predicted by the potential flow theory for example fujino et al 1992 used shaking table experiments to study the vibration of a single degree of freedom structure with an attached tuned liquid damper tld based on the shallow water wave theory they developed a nonlinear model to describe the liquid motion inside a rectangular water tank and semi analytically included the damping effect of the liquid motion using their model the response of a structure with tld subjected to the harmonic external force can be predicted pal et al 2003 used a finite element numerical model to simulate the sloshing problem without baffle their numerical scheme was developed on the basis of a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach with the velocity potential as the unknown nodal variable in the fluid domain and the displacements as the unknowns in the structure domain wu et al 2013 proposed a three dimensional finite difference model to study the oblique sloshing in a square water tank without baffle under oblique horizontal excitation they tested different computational meshes and time steps and validated their simulation results via experimental measurements they also investigated the dynamic pressure on the tank walls and found that the dynamic pressure was dominated by the added mass effect when the excitation frequency was much larger than the natural frequency in order to mitigate the sloshing induced forces on storage tanks baffles have been installed in the storage tanks to damp out the sloshing liu and lin 2009 celebi and akyildiz 2002 experimentally investigated the nonlinear sloshing inside a partially filled rectangular tank with one vertical baffle their results revealed that the baffle produced a shear layer and dissipated energy by the viscous term they concluded that in an increased water depth the rolling amplitude and frequency of the tank with or without baffle configurations directly affect the degree of nonlinearity of the sloshing phenomena panigrahy et al 2009 used shaking table experiments to investigate the mitigating effects of different kinds of baffles on sloshing in a square water tank they found that the ring baffles on the tank walls were more effective than horizontal baffles due to the ring baffles absorbing and dissipating energy in all directions rather than being concentrated in particular directions liu and lin 2009 summarized the previous studies on the effect of baffles on sloshing and adopted a large eddy simulation les model to simulate the three dimensional sloshing in a rectangular tank with baffle they found that the vertical baffle is more effective than the horizontal baffle in reducing the sloshing and pressure on the wall akyildiz 2012 used a finite difference numerical model to study the liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with one vertical baffle at the tank bottom they adopted a moving coordinate system to solve the navier stokes equations but ignored the wave breaking and turbulence in the tank they validated their simulation results by the laboratory experiments of akyildiz and ünal 2005 and demonstrated that both the maximum wave height and dynamic pressure decreased as the baffle height increased wu et al 2012 used a time independent finite difference scheme with fictitious cell technique to study sloshing in water tanks with bottom mounted baffles and surface piercing baffles they analyzed the response frequency of the baffled tank and found that the asymptotic formula is inadequate to predict the effect of baffles on the fundamental frequency when the baffle height is large jung et al 2012 applied the standard k ε turbulence model and the volume of fluid vof method to simulate the liquid sloshing in a rectangular water tank with one vertical baffle in the middle of the tank their results demonstrated that the vortices generated by the flow separation from the baffle tip became weaker as the baffle height increased nevertheless their simulation result over estimated the peak pressure on the side wall of the tank as compared to the experimental result of kang and lee 2005 xue et al 2012 and xue et al 2017 used numerical model and laboratory experiments to study the liquid sloshing in a square tank with different types of baffles the compared the effects of vertical horizontal and perforated baffles on the sloshing their simulation results revealed that the baffles could change the natural frequency of the tank and reduce the amplitude of sloshing and the maximum dynamic pressure occurred near the free surface zhang et al 2014 and chen et al 2017 compared the simulation results of sloshing flows computed by a meshless moving particle semi implicit mps method and a grid based level set method they considered two violent sloshing cases and the simulation results demonstrated that both methods can be used to simulate the sloshing flows nevertheless the mps method has better accuracy than the level set method in capturing the second pressure peak as well as the splashing cao et al 2014 used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model to simulate the liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with one baffle the above studies whether by laboratory experiments and or by numerical models did not examine the influence of baffle spacing or number on the mitigating effect of multiple baffles nor did they provide a quantitative method to estimate the sloshing induced hydrodynamic forces on the sidewalls such information is needed for the design of baffles in storage tanks and the tuned liquid dampers in high rise buildings this study combined a large eddy simulation les model and the volume of fluid vof method to simulate the sloshing in a rectangular tank with vertical baffles on the tank bottom a series of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the effects of baffle spacing and height on the sloshing induced hydrodynamic forces of the tank walls 2 numerical model this study employed an in house large eddy simulation code wu et al 2014 chu et al 2016 to simulate the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank the fluid motion was computed by solving the continuity equation and the

meneveau 1997 for wake flows in addition the projection method delong 1997 was employed to solve the poisson pressure equation ppe and to decouple the velocity and pressure in the navier stokes equations the kinematic motion of the water surface was explicated by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 the volume fraction f m occupied by the water in a cell was described by 7 f m t u i f m x i 0 the value of f m 1 indicates that the cell is full of water f m 0 when the cell is full of air and 0 f m 1 when the cell contains the air water interface the computational domain was discretized by the finite volume method fvm the solid baffles in the computational domain were treated by the method of partial cell treatment pct liu et al 2005 the pct is used when a cell is partially occupied by the solid material the effective cell size is reduced to θv in which θ is the volume fraction of the fluid and v is the cell volume the modified navier stokes equation can be written as 8 θ u i t θ u i u j x j θ ρ p x i θ g δ i 3 θ ρ τ i j x j where τ i j is the stress tensor and θ is the blockage ratio of the solid material inside the computational grids in the finite

of the computational grid further details of the numerical model can be found in chu et al 2016 in order to generate a periodic horizontal acceleration on the water tank a sinusoidal body force was applied to the fluid elements 10 f x a e ω 2 sin ω t where a e is the amplitude of external excitation ω 2πf e is the angular frequency and f e is the excitation frequency 3 experimental setup the sloshing experiments were carried out in a rectangular water tank with the internal dimension length l 500 mm width w 300 mm and height h 400 mm the liquid inside the tank was pure water and the initial water depth was h w 80 mm the water tank was installed on a shaking table driven by a hydraulic actuator a capacitance type wave gauge net 030 nijin co with a resolution of 0 03 mm see fig 1 was used to measure the wave height in the tank the measured signal was processed by an amplifier net 406 nijin co and transmitted to a data logger 34970 a agilent inc the sampling frequency was 100 hz and the sampling duration of each experiment was 90 s the wave gauge was installed on the central line y 0 of the tank and at a distance 60 mm to one sidewall of the tank the excitation direction was along the length x direction of the tank the amplitude of excitation was fixed at a e 15 mm and the excitation frequency was set as f e 0 50 1 30 hz before starting each experiment the water tank was placed stationary for about 5 min to let the water waves calm down the fundamental natural frequency f n of sloshing can be predicted by the following equation lamb 1932 11 f n 1 2 π π g l tanh π h w l in this study the length of the tank l 500 mm and water depth h w 80 mm therefore the natural frequency was f n 0 85 hz the first part of the experiment was to study the sloshing in the tank without baffles and the second part of the experiment was to investigate the sloshing with five vertical baffles number of baffle n b 5 mounted at the tank bottom the width of the baffles was 300 mm same width as the water tank the height h b 40 mm the thickness t b 5 mm and the spacing between two adjacent baffles was s 80 mm the water depth excitation amplitude and frequency were the same as the case of without baffle fig 2 a compares the measured maximum wave heights in the tank without and with five baffles under different excitation frequencies the wave heights were normalized by the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and the excitation frequencies were normalized by the natural frequency f n 0 85 hz when the excitation frequency f e f n 0 59 the maximum wave heights in the tank with and without baffles were almost the same however in the absence of the baffle and the excitation frequency f e f n 1 06 the wave amplitude grew with time and water was splashing out of the tank without top when t 15 s the average water depth in the tank changed with time and the sloshing became an unsteady phenomenon when the excitation frequency was close to the first mode natural frequency f n 0 85 hz of the tank with five baffles in the tank the wave amplitudes were drastically diminished especially when the excitation frequency was close to the natural frequency the spectral density function of measured surface displacement under the excitation frequency f e 1 10 hz and n b 0 analyzed by the fast fourier transform fft was shown in fig 2 b as can be seen the first mode frequency occurred at 1 123 hz and the second mode occurred at 2 246 hz twice of the first mode frequency fig 2 c shows the first mode response frequencies of the water tank without and with five baffles it demonstrates that the dominant response frequency in the tank equals to the excitation frequency regardless of the baffles 4 model validation in order to validate the present les model the simulation results for the cases without and with baffles were compared with the measured wave heights for the validation cases the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 10 hz and water depth h w 80 mm the reynolds number was calculated as 12 re 2 π f e a e h w ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the water and the reynolds number re 8300 fig 3 shows the computational domain length 0 5 m width 0 3 m and height 0 2 m and the grid arrangement the computational domain was divided into three zones and the water surface was in zone ii which adopted a uniform grid with the smallest grid size δx 2 5 mm δy 10 mm and δz 2 0 mm zones i and iii employed non uniform grids with the stretching ratio 1 03 and 1 05 respectively the courant number was set as cr 0 85 and the average time step was δt 0 0036 s the grid sensitivity was checked by comparing the simulation results of five computational different grids see table 1 the difference δ between the measured wave height ηm and predicted wave height ηp was calculated as 13 δ η m η p η p 100 the maximum ηmax and average wave height η at a distance 60 mm to the sidewall were computed from the simulation results between 40 and 60 s for the case without baffle the simulation results of grid 4 50 30 80 with the error δ 1 1 and 3 9 for the maximum ηmax and average wave height η respectively therefore grid 4 was used to simulate the flow condition without baffle in order to obtain a sufficient precision and to save computational time for the validation case with baffles the flow parameters were water depth h w 80 mm baffle height h b 40 mm baffle number n b 5 excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and frequency f e 1 10 hz fig 4 a and b compare the measured and simulated surface displacements of different computational grids for the cases without and with five baffles respectively the surface displacements shown in fig 4 are the results after the surface waves became stationary t 30 s the good agreement between the measured and simulated surface waves demonstrates that the present les model and vof method are capable of simulating the sloshing phenomenon inside the water tank table 2 summarizes the differences between the measured and predicted wave height the simulation result of grid 4 90 30 80 has the smallest error δ 2 9 and 4 0 for the maximum ηmax and average wave height η respectively thus grid 4 was used to simulate the flow conditions with baffles in the tank 5 results and discussion this study used the validated les model to investigate the influences of baffle height and spacing on the sloshing phenomenon the simulation results revealed that the average and maximum wave heights were very close therefore only the results of maximum wave height were discussed 5 1 baffle number this section discusses the influence of baffle number on the sloshing frequency and amplitude the water depth h w 80 mm baffle height h b 40 mm excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and frequency f e 1 30 hz 1 53f n were all fixed the numerical model was used to simulate the sloshing with several different baffle numbers n b 1 3 5 7 and 9 since the length of the water tank was fixed l 0 50 m the spacing between two adjacent baffles s decreased as the number of the baffles n b increased figs 5 7 show the simulated velocity vectors on the central plane y w 0 50 of the tank without baffle with one baffle n b 1 spacing s l 0 5 and five baffles n b 5 s l 0 16 respectively at four different phases of one cycle the period t 0 77 s and the reference time to 44 8 s the interaction between the baffle and the vortices became more complicated as the number of baffle increased during the first half period t to t 4 and to t 2 the water was moving from left to right the water moved in the opposite direction in the second half of the period t to 3t 4 and to t note that in figs 6 and 7 vortices were generated by the flow separation at the baffle tip furthermore the wave height and wave induced velocity for the case of one baffle n b 1 was larger than that of n b 0 besides with only one baffle in the tank there was wave breaking at phases t to t 4 and t to 3t 4 when the baffle number n b 5 fig 7 the wave amplitude and velocity in the tank became moderate as compared to that of n b 0 and 1 the vortices originated by the baffle tip became weaker with increasing baffle number n b fig 8 compares the simulated horizontal velocities at location x l 0 5 y w 0 5 for baffle number n b 1 9 the excitation frequency f e 1 30 hz amplitude a e 15 mm and the baffle height h b h w 0 50 the horizontal velocity was positive when t to t 4 and to t 2 and velocity became negative when t to 3t 4 and to t without the baffle n b 0 in the tank the velocity profile was close to a uniform distribution the velocity distribution became non uniform when there were baffles the large velocity gradient near the baffle tip was the source of the vortex also note that the maximum horizontal velocity occurred at n b 1 and the magnitude of the velocity decreased as the number of baffle n b increased fig 9 shows the relationship between the maximum wave height ηmax and baffle number for the baffle height h b h w 0 50 the measured wave heights of n b 0 and 5 were also plotted in the figure for comparison the good agreement of simulated and measured wave heights again demonstrates the capability of the present les model to simulate the sloshing phenomenon as expected the wave height decreased as the baffle number increased and the wave height of nine baffles n b 9 was about half of the wave height without baffle n b 0 note that the thickness of the baffles is 5 mm and the total length of the tank is 500 mm therefore the effective tank length was l 475 mm when there were five baffles in the tank and the change of the tank length was 5 this will change the natural frequency from 0 85 hz to 0 89 hz about 4 5 the influence of effective length increased as the number of baffles n b increased nevertheless the mitigating effect of baffles on the sloshing is more significant than the influence of effective length the influence of the multiple baffles on the natural frequency of the water tank is discussed in section 5 3 5 2 baffle height in order to investigate the effect of baffle height on the sloshing phenomenon the flow fields of several different baffle heights h b 20 mm 40 mm 60 mm and 70 mm relative baffle height h b h w 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 0 875 respectively were simulated by the present les model the number of baffle n b 5 water depth h w 80 mm excitation amplitude a e 15 mm and frequency f e 1 30 hz 1 53f n were fixed fig 10 shows the relationship between the maximum wave heights ηmax and the relative baffle height h b h w for baffle number n b 5 the baffle height h b 0 represents that the water tank had no baffle it reveals that the wave height decreased as the baffle height increased this finding is similar to the simulation results of akyildiz 2012 and jung et al 2012 nonetheless the wave heights were almost the same when the baffle height h b h w 0 75 and 0 875 in other words the effect of baffle height lessened when the relative height h b h w 0 75 when the relative height h b h w 0 75 the maximum wave height was about 50 of the wave height without baffle h b 0 5 3 excitation frequency this section examines the effect of excitation frequency f e on the wave height the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm water depth hw 80 mm baffle height h b h w 0 50 and baffle number n b 5 the excitation frequency f e was in the range of 0 50 hz 1 5 hz fig 11 displays the simulated and measured maximum wave heights of different frequencies f e the largest wave height occurred when the excitation frequency was 0 70 hz compared to the largest wave height occurred at 0 90 hz for the tank without baffle see fig 2 this indicates that the natural frequency of the tank is altered by the baffles this can be explained by the fact that the water between two adjacent baffles merely moved between the baffles while the water above the baffle could move freely from one side of the tank to another side the effective water depth can be calculated as h w h b 40 mm by substituting this effective water depth and the length of the tank l 500 mm into eq 11 one can get the new natural frequency f n 0 65 hz this value is close to the frequency f e 0 70 hz that has the largest observed wave height in other words the natural frequency of baffled tank can be tuned by changing the effective water depth in the tank 5 4 hydrodynamic force the sloshing forces acting on the sidewalls of the tanks during earthquakes are essential for the design of storage tanks and tuned liquid dampers however the previous studies did not provide a quantitative method to estimate the sloshing induced hydrodynamic forces based on the simulation results the dynamic pressures pd z p ps z of the sidewalls normal to the motion of the tank were calculated where ps z ρg h z is the hydrostatic pressure in the water h is the water depth ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water and g is the gravitational accelertaion fig 12 shows the distribution of dynamic pressure on the sidewall of the tank x 0 y w 0 5 for baffle numbers n b 0 1 3 and 5 with the baffle height h b h w 0 50 the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 30 hz and water depth h w 80 mm when time t to 3t 4 and t to t the dynamic pressure with one baffle n b 1 is larger than that of without baffle n b 0 especially near the water surface as the baffle number increased the dynamic pressure on the sidewall substantially decreased when n b 3 the hydrodynamic force on the sidewall x 0 is calculated as 14 f i 1 n p i δ z i w where p i is the dynamic pressure at the ith grid point on the sidewall δz i is the grid size of the ith grid and w 0 3 m is the width of the tank since the hydrodynamic pressure is proportional to the amplitude of the excitation acceleration a e 2 π f e 2 the dimensionless force coefficient is defined as 15 c f f 0 5 ρ a e 2 π f e 2 h w w h w where h w is the average water depth and w is the width of the water tank fig 13 shows the time variation of force coefficients on the sidewall of the tank x 0 under different numbers of baffle the excitation amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 30 hz h w 80 mm and h b h w 0 50 as can be seen the maximum force coefficient c f of one baffle n b 1 is slightly larger than that of no baffle n b 0 in other words the diminishing effect of single baffle on the sloshing force is not very effective when n b 1 the force coefficient decreased as the number of n b increased fig 14 depicts the relationship between the maximum force coefficient c f and baffle number n b the maximum force coefficient c f is about 104 70 60 56 and 46 for n b 1 3 5 7 and 9 respectively compared with the no baffle case n b 0 the maximum force coefficients on the sidewall x 0 for different baffle heights h b h w are shown in fig 15 the amplitude a e 15 mm frequency f e 1 30 hz h w 80 mm and n b 5 as expected the force coefficient decreased as the baffle height h b increased nevertheless the effect of baffle height lessened when the relative height h b h w 0 75 when the relative height h b h w 0 75 and baffle number n b 5 the maximum force coefficient is about 55 of that without baffle n b 0 fig 16 shows the relationship between the maximum force coefficient and the excitation frequency the baffle height h b h w 0 50 and baffle number n b 5 it demonstrates that the largest force coefficient occurred when the excitation frequency f e 0 70 hz which is close to the new natural frequency 0 65 hz with the effective water depth h w h b 40 mm the force coefficients of other excitation frequencies are much smaller than that of the frequency f e 0 70 hz the dimensionless force coefficients shown in figs 14 16 can be utilized for the optimal design in terms of the height and number of the baffles of the tuned liquid dampers in high rise buildings 6 conclusions this study used a large eddy simulation model and volume of fluid vof method to investigate liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with multiple vertical baffles mounted on the tank bottom the simulated wave heights were validated by the results of shaking table experiments then the numerical model was used to study the influences of the excitation frequency baffle number and height on the sloshing force of the tank walls the simulation results can be summarized into following points 1 the baffles have pronounced mitigating effect on the sloshing phenomenon when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the tank the first mode response frequency was very close to the excitation frequency regardless of the baffles 2 the natural frequency of the tank with multiple vertical baffles is related to the effective water depth total water depth h w subtracting the baffle height h b in other words the natural frequency of baffled tank can be tuned by varying the effective water depth in the tank 3 when the relative baffle height h b h w 0 50 the maximum sloshing force on the sidewalls of the tank with single baffle n b 1 is slightly larger than that of without baffle n b 0 case when n b 3 the wave height and sloshing force decrease as the baffle number increases namely the mitigating effect of multiple baffles is better than that of one baffle 4 the wave height and the sloshing force decrease as the baffle height increases but the effect of baffle height is lessened when the relative height h b h w 0 75 when the relative height h b h w 0 75 and baffle number n b 5 the hydrodynamic force is about 55 of that without the baffle 5 the sloshing force on the sidewalls of the tank can be described by the excitation frequency amplitude and the average water depth the dimensionless force coefficient can be used for the design of the tuned liquid dampers tld in high rise buildings acknowledgment this

23099,in northern sea areas such as the baltic sea and the arctic especially in winter conditions the presence of sea ice frequently necessitates icebreaker assistance operations for vessels navigating in these areas icebreaker escort operations are important for ensuring the safety of navigation in these harsh environments while these operations reduce the overall system risk studies have shown that specific navigational risks are associated also with escort operations necessitating appropriate training and operational support for ship crew engaged in these in this paper the icebreaker escort operations are investigated and a ship following model is proposed drawing on similarities with the car following phenomenon this ship following model accounts for the necessity of keeping an appropriate safety distance to avoid collision as well as for the effects of sea ice on the operation its main intended use is for implementation in maritime simulators providing a realistic environment of operational conditions for training ship crews as a first approximation the model accounts for the ice condition by the average ice thickness while the safety speed constraint is relative to the vessel s ability of navigating in ice the model parameters are calibrated using empirical data of icebreaker escort operations case studies are executed showing good agreement

protection faghih roohiet al 2014 sang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a in some areas with high latitudes the cold weather in the winter season causes the sea surface to freeze in the baltic sea area navigation in harsh sea ice environments poses specific challenges to winter navigation and navigational accidents occur relatively more frequently in ice conditions than in open water conditions goerlandt et al 2017a the safety of life at sea convention chapter v solas 1974 contains technical and operational provisions related to the safety of navigation which applies globally this inter alia concerns voyage planning which aims at ensuring sufficient sea room for the vessel s safe passage while anticipating navigational hazards and adverse weather conditions another highly relevant international convention is the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs 1972 which provides rules focusing on the operational navigational actions to ensure navigational safety this includes requirements to proceed with a safe speed accounting for technical capabilities of the vessel traffic density and composition and environmental conditions the colregs also contain rules for vessels in sight of one another to facilitate collision avoidance for vessels operating in arctic waters solas chapter ivx makes mandatory the international code for ships

united nations convention on the law of the sea un general assembly 1982 several states have implemented additional mechanisms to ensure the safety of navigation in their waters due to specific local

and operational instructions on winter navigation liikennevirasto 2017 the latter include general provisions related to icebreaker assistance traffic restrictions operational requirements for vessels information on ice services and vessel traffic services despite the implementation of the above outlined risk management processes jointly known as the finnish swedish winter navigation system a recent risk analysis indicates that collisions and especially collisions in icebreaker escort and convoy operations have the potential to lead to significant oil spills valdez banda et al 2015 as e g occurred following the runner 4 accident in the gulf of finland in 2006 wang et al 2008 the results of a more detailed risk management model indicate that of several available risk control options improved training is considered one of the most effective methods to reduce the maritime risk valdez banda et al 2016 this was also the conclusion of an interview and questionnaire study by boström and österman 2017 maritime navigation simulators are important tools for ship crews to gain experience with different navigational conditions so developing realistic simulator environments is important to enhance training last et al 2017 ship performance models are essential building blocks in the development of such simulators significant work has been performed to develop models for ship

2011 and route planning in ice kotovirta et al 2009 less scientific work has been performed on developing models for real time simulation purposes a notable exception being lubbad and løset 2011 who propose an approach based on the physx modeling environment for tracking the ship ice interaction process focusing specifically on escort and convoy operations tsoy 1983 has developed a mathematical model for the ship dynamics of a vessel in a channel broken by an icebreaker without considering the dynamics or interaction with the icebreaker however to the best of the authors knowledge no models have been developed with the specific purpose of modeling the spatio temporal interaction process of the icebreaker and the escorted vessel the development and implementation of such a model in a maritime simulator would improve the realism of navigational scenarios which could contribute to improved training for navigation in ice conditions in turn reducing the navigational risk according to the results of valdez banda et al 2016 and boström and österman 2017 additionally the purpose of this paper is to develop a ship following model for icebreaker escort operations with possible application in ship bridge simulators the model is established accounting for the safety distance that is mandatory for ship collision avoidance and the safe speed in ice conditions considering the ship s ability to pass through a sea ice environment although the parameters are calibrated to the specific sea ice conditions prevailing in the baltic sea area the proposed modeling approach can also be applied in other ice covered waters the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines research the studied problem and reviews previous work concerning kinematic following model

elements used for managing the risks of winter navigation these include ship design requirements to ship operation information services traffic restrictions and specific navigational operations valdez banda et al 2015 when vessels are authorized to cross an area covered by sea ice they may depending on the ice conditions and ship specific characteristics require assistance from an icebreaker in icebreaker assistance five practical operations are commonly distinguished rosenblad 2007 escort convoy breaking loose double convoy and towing in an escort operation an icebreaker breaks a channel and a vessel follows the icebreaker at a certain distance the distance which is maintained between the icebreaker and the assisted vessel is in practice based on experience results from empirical work by goerlandt et al 2017b who analyze escort operations based on data from the automatic identification system ais and sea ice hindcast data however show that there is a dependency between this distance and the prevailing ice conditions convoy operations are similar to escorting but with several ships following the icebreaker more details about the practical navigational aspects of ship convoy and escort operations can be found in rosenblad 2007 generally the crew of a vessel assisted in an escort operation is responsible for establishing and maintaining a suitable distance between the assisted vessel and the icebreaker rosenblad 2007 in accordance with the general provisions of the colregs 1972 and observing the general instructions as laid out by liikennevirasto 2017 for economic reasons a relatively high speed is typically maintained during the operation goerlandt et al 2017b from a safety and operational point of view this distance is clearly important as shown by zhang et al 2017a the collision probability increases with a shorted distance between the icebreaker and the escorted vessel however if a longer distance is maintained the movement of the assisted vessel may be obstructed by ice e g by slush ice in the channel especially in compressive ice conditions the opened channel can close again so that with longer distances between the icebreaker and assisted vessel the probability of the ship getting stuck in ice increases riska et al 1997 it is also empirically confirmed by goerlandt et al 2017b that in compressive ice conditions in the baltic sea escorted vessels navigate closer to the icebreaker another important issue in escort operations is the safe speed even though the escorted vessel navigates largely in the channel broken free by the icebreaker the speed needs to be kept in a safe speed range to prevent damage to the hull or hull appendices from ice ice damage is often the result of excessive speed in the ice conditions which occurs in broken ice in low to moderate concentrations enfotec et al 1996 tunik 2000 this is due to the significant increases in ice loads with increased ice thicknesses and ship speeds kotilainen et al 2017 a related issue in the execution of the escort operation is the width of the assisted vessel in relation to the channel width an increase of a ship s beam relative to the channel width leads to a noticeable increase of ice resistance a decrease of the ship s speed in the channel and an increased risk of hull damage due to the speed dependent ice loads riska et al 1997 in some studies such as goerlandt et al 2017b the distance and speed between icebreakers and following vessels in escort and convoy operations have been empirically studied also in other studies e g tsoy 1983 the speed of movement in a channel broken by an icebreaker has been addressed zhang et al 2017a develop a simulation model for estimating the safe distance in escort operations applied to case studies of vessels navigating along the northern sea route this model aims at determining the collision frequency for an escort operation under different ice conditions and following distances acknowledging the previous efforts in analyzing and modeling escort operations there currently is a lack of comprehensive modeling approaches to estimate the combined kinematics of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel in escort operations as mentioned in the introduction such a model can be useful to enhance the realism of ship navigation in ice conditions in ship handling simulators this can contribute to enhanced training and ultimately to reduced ship collision risk in winter navigation conditions valdez banda et al 2016 2 2 review of following model approaches while no models have been developed for combined kinematics of an icebreaker and an escorted vessel in road traffic there is a rich literature on car following models clearly the respective operational contexts are different but the more generic problem of the coupled kinematics of two vehicles engaged in a leader follower pattern has similarities between road traffic and ship escort operations this similarity has also been exploited by he et al 2012 who developed a safety distance model for inland vessels hence in order to develop a modeling approach for ship escort operations it is considered useful to provide a brief overview of the approaches taken to address the car following problem car following has been studied for several decades and a lot of progress has been made in this area the concept of car following was first established in the early 1950s reuschel 1950 and pipes 1953 first analyzed the traffic in the queue from the kinematic point of view pipes assumed that the driver desires to maintain a prescribed safety distance with the preceding vehicle based on the california vehicle code in the 1950s general motors gm laboratories performed much theoretical research greatly advancing the basic research of the car following problem with influence continuing to this day newell 2002 gazis 2002 in recent decades the following model in road traffic has been well developed safety is one of the key factors considered przybyla et al 2015 tang et al 2017 the effects of car following model on intelligent traffic systems are also studied kuang et al 2017 in recent years the modeling approaches have made extensive use of data driven model formulation and parameterization papathanasopoulou and antoniou 2015 more accurate algorithms have been developed for estimating the model parameters based on large amounts of data li et al 2016 a variety of theoretical methods to model car following behavior have been proposed from the perspective of traffic engineering the modeling approaches can be divided into stimulus response model safe distance model psycho physiological model and artificial intelligence model wang and jin 2012 the stimulus response framework siuhi and kaseko 2016 is the most basic follow up behavior modeling approach which expresses the role of the leading vehicle to the following car s driver as a stimulus s t and the driver s perceptual ability as a sensitive coefficient of s e the human reaction r e is expressed as the movement of the followed car as shown in equation 1 1 r e s e s t the safety distance modeling approach is based on the assumption that the driver desires to maintain a safe distance from the leading vehicle and that the driver can have time to react and decelerate to avoid a collision when the preceding vehicle suddenly brakes kometani et al 1959 first proposed a safety distance model which uses the speed of the leading vehicle and the following car to calculate the safe distance as follows 2 x n 1 t x n t α 1 v n 1 2 β 1 v n 2 t t β v n t t b 0 here α 1 β 1 β b 0 are coefficients which are calibrated on the basis of observed car following data whereas x is location and v is speed n indicates the preceding car and n 1 is the following car t means time interval gipps 1981 proposed a new safety distance model considering the vehicle s acceleration constraints and safety distance constraints the model takes into account the influence of many factors in driving behavior and is still widely used spyropoulou 2007 the model suggests that the speed of a vehicle is subject to three constraints first the vehicle speed does not exceed the driver s desired speed v n second the vehicle accelerates rapidly until it approaches the desired speed and then the acceleration is reduced almost to zero if two vehicles are far apart they behave as in the free flow condition i e their kinematics do not influence one another the third condition is taken into account when distances between the vehicles are short and determines the driving behavior of the following vehicle while the preceding vehicle decelerates it is assumed that the following vehicle will adjust its velocity so as to keep a safe distance from the preceding vehicle the basic expression of the model is 3 v n t t a n t a n 2 t t 2 a n t 2 δ x n t l n 1 v n t t v n 1 t 2 a ˆ t δ x n t is the distance between the nth car and the preceding vehicle a ˆ t is the acceleration of the leading vehicle estimated by the following vehicle it can be simply assumed that the value is equal to the acceleration of the leading vehicle a n 1 t the variable v is speed and parameter l is the length of preceding car a n t is the acceleration of the leading vehicle at time t whereas parameter t is time interval to next following state check point then a n t t is speed of the leading vehicle wiedemann 1974 proposed a psycho physiological vehicle following model which has become the core entity of the widely used micro traffic simulation software vissim vissim 2017 the basic idea of the model is that once the distance between the vehicles is considered to be less than the psychological safety distance the driver of the following car will start to slow down as the driver cannot accurately judge the speed of the preceding vehicle the speed of the following car will be lower than the speed of the preceding vehicle during a short time interval this period lasts until the distance between the two cars approaches another psychological safety distance when the driver of the following car will begin to speed up again this forms a cycle of acceleration deceleration and re acceleration many of the theoretical methods of artificial intelligence can be applied to a number of fields including vehicle following behavior modeling the artificial intelligence method can effectively describe driving behavior characteristics that are difficult to express with precise mathematical models kikuchi and chakroborty 1992 first proposed a follow up model based on fuzzy logic with the development of artificial neural network ann in the field of transportation applications dougherty 1995 the ann driving behavior modeling has gradually developed kehtarnavaz et al 1998 for example scholars have proposed car following models based on bp back propagation neural networks and based on radial basis function neural network jia et al 2001 xu et al 2007 zhou et al 2009 3 ship following in ice condition selection of modeling approach and evidence 3 1 model aims and selection of modeling approach the model for ship following in ice conditions is primarily intended for use in ship bridge simulators improved training in ice navigation has been identified as an effective and realistic option to reduce the risks of winter navigation valdez banda et al 2016 boström and österman 2017 ship escort and convoy operations have been found to be among the operations involving the most accidents goerlandt et al 2017a these operations also representing the highest risks to environmental pollution valdez banda et al 2016 hence these are good candidates for which to prioritize the realism in bridge simulator centers in particular in regards the spatio temporal kinematics between the vessels in different ice conditions a ship following model may also have a use for maritime traffic system simulation purposes advanced traffic simulation models could shed light on the required number of icebreakers for ensuring smooth cargo flows lindeberg et al 2015 and provide insights into the effect of rule changes in a waterway qu and meng 2012 traffic simulation models also have a role in analyzing maritime transportation risk van dorp and merrick 2011 and in investigating the effect of design of operational changes to ship emissions zhang et al 2017b in the current modeling approach focus is exclusively on ship escort operations i e only the kinematics between the icebreaker and one following ship are considered extending the approach to convoy operations is possible in principle but is outside the current scope for the escort operations the speed and distance of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel are subject to several constraints as seen in section 2 1 first the assisted vessel has to be keep a reasonable distance with icebreaker on the one hand the distance between the ships should be enough to prevent collision when the leading ship suddenly stops on the other hand the distance should not be too large to prevent the assisted vessel being hampered by ice in the channel second while the speed should be as high as possible for economic reasons the speed should be below the safe speed to prevent ice induced hull damages of the modeling approaches introduced in section 2 2 the approach by gipps 1981 which is based on the safety distance is considered suitable as a basis for developing a ship following model under ice condition as the safety of collision avoidance is a major concern however unlike the car following problem the icebreaker needs to take the ice going capability of the assisted ship into consideration because different ship design ice classes and different ice conditions correspond to different levels of safety concern in practice such operational considerations by the icebreaker crew lead to instructions to assisted vessels in accordance to the provisions of liikennevirasto 2017 the proposed modeling approach combines an analytical model describing the coupled kinematics of an icebreaker and an escorted vessel where environmental conditions and vessel capabilities are calibrated using empirical data in the following sections the data and information sources used in the definition of the model are introduced in section 3 2 data concerning escort operations from combined ship traffic and ice information sources are described section 3 3 addresses how the effect of the ice type is accounted for while section 3 4 focuses on the safety speed 3 2 data of escort operations in ice condition for obtaining insights in the kinematics of escort operations and for establishing data for calibrating model parameters and validation a series of videos has been constructed using data from the automatic identification system ais these videos show the icebreaker operations dynamically while giving insight in the overall traffic situation information about ice conditions based on hindcast data obtained from the helmi multi category sea ice model described in haapala et al 2005 is coupled to the ship movement data as well in this study data is used from the baltic sea in the period of feb 19 2011 to mar 18 2011 fig 1 shows a screenshot of a video which shows the ais and sea ice data of an icebreaker operation the various elements of the video are outlined below the method of constructing and analyzing these kinds of videos as well as the underlying data sources is explained in detail in goerlandt et al 2017b a icebreaker central in a 2 nm inspection domain the icebreaker is shown by a contour at its instantaneous position b assisted nearby vessels within the 2 nm inspection domain the vessels assisted and or nearby the icebreaker are shown by a contour at their

ice condition on ship following this study focuses on ship following model under ice condition therefore it is necessary to understand and quantify the ice condition in the model 3 3 1 ice category sea ice is a complex natural phenomenon showing different forms and types sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes as they are driven against each other typical resulting ice types can be classified as rafted ice when ice sheets slide under one another or ridged ice in which a line of broken ice is forced downward known as the keel and upward known as the sail level ice is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation and is therefore relatively flat the ice data used in this study was obtained from the hindcasts performed with the helmi multi category sea ice model the model is described in detail in haapala et al 2005 and mårtensson et al 2012 in order to analyze ship following behavior the ice related parameters are retrieved from helmi model level ice concentration level ice thickness ridged ice concentration ridged ice thickness rafted ice concentration rafted ice thickness direction of ice compression ice compression magnitude ice drift velocity direction of wind wind speed air temperature and sea water temperature the helmi model can resolve the parameters of mean ice velocity internal ice stress ice concentration and ice thickness thickness is classified as seven categories five level ice categories rafted ice and ridged ice the following equations govern the development of the non deformed ice categories haapala et al 2005 4 a u t u a u ψ u θ a u 5 h u t u h u ω u θ h u where a u is the concentration of a given non deformed ice category the ice velocity vector is denoted with u ψ u stands for the change of ice concentration due to deformation θ a u denotes thermodynamical changes h u is the mean thickness of non deformed ice per unit area ω u is the change of concentration of non deformed ice and θ h u is thermos dynamical change floe thickness h is obtained since h h a haapala et al 2005 the evaluation of the deformed ice categories applies following equations haapala et al 2005 6 a d t u a d ψ d θ a d 7 h d t u h d ω d θ h d where ψ d and ω d are the redistribution terms of deformed ice which describe the growth in concentration and mass of deformed ice due to process of ridging and rafting 3 3 2 quantification of ice condition the safety degree of ship sailing in an ice area is the result of a combination of ice and ship conditions involving amongst other ice type ice thickness ship hull structure engine ability and sailing speed the finnish swedish ice class rules establish six ice classes assigned to vessels operating in first year ice in the baltic sea these ice classes relate to requirements for hull structural design engine output and performance in ice the six ice classes are denoted ia super ia ib ic ii and iii currently an accurate analytic relationship between the effect of ice conditions on the coupled vessel kinematics in focus in the ship following problem has not yet been established therefore in this study the average ice thickness is used to represent the ice condition assuming that the effect on the coupled vessel kinematics is linearly proportional to the average ice thickness to derive the average ice thickness information from the helmi model outlined in section 3 3 1 is used the average ice thickness h a v e can be calculated as follows 8 h a v e i 1 n h i i 1 n a i where h i i 1 2 7 indicates the thickness of five level ice categories rafted ice and ridged ice and a i i 1 2 7 indicates the concentration of these ice categories 3 4 safety speed safety of ships operating in ice infested waters depends on operational aspects generally the ice class is the primary criterion characterizing a ship s operational limits and structural strength stoddard et al 2016 while it is known that loads on hull structures due to ice impacts are inherently speed dependent tunik 2000 kotilainen et al 2017 there currently is no accurate quantitative relationship between the ice classes operational speeds and ice impact loads in different ice conditions in principle an assessment of safety and operational limits for an individual ship can be obtained from a safe speed analysis here safe speed is the minimal value of all maximum speeds satisfying a set of expressions equating the speed dependent ice loads due to possible ship ice impacts and the load bearing capacity of the affected structures considered for every ice loaded structural member tunik 2000 mathematically this can be expressed as 9 v s a f e min v m a x j p j v p j σ α ε α where p j v is the speed dependent ice impact load on the j t h structural member p j σ α ε α is the load bearing capacity of the j t h structural member with respect to allowable criteria for stress strain σ α ε α state v m a x j is the maximum ship speed satisfying conditions for the j t h structural member and v is the ship speed when the ice conditions are sufficiently severe for a ship to proceed her speed is low and impact loads are comparatively low as well when a ship encounters moderate or low ice resistance and is sailing relatively fast in channels broken by an icebreaker as well as in leads polynyas or thin ice with immediately adjacent heavy ice features she can hit these heavy ice features resulting in high impact loads and damages this is the scenario for many speed related damages jalonen et al 2005 this latter scenario is the basic scenario applicable to the safe speed concept for a vessel following an icebreaker in a channel in such scenarios the safe speeds are not related directly to ice thickness but rather to the probabilities of encountering strong and massive ice features the safe speeds may differ considerably for different ship types and ice classes for example icebreakers designed primarily for ice management and high manoeuvrability are intended to spend a major part of their operational life in severe ice conditions will have different safe speeds compared to icebreaking vessels whose primary missions do not necessarily include sailing in ice but which are capable of independent navigation in severe ice conditions ships of low ice classes capable of operating in broken ice again will have different safe speeds typical values of safe speeds may vary from 2 to 6 knots when elastic criteria are applied for the structural response to ice impact loads when plastic criteria are adopted safe speeds range from 3 to about 12 knots with upper values for large ships and lighter ice conditions tunik 2000 4 ship following in ice condition modelling 4 1 ship following model basic concepts in modeling the ship following behavior in escort operations a key aspect is the safety distance i e the distance between the assisted vessel and the icebreaker as discussed above this distance should be large enough to prevent collisions from occurring but also be large enough so the following vessel is not adversely affected by the presence of ice in the broken channel or by closure of the ice channel due to compression caused by sea ice dynamics in the field of road transportation research the model by gipps 1981 is based on a similar constraint of safety distance this distance accounts for the influence of many factors in driving behavior compared to the original model by gipps the situation in escort operations in ice navigation is more complex which is mainly due to the speed limits necessary for minimizing the risk of ice damages to the ship hull on the one hand the assisted vessel needs to adjust its speed according to the speed of the icebreaker i e accelerating or decelerating to maintain a safe distance on the other hand the ship speed is subject to the constraints of the safety speed according to the ice condition and the hull capacity as outlined in section 3 4 hence due to the different capacity through the ice channel the icebreaker also needs to consider the ice going capability of the assisted ship and adjust its operating speed the driving speed proactively riska et al 1997 based on the previous discussion the following behavior of the following ship is mainly affected by two factors the safety distance which in turn depends on the speed of the leading ship and the ice conditions and the safety speed which depends on the ice conditions and ship design also the relative width between icebreaker and the assisted vessel has a certain influence on the difficulty of maintaining a steady speed in case the assisted ship cannot keep up with the icebreaker the icebreaker may reduce its speed as typical channel ice conditions are quite complex and can vary even over relatively short distances li et al 2018 there is some variation in the relationship between the ice conditions and the ship speed for the icebreaker and the assisted vessel therefore the exact determination of a safety distance involves some uncertainty zhang et al 2017a for the current modeling purposes the safety distance is divided into two parts the basic safety distance d b which is determined by the kinematic characteristics of the ships and the adjustable safety distance d i which is determined by the ice conditions with a positive or negative value depending on the traffic situation and ice condition mathematically this is written as 10 d d b d i considering the ability of the assisted vessel to cross a given sea ice environment there is another speed constraint stemming from the safe speed in ice conditions see section 3 4 mathematically this constraint is written 11 s s s a f e fig 3 illustrates how the safety distance is considered in the ship following model which closely relates to hoe the escorted ship and icebreaker maintain a safe distance fig 3 explains the following behavior from two aspects on the one hand the following ship needs follow the icebreaker within a safe distance via acceleration or deceleration on the other hand the icebreaker needs to keep the escorted ship within the safety speed the development of a following model for escort operations in ice conditions consists of three steps first the model structure is established which is elaborated in section 4 2 then the parameters in the model are calibrated which is presented in section 4 3 finally the model is validated i e the model performance is evaluated in light of the intended model use this is performed in the case study shown in section 5 4 2 ship following model mathematical formulation based on the original formulation of the vehicle following model by gipps 1981 and the discussion on the influencing factors for the ship following model in escort operations in sea ice conditions see section 3 the mathematical structure of the ship following model is formulated in the following sections the model is developed in steps to highlight the different aspects considered in the model in section 4 2 1 the initial model is presented which accounts only for the vessel kinematics and is very similar to the original model by gipps 1981 in section 4 2 2 the model is extended to account for the effect of ice conditions to the safety distance in section 4 2 3 the issue of the safety speed of the vessel operating in ice conditions is considered 4 2 1 initial model formulation the structural form of the ship following model is derived from the constraints given by the vessel kinematic characteristics considering the scenario with an icebreaker and one assisted vessel in an escort operation the icebreaker may stop for some reason like being stuck by ridged ice zhang et al 2017a then the following vessel has to decrease speed quickly and stop to avoid collision as demonstrated in fig 4 to avoid such a collision sufficient distance d between the icebreaker and the following ship is needed considering the constraint of safety distance similar to the model by gipps 1981 we can write 12 d t n τ x p t n τ x f t n τ l p v f t τ v f 2 t 2 a f v p 2 t 2 a p here the parameters x p v p a p are the location speed and deceleration of the leading preceding ship respectively and x f v f a f are the location speed and deceleration of the escorted following ship t n is the start time of deceleration and τ is time interval of deceleration d is the safety distance between two vessels the variable l is the length of vessels the subscript p means preceding and the subscript f means following to avoid a collision it is required that d t n τ 0 i e 13 x p t n τ l p x f t n τ considering the kinematics of vessels motion and the driver s reaction 14 x p t n τ x p t n v p t n 2 2 a p 15 x f t n τ x f t n τ v f t n v f t n τ 2 v f t n τ θ v f t n τ 2 2 a f here θ is the reaction time which causes lag of the following ship to accelerate decelerate after the preceding vessel increases or decreases its speed then we obtain 16 x p t n v p t n 2 2 a p l p x f t n τ v f t n v f t n τ 2 v f t n τ θ v f t n τ 2 2 a f this equals 17 v f t n τ 2 2 a f v f t n τ τ 2 θ x p t n x f t n l p v f t n τ 2 v p t n 2 2 a p 0 solving inequality 17 then results in 18 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p 4 2 2 updated model formulation including effect of ice conditions the model in section 4 2 1 is derived without consideration of the effect of ice on the safety distance however an analysis by goerlandt et al 2017b clearly shows that ice conditions significantly influence the distance between the assisted vessel and the icebreaker higher ice thickness correspond to shorter distances hence for a ship navigating in sea ice conditions it is reasonable to model the following distance as a function of the safety distance in open water conditions and the ice conditions defining 19 δ d d s a f e i c e d s a f e then the model 12 is changed as follows 20 d s a f e x p t n τ x f t n τ l p δ d to avoid collision it is required that d s a f e 0 i e 21 x p t n τ l p δ d x f t n τ then eq 16 is updated as follows 22 x p t n v p t n 2 2 a p l p δ d x f t n τ v f t n v f t n τ 2 v f t n τ θ v f t n τ 2 2 a f this can be re written as 23 v f t n τ 2 2 a f v f t n τ τ 2 θ x p t n x f t n l p δ d v f t n τ 2 v p t n 2 2 a p 0 from this the expression of the speed of the following vessel can be deduced 24 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p δ d τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p the relationship between δ d and the ice conditions is relatively complex possibly depending on specific local conditions in this study to simply the problem it is assumed that δ d is linearly proportional to the ice condition as follows 25 δ d α i c e c o n d i t i o n β where α and β are coefficients which need to be calibrated on the basis of collected data it is further assumed that the ice condition can be adequately represented by the average ice thickness as defined by eq 8 considering based on the definition of eq 19 that δ d 0 in open water conditions i e without ice presence the coefficient β should be zero then eq 25 simplifies to 26 δ d α h a v e therefore eq 24 becomes 27 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p α h a v e τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p 4 2 3 final model formulation including safety speed constraint based on the discussion about safety speed in section 3 4 a ship navigating in sea ice environments has to consider the structural strength of ship hull and keep its speed in a reasonable range for safety reasons the mean safety speed can be estimated based on an experienced equation after a term of ice decision numeral that represents the effect of ice condition and ship structure condition has been calculated enfotec et al 1996 it is 28 v s a f e f i c e d e c i s i o n n u m e r a l then the speed constraint can be formulated as 29 v v s a f e v s a f e v s a f e δ v here δ v is a range determined by specific conditions in this study to simplify the problem this factor is taken as zero consequently the final model including the safety speed constraint is written as 30 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p α h a v e τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p v f v s a f e where the combinated item α h a v e reflects the effect of ice condition that is demonstrated in fig 2 and the limitation of v s a f e represents the operation concern of safety speed shown in fig 3 4 3 coefficient calibration in this section the coefficients in the model of eq 28 are calibrated the reaction time θ is considered in section 4 3 1 the ice condition parameter α in section 4 3 2 the safety speed is considered in section 4 3 3 4 3 1 reaction time the kinematics of a ship are different than those of a vehicle when braking with a car it will decelerate almost immediately in contrast a ship often decelerates after a short delay therefore the reaction time of a car is nearly exactly the reaction time of driver however the reaction time of a ship includes the reaction time of both crew and the ship which is reflected in the lag of speed change of the ship for assessing the reaction time correlation analysis is an effective method that can show the lag between two analyzed time series zhang et al 2016b since the proposed model of eq 30 contains reaction time θ correlation analysis of speed and acceleration is conduction to calibrate the reaction time defining x t and y t as samples of the stationary random process x k t y k t the cross correlation function r x y τ is defined as 31 r x y τ e x t y t τ lim t 1 t 0 t x t y t τ d t the coefficient of cross correlation is 32 ρ x y τ lim t 1 t 0 t x t y t τ d t μ x μ y σ x σ y r x y τ μ x μ y σ x σ y first the correlation of the speeds of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel is analyzed the data taken is from icebreaker escort service in march 1 2011 the icebreaker is fennica with international maritime organization imo number 9043615 whereas the imo number of the assisted vessel is 9551923 many following scenarios samples are analyzed in this stage as elaborated below a typical example is shown in fig 6 which occurs around 14 50pm march 1 2011 in the following figures a time unit of 10 s is used to keep correspondence with the original data fig 6 shows cross correlation analysis of speed time series in fig 5 the term ccf in fig 6 means cross correlation function which is calculated using equation 32 from the range of peak value of cross correlation analysis where ccf 0 5 it is seen that there exists a lag in range of 50 110 s concerning the time when the assisted ship changes speed to match the change in icebreaker speed with an average lag of around 80 s the lag in fig 6 corresponds to the elapsed time interval between the time of a speed change by the icebreaker and the ensuing speed change by the escorted vessel in order to determine the lag of speed between icebreakers and assisted vessels more generally more cross correlation analyses are conducted for different escort following scenarios a sample of escort scenarios observed in the period feb 19 2011 to mar 18 2011 recorded based on a video analysis described in goerlandt et al 2017b are taken as a basis for this analysis statistics are made concerning the average lag of different icebreakers with results shown in table 1 and fig 7 the icebreakers include fennica and voima imo 5383158 and imo of assisted vessels are 9342152 9388376 9190315 8707783 and 8131922 from fig 7 it is further taken that the average lag can be modeled as a gaussian distribution x n μ σ 2 with μ 84 45 seconds and σ 35 78 seconds this value is validated using hypothesis testing applied with data sampling from icebreaker voima and its assisted ship hypotheses h 0 μ μ 0 h 1 μ μ 0 suppose statistical test 33 u x μ 0 σ n here μ 0 is mean value and σ is variance n is the number of samples and x is average of the samples the hypothesis rejection domain d is 34 d u u α 2 when confidence probability α 0 05 the hypothesis rejection domain becomes cook and lawless 2007 35 d u 1 645 from the sampling data of icebreaker voima it is found that x 68 which corresponds to u x 1 05 because x d therefore the hypothesis h 0 cannot be rejected from the validation result the gaussian distribution is supported and the estimation of parameter θ is 84 45 s the variance of parameter θ is around 36 s which may be caused e g by differences in the human performance in terms of decision making and reaction time as well as by differences in the response of the propulsion system 4 3 2 ice condition parameter the parameter calibration of the effect of ice conditions in the following model can be transformed into as a problem for solving the optimal solution of nonlinear programming where the objective function is set to approach the smallest difference between the observed data and the simulated data from the model in general the independent variables are the parameters of the model and the constraint is the physical range of each parameter it can be expressed as 36 min f o b j e c t i v e f v x a i c e h i v x a i c e 0 i 1 2 n h g j v x a i c e 0 j 1 2 n g here f is the objective function which represents a functional relationship of speed v position x and acceleration a and ice condition ice which has been mathematically described in the previous sections the variable h i is a linear constraint whereas g j is a nonlinear constraint n h and n g are the number of linear and nonlinear constraints to solve the optimization problem the least squares method can be used which is well known harter 1975 based on eq 30 the optimization goal is minimum of difference between simulated speed and observed speed then the most suitable ice condition parameter contained in the model is expected to be achieved from eq 38 the data is taken from icebreaker escort operations across different icebreakers in difference ice conditions from feb 19 2011 to mar 18 2011 march 2011 with a dataset as described in section 4 3 1 37 min α f v f v f min α v f t n τ v f t n τ 2 let 38 d f v f v f d α 0 here v f is defined by eq 30 the result of the calibrated parameter is α 125 64 the value of α does not have a unit because ice thickness and the differential safety distance both are in meters see eq 26 the minus value of α implies that the distance between the icebreaker and the assisted ship is smaller in ice conditions compared to open water and decreased with higher ice thickness this is consistent with the empirical findings of the parameters in icebreaker escort operations by goerlandt et al 2017b 4 3 3 safety speed in safety speed rule of international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs 1972 all vessels shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that they can take proper and effective action to avoid collision in finnish waters in winter navigation conditions vessels are furthermore required to follow appropriate instructions of icebreakers liikennevirasto 2017 goerlandt et al 2017b presented an analysis of ship escort and convoy operations in baltic sea ice conditions and obtained statistics for the ship speed ranges in relation to the ice thickness shown in fig 8 from this work the speed distribution of escort assistance operations for different ice conditions is known where it can be considered that the maximum applied speeds approximately correspond to the safety speed as seen in section 3 4 the factors affecting safety speed include ice conditions and ship type however as this relationship between ice conditions ship type and safety speed are complex and involve significant uncertainty in absence of detailed hull information the safety speed is for the current modeling purposes obtained from the empirical statistics from actual escort operations from the table we select the 0 95 quantile which means that 95 of the escort operation speeds are lower than this value this value is here considered to represent the criterion of safety speed limitation considering the effect of outlier that may lead to unreasonable speed value we use 0 95 quantile in place of maximum value according to table 2 we set the safety speed limitation as 13 knots 5 model validation in this section the proposed ship following model is validated under different ice condition by comparing the model outputs with actual historical ais data the ice data was obtained from the hindcasts performed with the helmi multi category sea ice model introduced in section 3 3 1 in the simulation the actual ice condition data is used for comparing the simulated speeds with the observed speeds from ais the computation environment used herein applies matlab 2015 on a pc server with one intel core i7 4790 3 6 ghz cpu 32 gb ram and the windows 7 operating system three performance measures namely mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean squared error rmse are applied to evaluate the simulation results these metrics are defined as follows hyndman and koehler 2006 39 m a e i 1 n v ˆ i v i n 40 m a p e 1 n i 1 n v ˆ i v i v i 100 41 r m s e i 1 n v ˆ i v i 2 n 1 where n is the number of observations v i is the actual ship speed at time i and v i ˆ is the simulated ship speed at time i two case studies are conducted as part of a validation of the proposed ship following model fig 9 demonstrates the first case which contains 6 sub figures these show the speed of the icebreaker the simulated and observed speed of the escorted ship the simulated and observed distance between icebreaker and the escorted ship and the average thickness of level ice ridged ice and rafted ice in the first case the icebreaker is fennica and the imo of assisted vessel is 9378735 the time period is from 00 09 a m to 1 07 a m on march 12 2011 fig 10 demonstrates the result of the second case with similar information shown in the sub figures as for the first case in the second case the icebreaker is voima and the imo of assisted vessel is 8707783 the time period is from 7 21 a m to 8 58 a m in march 12 2011 table 3 shows the evaluation of simulation speed of following ship by comparing with actual speed from the results shown in table 3 it can be seen that the simulation results fit the observed speed with a mape deviation of around 16 although there exists a deviation the proposed model can be considered to simulate the speed of the assisted vessel under different ice conditions reasonably well this is also clear from a visual observation of figs 9 b and 10 b where the simulated speed profiles of the assisted vessel qualitatively follow the empirically established speed profiles rather well as for the original gipps model for the car following problem gipps 1981 the proposed model in this study and in particular the safety distance formulation is developed by considering a scenario where the leading vessel the icebreaker stops however this does not mean that the model is only applicable for situations where the icebreaker stops in cases where the icebreaker speed is low e g around 4 knots and the distance to the assisted vessel is quite short e g less than 200 m the crew in the escorted ship has to consider the possibility that the leading vessels suddenly stops and keep a sufficient distance to the leading vessel 6 discussion in this paper the escort operation in ice conditions has been studied and a ship following model has been developed to simulate the spatio temporal coupled kinematics of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel whereas in road traffic several such models have been developed the developed model for icebreaker escort operations in ice is to the best of the authors knowledge the first of its kind the basic model structure is presented the necessary parameters are calibrated and a validation is performed showing reasonable results however due to the complexity of the ice conditions and the ship operation it is acknowledged that some factors are modeled based on simplifying assumptions which can affect the accuracy of the model these would benefit from further development to increase the accuracy of the simulation the main simplifying factors include the relative width of the assisted vessel in relation to the width of the icebreaker the ice conditions and their relation to δd and the determination of the safe speed these are elaborated in the following sections another issue concerns validation while the case studies of section 5 indicate that the model provides quite reasonable results capturing the main aspects of the coupled vessel kinematics rather well further validation is needed one option is to evaluate the model performance in more cases however more important is to test the model in its actual intended use environment since the primary reason for the model development is to improve the realism of the ship following behavior in ship simulators an evaluation should be performed of how well the model is actually suited for this purpose it is crucial that the model behavior as calculated by the model appears realistic to users of the ship handling simulator for which an appropriate test program should be developed and executed this is beyond the scope of the current work and is left for future research 6 1 the width of the assisted vessel for the following ship navigating in an ice channel previous work has indicated the importance of the vessel s width relative to the width of the channel which corresponds t to the width of the icebreaker for the resistance encountered by the assisted vessel and its ability to navigate through the channel riska et al 1997 thus the relative beam is taken to be a relation of the ship s beam to the beam of the icebreaker which opens up the ice channel an increase of the assisted ship s relative beam leads to a noticeable increase of ice resistance and accordingly a decrease of the ship s speed in the channel tsoy 1983 there is a proposed relationship for the ship speed in channels broken in ice covers of various thicknesses h as a function of continuous ice of limit thickness h i encountered by ship and sailing speed in open water v 0 as well as of relative breadth b presented in the following analytical way tsoy 1983 42 v i v 0 1 k c h h v 0 2 h i v 0 k n here k c h and k n are parameters calculated from the relative breadth b the equation indicates the relationship between the relative values of the speed of ship s movement in channel the ice thickness and the ship s width however increased resistance due to the increase of the ship s beam can be compensated by increase in power and improvement of hull shape in the currently proposed model this relative width effect on the speed is not included but it could be considered in future research 6 2 safety distance the model proposed in this study is based on the assumption that the safety distance can be divided into two parts the basic safety distance d b which is determined by kinematic characteristics of the ships and the context dependent safety distance d i which relates to the ice conditions see eq 20 the determination of the distance δ d would benefit from further research since the relationship between the distance δ d and the ice condition is relative complex moreover other factors such as the experience of navigators or atmospheric conditions may also have an effect on the safety distance in the currently proposed model to simply the problem the assumption is made that the distance δ d is proportional to the average ice thickness see eq 27 the effect of other factors such as ship type and weather influence are ignored in order to obtain a model with improved accuracy those factors could be investigated in further research and possibly be taken into account in a more comprehensive model from figs 9 c and 10 c it is seen that the simulated and observed distance compare rather well in this work this distance is denoted the safety distance an interesting issue concerns how this distance relates to the minimum safe distance i e the distance below which an assisted vessel cannot avoid a collision with the preceding vessel in winter navigation in the baltic sea this distance is decided during operations based on navigator s experience rosenblad 2007 so no explicit numerical values for this distance are available goerlandt et al 2017b made an empirical analysis of the observed distances in escort operations in different ice conditions but while these distances usually lead to safe operations accidents occur rather frequently in ice conditions goerlandt et al 2017a from which it is plausible to assume that not all observed distances are actually safe the only work known to the authors where the minimum safe distance is explicitly studied and numerical values are provided is the work by zhang et al 2017a however results of this model are not used in this work for two reasons first the model is developed for and using data of navigation in arctic conditions which differ quite significantly from the baltic sea ice conditions second the numerical results of the minimum safe distance model are sensitive to a threshold value for the acceptable collision frequency for which no commonly agreed values exist hence comparison with the results of zhang et al 2017a are considered out of the scope of this article considering the above it is recommended that future research focuses also on the development of approaches to determine numerical values for the minimum safe distance for escort and convoy navigation in baltic sea winter conditions approaches such as the minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 could be considered for this purpose 6 3 safety speed transport canada an organization responsible for transportation policies and programs of canada has established a series of methods to quantify the effect of ice conditions and shipping risk which contains some core contents such as ice type ice multiplier and ice numeral according to these methods every ice type has a numerical value which is dependent on the ice category of the vessel this number is called an ice multiplier im the value of the ice multiplier reflects the level of risk or operational constraint that the particular ice type poses to each category of vessel transport canada 1998 this rationale also lays at the basis of the polar operational limit assessment risk indexing system polaris which is linked to the polar ship certificate included in the international code for ships operating in polar waters polar code imo 2016 see also stoddard et al 2016 for an ice regime the ice numeral in is the sum of the products of the concentration of each ice type and the ice multipliers relating to the type or class of the ship in question 43 i n i 1 n c i i m i where in is ice numeral and ci is the concentration in tenths of ice type i imi is the ice multiplier for ice type i the right hand side of the equation is repeated for as many ice types and each of their respective concentrations which may be present including open water ice numerals can be calculated from ice conditions as a result the polaris method can be used to determine a safety speed based on both the ice numeral which reflects the ice conditions quantitatively and the vessel s ice class which corresponds to the vessel s ability to withstand ice loads in representative ice conditions the finnish swedish ice class rules riska and kämärainen 2011 establish a six ice classes assigned to operating in first year ice in the baltic sea on the basis of requirements for hull structural design engine output and performance in ice however in the baltic sea the analytic relationship between ice condition ship type and safety speed has not been established and the polaris method is not as such intended to be used in this area imo 2016 moreover for the navigational conditions in an escort operation with an icebreaker and an escorted vessel are rather specific in the sense that the overall ice conditions are only indirectly representative of the local ice conditions near the channel broken free by the ice hence also the safety speed derived from ice conditions over larger sea areas as applied in the polaris method likely is not very representative for modeling the kinematics in escort operations therefore the current modeling approach applies the average ice thickness as an approximation of the effect of the ice condition as discussed in section 6 2 in addition a separate constraint related to the safety speed is applied based on empirical analyses from observed escort operations in the baltic sea goerlandt et al 2017b while this is considered a reasonable approximation as it is based on actual operational conditions it is acknowledged that the safety speed constraint is a simplification the fact that it does not account for the possible effects of ship types ship sizes and ice classes may in part justify the deviations of the results of the proposed ship following model when compared with the observed values as found in section 5 an analytical relationship between ship hull ability ice conditions and safety speed therefore would also be valuable for future research to improve the proposed model 6 4 uncertainty analysis and priorities for further research in this article a modeling approach for the coupled kinematic problem of an icebreaker and one escorted vessel is proposed as shown in section 5 the model provides reasonable estimates of the distance between the vessels and of the speed of the assisted vessel nevertheless it has also been stressed during the model development and in the above discussions that several simplifying assumptions have been made given the fact that no previous work has been performed on developing a ship following model for icebreaker escort operations and considering the reasonable accuracy of the results the authors consider the presented model a useful contribution to the literature on maritime traffic simulation nevertheless it is recommended to further validate the model and to improve the model elements which are most affected by uncertainties arising due to simplifications to facilitate this a qualitative uncertainty analysis is performed based on an approach described in goerlandt and reniers 2016 in this approach as shown in table 4 different model elements are identified and a judgment is made on the strength of the evidence for the adopted model simplifications in the approach strong strength of evidence corresponds to cases where there is much empirical data available to develop the model element and where the modeling approach is expected to lead to good predictions on theoretical or experience based grounds weak strength of evidence corresponds to cases where little or no empirical data is available for the model element and where the modeling approach is expected to lead to poor predictions based on theoretical or experience based grounds medium strength of evidence concerns cases in between weak and strong this study attempts to establish a framework of the ship follow up model under ice condition and calibrates the model parameters through the data in the baltic sea which has been verified to approach a certain degree of accuracy based on the qualitative uncertainty analysis it is recommended to prioritize future research on developing a better understanding of the effect of ice conditions on the coupled kinematics and safety distance and on developing better methods to define the safety speed accounting for various influencing factors 7 conclusions in this paper ship escort operations in ice conditions have been studied and a ship following model for the coupled kinematics of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel has been proposed similarities with the car following phenomenon which has been studied extensively in road transportation have been exploited to define the model structure the model is established using the concept of a safety distance between the icebreaker and the assisted vessel accounting for the effect of the ice conditions and for the safety speed constraint parameters in the model are estimated using empirical analyses from escort operations in the baltic sea area based on data from the automatic identification system coupled with data from ice hindcast modeling the developed model simulates the ship following behavior in ice conditions reasonably well according to the case studies taken from empirical data ice conditions are quite complex and involve different ice type categories such as level ice ridged ice and rafted ice moreover various ship types have different ability to navigate in sea ice environments the developed model is the first to model the coupled kinematics of the icebreaker and its assisted vessel and does this reasonably well despite a number of simplifications and assumed relations there are several model aspects which could be studied in more detail to improve the accuracy of the model including the relative width of the assisted vessel the effect of the ice conditions on the differential safety distance and the safety speed finally further validation tests using case studies from historic traffic data and model performance tests in ship simulators would be required before the developed model or a further refined version can be implemented in actual ship simulator environments these issues are however

23099,in northern sea areas such as the baltic sea and the arctic especially in winter conditions the presence of sea ice frequently necessitates icebreaker assistance operations for vessels navigating in these areas icebreaker escort operations are important for ensuring the safety of navigation in these harsh environments while these operations reduce the overall system risk studies have shown that specific navigational risks are associated also with escort operations necessitating appropriate training and operational support for ship crew engaged in these in this paper the icebreaker escort operations are investigated and a ship following model is proposed drawing on similarities with the car following phenomenon this ship following model accounts for the necessity of keeping an appropriate safety distance to avoid collision as well as for the effects of sea ice on the operation its main intended use is for implementation in maritime simulators providing a realistic environment of operational conditions for training ship crews as a first approximation the model accounts for the ice condition by the average ice thickness while the safety speed constraint is relative to the vessel s ability of navigating in ice the model parameters are calibrated using empirical data of icebreaker escort operations case studies are executed showing good agreement between the simulation model and real world operational conditions keywords maritime safety ship following model ship simulator icebreaker escort operation ice conditions 1 introduction maritime

protection faghih roohiet al 2014 sang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a in some areas with high latitudes the cold weather in the winter season causes the sea surface to freeze in the baltic sea area navigation in harsh sea ice environments poses specific challenges to winter navigation and navigational accidents occur relatively more frequently in ice conditions than in open water conditions goerlandt et al 2017a the safety of life at sea convention chapter v solas 1974 contains technical and operational provisions related to the safety of navigation which applies globally this inter alia concerns voyage planning which aims at ensuring sufficient sea room for the vessel s safe passage while anticipating navigational hazards and adverse weather conditions another highly relevant international convention is the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs 1972 which provides rules focusing on the operational navigational actions to ensure navigational safety this includes requirements to proceed with a safe speed accounting for technical capabilities of the vessel traffic density and composition and environmental conditions the colregs also contain rules for vessels in sight of one another to facilitate collision avoidance for vessels operating in arctic waters solas chapter ivx makes mandatory the international code for ships operating in polar waters polar code imo 2017 which contains specific technical and operational requirements for vessels engaged in operations in the arctic in accordance with the provisions of the united nations convention on the law of the sea un general assembly 1982 several states have implemented additional mechanisms to ensure the safety of navigation in their waters due to specific local conditions such as the presence of sea ice in finnish waters in the baltic sea area this especially concerns technical requirements for vessels as stipulated in the ice class regulations trafi 2017 and operational instructions on winter navigation liikennevirasto 2017 the latter include general provisions related to icebreaker assistance traffic restrictions operational requirements for vessels information on ice services and vessel traffic services despite the implementation of the above outlined risk management processes jointly known as the finnish swedish winter navigation system a recent risk analysis indicates that collisions and especially collisions in icebreaker escort and convoy operations have the potential to lead to significant oil spills valdez banda et al 2015 as e g occurred following the runner 4 accident in the gulf of finland in 2006 wang et al 2008 the results of a more detailed risk management model indicate that of several available risk control options improved training is considered one of the most effective methods to reduce the maritime risk valdez banda et al 2016 this was also the conclusion of an interview and questionnaire study by boström and österman 2017 maritime navigation simulators are important tools for ship crews to gain experience with different navigational conditions so developing realistic simulator environments is important to enhance training last et al 2017 ship performance models are essential building blocks in the development of such simulators significant work has been performed to develop models for ship performance in ice conditions most of these are primarily intended for estimating the ice loads ship resistance and or speed in ice breaking mode in independent navigation zhou et al 2016 kuuliala et al 2017 li et al 2018 and are based on first principle engineering approaches data driven models have recently been proposed for ship performance in different operations e g independent navigation in complex dynamic ice conditions in baltic montewka et al 2015 and arctic fu et al 2016 sea environments these models focus on ship independent navigation and are applied for e g ship design su et al 2011 and route planning in ice kotovirta et al 2009 less scientific work has been performed on developing models for real time simulation purposes a notable exception being lubbad and løset 2011 who propose an approach based on the physx modeling environment for tracking the ship ice interaction process focusing specifically on escort and convoy operations tsoy 1983 has developed a mathematical model for the ship dynamics of a vessel in a channel broken by an icebreaker without considering the dynamics or interaction with the icebreaker however to the best of the authors knowledge no models have been developed with the specific purpose of modeling the spatio temporal interaction process of the icebreaker and the escorted vessel the development and implementation of such a model in a maritime simulator would improve the realism of navigational scenarios which could contribute to improved training for navigation in ice conditions in turn reducing the navigational risk according to the results of valdez banda et al 2016 and boström and österman 2017 additionally the purpose of this paper is to develop a ship following model for icebreaker escort operations with possible application in ship bridge simulators the model is established accounting for the safety distance that is mandatory for ship collision avoidance and the safe speed in ice conditions considering the ship s ability to pass through a sea ice environment although the parameters are calibrated to the specific sea ice conditions prevailing in the baltic sea area the proposed modeling approach can also be applied in other ice covered waters the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines research the studied problem and reviews previous work concerning kinematic following model section 3 studies the factors of ship following model in ice conditions and introduces the data used in this study in section 4 the model of ship following in sea ice conditions is established case studies are performed in section 5 as a first step towards model validation section 6 and 7 provide a discussion and concluding remarks 2 background and problem description 2 1 ship escort operations in ice conditions maritime safety in complex ice conditions requires special considerations for instance in the baltic sea area the finnish swedish winter navigation system fswns consists of five elements used for managing the risks of winter navigation these include ship design requirements to ship operation information services traffic restrictions and specific navigational operations valdez banda et al 2015 when vessels are authorized to cross an area covered by sea ice they may depending on the ice conditions and ship specific characteristics require assistance from an icebreaker in icebreaker assistance five practical operations are commonly distinguished rosenblad 2007 escort convoy breaking loose double convoy and towing in an escort operation an icebreaker breaks a channel and a vessel follows the icebreaker at a certain distance the distance which is maintained between the icebreaker and the assisted vessel is in practice based on experience results from empirical work by goerlandt et al 2017b who analyze escort operations based on data from the automatic identification system ais and sea ice hindcast data however show that there is a dependency between this distance and the prevailing ice conditions convoy operations are similar to escorting but with several ships following the icebreaker more details about the practical navigational aspects of ship convoy and escort operations can be found in rosenblad 2007 generally the crew of a vessel assisted in an escort operation is responsible for establishing and maintaining a suitable distance between the assisted vessel and the icebreaker rosenblad 2007 in accordance with the general provisions of the colregs 1972 and observing the general instructions as laid out by liikennevirasto 2017 for economic reasons a relatively high speed is typically maintained during the operation goerlandt et al 2017b from a safety and operational point of view this distance is clearly important as shown by zhang et al 2017a the collision probability increases with a shorted distance between the icebreaker and the escorted vessel however if a longer distance is maintained the movement of the assisted vessel may be obstructed by ice e g by slush ice in the channel especially in compressive ice conditions the opened channel can close again so that with longer distances between the icebreaker and assisted vessel the probability of the ship getting stuck in ice increases riska et al 1997 it is also empirically confirmed by goerlandt et al 2017b that in compressive ice conditions in the baltic sea escorted vessels navigate closer to the icebreaker another important issue in escort operations is the safe speed even though the escorted vessel navigates largely in the channel broken free by the icebreaker the speed needs to be kept in a safe speed range to prevent damage to the hull or hull appendices from ice ice damage is often the result of excessive speed in the ice conditions which occurs in broken ice in low to moderate concentrations enfotec et al 1996 tunik 2000 this is due to the significant increases in ice loads with increased ice thicknesses and ship speeds kotilainen et al 2017 a related issue in the execution of the escort operation is the width of the assisted vessel in relation to the channel width an increase of a ship s beam relative to the channel width leads to a noticeable increase of ice resistance a decrease of the ship s speed in the channel and an increased risk of hull damage due to the speed dependent ice loads riska et al 1997 in some studies such as goerlandt et al 2017b the distance and speed between icebreakers and following vessels in escort and convoy operations have been empirically studied also in other studies e g tsoy 1983 the speed of movement in a channel broken by an icebreaker has been addressed zhang et al 2017a develop a simulation model for estimating the safe distance in escort operations applied to case studies of vessels navigating along the northern sea route this model aims at determining the collision frequency for an escort operation under different ice conditions and following distances acknowledging the previous efforts in analyzing and modeling escort operations there currently is a lack of comprehensive modeling approaches to estimate the combined kinematics of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel in escort operations as mentioned in the introduction such a model can be useful to enhance the realism of ship navigation in ice conditions in ship handling simulators this can contribute to enhanced training and ultimately to reduced ship collision risk in winter navigation conditions valdez banda et al 2016 2 2 review of following model approaches while no models have been developed for combined kinematics of an icebreaker and an escorted vessel in road traffic there is a rich literature on car following models clearly the respective operational contexts are different but the more generic problem of the coupled kinematics of two vehicles engaged in a leader follower pattern has similarities between road traffic and ship escort operations this similarity has also been exploited by he et al 2012 who developed a safety distance model for inland vessels hence in order to develop a modeling approach for ship escort operations it is considered useful to provide a brief overview of the approaches taken to address the car following problem car following has been studied for several decades and a lot of progress has been made in this area the concept of car following was first established in the early 1950s reuschel 1950 and pipes 1953 first analyzed the traffic in the queue from the kinematic point of view pipes assumed that the driver desires to maintain a prescribed safety distance with the preceding vehicle based on the california vehicle code in the 1950s general motors gm laboratories performed much theoretical research greatly advancing the basic research of the car following problem with influence continuing to this day newell 2002 gazis 2002 in recent decades the following model in road traffic has been well developed safety is one of the key factors considered przybyla et al 2015 tang et al 2017 the effects of car following model on intelligent traffic systems are also studied kuang et al 2017 in recent years the modeling approaches have made extensive use of data driven model formulation and parameterization papathanasopoulou and antoniou 2015 more accurate algorithms have been developed for estimating the model parameters based on large amounts of data li et al 2016 a variety of theoretical methods to model car following behavior have been proposed from the perspective of traffic engineering the modeling approaches can be divided into stimulus response model safe distance model psycho physiological model and artificial intelligence model wang and jin 2012 the stimulus response framework siuhi and kaseko 2016 is the most basic follow up behavior modeling approach which expresses the role of the leading vehicle to the following car s driver as a stimulus s t and the driver s perceptual ability as a sensitive coefficient of s e the human reaction r e is expressed as the movement of the followed car as shown in equation 1 1 r e s e s t the safety distance modeling approach is based on the assumption that the driver desires to maintain a safe distance from the leading vehicle and that the driver can have time to react and decelerate to avoid a collision when the preceding vehicle suddenly brakes kometani et al 1959 first proposed a safety distance model which uses the speed of the leading vehicle and the following car to calculate the safe distance as follows 2 x n 1 t x n t α 1 v n 1 2 β 1 v n 2 t t β v n t t b 0 here α 1 β 1 β b 0 are coefficients which are calibrated on the basis of observed car following data whereas x is location and v is speed n indicates the preceding car and n 1 is the following car t means time interval gipps 1981 proposed a new safety distance model considering the vehicle s acceleration constraints and safety distance constraints the model takes into account the influence of many factors in driving behavior and is still widely used spyropoulou 2007 the model suggests that the speed of a vehicle is subject to three constraints first the vehicle speed does not exceed the driver s desired speed v n second the vehicle accelerates rapidly until it approaches the desired speed and then the acceleration is reduced almost to zero if two vehicles are far apart they behave as in the free flow condition i e their kinematics do not influence one another the third condition is taken into account when distances between the vehicles are short and determines the driving behavior of the following vehicle while the preceding vehicle decelerates it is assumed that the following vehicle will adjust its velocity so as to keep a safe distance from the preceding vehicle the basic expression of the model is 3 v n t t a n t a n 2 t t 2 a n t 2 δ x n t l n 1 v n t t v n 1 t 2 a ˆ t δ x n t is the distance between the nth car and the preceding vehicle a ˆ t is the acceleration of the leading vehicle estimated by the following vehicle it can be simply assumed that the value is equal to the acceleration of the leading vehicle a n 1 t the variable v is speed and parameter l is

vehicle wiedemann 1974 proposed a psycho physiological vehicle following model which has become the core entity of the widely used micro traffic simulation software vissim vissim 2017 the basic idea of the model is that once the distance between the vehicles is considered to be less than the psychological safety distance the driver of the following car will start to slow down as the driver cannot accurately judge the speed of the preceding vehicle the speed of the following car will be lower than the speed of the preceding vehicle during a short time interval this period lasts until the distance between the two cars approaches another psychological safety distance when the driver of the following car will begin to speed up again this forms a cycle of acceleration deceleration and re acceleration many of the theoretical methods of artificial intelligence can be applied to a number of fields including vehicle following behavior modeling the artificial intelligence method can effectively describe driving behavior characteristics that are difficult to express with precise mathematical models kikuchi and chakroborty 1992 first proposed a follow up model based on fuzzy logic with the development of artificial neural network ann in the field of transportation applications dougherty 1995 the ann driving behavior modeling has gradually developed kehtarnavaz et al 1998 for example scholars have proposed car following models based on bp back propagation neural networks and based on radial basis function neural network jia et al 2001 xu et al 2007 zhou et al 2009 3 ship following in ice condition selection of modeling approach and evidence 3 1 model aims and selection of modeling approach the model for ship following in ice conditions is primarily intended for use in ship bridge simulators improved training in ice navigation has been identified as an effective and realistic option to reduce the risks of winter navigation valdez banda et al 2016 boström and österman 2017 ship escort and convoy operations have been found to be among the operations involving the most accidents goerlandt et al 2017a these operations also representing the highest risks to environmental pollution valdez banda et al 2016 hence these are good candidates for which to prioritize the realism in bridge simulator centers in particular in regards the spatio temporal kinematics between the vessels in different ice conditions a ship following model may also have a use for maritime traffic system simulation purposes advanced traffic simulation models could shed light on the required number of icebreakers for ensuring smooth cargo flows lindeberg et al 2015 and provide insights into the effect of rule changes in a waterway qu and meng 2012 traffic simulation models also have a role in analyzing maritime transportation risk van dorp and merrick 2011 and in investigating the effect of design of operational changes to ship emissions zhang et al 2017b in the current modeling approach focus is exclusively on ship escort operations i e only the kinematics between the icebreaker and one following ship are considered extending the approach to convoy operations is possible in principle but is outside the current scope for the escort operations the speed and distance of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel are subject to several constraints as seen in section 2 1 first the assisted vessel has to be keep a reasonable distance with icebreaker on the one hand the distance between the ships should be enough to prevent collision when the leading ship suddenly stops on the other hand the distance should not be too large to prevent the assisted vessel being hampered by ice in the channel second while the speed should be as high as possible for economic reasons the speed should be below the safe speed to prevent ice induced hull damages of the modeling approaches introduced in section 2 2 the approach by gipps 1981 which is based on the safety distance is considered suitable as a basis for developing a ship following model under ice condition as the safety of collision avoidance is a major concern however unlike the car following problem the icebreaker needs to take the ice going capability of the assisted ship into consideration because different ship design ice classes and different ice conditions correspond to different levels of safety concern in practice such operational considerations by the icebreaker crew lead to instructions to assisted vessels in accordance to the provisions of liikennevirasto 2017 the proposed modeling approach combines an analytical model describing the coupled kinematics of an icebreaker and an escorted vessel where environmental conditions and vessel capabilities are calibrated using empirical data in the following sections the data and information sources used in the definition of the model are introduced in section 3 2 data concerning escort operations from combined ship traffic and ice information sources are described section 3 3 addresses how the effect of the ice type is accounted for while section 3 4 focuses on the safety speed 3 2 data of escort operations in ice condition for obtaining insights in the kinematics of escort operations and for establishing data for calibrating model parameters and validation a series of videos has been constructed using data from the automatic identification system ais these videos show the icebreaker operations dynamically while giving insight in the overall traffic situation information about ice conditions based on hindcast data obtained from the helmi multi category sea ice model described in haapala et al 2005 is coupled to the ship movement data as well in this study data is used from the baltic sea in the period of feb 19 2011 to mar 18 2011 fig 1 shows a screenshot of a video which shows the ais and sea ice data of an icebreaker operation the various elements of the video are outlined below the method of constructing and analyzing these kinds of videos as well as the underlying data sources is explained in detail in goerlandt et al 2017b a icebreaker central in a 2 nm inspection domain the icebreaker

ice condition on ship following this study focuses on ship following model under ice condition therefore it is necessary to understand and quantify the ice condition in the model 3 3 1 ice category sea ice is a complex natural phenomenon showing different forms and types sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes as they are driven against each other typical resulting ice types can be classified as rafted ice when ice sheets slide under one another or ridged ice in which a line of broken ice is forced downward known as the keel and upward known as the sail level ice is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation and is therefore relatively flat the ice data used in this study was obtained from the hindcasts performed with the helmi multi category sea ice model the model is described in detail in haapala et al 2005 and mårtensson et al 2012 in order to analyze ship following behavior the ice related parameters are retrieved from helmi model level ice concentration level ice thickness ridged ice concentration ridged ice thickness rafted ice concentration rafted ice thickness direction of ice compression ice compression magnitude ice drift velocity direction of wind wind speed air temperature and sea water temperature the helmi model can resolve the parameters of mean ice velocity internal ice stress ice concentration and ice thickness thickness is classified as seven categories five level ice categories rafted ice and ridged ice the following equations govern the development of the non deformed ice categories haapala et al 2005 4 a u t u a u ψ u θ a u 5 h u t u h u ω u θ h u where a u is the concentration of a given non deformed ice category the ice velocity vector is denoted with u ψ u stands for the change of ice concentration due to deformation θ a u denotes thermodynamical changes h u is the mean thickness of non deformed ice per unit area ω u is the change of concentration of non deformed ice and θ h u is thermos dynamical change floe thickness h is obtained since h h a haapala et al 2005 the evaluation of the deformed ice categories applies following equations haapala et al 2005 6 a d t u a d ψ d θ a d 7 h d t u h d ω d θ h d where ψ d and ω d are the redistribution terms of deformed ice which describe the growth in concentration and mass of deformed ice due to process of ridging and rafting 3 3 2 quantification of ice condition the safety degree of ship sailing in an ice area is the result of a combination of ice and ship conditions involving amongst other ice type ice thickness ship hull structure engine ability and sailing speed the finnish swedish ice class rules establish six ice classes assigned to vessels operating in first year ice in the baltic sea these ice classes relate to requirements for hull structural design engine output and performance in ice the six ice classes are denoted ia super ia ib ic ii and iii currently an accurate analytic relationship between the effect of ice conditions on the coupled vessel kinematics in focus in the ship following problem has not yet been established therefore in this study the average ice thickness is used to represent the ice condition assuming that the effect on the coupled vessel kinematics is linearly proportional to the average ice thickness to derive the average ice thickness information from the helmi model outlined in section 3 3 1 is used the average ice thickness h a v e can be calculated as follows 8 h a v e i 1 n h i i 1 n a i where h i i 1 2 7 indicates the thickness of five level ice categories rafted ice and ridged ice and a i i 1 2 7 indicates the concentration of these ice categories 3 4 safety speed safety of ships operating in ice infested waters depends on operational aspects generally the ice class is the primary criterion characterizing a ship s operational limits and structural strength stoddard et al 2016 while it is known that loads on hull structures due to ice impacts are inherently speed dependent tunik 2000 kotilainen et al 2017 there currently is no accurate quantitative relationship between the ice classes operational speeds and ice impact loads in different ice conditions in principle an assessment of safety and operational limits for an individual ship can be obtained from a safe speed analysis here safe speed is the minimal value of all maximum speeds satisfying a set of expressions equating the speed dependent ice loads due to possible ship ice impacts and the load bearing capacity of the affected structures considered for every ice loaded structural member tunik 2000 mathematically this can be expressed as 9 v s a f e min v m a x j p j v p j σ α ε α where p j v is the speed dependent ice impact load on the j t h structural member p j σ α ε α is the load bearing capacity of the j t h structural member with respect to allowable criteria for stress strain σ α ε α state v m a x j is the maximum ship speed satisfying conditions for the j t h structural member and v is the ship speed when the ice conditions are sufficiently severe for a ship to proceed her speed is low and impact loads are comparatively low as well when a ship encounters moderate or low ice resistance and is sailing relatively fast in channels broken by an icebreaker as well as in leads polynyas or thin ice with immediately adjacent heavy ice features she can hit these heavy ice features resulting in high impact loads and damages this is the scenario for many speed related damages jalonen et al 2005 this latter scenario is the basic scenario applicable to the safe speed concept for a vessel following an icebreaker in a channel in such scenarios the safe speeds are not related directly to ice thickness but rather to the probabilities of encountering strong and massive ice features the safe speeds may differ considerably for different ship types and ice classes for example icebreakers designed primarily for ice management and high manoeuvrability are intended to spend a major part of their operational life in severe ice conditions will have different safe speeds compared to icebreaking vessels whose primary missions do not necessarily include sailing in ice but which are capable of independent navigation in severe ice conditions ships of low ice classes capable of operating in broken ice again will have different safe speeds typical values of safe speeds may vary from 2 to 6 knots when elastic criteria are applied for the structural response to ice impact loads when plastic criteria are adopted safe speeds range from 3 to about 12 knots with upper values for large ships and lighter ice conditions tunik 2000 4 ship following in ice condition modelling 4 1 ship following model basic concepts in modeling the ship following behavior in escort operations a key aspect is the safety distance i e the distance between the assisted vessel and the icebreaker as discussed above this distance should be large enough to prevent collisions from occurring but also be large enough so the following vessel is not adversely affected by the presence of ice in the broken channel or by closure of the ice channel due to compression caused by sea ice dynamics in the field of road transportation research the model by gipps 1981 is based on a similar constraint of safety distance this distance accounts for the influence of many factors in driving behavior compared to the original model by gipps the situation in escort operations in ice navigation is more complex which is mainly due to the speed limits necessary for minimizing the risk of ice damages to the ship hull on the one hand the assisted vessel needs to adjust its speed according to the speed of the icebreaker i e accelerating or decelerating to maintain a safe distance on the other hand the ship speed is subject to the constraints of the safety speed according to the ice condition and the hull capacity as outlined in section 3 4 hence due to the different capacity through the ice channel the icebreaker also needs to consider the ice going capability of the assisted ship and adjust its operating speed the driving speed proactively riska et al 1997 based on the previous discussion the following behavior of the following ship is mainly affected by two factors the safety distance which in turn depends on the speed of the leading ship and the ice conditions and the safety speed which depends on the ice conditions and ship design also the relative width between icebreaker and the assisted vessel has a certain influence on the difficulty of maintaining a steady speed in case the assisted ship cannot keep up with the icebreaker the icebreaker may reduce its speed as typical channel ice conditions are quite complex and can vary even over relatively short distances li et al 2018 there is some variation in the relationship between the ice conditions and the ship speed for the icebreaker and the assisted vessel therefore the exact determination of a safety distance involves some uncertainty zhang et al 2017a for the current modeling purposes the safety distance is divided into two parts the basic safety distance d b which is determined by the kinematic characteristics of the ships and the adjustable safety distance d i which is determined by the ice conditions with a positive or negative value depending on the traffic situation and ice condition mathematically this is written as 10 d d b d i considering the ability of the assisted vessel to cross a given sea ice environment there is another speed constraint stemming from the safe speed in ice conditions see section 3 4 mathematically this constraint is written 11 s s s a f e fig 3 illustrates how the safety distance is considered in the ship following model which closely relates to hoe the escorted ship and icebreaker maintain a safe distance fig 3 explains the following behavior from two aspects on the one hand the following ship needs follow the icebreaker within a safe distance via acceleration or deceleration on the other hand the icebreaker needs to keep the escorted ship within the safety speed the development of a following model for escort operations in ice conditions consists of three steps first the model structure is established which is elaborated in section 4 2 then the parameters in the model are calibrated which is presented in section 4 3 finally the model is validated i e the model performance is evaluated in light of the intended model use this is performed in the case study shown in section 5 4 2 ship following model mathematical formulation based on the original formulation of the vehicle following model by gipps 1981 and the discussion on the influencing factors for the ship following model in escort operations in sea ice conditions see section 3 the mathematical structure of the ship following model is formulated in the following sections the model is developed in steps to highlight the different aspects considered in the model in section 4 2 1 the initial model is presented which accounts only for the vessel kinematics and is very similar to the original model by gipps 1981 in section 4 2 2 the model is extended to account for the effect of ice conditions to the safety distance in section 4 2 3 the issue of the safety speed of the vessel operating in ice conditions is considered 4 2 1 initial model formulation the structural form of the ship following model is derived from the constraints given by the vessel kinematic characteristics considering the scenario with an icebreaker and one assisted vessel in an escort operation the icebreaker may stop for some reason like being stuck by ridged ice zhang et al 2017a then the following vessel has to decrease speed quickly and stop to avoid collision as demonstrated in fig 4 to avoid such a collision sufficient distance d between the icebreaker and the following ship is needed considering the constraint of safety distance similar to the model by gipps 1981 we can write 12 d t n τ x p t n τ x f t n τ l p v f t τ v f 2 t 2 a f v p 2 t 2 a p here the parameters x p v p a p are the location speed and deceleration of the leading preceding ship respectively and x f v f a f are the location speed and deceleration of the escorted following ship t n is the start time of deceleration and τ is time interval of deceleration d is the safety distance between two vessels the variable l is the length of vessels the subscript p means preceding and the subscript f means following to avoid a collision it is required that d t n τ 0 i e 13 x p t n τ l p x f t n τ considering the kinematics of vessels motion and the driver s reaction 14 x p t n τ x p t n v p t n 2 2 a p 15 x f t n τ x f t n τ v f t n v f t n τ 2 v f t n τ θ v f t n τ 2 2 a f here θ is the reaction time which causes lag of the following ship to accelerate decelerate after the preceding vessel increases or decreases its speed then we obtain 16 x p t n v p t n 2 2 a p l p x f t n τ v f t n v f t n τ 2 v f t n τ θ v f t n τ 2 2 a f this equals 17 v f t n τ 2 2 a f v f t n τ τ 2 θ x p t n x f t n l p v f t n τ 2 v p t n 2 2 a p 0 solving inequality 17 then results in 18 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p 4 2 2 updated model formulation including effect of ice conditions the model in section 4 2 1 is derived without consideration of the effect of ice on the safety distance however an analysis by goerlandt et al 2017b clearly shows that ice conditions significantly influence the distance between the assisted vessel and the icebreaker higher ice thickness correspond to shorter distances hence for a ship navigating in sea ice conditions it is reasonable to model the following distance as a function of the safety distance in open water conditions and the ice conditions defining 19 δ d d s a f e i c e d s a f e then the model 12 is changed as follows 20 d s a f e x p t n τ x f t n τ l p δ d to avoid collision it is required that d s a f e 0 i e 21 x p t n τ l p δ d x f t n τ then eq 16 is updated as follows 22 x p t n v p t n 2 2 a p l p δ d x f t n τ v f t n v f t n τ 2 v f t n τ θ v f t n τ 2 2 a f this can be re written as 23 v f t n τ 2 2 a f v f t n τ τ 2 θ x p t n x f t n l p δ d v f t n τ 2 v p t n 2 2 a p 0 from this the expression of the speed of the following vessel can be deduced 24 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p δ d τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p the relationship between δ d and the ice conditions is relatively complex possibly depending on specific local conditions in this study to simply the problem it is assumed that δ d is linearly proportional to the ice condition as follows 25 δ d α i c e c o n d i t i o n β where α and β are coefficients which need to be calibrated on the basis of collected data it is further assumed that the ice condition can be adequately represented by the average ice thickness as defined by eq 8 considering based on the definition of eq 19 that δ d 0 in open water conditions i e without ice presence the coefficient β should be zero then eq 25 simplifies to 26 δ d α h a v e therefore eq 24 becomes 27 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p α h a v e τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p 4 2 3 final model formulation including safety speed constraint based on the discussion about safety speed in section 3 4 a ship navigating in sea ice environments has to consider the structural strength of ship hull and keep its speed in a reasonable range for safety reasons the mean safety speed can be estimated based on an experienced equation after a term of ice decision numeral that represents the effect of ice condition and ship structure condition has been calculated enfotec et al 1996 it is 28 v s a f e f i c e d e c i s i o n n u m e r a l then the speed constraint can be formulated as 29 v v s a f e v s a f e v s a f e δ v here δ v is a range determined by specific conditions in this study to simplify the problem this factor is taken as zero consequently the final model including the safety speed constraint is written as 30 v f t n τ a f τ 2 θ a f 2 τ 2 θ 2 a f 2 x p t n x f t n l p α h a v e τ v f t n v p 2 t n a p v f v s a f e where the combinated item α h a v e reflects the effect of ice condition that is demonstrated in fig 2 and the limitation of v s a f e represents the operation concern of safety speed shown in fig 3 4 3 coefficient calibration in this section the coefficients in the model of eq 28 are calibrated the reaction time θ is considered in section 4 3 1 the ice condition parameter α in section 4 3 2 the safety speed is considered in section 4 3 3 4 3 1 reaction time the kinematics of a ship are different than those of a vehicle when braking with a car it will decelerate almost immediately in contrast a ship often decelerates after a short delay therefore the reaction time of a car is nearly exactly the reaction time of driver however the reaction time of a ship includes the reaction time of both crew and the ship which is reflected in the lag of speed change of the ship for assessing the reaction time correlation analysis is an effective method that can show the lag between two analyzed time series zhang et al 2016b since the proposed model of eq 30 contains reaction time θ correlation analysis of speed and acceleration is conduction to calibrate the reaction time defining x t and y t as samples of the stationary random process x k t y k t the cross correlation function r x y τ is defined as 31 r x y τ e x t y t τ lim t 1 t 0 t x t y t τ d t the coefficient of cross correlation is 32 ρ x y τ lim t 1 t 0 t x t y t τ d t μ x μ y σ x σ y r x y τ μ x μ y σ x σ y first the correlation of the speeds of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel is analyzed the data taken is from icebreaker escort service in march 1 2011 the icebreaker is fennica with international maritime organization imo number 9043615 whereas the imo number of the assisted vessel is 9551923 many following scenarios samples are analyzed in this stage as elaborated below a typical example is shown in fig 6 which occurs around 14 50pm march 1 2011 in the following figures a time unit of 10 s is used to keep correspondence with the original data fig 6 shows cross correlation analysis of speed time series in fig 5 the term ccf in fig 6 means cross correlation function which is calculated using equation 32 from the range of peak value of cross correlation analysis where ccf 0 5 it is seen that there exists a lag in range of 50 110 s concerning the time when the assisted ship changes speed to match the change in icebreaker speed with an average lag of around 80 s the lag in fig 6 corresponds to the elapsed time interval between the time of a speed change by the icebreaker and the ensuing speed change by the escorted vessel in order to determine the lag of speed between icebreakers and assisted vessels more generally more cross correlation analyses are conducted for different escort following scenarios a sample of escort scenarios observed in the period feb 19 2011 to mar 18 2011 recorded based on a video analysis described in goerlandt et al 2017b are taken as a basis for this analysis statistics are made concerning the average lag of different icebreakers with results shown in table 1 and fig 7 the icebreakers include fennica and voima imo 5383158 and imo of assisted vessels are 9342152 9388376 9190315 8707783 and 8131922 from fig 7 it is further taken that the average lag can be modeled as a gaussian distribution x n μ σ 2 with μ 84 45 seconds and σ 35 78 seconds this value is validated using hypothesis testing applied with data sampling from icebreaker voima and its assisted ship hypotheses h 0 μ μ 0 h 1 μ μ 0 suppose statistical test 33 u x μ 0 σ n here μ 0 is mean value and σ is variance n is the number of samples and x is average of the samples the hypothesis rejection domain d is 34 d u u α 2 when confidence probability α 0 05 the hypothesis rejection domain becomes cook and lawless 2007 35 d u 1 645 from the sampling data of icebreaker voima it is found that x 68 which corresponds to u x 1 05 because x d therefore the hypothesis h 0 cannot be rejected from the validation result the gaussian distribution is supported and the estimation of parameter θ is 84 45 s the variance of parameter θ is around 36 s which may be caused e g by differences in the human performance in terms of decision making and reaction time as well as by differences in the response of the propulsion system 4 3 2 ice condition parameter the parameter calibration of the effect of ice conditions in the following model can be transformed into as a problem for solving the optimal solution of nonlinear programming where the objective function is set to approach the smallest difference between the observed data and the simulated data from the model in general the independent variables are the parameters of the model and the constraint is the physical range of each parameter it can be expressed as 36 min f o b j e c t i v e f v x a i c e h i v x a i c e 0 i 1 2 n h g j v x a i c e 0 j 1 2 n g here f is the objective function which represents a functional relationship of speed v position x and acceleration a and ice condition ice which has been mathematically described in the previous sections the variable h i is a linear constraint whereas g j is a nonlinear constraint n h and n g are the number of linear and nonlinear constraints to solve the optimization problem the least squares method can be used which is well known harter 1975 based on eq 30 the optimization goal is minimum of difference between simulated speed and observed speed then the most suitable ice condition parameter contained in the model is expected to be achieved from eq 38 the data is taken from icebreaker escort operations across different icebreakers in difference ice conditions from feb 19 2011 to mar 18 2011 march 2011 with a dataset as described in section 4 3 1 37 min α f v f v f min α v f t n τ v f t n τ 2 let 38 d f v f v f d α 0 here v f is defined by eq 30 the result of the calibrated parameter is α 125 64 the value of α does not have a unit because ice thickness and the differential safety distance both are in meters see eq 26 the minus value of α implies that the distance between the icebreaker and the assisted ship is smaller in ice conditions compared to open water and decreased with higher ice thickness this is consistent with the empirical findings of the parameters in icebreaker escort operations by goerlandt et al 2017b 4 3 3 safety speed in safety speed rule of international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs 1972 all vessels shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that they can take proper and effective action to avoid collision in finnish waters in winter navigation conditions vessels are furthermore required to follow appropriate instructions of icebreakers liikennevirasto 2017 goerlandt et al 2017b presented an analysis of ship escort and convoy operations in baltic sea ice conditions and obtained statistics for the ship speed ranges in relation to the ice thickness shown in fig 8 from this work the speed distribution of escort assistance operations for different ice conditions is known where it can be considered that the maximum applied speeds approximately correspond to the safety speed as seen in section 3 4 the factors affecting safety speed include ice conditions and ship type however as this relationship between ice conditions ship type and safety speed are complex and involve significant uncertainty in absence of detailed hull information the safety speed is for the current modeling purposes obtained from the empirical statistics from actual escort operations from the table we select the 0 95 quantile which means that 95 of the escort operation speeds are lower than this value this value is here considered to represent the criterion of safety speed limitation considering the effect of outlier that may lead to unreasonable speed value we use 0 95 quantile in place of maximum value according to table 2 we set the safety speed limitation as 13 knots 5 model validation in this section the proposed ship following model is validated under different ice condition by comparing the model outputs with actual historical ais data the ice data was obtained from the hindcasts performed with the helmi multi category sea ice model introduced in section 3 3 1 in the simulation the actual ice condition data is used for comparing the simulated speeds with the observed speeds from ais the computation environment used herein applies matlab 2015 on a pc server with one intel core i7 4790 3 6 ghz cpu 32 gb ram and the windows 7 operating system three performance measures namely mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean squared error rmse are applied to evaluate the simulation results these metrics are defined as follows hyndman and koehler 2006 39 m a e i 1 n v ˆ i v i n 40 m a p e 1 n i 1 n v ˆ i v i v i 100 41 r m s e i 1 n v ˆ i v i 2 n 1 where n is the number of observations v i is the actual ship speed at time i and v i ˆ is the simulated ship speed at time i two case studies are conducted as part of a validation of the proposed ship following model fig 9 demonstrates the first case which contains 6 sub figures these show the speed of the icebreaker the simulated and observed speed of the escorted ship the simulated and observed distance between icebreaker and the escorted ship and the average thickness of level ice ridged ice and rafted ice in the first case the icebreaker is fennica and the imo of assisted vessel is 9378735 the time period is from 00 09 a m to 1 07 a m on march 12 2011 fig 10 demonstrates the result of the second case with similar information shown in the sub figures as for the first case in the second case the icebreaker is voima and the imo of assisted vessel is 8707783 the time period is from 7 21 a m to 8 58 a m in march 12 2011 table 3 shows the evaluation of simulation speed of following ship by comparing with actual speed from the results shown in table 3 it can be seen that the simulation results fit the observed speed with a mape deviation of around 16 although there exists a deviation the proposed model can be considered to simulate the speed of the assisted vessel under different ice conditions reasonably well this is also clear from a visual observation of figs 9 b and 10 b where the simulated speed profiles of the assisted vessel qualitatively follow the empirically established speed profiles rather well as for the original gipps model for the car following problem gipps 1981 the proposed model in this study and in particular the safety distance formulation is developed by considering a scenario where the leading vessel the icebreaker stops however this does not mean that the model is only applicable for situations where the icebreaker stops in cases where the icebreaker speed is low e g around 4 knots and the distance to the assisted vessel is quite short e g less than 200 m the crew in the escorted ship has to consider the possibility that the leading vessels suddenly stops and keep a sufficient distance to the leading vessel 6 discussion in this paper the escort operation in ice conditions has been studied and a ship following model has been developed to simulate the spatio temporal coupled kinematics of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel whereas in road traffic several such models have been developed the developed model for icebreaker escort operations in ice is to the best of the authors knowledge the first of its kind the basic model structure is presented the necessary parameters are calibrated and a validation is performed showing reasonable results however due to the complexity of the ice conditions and the ship operation it is acknowledged that some factors are modeled based on simplifying assumptions which can affect the accuracy of the model these would benefit from further development to increase the accuracy of the simulation the main simplifying factors include the relative width of the assisted vessel in relation to the width of the icebreaker the ice conditions and their relation to δd and the determination of the safe speed these are elaborated in the following sections another issue concerns validation while the case studies of section 5 indicate that the model provides quite reasonable results capturing the main aspects of the coupled vessel kinematics rather well further validation is needed one option is to evaluate the model performance in more cases however more important is to test the model in its actual intended use environment since the primary reason for the model development is to improve the realism of the ship following behavior in ship simulators an evaluation should be performed of how well the model is actually suited for this purpose it is crucial that the model behavior as calculated by the model appears realistic to users of the ship handling simulator for which an appropriate test program should be developed and executed this is beyond the scope of the current work and is left for future research 6 1 the width of the assisted vessel for the following ship navigating in an ice channel previous work has indicated the importance of the vessel s width relative to the width of the channel which corresponds t to the width of the icebreaker for the resistance encountered by the assisted vessel and its ability to navigate through the channel riska et al 1997 thus the relative beam is taken to be a relation of the ship s beam to the beam of the icebreaker which opens up the ice channel an increase of the assisted ship s relative beam leads to a noticeable increase of ice resistance and accordingly a decrease of the ship s speed in the channel tsoy 1983 there is a proposed relationship for the ship speed in channels broken in ice covers of various thicknesses h as a function of continuous ice of limit thickness h i encountered by ship and sailing speed in open water v 0 as well as of relative breadth b presented in the following analytical way tsoy 1983 42 v i v 0 1 k c h h v 0 2 h i v 0 k n here k c h and k n are parameters calculated from the relative breadth b the equation indicates the relationship between the relative values of the speed of ship s movement in channel the ice thickness and the ship s width however increased resistance due to the increase of the ship s beam can be compensated by increase in power and improvement of hull shape in the currently proposed model this relative width effect on the speed is not included but it could be considered in future research 6 2 safety distance the model proposed in this study is based on the assumption that the safety distance can be divided into two parts the basic safety distance d b which is determined by kinematic characteristics of the ships and the context dependent safety distance d i which relates to the ice conditions see eq 20 the determination of the distance δ d would benefit from further research since the relationship between the distance δ d and the ice condition is relative complex moreover other factors such as the experience of navigators or atmospheric conditions may also have an effect on the safety distance in the currently proposed model to simply the problem the assumption is made that the distance δ d is proportional to the average ice thickness see eq 27 the effect of other factors such as ship type and weather influence are ignored in order to obtain a model with improved accuracy those factors could be investigated in further research and possibly be taken into account in a more comprehensive model from figs 9 c and 10 c it is seen that the simulated and observed distance compare rather well in this work this distance is denoted the safety distance an interesting issue concerns how this distance relates to the minimum safe distance i e the distance below which an assisted vessel cannot avoid a collision with the preceding vessel in winter navigation in the baltic sea this distance is decided during operations based on navigator s experience rosenblad 2007 so no explicit numerical values for this distance are available goerlandt et al 2017b made an empirical analysis of the observed distances in escort operations in different ice conditions but while these distances usually lead to safe operations accidents occur rather frequently in ice conditions goerlandt et al 2017a from which it is plausible to assume that not all observed distances are actually safe the only work known to the authors where the minimum safe distance is explicitly studied and numerical values are provided is the work by zhang et al 2017a however results of this model are not used in this work for two reasons first the model is developed for and using data of navigation in arctic conditions which differ quite significantly from the baltic sea ice conditions second the numerical results of the minimum safe distance model are sensitive to a threshold value for the acceptable collision frequency for which no commonly agreed values exist hence comparison with the results of zhang et al 2017a are considered out of the scope of this article considering the above it is recommended that future research focuses also on the development of approaches to determine numerical values for the minimum safe distance for escort and convoy navigation in baltic sea winter conditions approaches such as the minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 could be considered for this purpose 6 3 safety speed transport canada an organization responsible for transportation policies and programs of canada has established a series of methods to quantify the effect of ice conditions and shipping risk which contains some core contents such as ice type ice multiplier and ice numeral according to these methods every ice type has a numerical value which is dependent on the ice category of the vessel this number is called an ice multiplier im the value of the ice multiplier reflects the level of risk or operational constraint that the particular ice type poses to each category of vessel transport canada 1998 this rationale also lays at the basis of the polar operational limit assessment risk indexing system polaris which is linked to the polar ship certificate included in the international code for ships operating in polar waters polar code imo 2016 see also stoddard et al 2016 for an ice regime the ice numeral in is the sum of the products of the concentration of each ice type and the ice multipliers relating to the type or class of the ship in question 43 i n i 1 n c i i m i where in is ice numeral and ci is the concentration in tenths of ice type i imi is the ice multiplier for ice type i the right hand side of the equation is repeated for as many ice types and each of their respective concentrations which may be present including open water ice numerals can be calculated from ice conditions as a result the polaris method can be used to determine a safety speed based on both the ice numeral which reflects the ice conditions quantitatively and the vessel s ice class which corresponds to the vessel s ability to withstand ice loads in representative ice conditions the finnish swedish ice class rules riska and kämärainen 2011 establish a six ice classes assigned to operating in first year ice in the baltic sea on the basis of requirements for hull structural design engine output and performance in ice however in the baltic sea the analytic relationship between ice condition ship type and safety speed has not been established and the polaris method is not as such intended to be used in this area imo 2016 moreover for the navigational conditions in an escort operation with an icebreaker and an escorted vessel are rather specific in the sense that the overall ice conditions are only indirectly representative of the local ice conditions near the channel broken free by the ice hence also the safety speed derived from ice conditions over larger sea areas as applied in the polaris method likely is not very representative for modeling the kinematics in escort operations therefore the current modeling approach applies the average ice thickness as an approximation of the effect of the ice condition as discussed in section 6 2 in addition a separate constraint related to the safety speed is applied based on empirical analyses from observed escort operations in the baltic sea goerlandt et al 2017b while this is considered a reasonable approximation as it is based on actual operational conditions it is acknowledged that the safety speed constraint is a simplification the fact that it does not account for the possible effects of ship types ship sizes and ice classes may in part justify the deviations of the results of the proposed ship following model when compared with the observed values as found in section 5 an analytical relationship between ship hull ability ice conditions and safety speed therefore would also be valuable for future research to improve the proposed model 6 4 uncertainty analysis and priorities for further research in this article a modeling approach for the coupled kinematic problem of an icebreaker and one escorted vessel is proposed as shown in section 5 the model provides reasonable estimates of the distance between the vessels and of the speed of the assisted vessel nevertheless it has also been stressed during the model development and in the above discussions that several simplifying assumptions have been made given the fact that no previous work has been performed on developing a ship following model for icebreaker escort operations and considering the reasonable accuracy of the results the authors consider the presented model a useful contribution to the literature on maritime traffic simulation nevertheless it is recommended to further validate the model and to improve the model elements which are most affected by uncertainties arising due to simplifications to facilitate this a qualitative uncertainty analysis is performed based on an approach described in goerlandt and reniers 2016 in this approach as shown in table 4 different model elements are identified and a judgment is made on the strength of the evidence for the adopted model simplifications in the approach strong strength of evidence corresponds to cases where there is much empirical data available to develop the model element and where the modeling approach is expected to lead to good predictions on theoretical or experience based grounds weak strength of evidence corresponds to cases where little or no empirical data is available for the model element and where the modeling approach is expected to lead to poor predictions based on theoretical or experience based grounds medium strength of evidence concerns cases in between weak and strong this study attempts to establish a framework of the ship follow up model under ice condition and calibrates the model parameters through the data in the baltic sea which has been verified to approach a certain degree of accuracy based on the qualitative uncertainty analysis it is recommended to prioritize future research on developing a better understanding of the effect of ice conditions on the coupled kinematics and safety distance and on developing better methods to define the safety speed accounting for various influencing factors 7 conclusions in this paper ship escort operations in ice conditions have been studied and a ship following model for the coupled kinematics of the icebreaker and the assisted vessel has been proposed similarities with the car following phenomenon which has been studied extensively in road transportation have been exploited to define the model structure the model is established using the concept of a safety distance between the icebreaker and the assisted vessel accounting for the effect of the ice conditions and for the safety speed constraint parameters in the model are estimated using empirical analyses from escort operations in the baltic sea area based on data from the automatic identification system coupled with data from ice hindcast modeling the developed model simulates the ship following behavior in ice conditions reasonably well according to the case studies taken from empirical data ice conditions are quite complex and involve different ice type categories such as level ice ridged ice and rafted ice moreover various ship types have different ability to navigate in sea ice environments the developed model is the first to model the coupled kinematics of the icebreaker and its assisted vessel and does this reasonably well despite a number of simplifications and assumed relations there are several model aspects which could be studied in more detail to improve the accuracy of the model including the relative width of the assisted vessel the effect of the ice conditions on the differential safety distance and the safety speed finally further validation tests using case studies from historic traffic data and model performance tests in ship simulators would be required before the developed model or a further refined version can be implemented in actual ship simulator environments these issues are however
