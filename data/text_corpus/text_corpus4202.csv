considering the main parameters that influence ice loads a grey relational analysis was performed to determine the input variables of the parametric model of extremes the parametric statistics can aid in the development of an early warning system for detecting ice loads keywords ice loads load identification ls svm full scale measurement navigation in the arctic 1 introduction an ice load monitoring system is required for the safe operation of a mammoth tanker an lng carrier and a bulk carrier in the polar regions throughout the year recently several full scale ice load measurements were performed on icebreakers including kv svalbard leira et al 2009 ib sampo riska 1990 ccgs terry fox johnston et al 2008 shirase yamauchi et al 2011 and ibrv araon jeon et al 2018 the aforementioned studies focused on a reasonable measurement technique feasible load identification model and statistical analysis of ice loads to precisely identify ice loads an effective identification model is essential and is the focus of recent studies fenz et al 2018 kjerstad et al 2018 waal et al 2018 based on the monitoring requirements three ice load monitoring techniques namely ice pressure identification on a shell structure fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 ice induced torque identification on the shaft line of a propeller waal et al 2018 ikonen et al 2015 and global ice resistance identification johnston et al 2008 kjerstad et al 2018 were developed generally most of the ice load identification models are based on time domain algorithms such as the data influence matrix jeon et al 2018 fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 and time domain deconvolution algorithm waal et al 2018 ikonen et al 2015 intelligent algorithms have been significantly improved with the development of artificial intelligence and intelligent algorithms including neural networks cooper and dimaio 2018 particle swarm optimization algorithm gou et al 2017 and simulated annealing algorithm wang et al 2011 which have recently been widely used in ice load identification as a novel soft computing learning algorithm the support vector machine svm possesses a strong generalization ability to exploit the nonlinear relationships in complex engineering problems yin et al 2015 zhao and yin 2016 li et al 2016 zhao 2008 the svm algorithm proposed by vapnik in 1995 was developed over the last thirty years vapnik 1995 and is firmly established in the framework of statistical learning theory the statistics of ice loads can be divided into short term suominen et al 2017 suominen and kujala 2014 and long term statistics based on the sampling time kujala 1996 jordaan et al 1993 short term statistics typically refer to the statistical analysis of ice loads in a voyage or a section of route thus long term statistics which represent an accumulation of short term statistics can be used for design purposes hence short term statistics form the basis of the optimum design myland et al 2016 warntjen et al 2018 and ice induced fatigue damage suyuthi et al 2013a of a ship structure however ship ice interactions are typical stochastic processes given the numerous parameters of ship hull various forms of ship ice relative movements and the anisotropic characteristics of sea ice mechanics suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen and kujala 2014 the scatter plots of ice loads and ice thicknesses or vessel velocities exhibit high dispersion jeon et al 2018 kotilainen et al 2017 then the input variables of the parametric model of extremes could be reselected by some correlation analysis to build the optimum parameterized model alternatively researchers from norway and finland typically focused on short term statistics of extreme values of ice loads including analysis of the distribution suyuyhi et al 2013b analysis of the variation coefficient suominen and kujala 2014 and forecast analysis kotilainen et al 2017 statistical analysis of extremes requires proper extreme selection procedures that are developed by referring to the time domain characteristics of ice loads the most adopted selection procedure is rayleigh separator which sets the separator value in advance suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen et al 2017 however the selection criterion of the rayleigh separator value is empirical and considers the characteristics of the algorithm and precision of the measuring system suyuyhi et al 2013b jeon et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 qu developed a selection code that can select extremes without pre set parameters qu et al 2012 then extremes can be determined by examining the peak points of the signal series and the code has been applied in the construction of random ice force models for narrow conical structures in this study a full scale ice load measurement system for the icebreaker xuelong henceforth referred to as xuelong is introduced and a statistical analysis of the measured ice loads is performed first the ice load measurement system and ice load identification model based on ls svm are introduced subsequently a trial application of load identification is performed to validate the proposed model second two typical time history curves of ice loads in different ice conditions are analysed third the probability plot of the distributions is utilised to optimise fitting models of extreme ice loads grey relational analysis is used for the parametric analysis of extremes finally the conclusions are summarised 2 full scale ice load monitoring system and load identification method the icebreaker xuelong henceforth referred to as xuelong is the third generation of icebreakers in china see fig 1 a the ice is classified as b1 by the china classification society an ice load monitoring system was installed on xuelong during the 8th chinese national arctic research expedition fig 1 b shows the route of the 8th chinese national arctic research expedition comprising of 20 590 sea miles in crossing the bering sea chukchi sea nordic sea and canada basin during the navigation approximately 1995 sea mile routes are covered with ice 2 1 ice load monitoring system on xuelong to capture the ice induced strains with the optimum measurement scheme we have performed several full scale measurements to analyze which measurement scheme is optimal strain gauges were mounted on different components including stringers transvers frames fringe of the transverse frames and outer shell through comparative analysis of the ice induced strains the ice induced strains on the transverse frames are clearly during the ship ice interaction furthermore different connecting forms of gauges including half bridge with temperature compensation and gauges with two axis filaments were analysed since the ice load that acts on it is concentrated in the vertical direction relative to the neutral axis the strain gauges with two axis filaments are adopted and in each strain sensor the filaments are placed at 45 and 135 angles shown in fig 2 a these strain gauges are installed on five transverse frames fr 5 fr 4 5 fr 4 fr 3 5 and fr 3 with a spacing of 400 mm and the vertical distance between adjacent gauges is 225 mm as shown in fig 2 a the measured strains are selected as the input variables furthermore when the icebreaker navigates through ice covered waters it is subjected to ice induced vibrations and the excitation frequencies depend on the dominant icebreaking mechanism heyn and skjetne 2018 to examine the dynamic process of a ship ice interaction the accelerations of ice induced ship hull vibrations are simultaneously measured in three directions i e heave surge and sway all signals are recorded using a dh5922n dynamic signal acquisition system fig 2 b shows the attached devices raw data are collected at a sampling rate of 500 hz and a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 30 hz is used to filter the signal noise ritch et al 2008 the maximum value of identified load 620 83 kn m is much lower than this threshold value when the structure is in elastic stage as a conventional assumption of ice load identification the fe model presumed to be in an elasticity stage that is linear elastic in this study fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 2 2 least square support vector machine for ice load identification the svm was initially developed for pattern recognition or classification vapnik 1995 to classify the different categories of data the svm classification model is built by searching a hyperplane to build the mapping in a convenient way the svm classification is modelled by mapping the into a feature vector in the input space the mapping may be unrealized due to data characteristics however the mapping could be achieved by simply preprocessing the data ε into some feature space ε ϕ ε then the hyperplane can be employed to construct function f ε which can be written as 1 f ε ω t ϕ ε b where ϕ r p r h is the nonlinear function that maps the input space to a so called high dimensional feature space where classification is easy to be performed r p is the primal dimensional feature space r h is the high dimensional feature space ω r p is the weight vector in the high dimensional feature space b is the bias term ε is the input data during the process of training model which could be measured strains or calculated strains and f ε is the corresponding output data namely the estimated ice loads on the ship hull the establishment of the ice load identification model based on svm regression algorithm can be found in the following description to solve the convex optimization problem the svm regression is modelled by mapping the sample data ε i into a feature vector ϕ ε i the implicit mapping process involves the calculation of the inner product of the feature vector ϕ ε i t ϕ ε j to decrease the computation burden the gaussian radial basis function kernel rbf kernel is used for the inner product computation as follows 2 k ε i ε j exp ε i ε j 2 2 σ 2 where σ denotes the width of the rbf kernel function by introducing loss functions svm can be applied in regression analysis problems during the training process of the sample we set d ε 1 f 1 ε 2 f 2 ε i f i ε n f n specifically δ denotes the loss function which is the accuracy of the fitting function and should be set as a small value i e 1 0 e 10 fig 3 shows that an envelope is composed of a hyperplane based on fitting accuracy and most of the sample data are inside the envelope the process of determining the hyperplane using support vectors is reported by vapnik 1995 individual data are not covered by the envelope due to the error term in the sample data set or fitting error subsequently slack variables ξ i 0 and ξ i 0 are introduced to handle the infeasible constraints of the optimization problem the construction of the ice load identification model is expressed as a convex optimization problem 3 min 1 2 ω 2 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 4 subject to f i ω t ϕ ε i b δ ξ i ω t ϕ ε i b f i δ ξ i ξ i 0 ξ i 0 1 2 where ω denotes the normal vector of the hyperplane b is a constant and c 0 is a constant that is comprised of the flatness of the ice load identification model and the amount up to which deviations higher than δ are tolerated here only the sample data outside the envelope contribute to the cost function sample data in the gridlines of fig 3 three hyperplane parameters including c δ and σ are involved in the problem involving hyperplane parameters selection and this leads to a large solving scale to further decrease the computational load the ls svm developed by suykens and vandewalle is adopted suykens and vandewalle 1999 the algorithm complexity is reduced by substituting the inequality constraints in svm eq 4 with equality constraints 5 min ω

is the weight vector in the high dimensional feature space based on eqs 5 and 6 a lagrange function is established with a lagrange multiplier α i 7 l j ω e i 1 n α i ω t ϕ ε i b e i y i to find the optimal solution of eq 7 take the derivative of ω b e k and α k thereafter obtain the following 8 ω k 1 n α k ϕ x k k 1 n α k 0 α k γ e k k 1 n ω t ϕ x k b e k y k 0 k 1 n by eq 8 the optimal solution can be expressed in matrix form 9 i n 0 0 z t 0 0 0 i n t 0 0 γ 1 i n i n z i n i n 0 ω b e α 0 0 0 y where y y 1 y n t i n 1 1 t e e 1 e n t α α 1 α n t and z ϕ x 1 ϕ x n t by eliminating ω and e the following linear equations can be obtained 10 0 i n i n t ω 1 γ i n b α 0 y where ω k l ϕ x k t ϕ x l k x k x l k l 1 n k represents kernel functions that satisfy the mercer condition to obtain the optimal solution of eq 7 we take the derivative of ω b e i and α i and we obtain the following expression 11 b i n t ω 1 γ i n 1 y i n t ω 1 γ i n 1 i n 12 α ω 1 γ i n 1 y i n b combining eq 11 and 12 with eq 1 the regression model of the ice load on the ship hull is obtained as follows 13 f ε i 1 n α n k ε ε i b it is worth mentioning that the ls svm adopted in this paper is a single output algorithm and limited to the weak estimation ability of multiple objective outputs this ice load identification model can only estimate the total load on the loading area accurately but not the ice pressure a far field ice load identification model based on ls svm is established to determine the ice load from the measured ice induced strains the far field load identification techniques are typically adopted in situations where the load field is inaccessible sensors are damageable or the load field is easy disturbed waal et al 2018 ikonen et al 2015 zheng et al 2013 the ice load monitoring technique can extend the monitoring range when compared to general ice load identification model fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 the numerical cases are analysed and the identification error of applied loads via the ls svm model is less than 3 2 3 experimental validation of the identification model to verify the feasibility of the ls svm algorithm in the identification of ice loads a physical experiment is conducted to forecast the load as shown in fig 4 the mass blocks are placed on the upper enclosed area and the strain gauges are installed in the lower right side of the plate to perform far field load identification the material of the plate is aluminium alloy with a poisson s ratio of ν 0 30 elastic modulus of e 69 0 gpa and density of ρ 2710 kg m 3 the boundaries of the plate are fixed with screws the blocks are weighted by an electric scale with a resolution of 0 1 g field measurements revealed that the ice load changed significantly due to the complex process of ice ship interaction and even in a short term analysis suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen and kujala 2014 the generalization ability of regression model is related to the sample data in the training set which should cover all the cases that might encountered hence the arrangements of the blocks are varied in terms of magnitude and distribution to characterise the stochastic nature of the ice load three different magnitudes of total mass are used to vary the magnitudes as shown in fig 4 furthermore other cases with same total mass but different distributions are simulated to denote the variation in ice pressure we conducted 112 group experiments in this study a held out validation method is adopted to determine the optimal parameters used for load identification the 112 group tests are divided into two sets one set with 100 groups is used for training while the other set with 12 groups is used to assess the identified results a regression model is established using the supervised learning of ls svm two basic parameters can affect fitting results namely the kernel parameter σ 2 and regularization parameter γ the optimal parameters can ensure that the regression values obtained via ls svm are robust under noisy conditions the values of kernel parameter σ 2 and regularization parameter γ of radial kernel function are determined via the following formulations zhao and yin 2016 alvarez et al 2011 14 σ 0 9 min std ε 1 1 34 lqr ε n 1 5 15 γ max f 3 σ f 2 f 3 σ f 2 where std ε denotes the average standard deviation of strains ε lqr ε denotes the average interquartile range f denotes the mean value of applied loads f and σ f denotes the standard deviation of f and n denotes the number of samples in the training set however to make the regression values obtained with the ls svm robust under noisy conditions the values of kernel parameter σ 2 and regularization parameter γ can be further optimized by some parameter optimization method such as generalized cross validation method and ant colony algorithm using the aforementioned method the value of γ σ 2 is determined to be 19 2 27 3 the trend of regression values is consistent with the trend of applied loads as shown in fig 5 the relative error e re is 3 6 which indicates that the ls svm model can be adopted as a relatively high precision load identification model in far field measurement the relative error e re is defined as 16 e re p p real 2 p real 2 100 where p denote regression values and p real denote applied loads 3 typical ship ice interaction cases in full scale at present ls svm is a new method to identify ice load which should be proved to be feasible and this chapter is set to verify the identified ice load with ls svm is reasonably through case study generally ice loads are dominated by primary ice breaking patterns and several researchers have focused on ice load analysis using numerical models based on circular crack patterns su et al 2010 li et al 2018 bending failure patterns aksnes 2010 and splitting patterns lu et al 2015 fig 6 shows the schematic diagram of icebreaking patterns as described by kujala 1996 and multiple ice breaking patterns coexist during the ice breaking process fig 6 also shows the circular crack splitting pattern crushing failure and broken ice slip along hull that correspond to frequently occurring patterns that are recorded on xuelong to show the effect on the characteristics of ice loads via continuous ice failure pattern and discontinuous ice failure pattern two typical ice breaking processes with different ice conditions are examined via time procedure analysis 3 1 ice load during navigation in a pack ice a case of pack ice ship interaction process with a duration of 100 s is analysed in the case study the ice concentration of the pack ice exceeds 90 see fig 7 a and thus the ice breaking process is a continuous process to demonstrate that the measured ice loads reflect the features of ice loads in the time domain the ice induced accelerations in the vertical direction are plotted in fig 7 b a comparison with the videos recorded on site indicates that the ice loads and acceleration signals vary synchronously every time the ice impacts the hull the signals exhibit relatively strong periodicity the extreme ice load values are extracted with a threshold value of 31 25 kn m the mean magnitude and time intervals of the extremes are 68 96 kn m and 4 58 s respectively 3 2 ice load during navigation in an open lead the second case is the ice loads in an open lead that corresponds to the discontinuous ice failure pattern to guarantee the structural safety of ship in an ice zone navigators typically seek open leads which can reduce the frequency of ship ice interaction the formation of an open lead is related to a splitting pattern whose occurrence can lower the ice resistance lu et al 2015 fig 8 a shows that an open lead is formed by current or wind four red dots denoted as a b c and d correspond to the positions of ship ice interaction the track of the ship almost overlaps with the open lead albeit with some differences at the corners of ice sheet when the ship interacts with an ice sheet at the corner part the ice sheet easily breaks in a splitting failure pattern as shown in position b and the above one small pieces of ice that are shed from the ice sheet can still act as obstructions for the ship hull however a wider open water channel is formed and the ice load rapidly decays to approximately zero as shown after position b and position c in fig 8 b the navigation mode decreases the sailing time in the ice zone and also decreases the ice load to some extent the mean magnitude of these extremes and period are 74 11 kn m and 5 43 s respectively we perform a comprehensive comparison with the ice loads in the first case and conclude that the frequency in an open lead is lower than continuous ice breaking patterns 4 statistical analysis of ice loads in full scale typically extreme values are selected as statistical values in extant studies on ice loads suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen et al 2017 to select more reasonable extreme values threshold values are typically adopted to avoid the interferences of neighbouring structures suominen et al 2017 kotilainen et al 2017 definitely the selection of threshold value directly influences the data distribution and some researchers have made study on this topic suominen et al 2017 however to our knowledge there is no standard for choosing the threshold value we consider the resolution of the measuring system and electric noise and select 31 25 kn m as the threshold level in this study as shown in fig 9 extreme values that occur over a 60 s timespan are selected 4 1 extreme distributions and goodness of fit test during the navigation through the arctic region 306 cases of ship ice interactions are analysed each case is observed for 10 min and 16 178 extreme ice loads are extracted as shown in the statistical values listed in table 1 ice thickness including mean value standard deviance and maximum vessel velocity including mean value standard deviance and maximum and extreme values including number mean value standard deviance and maximum are analysed according to the observation records of ice condition the ice type around the ship is mainly pack ice with concentration ranges from 60 to 90 the size of ice floe mainly contained four sizes small size 17 20 100m medium size 44 100 500m big size 29 500 2000m and giant size 10 bigger than 10 km around the navigation route the ice thickness is around 1 5 measured by calibration method and the average velocity of vessel mainly ranges from 3 kn to 10 kn the extreme values of ice loads in a given time history are denoted by x given the introduction of the threshold value denoted by α another random variable y is introduced to ensure convenient fitting analysis of extreme values furthermore the relationship between x and y corresponds to y x α subsequently the two parameter weibull one parameter exponential and two parameter lognormal distribution models are utilised to form a short term statistic of the extreme values suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen et al 2017 for the weibull distribution we obtain the following expression 17 f y k θ y θ k 1 e y θ k where k 0 96 denotes the shape parameter θ 38 65 denotes the scale parameter for the exponential distribution we obtain the following expression 18 f y λ e λ y where λ 2 98 10 2 denotes the rate parameter for the lognormal distribution we obtain the following expression 19 f y 1 σ 2 π y e ln y μ 2 2 σ 2 where μ 3 32 denotes the location parameter and σ 1 15 denotes the scale parameter the goodness of fit is a common index to evaluate the goodness of the fitting model the distribution models created using origin 9 0 are plotted in fig 10 and the goodness of fit for all the three models exceeds 0 99 however the goodness of fit may be different due to different group intervals and then the goodness of fit r 2 may be high when the group interval is appropriate hence this index may be insufficient in comprehensively assessing the fitting goodness on extreme values of ice loads for example suominen used three goodness of fit tests anderson darling kolmogorov smirnov and chi square tests to evaluate the distributions of the measured ice loads suominen et al 2017 to test the general fit a probability plot can be used it is a graphical tool to evaluate whether the field data follow any specific distribution suyuyhi et al 2013b gnanadesikan et al 1968 a visual comparison between the observed and expected cumulative probabilities is performed based on the probability plot if the data points in the probability plot are located approximately along a straight line the expected cumulative probability then the selected distribution model represents the data set accurately the coordinates should be transformed to plot the extreme values against the cumulative probability in a line style subsequently all x axis in the three distributions are plotted in logarithmic coordinates specifically y scale types in the weibull and exponential distributions are double log reciprocal the y scale type in lognormal is probability the weibull and exponential distributions represent the distribution of field data with a relatively high precision as shown in the probability plots in fig 11 furthermore the fitted weibull model accommodates the samples relatively better than the exponential model at the tail distribution at the tail distribution the exponential model will provide the highest extremes when selected as the initial disctribution and the two parameter weibull distribution will give the values closest to the real values the lognormal distribution deviates from the data to a significant degree hence the two parameter weibull distribution is more appropriate for the fitting model 4 2 parametric statistics model for the extreme values of ice loads an early warning system is available for reminding the navigators of the potential damage of the ship hull due to ice loads chai et al 2018 the existing alert mechanism of the ice load monitoring system on a ship is near real time although it lacks a prewarning function jeon et al 2018 fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 the early warning system can be established if ice loads can be predicted based on the ice thickness and vessel velocity kotilainen et al 2017 furthermore parametric statistics of full scale measured ice loads can assist in design analysis given the random characteristics the scatter plots of ice loads and ice thicknesses or vessel velocities exhibit high dispersion jeon et al 2018 kotilainen et al 2017 therefore it is crucial to select the proper input variables for parametric statistics grey relational analysis is used to calculate the degrees of correlation between ice loads and multiple input variables grey relational analysis is a portion of grey system theory which is suitable to determine complicated correlation degrees between input variables and output variable deng 1982 the theory of grey relational analysis is as follows 1 determine the reference sequence u 0 and comparison sequence v i 20 u 0 u 0 1 u 0 2 u 0 n v i v i 1 v i 2 v i n i 1 2 m where n denotes the number of ship ice interaction cases and m denotes the number of comparison sequences the reference sequence u 0 is set as the mean value of extremes in the ship ice interaction cases firstly the mean values of extremes of f ice unit is kn m can be supposed to be proportional to ice thickness and vessel velocity as shown in the first two expressions in eq 21 secondly based on the frequently used lindqvist ice resistance estimation formula lindqvist 1989 the approximate relationships between the mean values of extremes f ice and the ice thickness and vessel velocity are as shown in the third expression in eq 21 the process of local ice loads impacting the ship hull can be separated into three stages approaching stage crushing stage and disengaging stage before the time point of ice failure the ice force gradually increases and reaches its maximum amplitude the ice thereafter enters the disengaging stage and the ice force decreases the local ice loads f l in the numerical study can thus be simplified as periodic wave the ice resistance f r is the average value of ice forces along the navigation direction which satisfies f r f l the ice resistance is the superposition of local ice loads and f ice unit is kn m is the mean values of extremes which is proportional to the magnitude of local ice loads f l then the mean values of extremes f ice can be supposed to related to the ice resistance f r 21 f ice h ice f ice v ship f ice h ice 2 v ship where h ice unit is m and v ship unit is m s denote the mean values of ice thickness and vessel velocity respectively structural parameters e g hull angles and breadth are constant and ice parameters e g strength and elastic modulus vary significantly even in the short term and only variables h ice v ship and h ice 2 v ship are set as the comparison sequences during the voyage the ice thickness is measured using the calibration method weissling et al 2009 and the vessel velocity is measured using global positioning system specifically 289 cases contain this information 2 pre process of the original sequences 22 u 0 0 k u 0 k u 0 1 v i k v i k v i 1 k 1 2 n 23 u 0 0 u 0 0 1 u 0 0 2 u 0 0 n v i 0 v i 0 1 v i 0 2 v i 0 n

0 0 k v 0 0 k 1 2 u 0 0 n v i 0 n where ε i denotes the correlation degree the correlation degrees between the reference sequence and comparison sequences h ice v ship and h ice 2 v ship are 0 72 0 74 and 0 79 respectively the correlation increases if the value of correlation degree increases subsequently h ice 2 v ship should be set as the dependent variable in the parametric statistics due to the discrete features of full scale ice loads the ice load can only be confined by the limited equations sometime such as the global ice load measured on kulluk which is serviced in the alaska arctic wright 2000 as shown in the scatter plot of f ice and h ice 2 v ship in fig 12 90 of the data points are confined to the shadow area which is enclosed by two bound lines 25 upper bound line f ice 15 38 h ice 2 v ship 31 25 26 lower bound line f ice 2 78 h ice 2 v ship 31 25 eqs 25 and 26 are only for xuelong due to the limited test data during ship navigation in cold regions before entering a specific ice field the ice thickness can be estimated via a visual observation from a small helicopter or via remote sensing techniques furthermore it is relatively easy to control the vessel velocity by adjusting the output power of the main engine hence ice loads can be estimated from the forecast information 5 conclusions the measurement of a full scale ice load on a ship is an important approach to analyze ice loads on a ship hull the study presents statistical analysis of full scale measured ice loads and ice load identification model based on ls svm experimental analyses are performed to validate the identification procedure two typical ship ice interaction cases are analysed to examine the effects on the time domain feature of ice loads via different ice breaking processes from the perspective of short term statistics of ice load extreme values can be well fitted via a two parameter weibull distribution and extreme values can be forecasted using parametric statistics although the weibull distribution can generally accommodate measured ice loads with a relatively high precision future studies should focus on the distribution models influence of threshold value or other goodness of fit tests for example the values of weibull probability plots form a curve bending down at the tail distribution which indicates that the expected distribution is slightly skewed to the left with respect to the observed cumulative probability by using the limiting equation for ice loads a relatively safer navigation route can be suggested via a comprehensive analysis of ice conditions and navigation modes objectively this early warning technique is an auxiliary tool that should be improved using more field test data and more statistical forecast models credit

namely ice pressure identification on a shell structure fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 ice induced torque identification on the shaft line of a propeller waal et al 2018 ikonen et al 2015 and global ice resistance identification johnston et al 2008 kjerstad et al 2018 were developed generally most of the ice load identification models are based on time domain algorithms such as the data influence matrix jeon et al 2018 fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 and time domain deconvolution algorithm waal et al 2018 ikonen et al 2015 intelligent algorithms have been significantly improved with the development of artificial intelligence and intelligent algorithms including neural networks cooper and dimaio 2018 particle swarm optimization algorithm gou et al 2017 and simulated annealing algorithm wang et al 2011 which have recently been widely used in ice load identification as a novel soft computing learning algorithm the support vector machine svm possesses a strong generalization ability to exploit the nonlinear relationships in complex engineering problems yin et al 2015 zhao and yin 2016 li et al 2016 zhao 2008 the svm algorithm proposed by vapnik in 1995 was developed over the last thirty years vapnik 1995 and is firmly established in the framework of statistical learning theory the statistics of ice loads can be divided into short term suominen et al 2017 suominen and kujala 2014 and long term statistics based on the sampling time kujala 1996 jordaan et al 1993 short term statistics typically refer to the statistical analysis of ice loads in a voyage or a section of route thus long term statistics which represent an accumulation of short term statistics can be used for design purposes hence short term statistics form the basis of the optimum design myland et al 2016 warntjen et al 2018 and ice induced fatigue damage suyuthi et al 2013a of a ship structure however ship ice interactions are typical stochastic processes given the numerous parameters of ship hull various forms of ship ice relative movements and the anisotropic characteristics of sea ice mechanics suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen and kujala 2014 the scatter plots of ice loads and ice thicknesses or vessel velocities exhibit high dispersion jeon et al 2018 kotilainen et al 2017 then the input variables of the parametric model of extremes could be reselected by some correlation analysis to build the optimum parameterized model alternatively researchers from norway and finland typically focused on short term statistics of extreme values of ice loads including analysis of the distribution suyuyhi et al 2013b analysis of the variation coefficient suominen and kujala 2014 and forecast analysis kotilainen et al 2017 statistical analysis of extremes requires proper extreme selection procedures that are developed by referring to the time domain characteristics of ice loads the most adopted selection procedure is rayleigh separator which sets the separator value in advance suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen et al 2017 however the selection criterion of the rayleigh separator value is empirical and considers the characteristics of the algorithm and precision of the measuring system suyuyhi et al 2013b jeon et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 qu developed a selection code that can select extremes without pre set parameters qu et al 2012 then extremes can be determined by examining the peak points of the signal series and the code has been applied in the construction of random ice force models for narrow conical structures in this study a full scale ice load measurement system for the icebreaker xuelong henceforth referred to as xuelong is introduced and a statistical analysis of the measured ice loads is performed first the ice load measurement system and ice load identification model based on ls svm are introduced subsequently a trial application of load identification is performed to validate the proposed model second two typical time history curves of ice loads in different ice conditions are analysed third the probability plot of the distributions is utilised to optimise fitting models of extreme ice loads grey relational analysis is used for the parametric analysis of extremes finally the conclusions are summarised 2 full scale ice load monitoring system and load identification method the icebreaker xuelong henceforth referred to as xuelong is the third generation of icebreakers in china see fig 1 a the ice is classified as b1 by the china classification society an ice load monitoring system was installed on xuelong during the 8th chinese national arctic research expedition fig 1 b shows the route of the 8th chinese national arctic research expedition comprising of 20 590 sea miles in crossing the bering sea chukchi sea nordic sea and canada basin during the navigation approximately 1995 sea mile routes are covered with ice 2 1 ice load monitoring system on xuelong to capture the ice induced strains with the optimum measurement scheme we have performed several full scale measurements to analyze which measurement scheme is optimal strain gauges were mounted on different components including stringers transvers frames fringe of the transverse frames and outer shell through comparative analysis of the ice induced strains the ice induced strains on the transverse frames are clearly during the ship ice interaction furthermore different connecting forms of gauges including half bridge with temperature compensation and gauges with two axis filaments were analysed since the ice load that acts on it is concentrated in the vertical direction relative to the neutral axis the strain gauges with two axis filaments are adopted and in each strain sensor the filaments are placed at 45 and 135 angles shown in fig 2 a these strain gauges are installed on five transverse frames fr 5 fr 4 5 fr 4 fr 3 5 and fr 3 with a spacing of 400 mm and the vertical distance between adjacent gauges is 225 mm as shown in fig 2 a the measured strains are selected as the input variables furthermore when the icebreaker navigates through ice covered waters it is subjected to ice induced vibrations and the excitation frequencies depend on the dominant icebreaking mechanism heyn and skjetne 2018 to examine the dynamic process of a ship ice interaction the accelerations of ice induced ship hull vibrations are simultaneously measured in three directions i e heave surge and sway all signals are recorded using a dh5922n dynamic signal acquisition system fig 2 b shows the attached devices raw data are collected at a sampling rate of 500 hz and a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 30 hz is used to filter the signal noise ritch et al 2008 the maximum value of identified load 620 83 kn m is much lower than this threshold value when the structure is in elastic stage as a conventional assumption of ice load identification the fe model presumed to be in an elasticity stage that is linear elastic in this study fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 2 2 least square support vector machine for ice load identification the svm was initially developed for pattern recognition or classification vapnik 1995 to classify the different categories of data the svm classification model is built by searching a hyperplane to build the mapping in a convenient way the svm classification is modelled by mapping the into a feature vector in the input space the mapping may be unrealized due to data characteristics however the mapping could be achieved by simply preprocessing the data ε into some feature space ε ϕ ε then the hyperplane can be employed to construct function f ε which can be written as 1 f ε ω t ϕ ε b where ϕ r p r h is the nonlinear function that maps the input space to a so called high dimensional feature space where classification is easy to be performed r p is the primal dimensional feature space r h is the high dimensional feature space ω r p is the weight vector in the high dimensional feature space b is the bias term ε is the input data during the process of training model which could be measured strains or calculated strains and f ε is the corresponding output data namely the estimated ice loads on the ship hull the establishment of the ice load identification model based on svm regression algorithm can be found in the following description to solve the convex optimization problem the svm regression is modelled by mapping the sample data ε i into a feature vector ϕ ε i the implicit mapping process involves the calculation of the inner product of the feature vector ϕ ε i t ϕ ε j to decrease the computation burden the gaussian radial basis function kernel rbf kernel is used for the inner product computation as follows 2 k ε i ε j exp ε i ε j 2 2 σ 2 where σ denotes the width of the rbf kernel function by introducing loss functions svm can be applied in regression analysis problems during the training process of the sample we set d ε 1 f 1 ε 2 f 2 ε i f i ε n f n specifically δ denotes the loss function which is the accuracy of the fitting function and should be set as a small value i e 1 0 e 10 fig 3 shows that an envelope is composed of a hyperplane based on fitting accuracy and most of the sample data are inside the envelope the process of determining the hyperplane using support vectors is reported by vapnik 1995 individual data are not covered by the envelope due to the error term in the sample data set or fitting error subsequently slack variables ξ i 0 and ξ i 0 are introduced to handle the infeasible constraints of the optimization problem the construction of the ice load identification model is expressed as a convex optimization problem 3 min 1 2 ω 2 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 4 subject to f i ω t ϕ ε i b δ ξ i ω t ϕ ε i b f i δ ξ i ξ i 0 ξ i 0 1 2 where ω denotes the normal vector of the hyperplane b is a constant and c 0 is a constant that is comprised of the flatness of the ice load identification model and the amount up to which deviations higher than δ are tolerated here only the sample data outside the envelope contribute to the cost function sample data in the gridlines of fig 3 three hyperplane parameters including c δ and σ are involved in the problem involving hyperplane parameters selection and this leads to a large solving scale to further decrease the computational load the ls svm developed by suykens and vandewalle is adopted suykens and vandewalle 1999 the algorithm complexity is reduced by substituting the inequality constraints in svm eq 4 with equality constraints 5 min ω

optimal solution of eq 7 we take the derivative of ω b e i and α i and we obtain the following expression 11 b i n t ω 1 γ i n 1 y i n t ω 1 γ i n 1 i n 12 α ω 1 γ i n 1 y i n b combining eq 11 and 12 with eq 1 the regression model of the ice load on the ship hull is obtained as follows 13 f ε i 1 n α n k ε ε i b it is worth mentioning that the ls svm adopted in this paper is a single output algorithm and limited to the weak estimation ability of multiple objective outputs this ice load identification model can only estimate the total load on the loading area accurately but not the ice pressure a far field ice load identification model based on ls svm is established to determine the ice load from the measured ice induced strains the far field load identification techniques are typically adopted in situations where the load field is inaccessible sensors are damageable or the load field is easy disturbed waal et al 2018 ikonen et al 2015 zheng et al 2013 the ice load monitoring technique can extend the monitoring range when compared to general ice load identification model fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 the numerical cases are analysed and the identification error of applied loads via the ls svm model is less than 3 2 3 experimental validation of the identification model to verify the feasibility of the ls svm algorithm in the identification of ice loads a physical experiment is conducted to forecast the load as shown in fig 4 the mass blocks are placed on the upper enclosed area and the strain gauges are installed in the lower right side of the plate to perform far field load identification the material of the plate is aluminium alloy with a poisson s ratio of ν 0 30 elastic modulus of e 69 0 gpa and density of ρ 2710 kg m 3 the boundaries of the plate are fixed with screws the blocks are weighted by an electric scale with a resolution of 0 1 g field measurements revealed that the ice load changed significantly due to the complex process of ice ship interaction and even in a short term analysis suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen and kujala 2014 the generalization ability of regression model is related to the sample data in the training set which should cover all the cases that might encountered hence the arrangements of the blocks are varied in terms of magnitude and distribution to characterise the stochastic nature of the ice load three different magnitudes of total mass are used to vary the magnitudes as shown in fig 4 furthermore other cases with same total mass but different distributions are simulated to denote the variation in ice pressure we conducted 112 group experiments in this study a held out validation method is adopted to determine the optimal parameters used for load identification the 112 group tests are divided into two sets one set with 100 groups is used for training while the other set with 12 groups is used to assess the identified results a regression model is established using the supervised learning of ls svm two basic parameters can affect fitting results namely the kernel parameter σ 2 and regularization parameter γ the optimal parameters can ensure that the regression values obtained via ls svm are robust under noisy conditions the values of kernel parameter σ 2 and regularization parameter γ of radial kernel function are determined via the following formulations zhao and yin 2016 alvarez et al 2011 14 σ 0 9 min std ε 1 1 34 lqr ε n 1 5 15 γ max f 3 σ f 2 f 3 σ f 2 where std ε denotes the average standard deviation of strains ε lqr ε denotes the average interquartile range f denotes the mean value of applied loads f and σ f denotes the standard deviation of f and n denotes the number of samples in the training set however to make the regression values obtained with the ls svm robust under noisy conditions the values of kernel parameter σ 2 and regularization parameter γ can be further optimized by some parameter optimization method such as generalized cross validation method and ant colony algorithm using the aforementioned method the value of γ σ 2 is determined to be 19 2 27 3 the trend of regression values is consistent with the trend of applied loads as shown in fig 5 the relative error e re is 3 6 which indicates that the ls svm model can be adopted as a relatively high precision load identification model in far field measurement the relative error e re is defined as 16 e re p p real 2 p real 2 100 where p denote regression values and p real denote applied loads 3 typical ship ice interaction cases in full scale at present ls svm is a new method to identify ice load which should be proved to be feasible and this chapter is set to verify the identified ice load with ls svm is reasonably through case study generally ice loads are dominated by primary ice breaking patterns and several researchers have focused on ice load analysis using numerical models based on circular crack patterns su et al 2010 li et al 2018 bending failure patterns aksnes 2010 and splitting patterns lu et al 2015 fig 6 shows the schematic diagram of icebreaking patterns as described by kujala 1996 and multiple ice breaking patterns coexist during the ice breaking process fig 6 also shows the circular crack splitting pattern crushing failure and broken ice slip along hull that correspond to frequently occurring patterns that are recorded on xuelong to show the effect on the characteristics of ice loads via continuous ice failure pattern and discontinuous ice failure pattern two typical ice breaking processes with different ice conditions are examined via time procedure analysis 3 1 ice load during navigation in a pack ice a case of pack ice ship interaction process with a duration of 100 s is analysed in the case study the ice concentration of the pack ice exceeds 90 see fig 7 a and thus the ice breaking process is a continuous process to demonstrate that the measured ice loads reflect the features of ice loads in the time domain the ice induced accelerations in the vertical direction are plotted in fig 7 b a comparison with the videos recorded on site indicates that the ice loads and acceleration signals vary synchronously every time the ice impacts the hull the signals exhibit relatively strong periodicity the extreme ice load values are extracted with a threshold value of 31 25 kn m the mean magnitude and time intervals of the extremes are 68 96 kn m and 4 58 s respectively 3 2 ice load during navigation in an open lead the second case is the ice loads in an open lead that corresponds to the discontinuous ice failure pattern to guarantee the structural safety of ship in an ice zone navigators typically seek open leads which can reduce the frequency of ship ice interaction the formation of an open lead is related to a splitting pattern whose occurrence can lower the ice resistance lu et al 2015 fig 8 a shows that an open lead is formed by current or wind four red dots denoted as a b c and d correspond to the positions of ship ice interaction the track of the ship almost overlaps with the open lead albeit with some differences at the corners of ice sheet when the ship interacts with an ice sheet at the corner part the ice sheet easily breaks in a splitting failure pattern as shown in position b and the above one small pieces of ice that are shed from the ice sheet can still act as obstructions for the ship hull however a wider open water channel is formed and the ice load rapidly decays to approximately zero as shown after position b and position c in fig 8 b the navigation mode decreases the sailing time in the ice zone and also decreases the ice load to some extent the mean magnitude of these extremes and period are 74 11 kn m and 5 43 s respectively we perform a comprehensive comparison with the ice loads in the first case and conclude that the frequency in an open lead is lower than continuous ice breaking patterns 4 statistical analysis of ice loads in full scale typically extreme values are selected as statistical values in extant studies on ice loads suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen et al 2017 to select more reasonable extreme values threshold values are typically adopted to avoid the interferences of neighbouring structures suominen et al 2017 kotilainen et al 2017 definitely the selection of threshold value directly influences the data distribution and some researchers have made study on this topic suominen et al 2017 however to our knowledge there is no standard for choosing the threshold value we consider the resolution of the measuring system and electric noise and select 31 25 kn m as the threshold level in this study as shown in fig 9 extreme values that occur over a 60 s timespan are selected 4 1 extreme distributions and goodness of fit test during the navigation through the arctic region 306 cases of ship ice interactions are analysed each case is observed for 10 min and 16 178 extreme ice loads are extracted as shown in the statistical values listed in table 1 ice thickness including mean value standard deviance and maximum vessel velocity including mean value standard deviance and maximum and extreme values including number mean value standard deviance and maximum are analysed according to the observation records of ice condition the ice type around the ship is mainly pack ice with concentration ranges from 60 to 90 the size of ice floe mainly contained four sizes small size 17 20 100m medium size 44 100 500m big size 29 500 2000m and giant size 10 bigger than 10 km around the navigation route the ice thickness is around 1 5 measured by calibration method and the average velocity of vessel mainly ranges from 3 kn to 10 kn the extreme values of ice loads in a given time history are denoted by x given the introduction of the threshold value denoted by α another random variable y is introduced to ensure convenient fitting analysis of extreme values furthermore the relationship between x and y corresponds to y x α subsequently the two parameter weibull one parameter exponential and two parameter lognormal distribution models are utilised to form a short term statistic of the extreme values suyuyhi et al 2013b suominen et al 2017 for the weibull distribution we obtain the following expression 17 f y k θ y θ k 1 e y θ k where k 0 96 denotes the shape parameter θ 38 65 denotes the scale parameter for the exponential distribution we obtain the following expression 18 f y λ e λ y where λ 2 98 10 2 denotes the rate parameter for the lognormal distribution we obtain the following expression 19 f y 1 σ 2 π y e ln y μ 2 2 σ 2 where μ 3 32 denotes the location parameter and σ 1 15 denotes the scale parameter the goodness of fit is a common index to evaluate the goodness of the fitting model the distribution models created using origin 9 0 are plotted in fig 10 and the goodness of fit for all the three models exceeds 0 99 however the goodness of fit may be different due to different group intervals and then the goodness of fit r 2 may be high when the group interval is appropriate hence this index may be insufficient in comprehensively assessing the fitting goodness on extreme values of ice loads for example suominen used three goodness of fit tests anderson darling kolmogorov smirnov and chi square tests to evaluate the distributions of the measured ice loads suominen et al 2017 to test the general fit a probability plot can be used it is a graphical tool to evaluate whether the field data follow any specific distribution suyuyhi et al 2013b gnanadesikan et al 1968 a visual comparison between the observed and expected cumulative probabilities is performed based on the probability plot if the data points in the probability plot are located approximately along a straight line the expected cumulative probability then the selected distribution model represents the data set accurately the coordinates should be transformed to plot the extreme values against the cumulative probability in a line style subsequently all x axis in the three distributions are plotted in logarithmic coordinates specifically y scale types in the weibull and exponential distributions are double log reciprocal the y scale type in lognormal is probability the weibull and exponential distributions represent the distribution of field data with a relatively high precision as shown in the probability plots in fig 11 furthermore the fitted weibull model accommodates the samples relatively better than the exponential model at the tail distribution at the tail distribution the exponential model will provide the highest extremes when selected as the initial disctribution and the two parameter weibull distribution will give the values closest to the real values the lognormal distribution deviates from the data to a significant degree hence the two parameter weibull distribution is more appropriate for the fitting model 4 2 parametric statistics model for the extreme values of ice loads an early warning system is available for reminding the navigators of the potential damage of the ship hull due to ice loads chai et al 2018 the existing alert mechanism of the ice load monitoring system on a ship is near real time although it lacks a prewarning function jeon et al 2018 fenz et al 2018 suominen et al 2017 the early warning system can be established if ice loads can be predicted based on the ice thickness and vessel velocity kotilainen et al 2017 furthermore parametric statistics of full scale measured ice loads can assist in design analysis given the random characteristics the scatter plots of ice loads and ice thicknesses or vessel velocities exhibit high dispersion jeon et al 2018 kotilainen et al 2017 therefore it is crucial to select the proper input variables for parametric statistics grey relational analysis is used to calculate the degrees of correlation between ice loads and multiple input variables grey relational analysis is a portion of grey system theory which is suitable to determine complicated correlation degrees between input variables and output variable deng 1982 the theory of grey relational analysis is as follows 1 determine the reference sequence u 0 and comparison sequence v i 20 u 0 u 0 1 u 0 2 u 0 n v i v i 1 v i 2 v i n i 1 2 m where n denotes the number of ship ice interaction cases and m denotes the number of comparison sequences the reference sequence u 0 is set as the mean value of extremes in the ship ice interaction cases firstly the mean values of extremes of f ice unit is kn m can be supposed to be proportional to ice thickness and vessel velocity as shown in the first two expressions in eq 21 secondly based on the frequently used lindqvist ice resistance estimation formula lindqvist 1989 the approximate relationships between the mean values of extremes f ice and the ice thickness and vessel velocity are as shown in the third expression in eq 21 the process of local ice loads impacting the ship hull can be separated into three stages approaching stage crushing stage and disengaging stage before the time point of ice failure the ice force gradually increases and reaches its maximum amplitude the ice thereafter enters the disengaging stage and the ice force decreases the local ice loads f l in the numerical study can thus be simplified as periodic wave the ice resistance f r is the average value of ice forces along the navigation direction which satisfies f r f l the ice resistance is the superposition of local ice loads and f ice unit is kn m is the mean values of extremes which is proportional to the magnitude of local ice loads f l then the mean values of extremes f ice can be supposed to related to the ice resistance f r 21 f ice h ice f ice v ship f ice h ice 2 v ship where h ice unit is m and v ship unit is m s denote the mean values of ice thickness and vessel velocity respectively structural parameters e g hull angles and breadth are constant and ice parameters e g strength and elastic modulus vary significantly even in the short term and only variables h ice v ship and h ice 2 v ship are set as the comparison sequences during the voyage the ice thickness is measured using the calibration method weissling et al 2009 and the vessel velocity is measured using global positioning system specifically 289 cases contain this information 2 pre process of the original sequences 22 u 0 0 k u 0 k u 0 1 v i k v i k v i 1 k 1 2 n 23 u 0 0 u 0 0 1 u 0 0 2 u 0 0 n v i 0 v i 0 1 v i 0 2 v i 0 n

0 0 k v 0 0 k 1 2 u 0 0 n v i 0 n where ε i denotes the correlation degree the correlation degrees between the reference sequence and comparison sequences h ice v ship and h ice 2 v ship are 0 72 0 74 and 0 79 respectively the correlation increases if the value of correlation degree increases subsequently h ice 2 v ship should be set as the dependent variable in the parametric statistics due to the discrete features of full scale ice loads the ice load can only be confined by the limited equations sometime such as the global ice load measured on kulluk which is serviced in the alaska arctic wright 2000 as shown in the scatter plot of f ice and h ice 2 v ship in fig 12 90 of the data points are confined to the shadow area which is enclosed by two bound lines 25 upper bound line f ice 15 38 h ice 2 v ship 31 25 26 lower bound line f ice 2 78 h ice 2 v ship 31 25 eqs 25 and 26 are only for xuelong due to the limited test data during ship navigation in cold regions before entering a specific ice field the ice thickness can be estimated via a visual observation from a small helicopter or via remote sensing techniques furthermore it is relatively easy to control the vessel velocity by adjusting the output power of the main engine hence ice loads can be estimated from the forecast information 5 conclusions the measurement of a full scale ice load on a ship is an important approach to analyze ice loads on a ship hull the study presents statistical analysis of full scale measured ice loads and ice load identification model based on ls svm experimental analyses are performed to validate the identification procedure two typical ship ice interaction cases are analysed to examine the effects on the time domain feature of ice loads via different ice breaking processes from the perspective of short term statistics of ice load extreme values can be well fitted via a two parameter weibull distribution and extreme values can be forecasted using parametric statistics although the weibull distribution can generally accommodate measured ice loads with a relatively high precision future studies should focus on the distribution models influence of threshold value or other goodness of fit tests for example the values of weibull probability plots form a curve bending down at the tail distribution which indicates that the expected distribution is slightly skewed to the left with respect to the observed cumulative probability by using the limiting equation for ice loads a relatively safer navigation route can be suggested via a comprehensive analysis of ice conditions and navigation modes objectively this early warning technique is an auxiliary tool that should be improved using more field test data and more statistical forecast models credit

21011,the variable coefficient modified gardner equation is proposed to describe large amplitude internal solitary waves isws propagating over slope shelf topography the model is adapted from weakly nonlinear gardner equation by adjusting its original coefficients such that the model is capable of representing the crucial characteristics of large amplitude isws including the effective wavelength and wave speed to numerically solve the nonlinear equation the fourth order runge kutta method is applied for temporal discretization second order central finite difference numerical scheme is implemented for the space discretization and the iterative scheme is applied to treat the coupling term of time and space the numerical method is then verified by comparing fairly with laboratory experiments it s found the variable coefficient modified gardner model is a reliable theoretical tool to describe the behavior of large amplitude internal solitary waves passing through bottom topography keywords internal solitary wave strong nonlinearity strongly nonlinear theoretical model laboratory experiments two layer system slope shelf bottom topography 1 introduction internal solitary waves isws are ubiquitious features in coastal areas of the stratified oceans charaterized by large amplitude and strong current velocity helfrich and melville 2006 jackson 2007 examples have been widely reported worldwide in many regions osborne and burch 1980 kinder 1984 apel et al 1985 ostrovsky and stepanyants 1989 grimshaw et al 2006 scotti et al 2007 ramp et al 2010 cai et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 especially in the northern south china sea scs recently in northern scs an extreme isw with a maximum amplitude of 240m and current velocity of 2 55 m s was captured which is regared as one of the strongest isws of the world on record see huang et al 2016 such waves evoke enormous changes in ocean current and vertical thermal structures in a relatively time therefore knowledge of these waves are important on assessing their impact on underwater vehicles and offshore oil platforms as well as the marine biology and geology in the coastal oceans to describe the isws propagating over a region of variable depth the well known variable coefficient korteweg de vries kdv equation has been verified to be a suitable theoretical model as the amplitude of incoming isw is relatively small the variable coefficient kdv equation for internal waves was developed by ostrovsky and pelinovsky 1970 and later systematically derived by johnson 1973 while grimshaw and stewartson 1981 gave a detailed derivation for internal waves see also zhou and grimshaw 1989 and grimshaw et al 2010 comparing with experimental and fully nonlinear theoretical results grue et al 2011 showed that the kdv theory is relevant for small wave amplitude range but showcased a systematic deviation from experimental results for wave amplitudes exceeding 0 4 times the depth of the thinner layer upper layer for isws of depression not surprisingly kdv model fails to characterize the dynamics of large amplitude isws with amplitudes up to 100m and more observed since it is based on the weakly nonlinear long wave regime small 2001 kodaira et al 2016 la forgia and sciortino 2019 however kdv equation can be further improved by including an extra cubic nonlinear term whose coefficients has the opposite polarity to the coefficients of the linear dispersive term see the review by grimshaw 2016 which yields the so called gardner equation miyata 1988 grimshaw et al 2002 o driscoll and levine 2017 stanton and ostrovsky 1998 found that the extended kdv model did a good job of capturing characteristics of the highly nonlinear internal solitary waves from their observation nevertheless the extended kdv equation would generates table top solitons in the case that the initial wave amplitude tends close to the critical value in addition the extended kdv equation still fails to characterize the same maximum amplitude as the euler equation choi et al 2020 to exactly describe the properties of large amplitude isws many numerical strongly nonlinear models have been employed for both continuously stratified and multilayer fluids lamb 1994 grue et al 1997 lamb 2002 shimizu 2019 zhu et al 2018 isws solutions of the full nonlinear inviscid equations without consideration of effects of the earth s rotation can be obtained by solving the dubreil jacotin long djl equation turkington et al 1991 further extended by including background currents by stastna and lamb 2002 alternatively with the long wave assumption but no assumption on amplitude scale strongly nonlinear asymptotic model was proposed miyata 1985 miyata 1988 choi and camassa 1996 choi and camassa 1999 and is referred to as miyata choi camassa mcc model the solitary wave solution of mcc model is found to be in good agreement with both laboratory experiments michallet and barthelemy 1998 observations ostrovsky and grue 2003 and the numerical solutions of the euler equations camassa et al 2006 over a wide range of relative layer depth however as mentioned in our previous work choi et al 2020 mcc model would encounter kelvin helmholtz instability when solved numerically it s necessary to propose a new unidirectional model to predict the crucial characteristics of strongly nonlinear isws in the present work in order to describe large amplitude isws propagating over bottom topography we proposed modified gardner equation that extends the original gardner equation by adjusting its coefficients and adding further terms associated to the bottom topography which are function of x the original gardner equation is modified by changing its coefficients such that the adjusted modified gardner equation is capable of preserving the solitary wave characteristics of mcc model especially the maximum amplitude to show the good agreement the unsteady modified gardner equation is then compared with laboratory experimental measurements made by wessels and hutter 1996 and our experimental measurements in particular modified gardner equation can be supplemented with a damping term which is capable of describing wave dissipation in the numerical simulation when comparing with experimental results see liu et al 1998 cai et al 2002 and grimshaw et al 2003 for reviews on the topic of energy dissipation this paper is organized as follows after presenting our experimental set up and data processing techniques in section 2 we presented strongly nonlinear mcc model and proposed the modified gardner equation with adjusted coefficients in section 3 in section 4 the modified gardner equation is further generalized for variable bottom to solve the generalized model numerically the fourth order runge kutta method is applied for temporal discretization and second order central finite difference numerical scheme is implemented for the space discretization particularly iterative scheme is applied to deal with the coupling term of time and space then the numerical solution is compared with laboratory experimental measurements in section 5 the laboratory experiments of strongly nonlinear isws with large amplitude propagating over a slope shelf topography were carried out and also compared with numerical results of variable coefficient modified gardner equation concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 experimental setup and method 2 1 stratification and wave generation laboratory experiments were conducted for the propagation of an internal solitary wave over slope shelf topography in a two layer fresh brine fluid system within a wave flume at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu in china the flume is 30 m long with a cross section 1 2 m high and 0 6 m wide fig 1 the experimental apparatus consists of a trapezoidal obstacle made of smooth impermeable steel panel representing the slope shelf topography two sets of ultrasonic probes two digital video cameras with a resolution of 640 480 pixels and frame rate of 29 78 fps as shown in fig 1 besides other recording devices was also used to collect and record the conductivity measured from the probes the plateau is constructed by adding a plate with 13 m long and 0 6 m wide on the top of a frontal slope plate in each run the total fluid depth h h 1 h 2 was chosen to be 1 0 m the tank was first filled with fresh water of density ρ 1 998 k g m 3 up to afterwards the tank was filled with salt water of density ρ 2 1025 k g m 3 very gently through two mushroom shaped openings located at the bottom until the total depth reached h 1 0 m the salt water has been dyed red before it was injected into the flume to assist flow visualization fig 2 shows that the interface between fresh water and salt water is quite clear with the stratification approach furthermore h 1 0 2 m because the color of the lower layer is different from that of the upper layer the waveform variation can be more clearly observed as the wave propagates up the slope fig 3 a illustrates the measurement of density ρ and buoyancy frequency n profile when depth ratio h 1 h 2 1 4 the buoyancy frequency is given by n z g ρ 1 ρ z where g is the gravitational acceleration and ρ z represents density variation along the vertical direction as expected maximum buoyancy is located at the interface of two layer fluid as shown in fig 3b the wave generator was installed at the right side of the tank the wave tanker consists of two pistons vertically placed plates piston i and ii the upper piston i was moved to the direction of wave propagation while the lower one was moved to the opposite direction to generate an isw our method of wave generation by using two pistons was originally proposed by wessels and hutter 1996 however in their experiment the upper piston is surface piercing which may disturb the top free surface and generate the surface wave therefore in our experiment in order to minimize such effect caused by the upper piston i a rigid lid of 5 m long over upper layer was placed on the top of the fluid layer a wedge shaped wave absorber was placed on the most left hand size of the flume to suppress wave reflection as illustrated in fig 1 probe 1 recorded the interface displacement and waveform of the incoming internal solitary wave probe 2 was arranged at 2 m away from the shoulder on the slope region probe 3 and 4 measured the evolution of the transmitted wave at 0 2 m and 2 m from the shoulder on the horizontal plateau respectively 2 2 wave amplitude control and calibration to generate an internal solitary wave of amplitude a piston i and piston ii are accelerated to the mean velocities u 1 and u 2 respectively which are given by from mcc theory 1 u 1 c a h 1 a u 2 c a h 2 a where c denotes the phase speed the amplitudes measured by probe i are slightly different from input amplitude a due to friction and the finite pycnocline thickness nevertheless a linear relationship between the input amplitude a d and target amplitude a m can be found from series of experiments given by 2 a m h k a d h β where and β h 1 h 2 are the slope and the intercept of the best fit line respectively through a number of preliminary tests the values of k and β are determined for three different depth ratios as summarized in table 1 as seen from table 1 the slope k of the best fit line tends to increase as the depth ratio γ increases as shown in fig 4 the maximum error between the target amplitudes and the measured amplitudes of solitary generated by using eq 2 is found to be less than 5 in addition the internal solitary waves generated by aforementioned method are found reliably repeatable 3 theoretical model 3 1 strongly nonlinear mcc model the problem is considered in a cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 5 the main geometric parameters include the thickness of upper layer h 1 the original thickness of the lower layer h 2 the terrain height b x and the actual thickness of lower layer h 2 x the fluids of two layer are inviscid and incompressible with density ρ i i 1 2 the rigid lid condition is applied to the top surface boundary of the system with non uniform bottom topography the strongly nonlinear long wave model is given jo and choi 2002 by 3 η i t η i u i x 0 4 u 1 t u 1 u 1 x g ζ x p x ρ 1 1 η 1 1 3 η 1 3 g 1 x 5 u 2 t u 2 u 2 x g ζ x p x ρ 2 1 η 2 1 3 η 2 3 g 2 x 1 η 2 1

the local layer thickness η i i 1 2 and the thickness average velocity u i are given by 6 η 1 h 1 ζ u 1 x t 1 η 1 ζ h 1 u 1 x z t d z 7 η 2 h 2 b x ζ u 2 x t 1 η 2 h 2 b x ζ u 2 x z t d z and the nonlinear dispersive term g i are defined by 8 g 1 x t u 1 x t u 1 u 1 x x u 1 x 2 g 2 x t u 2 x t u 2 u 2 x x u 2 x 2 with h 2 given by 9 h 2 t u 2 x u 2 b x the model assumes h 2 h 1 o 1 and has an error of o ε 4 where the ε h 1 λ 1 with λ being characteristic wavelength is dispersive parameter on the other hand nonlinear parameter defined by α a h 1 is assumed o 1 which has been assumed to be small for weakly nonlinear model therefore this model is expected to describe the evolution of large amplitude internal solitary waves 3 2 modified gardner equation while there exist a number of theoretical models for uni directional waves we use an asymptotic model introduced by choi 2019 which is hereafter referred to as the modified gardner equation the model derivation and the choice of coefficients in choi 2019 are repeated here for completeness 3 2 1 derivation considering the complexity of mcc model especially when being solved numerically we hope to find a relatively simple unidirectional model which can be used for a wide range of wave amplitudes including the maximum to this end the well known gardner equation kakutani and yamasaki 1978 is taken into consideration 10 ζ

first replace c i by c i μ i μ i with parameter μ i to be determined which yields 12 ζ t c 0 ζ x c 1 μ 1 ζ ζ x c 2 μ 2 ζ x x x c 3 μ 3 ζ 2 ζ x μ 1 ζ ζ x μ 2 ζ x x x μ 3 ζ 2 ζ x o α 2 ε 3 α ε 5 from the leading order terms of eq 10 we have the following assumption 13 ζ x 1 c 0 ζ t c 1 ζ ζ x o α 2 ε α ε 3 by applying 13 to the terms proportional to μ i eq 12 becomes under the same order of

system given by 14 can be reduced to 19 c 2 c ˆ c 0 1 μ 2 ζ x 2 ζ 2 c ˆ c 0 1 3 c 1 c ˆ c 0 1 μ 1 ζ 1 6 c 3 c 1 c 0 μ 1 c ˆ c 0 1 μ 3 ζ 2 which can be written as 20 ζ x 2 γ 0 ζ 2 ζ 2 γ 1 ζ γ 2 γ 0 c ˆ 3 6 c ˆ 2 γ 1 2 c ˆ 1 c ˆ 3 γ 2 6 c ˆ c 0 c ˆ 3 where 21 c ˆ 1 c 1 c ˆ c 0 μ 1 c 0 c ˆ 2 c 2 c ˆ c 0 μ 2 c 0 c ˆ 3 c 3 c 1 μ 1 c 0 c ˆ c 0 μ 3 c 0 the solitary wave solution of eq 14 can be written explicitly in terms of elementary functions as 22 ζ x a b ˆ 1 b ˆ cosh 2 k ˆ x x x c ˆ t where b ˆ and k ˆ given by 23 b ˆ a 2 γ 2 k ˆ γ 0 γ 2 1 2 2 from ζ x 0 with ζ a the wave speed c ˆ of the solitary wave of the mg equation can be found as 24 c ˆ c 0 2 c 1 a c 3 c 1 μ 1 c 0 a 2 6 2 μ 1 c 0 a μ 3 c 0 a 2 while the effective wavelength of the mg model is given by 25 λ m g 2 a γ 0 1 2 t a n h 1 a γ 0 1 2 the maximum amplitude can be found as a ˆ m γ 1 2 which yields 26 a ˆ m c 1 c ˆ m c 0 μ 1 c 0 c 3 c 1 μ 1 c 0 c ˆ m c 0 μ 3 c 0 when 26 is combined with 24 with a a ˆ m one can find the expression of a ˆ m and c ˆ m which depend on μ 1 and μ 3 3 2 2 choice of coefficients three parameters μ i i 1 2 3 need fixing such that mg equation approximates well its parents equation which is mcc equation all the way to the maximum amplitude in particular we look for the expression of μ i in terms of ρ 2 ρ 1 and h 2 h 1 so that mg equation can be used for any density and depth ratio considering that we are interested in the large amplitude solitary waves and their dynamics we first choose μ i such that the mg and mcc equations share some of the crucial characteristics of large amplitude solitary waves notice that the relation between c ˆ m and a given by 24 and the maximum amplitude given by 26 depend on only μ 1 and μ 3 therefore μ 1 and μ 3 are chosen to match the maximum amplitude and maximum wave speed of mg equation with those of the mcc equation then μ 1 and μ 3 can be found in terms of a m and c m as 27 μ 1 c 0 6 c m c 0 c 1 a m c m c 0 a m μ 3 c 0 6 c m c 0 2 c 3 a m 2 6 c 1 a m c m c 0 c 1 2 a m 2 c m c 0 2 a m 2 where a m and c m are the maximum amplitude and maximum wave speed of mcc eqaution separately in terms of density and depth ratios given by 28 a m h 1 h 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 c m 2 g h 1 h 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 with these choices of μ 1 and μ 3 the maximum amplitude and maximum wave speed of mg equation would match those of the mcc equation on the other hand the effective wavelength can be adjusted with μ 2 as γ 0 in 25 depends on μ 2 while it can be improved in various ways one possibility is to improve the linear dispersion relation or wave speed up to o ε 4 it should be noticed that the original gardner equation has the linear wave speed correct to o ε 2 when linearised the modified gardner equation has the linear wave speed c l i n m g given by 29 c l i n m g c 0 c 2 μ 2 k 2 1 μ 2 c 0 k 2 which can be approximated as c l i n m g c 0 c 2 k 2 c 2 μ 2 c 0 k 4 o ε 6 this wave speed can be matched up to o ε 4 with the exact linear wave speed given by 30 c l i n e u l e r g k ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 c o t h k h 1 ρ 2 c o t h k h 2 1 2 c 0 c 2 k 2 c 6 k 4 o ε 6 where c 6 is given by 31 c 6 3 c 2 2 2 c 0 c 0 h 1 h 2 ρ 1 h 1 3 ρ 2 h 2 3 90 ρ 1 h 2 ρ 2 h 1 by choosing μ 2 as 32 μ 2 c 0 c 6 c 2 with the this choice of μ 2 29 is equivalent to the pade 2 2 approximation to the fully linear dispersion relation given by 30 fig 6 shows the wave speed c c 0 and effective wavelength λ m g h 1 versus the wave amplitude for the kdv gardner ahou model proposed by choi et al 2020 mcc and modified gardner equation with fixed μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 given by 27 and 32 respectively as expected the kdv equation is valid only for small amplitude internal solitary waves the gardner equation shows better agreement with mcc than kdv when the amplitude is no longer small however the maximum amplitude for gardner equation is much less than that for mcc equation and the euler equation therefore these unidirectional models fail to describe large amplitude wave compared with kdv and gardner equation as shown in fig 6a mg equation improves the comparison considerably although it still under predicts the effective wavelength λ m g in comparison with the mcc effective wavelength for 0 a h 1 1 3 mg model exhibits better agreement with mcc model than ahou model proposed by choi et al 2020 as for 1 3 a h 1 a m the mg model underestimates while the ahou model overestimates the wavelength slightly both the mg model and ahou model are capable of depicting the wave profiles of large amplitude isws however considering that the amplitude of the isws generated by wave maker in each experimental run would not exceed a h 1 1 0285 1 3 mg model is much more suitable for simulation than ahou model in our work on the other hand fig 6b shows mg equation well approximates the relation between the solitary wave speed c c 0 and the wave amplitude the solitary wave speed for mg equation is slightly greater than that of mcc equation over a range of intermediate wave amplitude but the difference is insignificant therefore mg model is considered in the following discussion for large amplitude internal solitary waves 4 modified gardner with variable coefficients a variable coefficient kdv equation describing weakly nonlinear internal waves moving over bottom topography was first derived by djordjevic and redekopp 1978 see also grimshaw 1981 djordjevic and redekopp 1978 liu et al 1998 jo and choi 2002 grimshaw et al 2003 liu et al 2017 which is given by 33 ζ t c 0 x ζ x c 1 x ζ ζ x c 2 x ζ x x x 1 2 c 0 x ζ 0 where c i i 0 1 2 can be found with replacing h 2 in 11 by local lower layer thickness h 2 x and c 0 x d c 0 d x it should be noted that the depth variation is assumed to be small or more specifically b x o ε 3 2 a similar approach can be applied to the modified gardner model which yields the following modified gardner equation with variable coefficients 34 ζ t c 0 x ζ x c 1 x μ 1 x ζ ζ x c 2 x μ 2 x ζ x x x c 3 x μ 3 x ζ 2 ζ x μ 1 x c 0 x ζ ζ t c 1 ζ ζ x μ 2 x c 0 x ζ x x t μ 3 x c 0 x ζ 2 ζ t 1 2 c 0 x ζ ν d ζ 0 here μ i i 1 2 3 can be found from those of μ i chosen in section 3 2 2 with replacing h 2 by h 2 x the term 1 2 c 0 x is the shoaling coefficient and depends on the gradient of bottom topography variation cai et al 2002 liu et al 2017 liu et al 1998 the term d ζ is generally a nonlinear integro differential operator describing wave dissipation and ν is a small parameter for deep water in oceanographic condition d 2 ζ x 2 is commonly used to represent the effective horizontal eddy viscosity on the other hand chezy friction d ζ ζ is readily selected to depict the bottom friction and induced mixing for shallow water therefore the latter chezy friction is considered to be suitable for estimating energy dissipation in the numerical simulation for this study the small parameter ν concerning with water depth stratification and bottom topography can be calculated for two layer fluid system see grimshaw et al 2010 liu 2020 as 35 ν c d c h 1 2 h h 2 2 where c d 2 5 10 3 notice that with μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 0 eq 34 becomes the variable coefficient gardner equation for ζ eq 34 can be further written in conservation form as 36 u t f x 1 2 c 0 x ζ ν ζ ζ 0 where u and f are given by 16 and 17 separately however it should be noticed that the coefficients in u and f are function of x with b x 0 eq 34 becomes modified gardner equation 14 for flat bottom 4 1 numerical scheme a fourth order runge kutta method is applied for temporal discretization and second order central finite difference numerical scheme is implemented for the space discretization for numerical computations it is convenient to rewrite 36 as 37 u t f x 1 2 c 0 ζ ν ζ ζ once the right hand side of eq 37 is evaluated with the results from the previous time step u at the new time step can be obtained easily it should be noticed that ζ at a new time step cannot be calculated directly by inverting from 16 since the expression for u is nonlinear to solve this problem an iterative scheme described below can be applied for given time step i eq 16 can be rewritten as 38 l ζ i 1 u i n ζ i where l and n denotes linear and nonlinear operators of eq 16 separately defined by 39 l ζ 1 μ 2 c 0 2 x ζ n ζ μ 1 2 c 0 ζ 2 μ 3 3 c 0 ζ 3 at n th iteration 40 ζ n 1 ζ n δ ζ n where ζ n is the result from precious iteration step starting with ζ 0 ζ i i denotes the i th time step the correction δ ζ n can be determined by 41 δ ζ n l n ζ ζ n 1 l ζ n n ζ n u i where n ζ ζ is given by 42 n ζ ζ μ 1 c 0 ζ μ 3 c 0 ζ 2 notice that the linear operator l n ζ ζ n in 41 can be easily inverted numerically using tridiagonal solver more efficiently the iterative scheme is applied repeatedly until the following condition is satisfied 43 ζ n 1 ζ n ζ n ε where we adopt ε 1 10 10 for our computation presented hereafter then ζ i 1 at a new time step can be found by applying ζ i 1 ζ n 1 where n denotes the n th iteration at which the aforementioned error condition is satisfied eventually 4 2 validation of the numerical scheme while the solitary wave solution of mg equation compares well with that of mcc equation its applicability to time dependent problems is still uncertain and need to be tested here we solve numerically the mg equation with variable coefficients using the numerical scheme aforementioned the numerical results were compared with that from experiments conducted by wessels and hutter 1996 in his work the bottom topography is flat topped triangular obstruction and layer ratio is h 1 h 2 2 with total height of two layer of 20 cm see fig 2 in wessels and hutter 1996 for detail the same initial condition was applied in our numerical case fig 7 shows that the waveforms in our numerical simulation are similar with that in the experiment during the wave passing through the obstruction fig 8 indicates the comparison of interface displacement between the numerical results and the experiments the first figure at the first position shows the numerical results fits pretty good with the experimental ones except for the trailing wave which is not included in our initial conditions fig 8b c shows the wave profile in the numerical simulation compares fairly good with that of experiments except for the wave amplitude the wave amplitude increases dramatically with time in our numerical simulation than that in the experiment during the wave climbs the slope fig 8d shows that the wave amplitude in the numerical simulation coincide the experiment results according to eq 29 the phase speed of a nonlinear wave depends on its wave amplitude and increases with growing amplitude thus the phase speed in the numerical simulation is faster than that in the experiment which is due to the increase of the wave amplitude however as shown in fig 8e f the wave decays in a few distances while on the shelf after the slope it is worth noting that the internal solitary waves generated in stratified ocean and laboratory experiments generally incorporate a pycnocline with finite depth with the broadening of pycnocline the interface in two layer system would shift into the mid depth and the wave would propagate through the mid layer pycnocline as well following the explanation and results of cheng and hsu 2014 wave amplitude and potential wave energy on the plateau decreased with the pycnocline thickness growth as well as the wave speed however mg model is derived in strictly two layer system without incorporating of the effect of pycnocline thickness thus which could serve as one wave to interpret why the amplitude estimation of mg model shows slightly larger than that of experimental results to more accurately predicts the wave transformation when the isws propagate over the slope shelf topography mg model with continuously stratification should be further considered and will be presented in our future work however because of its simplicity the two layer model is often used as an approximation when studying long internal waves overall based on the comparison with experiments the numerical scheme in this study is proved to be a reliable tool to treat the vmg equation numerical simulation using vmg model can be applied to describe the behavior of isws propagating over the bottom topography 5 propagation over slope shelf topography previously numerous experiments have been performed for internal solitary waves propagating over topography typically from deep to shallow water in this paper under real oceanographic condition isws with large amplitudes are considered and the configuration of the slope shelf topography is shown in fig 1 with a length of l 30 m and depth of h 1 m the layer and density ratio of upper and lower layer were chosen to be h 1 h 2 1 4 and ρ 2 ρ 1 1 0285 respectively to illustrate a whole length waveform of an isw on the slope region the length of the slope designed in this study is greater than the wavelength of the incoming internal solitary wave three dimensionless amplitudes a h 1 0 34 0 705 1 2 of depression isws were discussed in this study in our experimental arrangement the thickness of upper layer h 1 0 2 m was greater than that of lower layer h 2 0 15 m above the horizontal plateau consequently on the slope region there is a critical point where h 1 h 2 1 one can expect polarity change of incoming solitary waves when an isw passing through the slope region the phenomenon of waveform inversion has been abundant reported by previous experimental and numerical study cheng and hsu 2010 helfrich and melville 2006 helfrich and melville 1986 helfrich 1984 fig 9 illustrates the propagation process of an isw of depression with wave amplitude a h 1 1 2 over the slope shelf topography while the depression isw propagated onto the slope fig 9a b and 9c it first caused a draw down of fluid from bottom layer on the plateau fig 9d e and 9f until the interface near turning point became nearly parallel to the slope boundary fig 9f the draw down action carried more fluid across the shoulder downwards along the slope and thus reduced the thickness of the lower layer at the upper reach of the slope fig 9g meantime an internal hydraulic jump was generated because of above process near the turning point fig 9g and then propagated along the slope towards the shoulder fig 9h upon reaching the shoulder the bore raised the level of the interface on the plateau eventually an elevation like internal wave iw emerged and commenced propagation onto the plateau fig 9i in addition the trailing wave downwards the slope emerged as the wave continued spreading across the plateau fig 9j fig 10 shows the time evolution of a single solitary wave for 0 t h 1 g 1 2 750 as it passes through the slope shelf topography given by fig 1 fig 10 illustrates elevation hydraulic jump emerges from the rear face of the wave and hence develops into rarefaction wave train with reduced wave amplitude the interface displacements recorded by four sequential ultrasonic probes probe 1 2 3 and 4 along the wave tank are shown in fig 11 as well as the numerical results of variable coefficient modified gardner equation 34 fig 11a indicates that the solitary solution of mg model compares well with the experimental measurement when the amplitude a h 1 1 2 is relatively large while the maximum amplitude of the mg model is a m a x h 1 1 4 from 26 as the isw propagates onto the slope region fig 11b the vmg model predicts well the waveform wave speed and the waveform inversion phenomenon even though the weakly nonlinear theory cannot model any instabilities however the numerical results could not exactly capture the same wavelength and wave phase speed of the trailing wave train the discrepancy is reasonable as the wave train has already appeared since the isw was produced by wave maker in the experiment whereas which is not included in the initial condition for numerical simulation as shown in fig 11c and d the frontal face of the wave becomes more gently sloping and correspondingly the rear face becomes much steeper this behavior of wave shoaling was also previously described in several experimental papers e g kao et al 1985 helfrich 1992 michallet and ivey 1999 however the numerical results slightly overestimate the amplitudes and hence the wave speed errors in amplitude and phase become significant at the rear of the trailing wave train even so it can be concluded that estimates with the two layer vmg model are quite satisfactory as discussed in section 4 2 pycnocline thickness could be one of the factors that causes the discrepancy in amplitude and phase speed between the theory and experimental results as the pycnocline broadened the mean wave speed of an isw of depression also reduced when the wave propagated on the front slope of the trapezoidal obstacle besides the modified gardner model cannot describe the breaking event of large amplitude isws over an inclined bottom with very steep slopes following the breaking criterion of the isw over the slope found by vlasenko and hutter 2002 the breaking event happened at the position with depth h b when h b satisfies the condition a m h b h m 0 8 γ 0 4 where h m is the undisturbed depth of the isopycnal of maximum depression a m is the wave amplitude if the water depth h s on the shelf is less than h b a solitary breaks down before it penetrates into a shallow water zone otherwise it passes through the slope as a dispersive wave train without breaking it should be noted that the breaking criterion is valid for the range of the examined parameters 0 52 γ 21 8 where γ is the slope angle in the case of the isw with the largest amplitude of a h 1 1 2 and the slope inclination is 5 3 in our laboratory experiments h b is calculated as 0 6356 which is larger than h s 0 35 it indicates that breaking event has occurred before the isw arrived at the shelf zone in this study however our modified gardner model is unable to exactly capture this phenomenon which can be achieved by solving reynolds equation with continuous vertical stratification nevertheless based on above comparison between the numerical result of vmg model and laboratory experiments it s found the two layer model can be used as an approximation when studying large amplitude isws passing over sloping bottom when one mainly cares about the variation of prominent wave during the evolution process 6 conclusion it s shown that the variable coefficient modified gardner equation originated from weakly nonlinear gardner equation model is capable of describing large amplitude internal solitary wave propagating over bottom topography in contrast to original gardner equation the modified gardner equation well depicts the wavelength wave speed and maximum amplitude by altering its coefficients it s worth mentioning that such coefficients depend only on the physical parameter that is depth and density ratio in addition the fourth order runge kutta method was applied for temporal discretization and second order central finite difference numerical scheme has been implemented for the space discretization meanwhile the iterative scheme particularly proposed in this study to treat the coupling term of time and space of vmg equation proves feasible in the numerical simulation furthermore the corresponding laboratory experiments were also carried out by introducing a new internal solitary wave generation technique which obviously improves the precision and efficiency when compared with the experiments it is found that vmg model well describes not only the wave profiles up to the maximum wave amplitude but also the dynamic characteristics when they pass over bottom topography consequently the numerical scheme in this study is proved to be a reliable tool to treat the variable coefficient modified gardner equation numerical simulation using variable coefficient modified

21011,the variable coefficient modified gardner equation is proposed to describe large amplitude internal solitary waves isws propagating over slope shelf topography the model is adapted from weakly nonlinear gardner equation by adjusting its original coefficients such that the model is capable of representing the crucial characteristics of large amplitude isws including the effective wavelength and wave speed to numerically solve the nonlinear equation the fourth order runge kutta method is applied for temporal discretization second order central finite difference numerical scheme is implemented for the space discretization and the iterative scheme is applied to treat the coupling term of time and space the numerical method is then verified by comparing fairly with laboratory experiments it s found the variable coefficient modified gardner model is a reliable theoretical tool to describe the behavior of large amplitude internal solitary waves passing through bottom topography keywords internal solitary wave strong nonlinearity strongly nonlinear theoretical model laboratory experiments two layer system slope shelf bottom topography 1 introduction internal solitary waves isws are ubiquitious features in coastal areas of the stratified oceans charaterized by large amplitude and strong current velocity helfrich and melville 2006 jackson 2007 examples have been widely reported worldwide in many regions osborne and burch 1980 kinder 1984 apel et al 1985 ostrovsky and stepanyants 1989 grimshaw et al 2006 scotti et al 2007 ramp et al 2010 cai et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 especially in the northern south china sea scs recently in northern scs an extreme isw with a maximum amplitude of 240m and current velocity of 2 55 m s was captured which is regared as one of the strongest isws of the world on record see huang et al 2016 such waves evoke enormous changes in ocean current and vertical thermal structures in a relatively time therefore knowledge of these waves are important on assessing their impact on underwater vehicles and offshore oil platforms as well as the marine biology and geology in the coastal oceans to describe the isws propagating over a region of variable depth the well known variable coefficient korteweg de vries kdv equation has been verified to be a suitable theoretical model as the amplitude of incoming isw is relatively small the variable coefficient kdv equation for internal waves was developed by ostrovsky and pelinovsky 1970 and later systematically derived by johnson 1973 while grimshaw and stewartson 1981 gave a detailed derivation for internal waves see also zhou and grimshaw 1989 and grimshaw et al 2010 comparing with experimental and fully nonlinear theoretical results grue et al 2011 showed that the kdv theory is relevant for small wave amplitude range but showcased a systematic deviation from experimental results for wave amplitudes exceeding 0 4 times the depth of the thinner layer upper layer for isws of depression not surprisingly kdv model fails to characterize the dynamics of large amplitude isws with amplitudes up to 100m and more observed since it is based on the weakly nonlinear long wave regime small 2001 kodaira et al 2016 la forgia and sciortino 2019 however kdv equation can be further improved by including an extra cubic nonlinear term whose coefficients has the opposite polarity to the coefficients of the linear dispersive term see the review by grimshaw 2016 which yields the so called gardner equation miyata 1988 grimshaw et al 2002 o driscoll and levine 2017 stanton and ostrovsky 1998 found that the extended kdv model did a good job of capturing characteristics of the highly nonlinear internal solitary waves from their observation nevertheless the extended kdv equation would generates table top solitons in the case that the initial wave amplitude tends close to the critical value in addition the extended kdv equation still fails to characterize the same maximum amplitude as the euler equation choi et al 2020 to exactly describe the properties of large amplitude isws many numerical strongly nonlinear models have been employed for both continuously stratified and multilayer fluids lamb 1994 grue et al 1997 lamb 2002 shimizu 2019 zhu et al 2018 isws solutions of the full nonlinear inviscid equations without consideration of effects of the earth s rotation can be obtained by solving the dubreil jacotin long djl equation turkington et al 1991 further extended by including background currents by stastna and lamb 2002 alternatively with the long wave assumption but no assumption on amplitude scale strongly nonlinear asymptotic model was proposed miyata 1985 miyata 1988 choi and camassa 1996 choi and camassa 1999 and is referred to as miyata choi camassa mcc model the solitary wave solution of mcc model is found to be in good agreement with both laboratory experiments michallet and barthelemy 1998 observations ostrovsky and grue 2003 and the numerical solutions of the euler equations camassa et al 2006 over a wide range of relative layer depth however as mentioned in our previous work choi et al 2020 mcc model would encounter kelvin helmholtz instability when solved numerically it s necessary to propose a new unidirectional model to predict the crucial characteristics of strongly nonlinear isws in the present work in order to describe large amplitude isws propagating over bottom topography we proposed modified gardner equation that extends the original gardner equation by adjusting its coefficients and adding further terms associated to the bottom topography which are function of x the original gardner equation is modified by changing its coefficients such that the adjusted modified gardner equation is capable of preserving the solitary wave characteristics of mcc model especially the maximum amplitude to show the good agreement the unsteady modified gardner equation is then compared with laboratory experimental measurements made by wessels and hutter 1996 and our experimental measurements in particular modified gardner equation can be supplemented with a damping term which is capable of describing wave dissipation in the numerical simulation when comparing with experimental results see liu et al 1998 cai et al 2002 and grimshaw et al 2003 for reviews on the topic of energy dissipation this paper is organized as follows after presenting our experimental set up and data processing techniques in section 2 we presented strongly nonlinear mcc model and proposed the modified gardner equation with adjusted coefficients in section 3 in section 4 the modified gardner equation is further generalized for variable bottom to solve the generalized model numerically the fourth order runge kutta method is applied for temporal discretization and second order central finite difference numerical scheme is implemented for the space discretization particularly iterative scheme is applied to deal with the coupling term of time and space then the numerical solution is compared with laboratory experimental measurements in section 5 the laboratory experiments of strongly nonlinear isws with large amplitude propagating over a slope shelf topography were carried out and also compared with numerical results of variable coefficient modified gardner equation concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 experimental setup and method 2 1 stratification and wave generation laboratory experiments were conducted for the propagation of an internal solitary wave over slope shelf topography in a two layer fresh brine fluid system within a wave flume at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu in china the flume is 30 m long with a cross section 1 2 m high and 0 6 m wide fig 1 the experimental apparatus consists of a trapezoidal obstacle made of smooth impermeable steel panel representing the slope shelf topography two sets of ultrasonic probes two digital video cameras with a resolution of 640 480 pixels and frame rate of 29 78 fps as shown in fig 1 besides other recording devices was also used to collect and record the conductivity measured from the probes the plateau is constructed by adding a plate with 13 m long and 0 6 m wide on the top of a frontal slope plate in each run the total fluid depth h h 1 h 2 was chosen to be 1 0 m the tank was first filled with fresh water of density ρ 1 998 k g m 3 up to afterwards the tank was filled with salt water of density ρ 2 1025 k g m 3 very gently through two mushroom shaped openings located at the bottom until the total depth reached h 1 0 m the salt water has been dyed red before it was injected into the flume to assist flow visualization fig 2 shows that the interface between fresh water and salt water is quite clear with the stratification approach furthermore h 1 0 2 m because the color of the lower layer is different from that of the upper layer the waveform variation can be more clearly observed as the wave propagates up the slope fig 3 a illustrates the measurement of density ρ and buoyancy frequency n profile when depth ratio h 1 h 2 1 4 the buoyancy frequency is given by n z g ρ 1 ρ z where g is the gravitational acceleration and ρ z represents density variation along the vertical direction as expected maximum buoyancy is located at the interface of two layer fluid as shown in fig 3b the wave generator was installed at the right side of the tank the wave tanker consists of two pistons vertically placed plates piston i and ii the upper piston i was moved to the direction of wave propagation while the lower one was moved to the opposite direction to generate an isw our method of wave generation by using two pistons was originally proposed by wessels and hutter 1996 however in their experiment the upper piston is surface piercing which may disturb the top free surface and generate the surface wave therefore in our experiment in order to minimize such effect caused by the upper piston i a rigid lid of 5 m long over upper layer was placed on the top of the fluid layer a wedge shaped wave absorber was placed on the most left hand size of the flume to suppress wave reflection as illustrated in fig 1 probe 1 recorded the interface displacement and waveform of the incoming internal solitary wave probe 2 was arranged at 2 m away from the shoulder on the slope region probe 3 and 4 measured the evolution of the transmitted wave at 0 2 m and 2 m from the shoulder on the horizontal plateau respectively 2 2 wave amplitude control and calibration to generate an internal solitary wave of amplitude a piston i and piston ii are accelerated to the mean velocities u 1 and u 2 respectively which are given by from mcc theory 1 u 1 c a h 1 a u 2 c a h 2 a where c denotes the phase speed the amplitudes measured by probe i are slightly different from input amplitude a due to friction and the finite pycnocline thickness nevertheless a linear relationship between the input amplitude a d and target amplitude a m can be found from series of experiments given by 2 a m h k a d h β where and β h 1 h 2 are the slope and the intercept of the best fit line respectively through a number of preliminary tests the values of k and β are determined for three different depth ratios as summarized in table 1 as seen from table 1 the slope k of the best fit line tends to increase as the depth ratio γ increases as shown in fig 4 the maximum error between the target amplitudes and the measured amplitudes of solitary generated by using eq 2 is found to be less than 5 in addition the internal solitary waves generated by aforementioned method are found reliably repeatable 3 theoretical model 3 1 strongly nonlinear mcc model the problem is considered in a cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 5 the main geometric parameters include the thickness of upper layer h 1 the original thickness of the lower layer h 2 the terrain height b x and the actual thickness of lower layer h 2 x the fluids of two layer are inviscid and incompressible with density ρ i i 1 2 the rigid lid condition is applied to the top surface boundary of the system with non uniform bottom topography the strongly nonlinear long wave model is given jo and choi 2002 by 3 η i t η i u i x 0 4 u 1 t u 1 u 1 x g ζ x p x ρ 1 1 η 1 1 3 η 1 3 g 1 x 5 u 2 t u 2 u 2 x g ζ x p x ρ 2 1 η 2 1 3 η 2 3 g 2 x 1 η 2 1

the local layer thickness η i i 1 2 and the thickness average velocity u i are given by 6 η 1 h 1 ζ u 1 x t 1 η 1 ζ h 1 u 1 x z t d z 7 η 2 h 2 b x ζ u 2 x t 1 η 2 h 2 b x ζ u 2 x z t d z and the nonlinear dispersive term g i are defined by 8 g 1 x t u 1 x t u 1 u 1 x x u 1 x 2 g 2 x t u 2 x t u 2 u 2 x x u 2 x 2 with h 2 given by 9 h 2 t u 2 x u 2 b x the model assumes h 2 h 1 o 1 and has an error of o ε 4 where the ε h 1 λ 1 with λ being characteristic wavelength is dispersive parameter on the other hand nonlinear parameter defined by α a h 1 is assumed o 1 which has been assumed to be small for weakly nonlinear model therefore this model is expected to describe the evolution of large amplitude internal solitary waves 3 2 modified gardner equation while there exist a number of theoretical models for uni directional waves we use an asymptotic model introduced by choi 2019 which is hereafter referred to as the modified gardner equation the model derivation and the choice of coefficients in choi 2019 are repeated here for completeness 3 2 1 derivation considering the complexity of mcc model especially when being solved numerically we hope to find a relatively simple unidirectional model which can be used for a wide range of wave amplitudes including the maximum to this end the well known gardner equation kakutani and yamasaki 1978 is taken into consideration 10 ζ

first replace c i by c i μ i μ i with parameter μ i to be determined which yields 12 ζ t c 0 ζ x c 1 μ 1 ζ ζ x c 2 μ 2 ζ x x x c 3 μ 3 ζ 2 ζ x μ 1 ζ ζ x μ 2 ζ x x x μ 3 ζ 2 ζ x o α 2 ε 3 α ε 5 from the leading order terms of eq 10 we have the following assumption 13 ζ x 1 c 0 ζ t c 1 ζ ζ x o α 2 ε α ε 3 by applying 13 to the terms proportional to μ i eq 12 becomes under the same order of

3 0 eq 14 becomes the gardner equation 10 eq 14 can be written in conservation form as 15 u t f x 0 where u and f are given by 16 u ζ μ 1 2 c 0 ζ 2 μ 3 3 c 0 ζ 3 μ 2 c 0 ζ x x 17 f c 0 x ζ 1 2 c 1 μ 1 ζ 2 c 2 μ 2 ζ x x 1 3 c 3 μ 3 c 1 μ 1 c 0 ζ 3 hereafter eq 14 will be referred to as the modified gardner mg equation which can be shown to conserve not only u but also the energy given by 18 ε m g 1 2 ζ 2 μ 1 3 c 0 ζ 3 μ 3 4 c 0 ζ 4 μ 2 2 c 0 ζ x 2 d x for travelling wave solution of eq 14 with x x c t after assuming ζ x t ζ x c t with c being the wave speed and imposing ζ ζ x 0 at infinity the system given by 14 can be reduced to 19 c 2 c ˆ c 0 1 μ 2 ζ x 2 ζ 2 c ˆ c 0 1 3 c 1 c ˆ c 0 1 μ 1 ζ 1 6 c 3 c 1 c 0 μ 1 c ˆ c 0 1 μ 3 ζ 2 which can be written as 20 ζ x 2 γ 0 ζ 2 ζ 2 γ 1 ζ γ 2 γ 0 c ˆ 3 6 c ˆ 2 γ 1 2 c ˆ 1 c ˆ 3 γ 2 6 c ˆ c 0 c ˆ 3 where 21 c ˆ 1 c 1 c ˆ c 0 μ 1 c 0 c ˆ 2 c 2 c ˆ c 0 μ 2 c 0 c ˆ 3 c 3 c 1 μ 1 c 0 c ˆ c 0 μ 3 c 0 the solitary wave solution of eq 14 can be written explicitly in terms of elementary functions as 22 ζ x a b ˆ 1 b ˆ cosh 2 k ˆ x x x c ˆ t where b ˆ and k ˆ given by 23 b ˆ a 2 γ 2 k ˆ γ 0 γ 2 1 2 2 from ζ x 0 with ζ a the wave speed c ˆ of the solitary wave of the mg equation can be found as 24 c ˆ c 0 2 c 1 a c 3 c 1 μ 1 c 0 a 2 6 2 μ 1 c 0 a μ 3 c 0 a 2 while the effective wavelength of the mg model is given by 25 λ m g 2 a γ 0 1 2 t a n h 1 a γ 0 1 2 the maximum amplitude can be found as a ˆ m γ 1 2 which yields 26 a ˆ m c 1 c ˆ m c 0 μ 1 c 0 c 3 c 1 μ 1 c 0 c ˆ m c 0 μ 3 c 0 when 26 is combined with 24 with a a ˆ m one can find the expression of a ˆ m and c ˆ m which depend on μ 1 and μ 3 3 2 2 choice of coefficients three parameters μ i i 1 2 3 need fixing such that mg equation approximates well its parents equation which is mcc equation all the way to the maximum amplitude in particular we look for the expression of μ i in terms of ρ 2 ρ 1 and h 2 h 1 so that mg equation can be used for any density and depth ratio considering that we are interested in the large amplitude solitary waves and their dynamics we first choose μ i such that the mg and mcc equations share some of the crucial characteristics of large amplitude solitary waves notice that the relation between c ˆ m and a given by 24 and the maximum amplitude given by 26 depend on only μ 1 and μ 3 therefore μ 1 and μ 3 are chosen to match the maximum amplitude and maximum wave speed of mg equation with those of the mcc equation then μ 1 and μ 3 can be found in terms of a m and c m as 27 μ 1 c 0 6 c m c 0 c 1 a m c m c 0 a m μ 3 c 0 6 c m c 0 2 c 3 a m 2 6 c 1 a m c m c 0 c 1 2 a m 2 c m c 0 2 a m 2 where a m and c m are the maximum amplitude and maximum wave speed of mcc eqaution separately in terms of density and depth ratios given by 28 a m h 1 h 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 c m 2 g h 1 h 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 with these choices of μ 1 and μ 3 the maximum amplitude and maximum wave speed of mg equation would match those of the mcc equation on the other hand the effective wavelength can be adjusted with μ 2 as γ 0 in 25 depends on μ 2 while it can be improved in various ways one possibility is to improve the linear dispersion relation or wave speed up to o ε 4 it should be noticed that the original gardner equation has the linear wave speed correct to o ε 2 when linearised the modified gardner equation has the linear wave speed c l i n m g given by 29 c l i n m g c 0 c 2 μ 2 k 2 1 μ 2 c 0 k 2 which can be approximated as c l i n m g c 0 c 2 k 2 c 2 μ 2 c 0 k 4 o ε 6 this wave speed can be matched up to o ε 4 with the exact linear wave speed given by 30 c l i n e u l e r g k ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 c o t h k h 1 ρ 2 c o t h k h 2 1 2 c 0 c 2 k 2 c 6 k 4 o ε 6 where c 6 is given by 31 c 6 3 c 2 2 2 c 0 c 0 h 1 h 2 ρ 1 h 1 3 ρ 2 h 2 3 90 ρ 1 h 2 ρ 2 h 1 by choosing μ 2 as 32 μ 2 c 0 c 6 c 2 with the this choice of μ 2 29 is equivalent to the pade 2 2 approximation to the fully linear dispersion relation given by 30 fig 6 shows the wave speed c c 0 and effective wavelength λ m g h 1 versus the wave amplitude for the kdv gardner ahou model proposed by choi et al 2020 mcc and modified gardner equation with fixed μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 given by 27 and 32 respectively as expected the kdv equation is valid only for small amplitude internal solitary waves the gardner equation shows better agreement with mcc than kdv when the amplitude is no longer small however the maximum amplitude for gardner equation is much less than that for mcc equation and the euler equation therefore these unidirectional models fail to describe large amplitude wave compared with kdv and gardner equation as shown in fig 6a mg equation improves the comparison considerably although it still under predicts the effective wavelength λ m g in comparison with the mcc effective wavelength for 0 a h 1 1 3 mg model exhibits better agreement with mcc model than ahou model proposed by choi et al 2020 as for 1 3 a h 1 a m the mg model underestimates while the ahou model overestimates the wavelength slightly both the mg model and ahou model are capable of depicting the wave profiles of large amplitude isws however considering that the amplitude of the isws generated by wave maker in each experimental run would not exceed a h 1 1 0285 1 3 mg model is much more suitable for simulation than ahou model in our work on the other hand fig 6b shows mg equation well approximates the relation between the solitary wave speed c c 0 and the wave amplitude the solitary wave speed for mg equation is slightly greater than that of mcc equation over a range of intermediate wave amplitude but the difference is insignificant therefore mg model is considered in the following discussion for large amplitude internal solitary waves 4 modified gardner with variable coefficients a variable coefficient kdv equation describing weakly nonlinear internal waves moving over bottom topography was first derived by djordjevic and redekopp 1978 see also grimshaw 1981 djordjevic and redekopp 1978 liu et al 1998 jo and choi 2002 grimshaw et al 2003 liu et al 2017 which is given by 33 ζ t c 0 x ζ x c 1 x ζ ζ x c 2 x ζ x x x 1 2 c 0 x ζ 0 where c i i 0 1 2 can be found with replacing h 2 in 11 by local lower layer thickness h 2 x and c 0 x d c 0 d x it should be noted that the depth variation is assumed to be small or more specifically b x o ε 3 2 a similar approach can be applied to the modified gardner model which yields the following modified gardner equation with variable coefficients 34 ζ t c 0 x ζ x c 1 x μ 1 x ζ ζ x c 2 x μ 2 x ζ x x x c 3 x μ 3 x ζ 2 ζ x μ 1 x c 0 x ζ ζ t c 1 ζ ζ x μ 2 x c 0 x ζ x x t μ 3 x c 0 x ζ 2 ζ t 1 2 c 0 x ζ ν d ζ 0 here μ i i 1 2 3 can be found from those of μ i chosen in section 3 2 2 with replacing h 2 by h 2 x the term 1 2 c 0 x is the shoaling coefficient and depends on the gradient of bottom topography variation cai et al 2002 liu et al 2017 liu et al 1998 the term d ζ is generally a nonlinear integro differential operator describing wave dissipation and ν is a small parameter for deep water in oceanographic condition d 2 ζ x 2 is commonly used to represent the effective horizontal eddy viscosity on the other hand chezy friction d ζ ζ is readily selected to depict the bottom friction and induced mixing for shallow water therefore the latter chezy friction is considered to be suitable for estimating energy dissipation in the numerical simulation for this study the small parameter ν concerning with water depth stratification and bottom topography can be calculated for two layer fluid system see grimshaw et al 2010 liu 2020 as 35 ν c d c h 1 2 h h 2 2 where c d 2 5 10 3 notice that with μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 0 eq 34 becomes the variable coefficient gardner equation for ζ eq 34 can be further written in conservation form as 36 u t f x 1 2 c 0 x ζ ν ζ ζ 0 where u and f are given by 16 and 17 separately however it should be noticed that the coefficients in u and f are function of x with b x 0 eq 34 becomes modified gardner equation 14 for flat bottom 4 1 numerical scheme a fourth order runge kutta method is applied for temporal discretization and second order central finite difference numerical scheme is implemented for the space discretization for numerical computations it is convenient to rewrite 36 as 37 u t f x 1 2 c 0 ζ ν ζ ζ once the right hand side of eq 37 is evaluated with the results from the previous time step u at the new time step can be obtained easily it should be noticed that ζ at a new time step cannot be calculated directly by inverting from 16 since the expression for u is nonlinear to solve this problem an iterative scheme described below can be applied for given time step i eq 16 can be rewritten as 38 l ζ i 1 u i n ζ i where l and n denotes linear and nonlinear operators of eq 16 separately defined by 39 l ζ 1 μ 2 c 0 2 x ζ n ζ μ 1 2 c 0 ζ 2 μ 3 3 c 0 ζ 3 at n th iteration 40 ζ n 1 ζ n δ ζ n where ζ n is the result from precious iteration step starting with ζ 0 ζ i i denotes the i th time step the correction δ ζ n can be determined by 41 δ ζ n l n ζ ζ n 1 l ζ n n ζ n u i where n ζ ζ is given by 42 n ζ ζ μ 1 c 0 ζ μ 3 c 0 ζ 2 notice that the linear operator l n ζ ζ n in 41 can be easily inverted numerically using tridiagonal solver more efficiently the iterative scheme is applied repeatedly until the following condition is satisfied 43 ζ n 1 ζ n ζ n ε where we adopt ε 1 10 10 for our computation presented hereafter then ζ i 1 at a new time step can be found by applying ζ i 1 ζ n 1 where n denotes the n th iteration at which the aforementioned error condition is satisfied eventually 4 2 validation of the numerical scheme while the solitary wave solution of mg equation compares well with that of mcc equation its applicability to time dependent problems is still uncertain and need to be tested here we solve numerically the mg equation with variable coefficients using the numerical scheme aforementioned the numerical results were compared with that from experiments conducted by wessels and hutter 1996 in his work the bottom topography is flat topped triangular obstruction and layer ratio is h 1 h 2 2 with total height of two layer of 20 cm see fig 2 in wessels and hutter 1996 for detail the same initial condition was applied in our numerical case fig 7 shows that the waveforms in our numerical simulation are similar with that in the experiment during the wave passing through the obstruction fig 8 indicates the comparison of interface displacement between the numerical results and the experiments the first figure at the first position shows the numerical results fits pretty good with the experimental ones except for the trailing wave which is not included in our initial conditions fig 8b c shows the wave profile in the numerical simulation compares fairly good with that of experiments except for the wave amplitude the wave amplitude increases dramatically with time in our numerical simulation than that in the experiment during the wave climbs the slope fig 8d shows that the wave amplitude in the numerical simulation coincide the experiment results according to eq 29 the phase speed of a nonlinear wave depends on its wave amplitude and increases with growing amplitude thus the phase speed in the numerical simulation is faster than that in the experiment which is due to the increase of the wave amplitude however as shown in fig 8e f the wave decays in a few distances while on the shelf after the slope it is worth noting that the internal solitary waves generated in stratified ocean and laboratory experiments generally incorporate a pycnocline with finite depth with the broadening of pycnocline the interface in two layer system would shift into the mid depth and the wave would propagate through the mid layer pycnocline as well following the explanation and results of cheng and hsu 2014 wave amplitude and potential wave energy on the plateau decreased with the pycnocline thickness growth as well as the wave speed however mg model is derived in strictly two layer system without incorporating of the effect of pycnocline thickness thus which could serve as one wave to interpret why the amplitude estimation of mg model shows slightly larger than that of experimental results to more accurately predicts the wave transformation when the isws propagate over the slope shelf topography mg model with continuously stratification should be further considered and will be presented in our future work however because of its simplicity the two layer model is often used as an approximation when studying long internal waves overall based on the comparison with experiments the numerical scheme in this study is proved to be a reliable tool to treat the vmg equation numerical simulation using vmg model can be applied to describe the behavior of isws propagating over the bottom topography 5 propagation over slope shelf topography previously numerous experiments have been performed for internal solitary waves propagating over topography typically from deep to shallow water in this paper under real oceanographic condition isws with large amplitudes are considered and the configuration of the slope shelf topography is shown in fig 1 with a length of l 30 m and depth of h 1 m the layer and density ratio of upper and lower layer were chosen to be h 1 h 2 1 4 and ρ 2 ρ 1 1 0285 respectively to illustrate a whole length waveform of an isw on the slope region the length of the slope designed in this study is greater than the wavelength of the incoming internal solitary wave three dimensionless amplitudes a h 1 0 34 0 705 1 2 of depression isws were discussed in this study in our experimental arrangement the thickness of upper layer h 1 0 2 m was greater than that of lower layer h 2 0 15 m above the horizontal plateau consequently on the slope region there is a critical point where h 1 h 2 1 one can expect polarity change of incoming solitary waves when an isw passing through the slope region the phenomenon of waveform inversion has been abundant reported by previous experimental and numerical study cheng and hsu 2010 helfrich and melville 2006 helfrich and melville 1986 helfrich 1984 fig 9 illustrates the propagation process of an isw of depression with wave amplitude a h 1 1 2 over the slope shelf topography while the depression isw propagated onto the slope fig 9a b and 9c it first caused a draw down of fluid from bottom layer on the plateau fig 9d e and 9f until the interface near turning point became nearly parallel to the slope boundary fig 9f the draw down action carried more fluid across the shoulder downwards along the slope and thus reduced the thickness of the lower layer at the upper reach of the slope fig 9g meantime an internal hydraulic jump was generated because of above process near the turning point fig 9g and then propagated along the slope towards the shoulder fig 9h upon reaching the shoulder the bore raised the level of the interface on the plateau eventually an elevation like internal wave iw emerged and commenced propagation onto the plateau fig 9i in addition the trailing wave downwards the slope emerged as the wave continued spreading across the plateau fig 9j fig 10 shows the time evolution of a single solitary wave for 0 t h 1 g 1 2 750 as it passes through the slope shelf topography given by fig 1 fig 10 illustrates elevation hydraulic jump emerges from the rear face of the wave and hence develops into rarefaction wave train with reduced wave amplitude the interface displacements recorded by four sequential ultrasonic probes probe 1 2 3 and 4 along the wave tank are shown in fig 11 as well as the numerical results of variable coefficient modified gardner equation 34 fig 11a indicates that the solitary solution of mg model compares well with the experimental measurement when the amplitude a h 1 1 2 is relatively large while the maximum amplitude of the mg model is a m a x h 1 1 4 from 26 as the isw propagates onto the slope region fig 11b the vmg model predicts well the waveform wave speed and the waveform inversion phenomenon even though the weakly nonlinear theory cannot model any instabilities however the numerical results could not exactly capture the same wavelength and wave phase speed of the trailing wave train the discrepancy is reasonable as the wave train has already appeared since the isw was produced by wave maker in the experiment whereas which is not included in the initial condition for numerical simulation as shown in fig 11c and d the frontal face of the wave becomes more gently sloping and correspondingly the rear face becomes much steeper this behavior of wave shoaling was also previously described in several experimental papers e g kao et al 1985 helfrich 1992 michallet and ivey 1999 however the numerical results slightly overestimate the amplitudes and hence the wave speed errors in amplitude and phase become significant at the rear of the trailing wave train even so it can be concluded that estimates with the two layer vmg model are quite satisfactory as discussed in section 4 2 pycnocline thickness could be one of the factors that causes the discrepancy in amplitude and phase speed between the theory and experimental results as the pycnocline broadened the mean wave speed of an isw of depression also reduced when the wave propagated on the front slope of the trapezoidal obstacle besides the modified gardner model cannot describe the breaking event of large amplitude isws over an inclined bottom with very steep slopes following the breaking criterion of the isw over the slope found by vlasenko and hutter 2002 the breaking event happened at the position with depth h b when h b satisfies the condition a m h b h m 0 8 γ 0 4 where h m is the undisturbed depth of the isopycnal of maximum depression a m is the wave amplitude if the water depth h s on the shelf is less than h b a solitary breaks down before it penetrates into a shallow water zone otherwise it passes through the slope as a dispersive wave train without breaking it should be noted that the breaking criterion is valid for the range of the examined parameters 0 52 γ 21 8 where γ is the slope angle in the case of the isw with the largest amplitude of a h 1 1 2 and the slope inclination is 5 3 in our laboratory experiments h b is calculated as 0 6356 which is larger than h s 0 35 it indicates that breaking event has occurred before the isw arrived at the shelf zone in this study however our modified gardner model is unable to exactly capture this phenomenon which can be achieved by solving reynolds equation with continuous vertical stratification nevertheless based on above comparison between the numerical result of vmg model and laboratory experiments it s found the two layer model can be used as an approximation when studying large amplitude isws passing over sloping bottom when one mainly cares about the variation of prominent wave during the evolution process 6 conclusion it s shown that the variable coefficient modified gardner equation originated from weakly nonlinear gardner equation model is capable of describing large amplitude internal solitary wave propagating over bottom topography in contrast to original gardner equation the modified gardner equation well depicts the wavelength wave speed and maximum amplitude by altering its coefficients it s worth mentioning that such coefficients depend only on the physical parameter that is depth and density ratio in addition the fourth order runge kutta method was applied for temporal discretization and second order central finite difference numerical scheme has been implemented for the space discretization meanwhile the iterative scheme particularly proposed in this study to treat the coupling term of time and space of vmg equation proves feasible in the numerical simulation furthermore the corresponding laboratory experiments were also carried out by introducing a new internal solitary wave generation technique which obviously improves the precision and efficiency when compared with the experiments it is found that vmg model well describes not only the wave profiles up to the maximum wave amplitude but also the dynamic characteristics when they pass over bottom topography consequently the numerical scheme in this study is proved to be a reliable tool to treat the variable coefficient modified gardner equation numerical simulation using variable coefficient modified gardner equation model can be applied to describe the behavior of large amplitude isws propagating over the bottom topography credit authorship contribution statement changhong zhi methodology

reynolds averaged statistics and the vortical structures are presented and discussed dynamic mode decomposition dmd is applied to study the flow in the wake region behind the square structure the dynamically important modes are extracted by further using a sparsity promoted algorithm the temporal information of the modes is compared with the results of the frequency analysis the reduced order model of the flow field is constructed by the modes and shows good agreement with the numerical simulation results keywords wall mounted square structure cfd turbulence saddes dynamic mode decomposition 1 introduction turbulent flows around wall mounted structures commonly occur in many engineering problems for instance glass reinforced plastic grp covers are used to protect the subsea installations such as pipelines from the potential damages caused by dropped objects and fishing gears for the stable installation of the subsea covers it is essential to obtain the hydrodynamic forces on them the wall mounted structures have also been used to enhance the heat transfer in gas turbines combustion ducts and heat exchangers acharya et al 1994 hwang et al 1999 other applications can be found in protrusive devices on various transportations such as racing cars aircrafts and ships dai et al 2017 the flows around the wall mounted structures display complex separation and reattachment features and induce complicate vortex arrangement in the separation region behind the structures as a result it is of great importance to study the flow characteristics around the structures a common simplified model of these wall mounted structures is a square cylinder lying on a flat wall which is investigated in the present study numerous studies have been conducted to study the flow around wall mounted structures early studies include arie et al 1975 where experiments have been conducted to study the pressure distribution around square structures subjected to a turbulent boundary layer at reynolds numbers of 3 4 10 4 r e 1 19 10 5 defined as r e u d ν where u is the free stream velocity and d is the height of the structure and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and tropea and gackstatter 1985 where the experiments of the flow past a wall mounted rectangular ribs were conducted in a channel at low reynolds numbers of 150 r e h 4500 defined based on the width of the channel experiments have also been performed by martinuzzi et al 1993 on the flows over square ribs with different spanwise lengths w d of the structures w is the spanwise length and d is the height of the structures of the ribs it was found that the flow in the middle region of the wake behind the structures with w d 6 and the flow in front of the rib with w d 10 are essentially two dimensional bergeles and athanassiadis 1983 studied the recirculation length around a two dimensional 2d rectangular ribs using a single hot wire and showed that the length of the recirculation region in front of the structures remains unchanged with the structure length while the length of the recirculation behind the structures varies linearly with the structure length liu et al 2008 analyzed the spatio temporal characteristics of the unsteady separation and reattachment of turbulent flows over a 2d square rib at r e 1 32 10 4 using experiments the frequency features of the shedding large scale vortex and the flapping separation bubbles were determined by the wall pressure spectra despite experiments numerical simulations were also adopted to study the turbulent boundary flow over wall mounted structures hwang et al 1999 employed 2d rans reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations of the turbulent flow past a 2d rib with different length to height ratios using the standard k ε model acharya et al 1994 used steady rans simulations to predict the mean streamwise velocity and the turbulence intensity of the flow behind a wall mounted 2d rib ryu et al 2007 used rans simulations based on the k ε model on the turbulent channel flow over 2d rib structures with different shapes to study the different drag forces and flow characteristics at r e 2 10 4 the previous numerical simulations on the flow around 2d wall mounted structures are largely carried out using the steady rans since the wall can suppress the large scale vortex shedding behind the structures however unsteady flow behaviors have been observed in the wake region behind the structures such as rolling up of vortices and a flapping separation bubbles reported by liu et al 2008 which cannot be studied based on the steady rans because only the time averaged flow characteristics can be captured in the steady rans simulations large eddy simulation les was used to investigate the temporal behavior of the wake flow behind bluff bodies in various studies reported by tian et al 2014 prsic et al 2018 and li et al 2018 however the computational cost of les at high reynolds numbers is high detached eddy simulations des proposed by spalart et al 1997 which is less computationally expensive can be used for this purpose the des method is a combination of a rans model in the attached boundary layer near the walls and a les method in the separated regions away from the walls an improvement to the standard des spalart et al 1997 was proposed by spalart et al 2006 known as delayed des ddes to delay the switching from rans to les in the boundary layers the method can prevent the artificial grid induced separation gis a detailed comparison was made by boudreau et al 2017 between the ddes simulation and urans unsteady rans simulation to show the ability of ddes in accurately capturing the wake behavior behind a square cylinder at r e o 10 4 furthermore the ddes simulation was adopted by ong et al 2017 to study the flow structures around monopile and gravity based wind turbine foundations at a high reynolds number of r e 4 10 6 in the present study 3d spalart allmaras ddes saddes method has been employed to investigate the unsteady flow in the wake region behind a wall mounted square structures to further understand the simulation results the flow is analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition dmd schmid 2010 to quantify the dynamical properties of the velocity fluctuations the method was proposed based on the koopman operator theory of dynamical systems rowley et al 2009 bagheri 2013 the dynamic information can be extracted from a time resolved flow fields obtained by either numerical simulations schmid 2010 tu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 or experimental data schmid 2011 schmid et al 2012 he et al 2013 seena and sung 2013 tissot et al 2013 2014 the dmd method is regarded as an extension of the global stability analysis of a linear system however the explicit equations of the dynamical system are not required and it can be used as a data driven method for nonlinear systems such as the fully turbulence a widely adopted method to extract important features is the proper orthogonal decomposition pod proposed by lumely 1967 however the pod modes are selected according to their energy and their temporal information is missing the dmd method assumes that the temporal evolution of the dynamical system is governed by a linear operator but it can still be applied to the nonlinear system and in fluid mechanics it is used to extract the coherent structures from the flow fields the organization of the present paper is outlined as follows the mathematical formulation and numerical methods are given in section 2 the convergence studies and validation studies are presented in section 3 the results and discussion in terms of hydrodynamics quantities power spectra analysis of the fluctuations instantaneous flow structures and dmd modes are given in section 4 finally a conclusion is made for the present study 2 mathematical formulation and numerical method 2 1 mathematical formulation in the framework of ddes the governing equations for the incompressible flow are filtered navier stokes equations given as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j where i j 1 2 3 for x y z is the streamwise cross stream and spanwise directions respectively u 1 u 2 u 3 for u v w are their corresponding resolved velocity components u i u j are the unresolved stresses which are modeled by 3 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i an additional transport equation is used to calculate the modified viscosity ν which can be found in spalart et al 2006 and is not described in detailed here ν is associated with the eddy viscosity ν t as 4 ν t ν f v 1 f v 1 x 3 x 3 c v 1 3 x ν ν t where c v 1 7 1 in the present study the f v 3 implementation rumsey et al 2001 for the spalart allmaras version is used to determine the terms in the transport equation of ν in the original des formulation the distance between a point in the flow domain and the wall d in the destruction term of the viscosity transport equation is modified as 5 d m i n d c d e s δ where c d e s 0 65 is a constant and δ is the length scale associated with the local grid spacings in the three directions 6 δ m a x δ x δ y δ z ddes is proposed to overcome the issue of grid induced separation gis by delaying the transition from rans in the attached boundary layer region to les in the separation region away from the wall in this method d is modified as 7 d d f d m a x 0 d c d e s δ where f d is a filter function designed to be 0 in the rans region and 1 in the les region 2 2 numerical methods openfoam an open source computational fluid dynamic cfd code is used in the present study the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators scheme is used the spatial schemes for gradient laplacian and divergence are gauss linear bounded gauss linear upwind and gauss linear limited corrected respectively 3 computational overview 3 1 computational domain the computational domain is shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinates is located at the center of the bottom edge of the wall mounted square structures the length and height of the computational domain are 50 d and 20 d respectively the spanwise length l z will be determined in the next section the distance between the inlet boundary and the center of the bottom edge of the square structure is set to be l u 11 5 d and the distance between the outlet boundary and the center of the bottom edge of the structure is set to be l d 40 5 d this inlet length is larger than that used in ong et al 2010 where numerical simulations were carried out for the flow around a cylinder close to a flat wall at r e 3 6 10 6 with an inlet length of 10 d the outlet length is also larger than that used in the previous similar numerical studies such as young et al 2006 at with l d 20 d ong et al 2009 2010 at r e o 10 6 with l d 20 d tian et al 2014 at r e 1 5 10 5 with l d 20 d and tian et al 2016 at r e 1 5 10 5 with l d 15 d based on these studies the size of the domain in the xy plane is large enough to suppress any far field effects the boundary conditions for the simulations are set as follows 1 a seabed boundary layer flow with a logarithmic horizontal velocity profile is used at the inlet boundary in x direction the logarithmic velocity profile with a boundary layer thickness of δ 0 73 d is adapted by curve fitting of the boundary layer profile obtained in the experiments done by arie et al 1975 the obtained velocity profile is shown in fig 2 compared with the experimental velocity profile reported by arie et al 1975 the velocity in y and z direction is set to be zero the inlet turbulent quantities are prescribed by implementing the turbulent viscosity which is given by 8 ν t c μ k 2 ε using the definition in the k ε model with c μ 0 09 the turbulent kinetic energy k and the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy ε are given by 9 k max c μ 1 2 1 z δ 2 u τ 2 0 0001 u 2 if z δ 0 0001 u 2 if z δ 10 ε c μ 3 4 k 3 2 l where the turbulent length scale l is given by l min κ y 1 3 5 y δ 1 c μ δ with κ 0 41 the same method for prescribing the turbulent viscosity has also been used ong et al 2017 where spalart allmaras ddes model was also adopted 2 no slip condition u v w 0 is applied on the bottom and the surface of the square structure the pressure is set to be zero normal gradient in the present study the flow around the square surface is fully developed turbulent and a wall function based on the spalding s law of the wall spalding 1961 is applied for the near wall region 3 at the outlet and top boundaries the velocities pressure and ν t are set as zero normal gradient 4 the periodic boundary conditions are used for all the variables on the two xy planes in the spanwise directions a parallel computing technique is used for the simulations on a distributed memory system in a notur project and the computational domain is divided into 128 or 256 subdomains based on different cell numbers 3 2 convergence studies convergence studies are carried out to determine the spanwise length the grid and time resolutions of the simulations the parameters and the results are shown in table 1 δ t is the time step and all the simulations are run for a non dimensional time of 1000 d u u is the free stream velocity and a total computational time in a range of 38400 128000 cpu hours is used for each case the time averaged drag coefficients and lift coefficients of different cases are considered which are defined as follows 11 c d f x 1 2 ρ u 2 d l z 12 c l f y 1 2 ρ u 2 d l z where f x is the total force obtained by integrating the pressure and the shear stress acting on the surfaces of the square structure in x direction and f y is the force in y direction first results of case 1 case 3 with different grids numbers in xy plane and the same l z grids number in z direction and δ t show that there is no significant difference in c d and the relative difference among c l of the three cases are within 4 7 then c d and c l of case 2 and case 4 with different l z and the same grid resolution in z direction shows that when increasing l z from 4 to 8 the relative difference between c d is within 1 while the relative difference between c l is 4 3 indicating that l z 4 is enough to provide converged results and this value is adopted for the other simulations the relative difference between c d of case 1 and case 5 with different δ t is less than 1 and the relative difference between c l is within 2 therefore δ t 0 001 is used for all the rest simulations in the present study it worth mentioning that the minimal taylor time scale defined as τ λ 15 ν ε 1 2 of the present study is calculated to be 0 04 and the time step of δ t 0 001 is much smaller than the minimal taylor time scale and hence also smaller than the large eddy scales with a finer grid resolution in z direction for case 6 both c d and c l decrease compared with case 3 however the relative differences for case 6 from case 3 is within 1 and 2 for the two quantities furthermore the time and spanwise averaged streamwise velocity u u and the pressure coefficient c p defined as 2 p p ρ u 2 where p is chosen such that c p at the front stagnation point on the front face of the structure is unity along the streamwise direction at y 0 5 are compared among different cases as shown in fig 3 it is shown that the results agree well with each other which indicate that the grid and time step convergences have been achieved fig 4 shows an example of the meshes of case 5 in table 1 in the xy plane and the yz plane 3 3 validation studies validation studies are conducted by comparing the converged results of case 6 in table 1 with the published data the c d value of case 6 is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data of c d 0 96 reported by arie et al 1975 with a relative difference of 10 8 and the numerical data of c d 1 02 obtained by 2d rans simulation reported by tauqeer et al 2017 with a relative difference of 5 2 further validation studies are done by comparing u u at different streamwise locations of x d 0 9 0 9 5 5 and x d 0 5 0 0 5 on the top of the square with the experimental data in turbulent channel flows reported by crabb et al 1977 as well as acharya et al 1994 in fig 5 the comparison shows that the results of the present study are overall in good agreement with the experimental data except that there is a discrepancy at x d 0 9 and x d 5 5 in the wake region where adverse pressure gradient takes place furthermore the hit rates and fractional bias of the present predicted time and spanwise averaged velocity profiles compared with the experimental data are at these locations are presented in table 2 according to santiago et al 2007 the hit rate value q and the fractional bias value fb for the velocity profile at each location are defined as 13 q 1 n i 1 n n i w i t h n i 1 if p i o i o i r d or p i o i a d 0 else 14 fb o p 0 5 p o where n is the total number of points at each locations in fig 3 the values of p i and o i denote the present predicted data and the experimental data respectively p and o denote their mean values r d and a d denotes a relative and absolute deviations respectively as suggested by santiago et al 2007 the values of r d 0 25 and a d 0 05 are used it can be seen that close to the square structure the velocity profiles can fulfil the criterion of q 66 as proposed by schlünzen et al 2004 far away downstream the square structure the hit rates can be large in addition the present simulation tends to underestimate the streamwise time and spanwise averaged velocity based on the fb values fig 6 shows profiles of the spanwise averaged u r m s u at different streamwise locations of the present study are compared with the previous published experimental data reported by acharya et al 1994 and tariq et al 2004 and les results reported by gu et al 2017 it can be seen that the values of u r m s u are in general comparable to the published data however the wall normal locations of the peak value of u r m s u are overpredicted for the present study and the discrepancy can be attributed to the higher r e of the present study compared with those used in the previous studies finally the energy spectra of the resolved cross stream velocity fluctuations obtained at the location of x d y d z d 1 0 5 2 of case 6 in the wake region behind the square is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the inertial subrange of the energy spectra follows well with the kolmogorov spectra with a 5 3 slope which confirms the validity of the present turbulence modeling 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic forces the hydrodynamics forces are analyzed in this section in terms of the instantaneous drag force and lift force acting on the square structure the time histories of c d and c l are shown in fig 8 a and b it is obvious that the frequency of c l is lower than that of c d there are clearly high and low drag regimes in c d which is closely related to the high and low c l the approximate positive correlation between the instantaneous values of two force coefficients is also observed in the phase space plot of c d and c l as shown in fig 8 c where the envelop of c l is amplified by c d this behavior has also been reported in najjar and balachandar 1998 tian et al 2014 and hemmati et al 2019 however due to the presence of the bottom flat wall the linear increase of c l with c d is not as apparent as that of the flow around a flat plate reported by tian et al 2014 4 2 reynolds averaged statistics and instantaneous flow visualizations reynolds averaged statistical quantities are discussed in this section fig 9 shows the streamlines of the time and spanwise averaged flows of case 6 there are three main recirculation motions around the square which are also reported by tauqueer et al 2017 a small one is formed around the front face of the structure and a large recirculation motion is generated due to the separation of the shear layer behind the square the third smaller one is induced by the large recirculation vortex around the rear face of the square on the top of the square a secondary separation appears which causes an additional small vortex this is also observed on the top of a flat plate reported by tian et al 2014 the contours of resolved reynolds stresses u u u 2 v v u 2 u v u 2 are presented in fig 10 due to the ddes used in the present study the reynolds stresses are low near the surface of the square where rans equations are solved high levels of the three reynolds stresses are all located around the shear layer behind the square the peak value of u u u 2 is located downstream at x d 3 while the peak value of v v u 2 is located closer to the square at x d 0 5 the peak value of u v u 2 is located between the peak locations of the other two quantities fig 11 shows the instantaneous 3d vortical structures at t 800 d u identified by the q criterion defined by 15 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where s and ω is the strain and the rotation tensor respectively the iso surfaces of nondimensionalized q d u 2 5 are colored by the time averaged streamwise velocity a shear layer is formed after the separation point and are shed due to the shear layer instability as marked as s the shear layer begins to rolling up denoted as r into hairpin vortices denoted as h and they are becoming larger further downstream due to the high r e the vortical structures are highly three dimensional and spatially irregular the vortical structures gathering around the shear layer are mostly in the spanwise direction while those in the wake region tend to be in the streamwise direction 4 3 dynamical mode decomposition analysis in this section the dmd method is employed to analyze the dynamical properties of the flow the algorithm of dmd can be briefly outlined as follows the input datasets in the form of a sequence of snapshots are denoted as two matrices 16 v 1 n v 1 v 2 v 3 v n r n x n 17 v 2 n v 2 v 3 v 4 v n 1 r n x n and a column vector v i i 1 2 3 n denotes the input data at time step of t t i which is usually the velocities or the pressure stored at every nodes in the flow field n x denotes the total number of the measured signals at all observation nodes in the experiments or numerical simulations the time step between two snapshots is δ t in the dmd method it is assumed that the there is a linear operator a between two consecutive snapshots v i 1 a v i and the relationship between the two data sequence matrices can be written as 18 a v 1 n v 2 n the dmd method aims to determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unknown operator a the eigenvalues of the operator can describe the dynamical properties inherited in the data sequence for a fluid mechanic problem the number of the components of each vector v i n x is usually larger than the total number of the snapshots n and the dmd method can provide a reduced order representation of the linear operator a first the singular value decomposition svd is applied for the matrix v 1 n 19 v 1 n u σ v t where σ is an diagonal matrix contain non zero singular values on its diagonal u and v contain orthogonal unit columns u r n x n and v r n n and u t u i v t v i where t denotes the transpose of the matrix and the column vectors of u are usually denoted as the proper orthogonal decomposition pod modes of the data sequence v 1 n then the linear mapping relationship of v 1 n and v 2 n can be expressed as 20 v 2 n au σ v t and the reduced order representation of a can be obtained by projecting a on u as 21 a u t au u t v 2 n v σ 1 because of the orthogonality of the column vector of u the matrix a with a lower dimension of n n contains the same eigenvalues as a with the dimension of n x n x by solving the eigenvalue problem 22 a y y λ the eigenvalue of a can be obtained as λ d i a g μ 1 μ 2 μ n and their corresponding eigenmodes are obtained by φ uy φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ n which are also denoted as the dmd modes according to schmid 2010 im log μ i δ t represents the frequency and re log μ i δ t represents the amplification rate of the mode an important question in the dmd method is to determine a small subset of dmd modes that can provide a reduced order approximation of the dynamic system represented by the data sequence 16 different from the pod modes whose contributions to the data sequence are ranked according to their energy levels the contribution of each dmd mode is difficult to measure because no information of their energy can be obtained through the algorithm a sparsity promoting sp dmd spdmd method is proposed by jovanović et al 2014 to select a subset of dynamically important modes this algorithm was further improved and adopted to analyze the flow past a circular cylinder at low r e in ohmiche 2017 given the dmd modes φ i and their eigenvalues μ i the input dataset can be approximated as 23 v 1 n φ d α v a n d φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ n α 1 α n μ 1 0 μ 1 n 1 μ n 0 μ n n 1 where d α d i a g α 1 α n denote the amplitudes of their corresponding dmd modes within the time span the amplitude of each dmd mode α i i 1 2 3 n is regarded as the measurement of its contribution to the dynamic system v a n d denotes the vandermonde matrix contained the temporal variations of each mode during the time span by introducing a penalty function γ an optimization problem is solved to determine the unknown amplitudes matrix d α 24 min α v 1 n φ d α v a n d f 2 γ i 1 n α i f is the frobenius norm of a matrix according to jovanović et al 2014 the positive parameter γ is choose to achieve a balance between the accuracy of the approximation 24 and the number of efficient dmd modes used in the approximation i e the sparsity of the amplitude matrix d α for a large γ most of the element in α 1 α n becomes 0 it means that the spdmd method removes the modes which only influence the early stages of the time evolution and are damped quickly as well as the modes with small amplitudes hence the dmd modes with non zero elements in α 1 α n which contribute the most to the dynamic system are kept in the present study the spdmd algorithm is performed on the u v data obtained in the 2d xy plane at the mid span point z 0 of the computational domain the similar 2d two dimensional 2c two components dmd analysis was also performed by tissot et al 2013 on the flow around a cylinder the number of the snapshots is n 800 from the time span of 450 t d u 530 with a time step of δ t d u 0 1 the dmd eigenvalues obtained by 22 are shown in fig 12 a together with a subset of eigenvalues corresponding to the n s p 57 modes selected by the spdmd algorithm and the others are located inside the unit circle when the eigenvalue of a dmd mode is located on the unit circle the growth decay rate of the mode is zero and the mode is neutrally stable as described in schmid et al 2010 schmid 2011 and pan et al 2015 it can be seen from fig 12 a that most of the eigenvalues lies on the unit circle due to the statistically stationary state of the turbulent flow this behavior has also been widely reported in seena and sung 2011 statnikov et al 2015 and wu et al 2019 other modes are located inside the unit circle and they have negative growth rates these modes are strongly damped within the temporal evolution of the dynamical system as reported in jovanović et al 2014 the power spectrum of the dmd modes obtained by 22 as well as the modes selected by spdmd are shown in fig 12 b it can be seen that after the spdmd algorithm is applied most of the modes are removed because even though they have large amplitudes they are damped quickly during the time evolution the modes with lower frequencies are left which make the most contribution to the dynamical system among the remaining modes after the spdmd algorithm the most dominant mode corresponds to the time averaged flow with a frequency of 0 all the other frequencies correspond to the turbulent fluctuations which appear in pair the dmd spectrum with the frequencies im log μ i δ t 0 of the remaining modes are shown in fig 15 all the spectrum is widely distributed since the flow is fully developed turbulence which displays multi scale features however all the spectrum is observed to cluster around 4 peaks as indicated in fig 16 a comparison between the dmd spectrum and the power spectral densities psd of the streamwise and the cross stream velocities is performed the dmd mode corresponding to the time averaged flow is not included the psds are obtained using the fast fourier transformation combined with welch s method welch 1967 for the psd analysis of the velocity signals the time series of u and v at 17 streamwise locations shown in fig 13 are sampled with a sampling frequency of δ t u d 0 01 the time span of the sampling is t u d 300 the spanwise averaged psds of u and v are shown in fig 14 at x d 0 2 and y d 1 4 2 0 a dominant frequency of is shown at f k h d u 0 45 0 5 and this dominant frequency is related to the kelvin helmholtz kh instability of the shear layer the value of the frequency is slightly larger than the previous published data of f k h d u 0 35 in abdalla et al 2007 at r e 4500 and f k h d u 0 42 in gu et al 2017 at r e 3000 which may be due to the higher investigated r e for the present study the predicted value of the kh instability frequency is also close to the value of f k h d u 0 59 reported in mercier et al 2020 at r e 2 5 10 5 in addition at these streamwise locations the frequency peaks at 2 f k h d u related to secondary harmonic are also observed it worth mentioning that there are frequency peaks at f s d u 0 25 for u and v at the locations of x d y d 2 1 2 and x d y d 4 1 6 which is the subharmonic of the primary kh instability frequency according to gu et al 2017 this subharmonic is related to the vortex pairing furthermore the widely reported low frequency mode in abdalla et al 2007 gu et al 2017 2018 and wu et al 2020 can be also seen at f m d u 0 05 0 09 for v at x d 4 and y d 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 however this low frequency mode is not obvious which may be due to the wide range of low frequencies related to the characteristics of fully developed turbulence a comparison between the dmd spectrum and the power spectral densities psd of the streamwise and the cross stream velocities at x d 1 2 4 and y d 1 6 with different heights is shown in fig 15 the dmd mode corresponding to the time averaged flow is not included the frequencies obtained by im log μ i δ t are divided by 2 π to compare with the psd it can be seen that the four clusters indicated by the grey vertical stripes of the dmd modes can correspond well to the different frequency peaks in psd therefore it can be inferred that modes 3 and 4 corresponds to subharmonic and primary kh modes respectively modes 1 and 2 can correspond to the low frequency motions as mentioned in taira et al 2017 dmd can be viewed as a combination of pod and the fourier transformation hence the dmd modes can capture both the spatial coherency and temporal evolution of the flow structures while fourier transformation can only obtain the characteristic frequencies of the velocity signals at a single point in the flow field the contours of the streamwise velocity corresponding to the dmd modes denoted as modes 0 4 in fig 11 from the 4 clusters are shown in fig 17 a e as has been mentioned the mode with 0 frequency denotes the time averaged flow which is similar to that shown in fig 9 the contour levels are different because all the dmd modes obtained by 22 are normalized the contours of the streamwise velocity of the mode with the second peak marked with mode 1 show that a large scale structure appears with a pair of high and low speed regions with the size relative to the cross stream size of the wake region the structures of the third mode marked with mode 2 shows smaller streamwise wavelength with the increasing frequency and decreasing amplitude of the higher order modes the structures are becoming smaller and the energetic regions are located closer to the shear layer of the recirculation region behind the square while more weak fluctuations are distributed near the bottom wall finally a reduced order model rom of the flow field is built based on the dmd modes together with their corresponding amplitudes and frequencies obtained by the spdmd algorithm to achieve this the velocity at a point x y at t t n is reconstructed by 25 u x y t n i 1 n s p α i φ i x y μ i n 1 where φ i x y denotes the value at x y of the i th mode and α i is its amplitude calculated by the spdmd method jovanović et al 2014 n s p is the total number of dmd modes used to build the rom the roms of a flow field at low r e are usually built by n s p o 10 modes however due to multi scale features of the fully developed turbulent flow in the present study a relatively larger number of dmd modes are required to examine the influence of the number of modes used to build the rom the time histories of the streamwise velocities at 6 locations of x d y d 0 5 0 5 1 0 5 1 5 0 5 2 0 5 3 0 5 4 0 5 behind the square obtained by 23 using n s p 57 and 103 modes are compared with the original numerical simulation data for n s p 57 large discrepancy is observed near the square at x d y d 0 5 0 5 indicating that more small scale structures are generated and more modes are needed to capture the dynamical behaviors at x d y d 3 0 5 4 0 5 the time variations of the streamwise velocity can be better predicted by the rom despite that the amplitudes of the rom are lower than the simulation results when increasing the modes number to n s p 103 the rom results become more accurate it is worth mentioned that the rom built by using these dmd modes only captures temporal evolution of large scale turbulent structures the production of small scale turbulent structures which lead to the spikes of the time histories of the streamwise velocity shown in figs 18 and 19 can be captured by including even more dmd modes which are truncated in the present rom 5 conclusion three dimensional spalart allmaras delayed detached eddy simulations of the flow around a wall mounted square structure are carried out the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity and the structure height d is r e 1 19 10 5 the drag coefficients as well as the time and spanwise averaged streamwise velocity profiles are in a reasonable agreement with the published data systematical analysis is presented in terms of the hydrodynamic quantities reynolds averaged statistics and the instantaneous vortical structures furthermore dynamic mode decomposition has been applied to the u v data in the 2d xy plane at the mid span point of the flow field which can extract the dynamic information of the coherent structures in the wake region behind the square structures the main conclusions can be outlined as follows 1 the frequency of the time history of the lift coefficient c l is lower than that of the drag coefficient c d the instantaneous c l is approximately associated with c d 2 three main time averaged recirculation motions are observed around the square a small one appears around the front face of the structure and a large recirculation motion formed behind the square a small vortex is induced by the large recirculation motion around the rear face of the structure 3 the shear layer sheds from the square and rolls up into small scale hairpin structures further downstream the small scale vortical structures around the shear layer are in the spanwise direction while in the wake region they are tilted in the streamwise direction 4 the frequencies and amplitudes of the dominant dmd modes which contribute the most to the inherent dynamics are obtained through the sparsity promoted dmd algorithm even though the flow under investigation is fully turbulence at a high reynolds number it can still be reconstructed by a finite number of dmd modes credit authorship

model of the flow field is constructed by the modes and shows good agreement with the numerical simulation results keywords wall mounted square structure cfd turbulence saddes dynamic mode decomposition 1 introduction turbulent flows around wall mounted structures commonly occur in many engineering problems for instance glass reinforced plastic grp covers are used to protect the subsea installations such as pipelines from the potential damages caused by dropped objects and fishing gears for the stable installation of the subsea covers it is essential to obtain the hydrodynamic forces on them the wall mounted structures have also been used to enhance the heat transfer in gas turbines combustion ducts and heat exchangers acharya et al 1994 hwang et al 1999 other applications can be found in protrusive devices on various transportations such as racing cars aircrafts and ships dai et al 2017 the flows around the wall mounted structures display complex separation and reattachment features and induce complicate vortex arrangement in the separation region behind the structures as a result it is of great importance to study the flow characteristics around the structures a common simplified model of these wall mounted structures is a square cylinder lying on a flat wall which is investigated in the present study numerous studies have been conducted to study the flow around wall mounted structures early studies include arie et al 1975 where experiments have been conducted to study the pressure distribution around square structures subjected to a turbulent boundary layer at reynolds numbers of 3 4 10 4 r e 1 19 10 5 defined as r e u d ν where u is the free stream velocity and d is the height of the structure and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and tropea and gackstatter 1985 where the experiments of the flow past a wall mounted rectangular ribs were conducted in a channel at low reynolds numbers of 150 r e h 4500 defined based on the width of the channel experiments have also been performed by martinuzzi et al 1993 on the flows over square ribs with different spanwise lengths w d of the structures w is the spanwise length and d is the height of the structures of the ribs it was found that the flow in the middle region of the wake behind the structures with w d 6 and the flow in front of the rib with w d 10 are essentially two dimensional bergeles and athanassiadis 1983 studied the recirculation length around a two dimensional 2d rectangular ribs using a single hot wire and showed that the length of the recirculation region in front of the structures remains unchanged with the structure length while the length of the recirculation behind the structures varies linearly with the structure length liu et al 2008 analyzed the spatio temporal characteristics of the unsteady separation and reattachment of turbulent flows over a 2d square rib at r e 1 32 10 4 using experiments the frequency features of the shedding large scale vortex and the flapping separation bubbles were determined by the wall pressure spectra despite experiments numerical simulations were also adopted to study the turbulent boundary flow over wall mounted structures hwang et al 1999 employed 2d rans reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations of the turbulent flow past a 2d rib with different length to height ratios using the standard k ε model acharya et al 1994 used steady rans simulations to predict the mean streamwise velocity and the turbulence intensity of the flow behind a wall mounted 2d rib ryu et al 2007 used rans simulations based on the k ε model on the turbulent channel flow over 2d rib structures with different shapes to study the different drag forces and flow characteristics at r e 2 10 4 the previous numerical simulations on the flow around 2d wall mounted structures are largely carried out using the steady rans since the wall can suppress the large scale vortex shedding behind the structures however unsteady flow behaviors have been observed in the wake region behind the structures such as rolling up of vortices and a flapping separation bubbles reported by liu et al 2008 which cannot be studied based on the steady rans because only the time averaged flow characteristics can be captured in the steady rans simulations large eddy simulation les was used to investigate the temporal behavior of the wake flow behind bluff bodies in various studies reported by tian et al 2014 prsic et al 2018 and li et al 2018 however the computational cost of les at high reynolds numbers is high detached eddy simulations des proposed by spalart et al 1997 which is less computationally expensive can be used for this purpose the des method is a combination of a rans model in the attached boundary layer near the walls and a les method in the separated regions away from the walls an improvement to the standard des spalart et al 1997 was proposed by spalart et al 2006 known as delayed des ddes to delay the switching from rans to les in the boundary layers the method can prevent the artificial grid induced separation gis a detailed comparison was made by boudreau et al 2017 between the ddes simulation and urans unsteady rans simulation to show the ability of ddes in accurately capturing the wake behavior behind a square cylinder at r e o 10 4 furthermore the ddes simulation was adopted by ong et al 2017 to study the flow structures around monopile and gravity based wind turbine foundations at a high reynolds number of r e 4 10 6 in the present study 3d spalart allmaras ddes saddes method has been employed to investigate the unsteady flow in the wake region behind a wall mounted square structures to further understand the simulation results the flow is analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition dmd schmid 2010 to quantify the dynamical properties of the velocity fluctuations the method was proposed based on the koopman operator theory of dynamical systems rowley et al 2009 bagheri 2013 the dynamic information can be extracted from a time resolved flow fields obtained by either numerical simulations schmid 2010 tu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 or experimental data schmid 2011 schmid et al 2012 he et al 2013 seena and sung 2013 tissot et al 2013 2014 the dmd method is regarded as an extension of the global stability analysis of a linear system however the explicit equations of the dynamical system are not required and it can be used as a data driven method for nonlinear systems such as the fully turbulence a widely adopted method to extract important features is the proper orthogonal decomposition pod proposed by lumely 1967 however the pod modes are selected according to their energy and their temporal information is missing the dmd method assumes that the temporal evolution of the dynamical system is governed by a linear operator but it can still be applied to the nonlinear system and in fluid mechanics it is used to extract the coherent structures from the flow fields the organization of the present paper is outlined as follows the mathematical formulation and numerical methods are given in section 2 the convergence studies and validation studies are presented in section 3 the results and discussion in terms of hydrodynamics quantities power spectra analysis of the fluctuations instantaneous flow structures and dmd modes are given in section 4 finally a conclusion is made for the present study 2 mathematical formulation and numerical method 2 1 mathematical formulation in the framework of ddes the governing equations for the incompressible flow are filtered navier stokes equations given as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j where i j 1 2 3 for x y z is the streamwise cross stream and spanwise directions respectively u 1 u 2 u 3 for u v w are their corresponding resolved velocity components u i u j are the unresolved stresses which are modeled by 3 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i an additional transport equation is used to calculate the modified viscosity ν which can be found in spalart et al 2006 and is not described in detailed here ν is associated with the eddy viscosity ν t as 4 ν t ν f v 1 f v 1 x 3 x 3 c v 1 3 x ν ν t where c v 1 7 1 in the present study the f v 3 implementation rumsey et al 2001 for the spalart allmaras version is used to determine the terms in the transport equation of ν in the original des formulation the distance between a point in the flow domain and the wall d in the destruction term of the viscosity transport equation is modified as 5 d m i n d c d e s δ where c d e s 0 65 is a constant and δ is the length scale associated with the local grid spacings in the three directions 6 δ m a x δ x δ y δ z ddes is proposed to overcome the issue of grid induced separation gis by delaying the transition from rans in the attached boundary layer region to les in the separation region away from the wall in this method d is modified as 7 d d f d m a x 0 d c d e s δ where f d is a filter function designed to be 0 in the rans region and 1 in the les region 2 2 numerical methods openfoam an open source computational fluid dynamic cfd code is used in the present study the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators scheme is used the spatial schemes for gradient laplacian and divergence are gauss linear bounded gauss linear upwind and gauss linear limited corrected respectively 3 computational overview 3 1 computational domain the computational domain is shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinates is located at the center of the bottom edge of the wall mounted square structures the length and height of the computational domain are 50 d and 20 d respectively the spanwise length l z will be determined in the next section the distance between the inlet boundary and the center of the bottom edge of the square structure is set to be l u 11 5 d and the distance between the outlet boundary and the center of the bottom edge of the structure is set to be l d 40 5 d this inlet length is larger than that used in ong et al 2010 where numerical simulations were carried out for the flow around a cylinder close to a flat wall at r e 3 6 10 6 with an inlet length of 10 d the outlet length is also larger than that used in the previous similar numerical studies such as young et al 2006 at with l d 20 d ong et al 2009 2010 at r e o 10 6 with l d 20 d tian et al 2014 at r e 1 5 10 5 with l d 20 d and tian et al 2016 at r e 1 5 10 5 with l d 15 d based on these studies the size of the domain in the xy plane is large enough to suppress any far field effects the boundary conditions for the simulations are set as follows 1 a seabed boundary layer flow with a logarithmic horizontal velocity profile is used at the inlet boundary in x direction the logarithmic velocity profile with a boundary layer thickness of δ 0 73 d is adapted by curve fitting of the boundary layer profile obtained in the experiments done by arie et al 1975 the obtained velocity profile is shown in fig 2 compared with the experimental velocity profile reported by arie et al 1975 the velocity in y and z direction is set to be zero the inlet turbulent quantities are prescribed by implementing the turbulent viscosity which is given by 8 ν t c μ k 2 ε using the definition in the k ε model with c μ 0 09 the turbulent kinetic energy k and the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy ε are given by 9 k max c μ 1 2 1 z δ 2 u τ 2 0 0001 u 2 if z δ 0 0001 u 2 if z δ 10 ε c μ 3 4 k 3 2 l where the turbulent length scale l is given by l min κ y 1 3 5 y δ 1 c μ δ with κ 0 41 the same method for prescribing the turbulent viscosity has also been used ong et al 2017 where spalart allmaras ddes model was also adopted 2 no slip condition u v w 0 is applied on the bottom and the surface of the square structure the pressure is set to be zero normal gradient in the present study the flow around the square surface is fully developed turbulent and a wall function based on the spalding s law of the wall spalding 1961 is applied for the near wall region 3 at the outlet and top boundaries the velocities pressure and ν t are set as zero normal gradient 4 the periodic boundary conditions are used for all the variables on the two xy planes in the spanwise directions a parallel computing technique is used for the simulations on a distributed memory system in a notur project and the computational domain is divided into 128 or 256 subdomains based on different cell numbers 3 2 convergence studies convergence studies are carried out to determine the spanwise length the grid and time resolutions of the simulations the parameters and the results are shown in table 1 δ t is the time step and all the simulations are run for a non dimensional time of 1000 d u u is the free stream velocity and a total computational time in a range of 38400 128000 cpu hours is used for each case the time averaged drag coefficients and lift coefficients of different cases are considered which are defined as follows 11 c d f x 1 2 ρ u 2 d l z 12 c l f y 1 2 ρ u 2 d l z where f x is the total force obtained by integrating the pressure and the shear stress acting on the surfaces of the square structure in x direction and f y is the force in y direction first results of case 1 case 3 with different grids numbers in xy plane and the same l z grids number in z direction and δ t show that there is no significant difference in c d and the relative difference among c l of the three cases are within 4 7 then c d and c l of case 2 and case 4 with different l z and the same grid resolution in z direction shows that when increasing l z from 4 to 8 the relative difference between c d is within 1 while the relative difference between c l is 4 3 indicating that l z 4 is enough to provide converged results and this value is adopted for the other simulations the relative difference between c d of case 1 and case 5 with different δ t is less than 1 and the relative difference between c l is within 2 therefore δ t 0 001 is used for all the rest simulations in the present study it worth mentioning that the minimal taylor time scale defined as τ λ 15 ν ε 1 2 of the present study is calculated to be 0 04 and the time step of δ t 0 001 is much smaller than the minimal taylor time scale and hence also smaller than the large eddy scales with a finer grid resolution in z direction for case 6 both c d and c l decrease compared with case 3 however the relative differences for case 6 from case 3 is within 1 and 2 for the two quantities furthermore the time and spanwise averaged streamwise velocity u u and the pressure coefficient c p defined as 2 p p ρ u 2 where p is chosen such that c p at the front stagnation point on the front face of the structure is unity along the streamwise direction at y 0 5 are compared among different cases as shown in fig 3 it is shown that the results agree well with each other which indicate that the grid and time step convergences have been achieved fig 4 shows an example of the meshes of case 5 in table 1 in the xy plane and the yz plane 3 3 validation studies validation studies are conducted by comparing the converged results of case 6 in table 1 with the published data the c d value of case 6 is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data of c d 0 96 reported by arie et al 1975 with a relative difference of 10 8 and the numerical data of c d 1 02 obtained by 2d rans simulation reported by tauqeer et al 2017 with a relative difference of 5 2 further validation studies are done by comparing u u at different streamwise locations of x d 0 9 0 9 5 5 and x d 0 5 0 0 5 on the top of the square with the experimental data in turbulent channel flows reported by crabb et al 1977 as well as acharya et al 1994 in fig 5 the comparison shows that the results of the present study are overall in good agreement with the experimental data except that there is a discrepancy at x d 0 9 and x d 5 5 in the wake region where adverse pressure gradient takes place furthermore the hit rates and fractional bias of the present predicted time and spanwise averaged velocity profiles compared with the experimental data are at these locations are presented in table 2 according to santiago et al 2007 the hit rate value q and the fractional bias value fb for the velocity profile at each location are defined as 13 q 1 n i 1 n n i w i t h n i 1 if p i o i o i r d or p i o i a d 0 else 14 fb o p 0 5 p o where n is the total number of points at each locations in fig 3 the values of p i and o i denote the present predicted data and the experimental data respectively p and o denote their mean values r d and a d denotes a relative and absolute deviations respectively as suggested by santiago et al 2007 the values of r d 0 25 and a d 0 05 are used it can be seen that close to the square structure the velocity profiles can fulfil the criterion of q 66 as proposed by schlünzen et al 2004 far away downstream the square structure the hit rates can be large in addition the present simulation tends to underestimate the streamwise time and spanwise averaged velocity based on the fb values fig 6 shows profiles of the spanwise averaged u r m s u at different streamwise locations of the present study are compared with the previous published experimental data reported by acharya et al 1994 and tariq et al 2004 and les results reported by gu et al 2017 it can be seen that the values of u r m s u are in general comparable to the published data however the wall normal locations of the peak value of u r m s u are overpredicted for the present study and the discrepancy can be attributed to the higher r e of the present study compared with those used in the previous studies finally the energy spectra of the resolved cross stream velocity fluctuations obtained at the location of x d y d z d 1 0 5 2 of case 6 in the wake region behind the square is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the inertial subrange of the energy spectra follows well with the kolmogorov spectra with a 5 3 slope which confirms the validity of the present turbulence modeling 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic forces the hydrodynamics forces are analyzed in this section in terms of the instantaneous drag force and lift force acting on the square structure the time histories of c d and c l are shown in fig 8 a and b it is obvious that the frequency of c l is lower than that of c d there are clearly high and low drag regimes in c d which is closely related to the high and low c l the approximate positive correlation between the instantaneous values of two force coefficients is also observed in the phase space plot of c d and c l as shown in fig 8 c where the envelop of c l is amplified by c d this behavior has also been reported in najjar and balachandar 1998 tian et al 2014 and hemmati et al 2019 however due to the presence of the bottom flat wall the linear increase of c l with c d is not as apparent as that of the flow around a flat plate reported by tian et al 2014 4 2 reynolds averaged statistics and instantaneous flow visualizations reynolds averaged statistical quantities are discussed in this section fig 9 shows the streamlines of the time and spanwise averaged flows of case 6 there are three main recirculation motions around the square which are also reported by tauqueer et al 2017 a small one is formed around the front face of the structure and a large recirculation motion is generated due to the separation of the shear layer behind the square the third smaller one is induced by the large recirculation vortex around the rear face of the square on the top of the square a secondary separation appears which causes an additional small vortex this is also observed on the top of a flat plate reported by tian et al 2014 the contours of resolved reynolds stresses u u u 2 v v u 2 u v u 2 are presented in fig 10 due to the ddes used in the present study the reynolds stresses are low near the surface of the square where rans equations are solved high levels of the three reynolds stresses are all located around the shear layer behind the square the peak value of u u u 2 is located downstream at x d 3 while the peak value of v v u 2 is located closer to the square at x d 0 5 the peak value of u v u 2 is located between the peak locations of the other two quantities fig 11 shows the instantaneous 3d vortical structures at t 800 d u identified by the q criterion defined by 15 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where s and ω is the strain and the rotation tensor respectively the iso surfaces of nondimensionalized q d u 2 5 are colored by the time averaged streamwise velocity a shear layer is formed after the separation point and are shed due to the shear layer instability as marked as s the shear layer begins to rolling up denoted as r into hairpin vortices denoted as h and they are becoming larger further downstream due to the high r e the vortical structures are highly three dimensional and spatially irregular the vortical structures gathering around the shear layer are mostly in the spanwise direction while those in the wake region tend to be in the streamwise direction 4 3 dynamical mode decomposition analysis in this section the dmd method is employed to analyze the dynamical properties of the flow the algorithm of dmd can be briefly outlined as follows the input datasets in the form of a sequence of snapshots are denoted as two matrices 16 v 1 n v 1 v 2 v 3 v n r n x n 17 v 2 n v 2 v 3 v 4 v n 1 r n x n and a column vector v i i 1 2 3 n denotes the input data at time step of t t i which is usually the velocities or the pressure stored at every nodes in the flow field n x denotes the total number of the measured signals at all observation nodes in the experiments or numerical simulations the time step between two snapshots is δ t in the dmd method it is assumed that the there is a linear operator a between two consecutive snapshots v i 1 a v i and the relationship between the two data sequence matrices can be written as 18 a v 1 n v 2 n the dmd method aims to determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unknown operator a the eigenvalues of the operator can describe the dynamical properties inherited in the data sequence for a fluid mechanic problem the number of the components of each vector v i n x is usually larger than the total number of the snapshots n and the dmd method can provide a reduced order representation of the linear operator a first the singular value decomposition svd is applied for the matrix v 1 n 19 v 1 n u σ v t where σ is an diagonal matrix contain non zero singular values on its diagonal u and v contain orthogonal unit columns u r n x n and v r n n and u t u i v t v i where t denotes the transpose of the matrix and the column vectors of u are usually denoted as the proper orthogonal decomposition pod modes of the data sequence v 1 n then the linear mapping relationship of v 1 n and v 2 n can be expressed as 20 v 2 n au σ v t and the reduced order representation of a can be obtained by projecting a on u as 21 a u t au u t v 2 n v σ 1 because of the orthogonality of the column vector of u the matrix a with a lower dimension of n n contains the same eigenvalues as a with the dimension of n x n x by solving the eigenvalue problem 22 a y y λ the eigenvalue of a can be obtained as λ d i a g μ 1 μ 2 μ n and their corresponding eigenmodes are obtained by φ uy φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ n which are also denoted as the dmd modes according to schmid 2010 im log μ i δ t represents the frequency and re log μ i δ t represents the amplification rate of the mode an important question in the dmd method is to determine a small subset of dmd modes that can provide a reduced order approximation of the dynamic system represented by the data sequence 16 different from the pod modes whose contributions to the data sequence are ranked according to their energy levels the contribution of each dmd mode is difficult to measure because no information of their energy can be obtained through the algorithm a sparsity promoting sp dmd spdmd method is proposed by jovanović et al 2014 to select a subset of dynamically important modes this algorithm was further improved and adopted to analyze the flow past a circular cylinder at low r e in ohmiche 2017 given the dmd modes φ i and their eigenvalues μ i the input dataset can be approximated as 23 v 1 n φ d α v a n d φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ n α 1 α n μ 1 0 μ 1 n 1 μ n 0 μ n n 1 where d α d i a g α 1 α n denote the amplitudes of their corresponding dmd modes within the time span the amplitude of each dmd mode α i i 1 2 3 n is regarded as the measurement of its contribution to the dynamic system v a n d denotes the vandermonde matrix contained the temporal variations of each mode during the time span by introducing a penalty function γ an optimization problem is solved to determine the unknown amplitudes matrix d α 24 min α v 1 n φ d α v a n d f 2 γ i 1 n α i f is the frobenius norm of a matrix according to jovanović et al 2014 the positive parameter γ is choose to achieve a balance between the accuracy of the approximation 24 and the number of efficient dmd modes used in the approximation i e the sparsity of the amplitude matrix d α for a large γ most of the element in α 1 α n becomes 0 it means that the spdmd method removes the modes which only influence the early stages of the time evolution and are damped quickly as well as the modes with small amplitudes hence the dmd modes with non zero elements in α 1 α n which contribute the most to the dynamic system are kept in the present study the spdmd algorithm is performed on the u v data obtained in the 2d xy plane at the mid span point z 0 of the computational domain the similar 2d two dimensional 2c two components dmd analysis was also performed by tissot et al 2013 on the flow around a cylinder the number of the snapshots is n 800 from the time span of 450 t d u 530 with a time step of δ t d u 0 1 the dmd eigenvalues obtained by 22 are shown in fig 12 a together with a subset of eigenvalues corresponding to the n s p 57 modes selected by the spdmd algorithm and the others are located inside the unit circle when the eigenvalue of a dmd mode is located on the unit circle the growth decay rate of the mode is zero and the mode is neutrally stable as described in schmid et al 2010 schmid 2011 and pan et al 2015 it can be seen from fig 12 a that most of the eigenvalues lies on the unit circle due to the statistically stationary state of the turbulent flow this behavior has also been widely reported in seena and sung 2011 statnikov et al 2015 and wu et al 2019 other modes are located inside the unit circle and they have negative growth rates these modes are strongly damped within the temporal evolution of the dynamical system as reported in jovanović et al 2014 the power spectrum of the dmd modes obtained by 22 as well as the modes selected by spdmd are shown in fig 12 b it can be seen that after the spdmd algorithm is applied most of the modes are removed because even though they have large amplitudes they are damped quickly during the time evolution the modes with lower frequencies are left which make the most contribution to the dynamical system among the remaining modes after the spdmd algorithm the most dominant mode corresponds to the time averaged flow with a frequency of 0 all the other frequencies correspond to the turbulent fluctuations which appear in pair the dmd spectrum with the frequencies im log μ i δ t 0 of the remaining modes are shown in fig 15 all the spectrum is widely distributed since the flow is fully developed turbulence which displays multi scale features however all the spectrum is observed to cluster around 4 peaks as indicated in fig 16 a comparison between the dmd spectrum and the power spectral densities psd of the streamwise and the cross stream velocities is performed the dmd mode corresponding to the time averaged flow is not included the psds are obtained using the fast fourier transformation combined with welch s method welch 1967 for the psd analysis of the velocity signals the time series of u and v at 17 streamwise locations shown in fig 13 are sampled with a sampling frequency of δ t u d 0 01 the time span of the sampling is t u d 300 the spanwise averaged psds of u and v are shown in fig 14 at x d 0 2 and y d 1 4 2 0 a dominant frequency of is shown at f k h d u 0 45 0 5 and this dominant frequency is related to the kelvin helmholtz kh instability of the shear layer the value of the frequency is slightly larger than the previous published data of f k h d u 0 35 in abdalla et al 2007 at r e 4500 and f k h d u 0 42 in gu et al 2017 at r e 3000 which may be due to the higher investigated r e for the present study the predicted value of the kh instability frequency is also close to the value of f k h d u 0 59 reported in mercier et al 2020 at r e 2 5 10 5 in addition at these streamwise locations the frequency peaks at 2 f k h d u related to secondary harmonic are also observed it worth mentioning that there are frequency peaks at f s d u 0 25 for u and v at the locations of x d y d 2 1 2 and x d y d 4 1 6 which is the subharmonic of the primary kh instability frequency according to gu et al 2017 this subharmonic is related to the vortex pairing furthermore the widely reported low frequency mode in abdalla et al 2007 gu et al 2017 2018 and wu et al 2020 can be also seen at f m d u 0 05 0 09 for v at x d 4 and y d 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 however this low frequency mode is not obvious which may be due to the wide range of low frequencies related to the characteristics of fully developed turbulence a comparison between the dmd spectrum and the power spectral densities psd of the streamwise and the cross stream velocities at x d 1 2 4 and y d 1 6 with different heights is shown in fig 15 the dmd mode corresponding to the time averaged flow is not included the frequencies obtained by im log μ i δ t are divided by 2 π to compare with the psd it can be seen that the four clusters indicated by the grey vertical stripes of the dmd modes can correspond well to the different frequency peaks in psd therefore it can be inferred that modes 3 and 4 corresponds to subharmonic and primary kh modes respectively modes 1 and 2 can correspond to the low frequency motions as mentioned in taira et al 2017 dmd can be viewed as a combination of pod and the fourier transformation hence the dmd modes can capture both the spatial coherency and temporal evolution of the flow structures while fourier transformation can only obtain the characteristic frequencies of the velocity signals at a single point in the flow field the contours of the streamwise velocity corresponding to the dmd modes denoted as modes 0 4 in fig 11 from the 4 clusters are shown in fig 17 a e as has been mentioned the mode with 0 frequency denotes the time averaged flow which is similar to that shown in fig 9 the contour levels are different because all the dmd modes obtained by 22 are normalized the contours of the streamwise velocity of the mode with the second peak marked with mode 1 show that a large scale structure appears with a pair of high and low speed regions with the size relative to the cross stream size of the wake region the structures of the third mode marked with mode 2 shows smaller streamwise wavelength with the increasing frequency and decreasing amplitude of the higher order modes the structures are becoming smaller and the energetic regions are located closer to the shear layer of the recirculation region behind the square while more weak fluctuations are distributed near the bottom wall finally a reduced order model rom of the flow field is built based on the dmd modes together with their corresponding amplitudes and frequencies obtained by the spdmd algorithm to achieve this the velocity at a point x y at t t n is reconstructed by 25 u x y t n i 1 n s p α i φ i x y μ i n 1 where φ i x y denotes the value at x y of the i th mode and α i is its amplitude calculated by the spdmd method jovanović et al 2014 n s p is the total number of dmd modes used to build the rom the roms of a flow field at low r e are usually built by n s p o 10 modes however due to multi scale features of the fully developed turbulent flow in the present study a relatively larger number of dmd modes are required to examine the influence of the number of modes used to build the rom the time histories of the streamwise velocities at 6 locations of x d y d 0 5 0 5 1 0 5 1 5 0 5 2 0 5 3 0 5 4 0 5 behind the square obtained by 23 using n s p 57 and 103 modes are compared with the original numerical simulation data for n s p 57 large discrepancy is observed near the square at x d y d 0 5 0 5 indicating that more small scale structures are generated and more modes are needed to capture the dynamical behaviors at x d y d 3 0 5 4 0 5 the time variations of the streamwise velocity can be better predicted by the rom despite that the amplitudes of the rom are lower than the simulation results when increasing the modes number to n s p 103 the rom results become more accurate it is worth mentioned that the rom built by using these dmd modes only captures temporal evolution of large scale turbulent structures the production of small scale turbulent structures which lead to the spikes of the time histories of the streamwise velocity shown in figs 18 and 19 can be captured by including even more dmd modes which are truncated in the present rom 5 conclusion three dimensional spalart allmaras delayed detached eddy simulations of the flow around a wall mounted square structure are carried out the reynolds number based on the free stream velocity and the structure height d is r e 1 19 10 5 the drag coefficients as well as the time and spanwise averaged streamwise velocity profiles are in a reasonable agreement with the published data systematical analysis is presented in terms of the hydrodynamic quantities reynolds averaged statistics and the instantaneous vortical structures furthermore dynamic mode decomposition has been applied to the u v data in the 2d xy plane at the mid span point of the flow field which can extract the dynamic information of the coherent structures in the wake region behind the square structures the main conclusions can be outlined as follows 1 the frequency of the time history of the lift coefficient c l is lower than that of the drag coefficient c d the instantaneous c l is approximately associated with c d 2 three main time averaged recirculation motions are observed around the square a small one appears around the front face of the structure and a large recirculation motion formed behind the square a small vortex is induced by the large recirculation motion around the rear face of the structure 3 the shear layer sheds from the square and rolls up into small scale hairpin structures further downstream the small scale vortical structures around the shear layer are in the spanwise direction while in the wake region they are tilted in the streamwise direction 4 the frequencies and amplitudes of the dominant dmd modes which contribute the most to the inherent dynamics are obtained through the sparsity promoted dmd algorithm even though the flow under investigation is fully turbulence at a high reynolds number it can still be reconstructed by a finite number of dmd modes credit authorship

21013,we investigated the displacement and lift time series of a circular cylinder strip plate cruciform system for energy harvesting in the reynolds number range 1 1 10 3 re 14 6 10 3 numerically using the open source c library openfoam the karman vortex induced vibration kviv regime was identified between reduced velocity u 2 3 and 13 6 while the streamwise vortex induced vibration sviv regime was identified between 18 2 u 29 5 we analysed the cylinder displacement and lift time series using the hilbert huang transform hht within this range of u karman vortex shedding contributes nearly as much as streamwise vortex shedding to the root mean square amplitude of total lift while between 25 0 u 29 5 the karman component contribution is on average twice that of the streamwise component these findings hint at the possibility to improve the power output of the harvester by a factor of two between 18 2 u 22 7 and by a factor of three between 25 0 u 29 5 if we can unite the contribution to the root mean square amplitude of the total lift under a single vibration driving mechanism the shedding of streamwise vortex graphical abstract image 1 keywords vortex induced vibration vibration energy harvester cfd simulation streamwise vorticity ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd hilbert transform 1 introduction streamwise vortex induced vibration sviv is a type of vortex induced vibration viv driven by vortical structures whose vorticity vector points in the direction of the free stream in recent decades there have been efforts to exploit the sviv phenomenon from cruciform structures for energy harvesting an example of which is given in fig 1 the literature on this subject can be broadly categorised into two groups how the mechanical properties of the oscillator e g mass ratio damping etc affects the amplitude frequency response of sviv koide et al 2009 2013 nguyen et al 2012 and how the minutiae of the flow field affect the force driving the vibration of the cylinder i e the fluid mechanical aspect of the system deng et al 2007 koide et al 2017 zhao and lu 2018 in the first focus area researchers studied some permutation of the following method to convert the vibration into electrical power the method consists of a coil and magnet the coil which moves with the vibrating cylinder creates relative motion against the magnet which is placed in the hollow of the coil koide et al 2009 while investigating the system at a reynolds number in the order of re o 10 4 koide et al 2009 showed that increased damping due to energy harvesting reduces the maximum vibration amplitude close to a factor of 4 amplitude reduction due to increased total damping was also mentioned in bernitsas et al 2008 bernitsas and raghavan 2008 bernitsas et al 2009 further investigation in nguyen et al 2012 revealed that damping not only affects the amplitude response of the cylinder but also narrows the synchronisation region between vortex shedding and cylinder vibration moreover nguyen et al 2012 demonstrated a strong coupling between mass ratio and damping in determining both the width of the synchronisation region and the maximum amplitude response of the cylinder in the second focus area investigators turned their attention to the details of the flow where streamwise vortex shedding occurs one such study carefully shot motion pictures of the dye injected flow koide et al 2017 at reynolds number in the order of re o 10 3 a lower reynolds number re reduces the amount of turbulence in the flow allowing a clearer shot of the vortex structures their study also highlights the higher level of turbulence produced by the circular cylinder strip plate cruciform in contrast to the twin circular cylinder cruciform which diminishes the periodicity of vortex shedding although visually enlightening this and other more qualitative studies contribute little towards improving our understanding of the relationship between vortex shedding and the resulting lift deng et al 2007 demonstrated a way to overcome such a shortcoming in their study deng et al 2007 examined the flow field of a twin circular cylinder cruciform using computational fluid dynamics cfd their domain stretches 28 d in the streamwise direction 16 d in the transverse direction and 12 d in the spanwise direction they studied an re range yet another order of magnitude smaller than that studied by koide et al 2017 possibly to get an even clearer visualisation of the vortical structures with less turbulence and to ease computational requisites at a fixed re 150 streamwise vortices form even at a gap ratio of 2 this result differs quite strikingly from koide et al 2006 2007 conducted at an re twice the order of magnitude of deng et al 2007 an indication that the minimum gap ratio needed for the onset of streamwise varies with respect to re they also observed that when the gap ratio g which they denote as l d in their paper increases from 3 to 4 the maximum amplitude of the lift coefficient increases by almost threefold this can be attributed quite easily to the current vortex pair shed by the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder immediately disturbs the pair shed from the upstream cylinder when g 3 the lift coefficient increases by about a factor of 3 when this immediate disturbance diminishes at g 4 the visualisation of three dimensional 3d vorticity isocontours enables us to quickly establish this link vis à vis the lift coefficient signal the authors use of cfd made this possible a similar study in the order of magnitude re o 10 2 by zhao and lu 2018 particularly highlighted the immense utility of cfd as a tool to research sviv or flow around a cruciform in general they computed the sectional lift coefficient along the upstream cylinder and the time history of this sectional lift coefficient revealed two different modes of vortex shedding namely parallel and k shaped they also paid attention to the local flow patterns that vary along the length of the upstream cylinder such as the trailing vortex flow necklace vortex flow and flow in the small gap denoted as sg flow the discontinuities in the phase angle of the sectional lift coefficient along the upstream cylinder seems to suggest the inadequateness of attributing the lift coefficient to streamwise vortex shedding alone particularly when karman vortex streamlines were also observed some distance away from the junction of the cruciform shirakashi et al 1989 also made a similar observation in their experimental work this leads us to hypothesise that the lift signal is more appropriately viewed as the streamwise karman vortex induced composite lift signal however we could not find studies that took this viewpoint and worked out its implication on power generation in their investigation of sviv the objectives of this study are thus threefold 1 to take a closer look at the amplitude and frequency response of a circular cylinder strip plate cruciform especially in reduced velocity u ranges where the transition from kviv to sviv occurs 2 to demonstrate the compositeness of the lift signal of an sviv system and establish the difference between the lift signal characteristics in the kviv and sviv regime and 3 to shed light on how the contribution from the karman and streamwise components of lift changes as we increase u after the onset of sviv and predict how much improvement in the power generation can be anticipated if we are able to unify the lift amplitude contributions due to karman and streamwise vortex shedding here u u f n d with u f n and d being the freestream velocity natural frequency of the system and the diameter of the circular cylinder respectively the following 2 details the methodology we employ to conduct this study we present and discuss our results in 4 5 and 6 we describe our conclusions in 7 2 methodology 2 1 problem geometry the geometrical setup for this study builds on the work of maruai et al 2017 2018 who studied both experimentally and numerically the flow induced motion fim of a square cylinder with a downstream flat plate their simulation results are in good agreement with their own experiment and with the experimental results of kawabata et al 2013 in the reynolds number range 3 6 10 3 re 12 5 10 3 this is well within the reynolds number studied in this work i e 1 1 10 3 re 14 6 10 3 our x y plane fundamentally follows the dimensions used in maruai et al 2017 2018 except for the cylinder shape which in this study is circular and the 20 d distance to the outlet is measured from the downstream face of the strip plate this is shown in fig 2 we chose the cylinder plate gap g to be 0 16 d as koide et al 2013 has shown that this gap size sustains the highest sviv amplitude over the widest range of u in comparison to other gap sizes as the problem geometry is explicitly three dimensional 3d the x y plane is extruded in the z direction thus obtaining a 3d domain as can be seen in fig 2 the circular cylinder extends from z d 7 5 to z d 7 5 while the strip plate extends from 10 5 to y d 10 5 the z direction extent is set as z d 7 5 is already more than twice the spanwise reach of the streamwise vortex thus sufficient for the vortices to materialise in our numerical solution to compare the spanwise extent of the numerical study by deng et al 2007 is z d 6 and the spanwise extents of experiments by nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 are z d 5 table 1 summarises the boundary conditions imposed on each of the boundary patches in the simulation domain see fig 6 the symbols u p ν t and ν refer to the flow velocity pressure kinetic eddy viscosity and its mediating variable respectively at the inlet the fixedvalue for u is the freestream velocity u m s while u 0 m s at the strip plate the fixedvalue for p at the outlet is 0 m2 s2 and the fixedvalue for ν is 0 m2 s at the cylinder and strip plate patches 2 2 numerical method the objectives of our study necessitate the solution of the continuity and 3d unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 3d urans equations we achieve this by using openfoam an open source computational fluid dynamics cfd platform written in c specifically we work to solve the following continuity and urans equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 p p x i x j 2 ν s i j u j u i the symbols u x t ρ p ν s and u are the mean component of velocity spatial component time density pressure kinematic viscosity mean strain rate and the fluctuating component of velocity respectively the mean strain rate s i j is given by 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i this study employs the spalart allmaras turbulence model to approximate the reynolds stress tensor τ i j u j u i this turbulence model has been shown to produce results that agree reasonably well with experiments in similar flow induced motion fim studies ding et al 2015a b we use the boussinesq approximation to relate the reynolds stress tensor to the mean velocity gradient 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j where ν t represents the kinetic eddy viscosity ν t is in turn a function of ν and f ν 1 while f ν 1 is a function of χ and c ν 1 and χ a function of ν and ν as shown in eq 5 5a ν t ν f ν 1 5b f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 5c x ν ν here ν serves to mediate the turbulence model and dictates how ν is conserved ν t u j ν x j c b 1 s ν c w 1 f w ν d 2 6 1 σ x j ν ν ν x j c b 2 ν x i ν x i c b 1 c b 2 and c ν 1 are constant with values 0 1335 0 622 and 7 1 respectively c w 1 is given by 7 c w 1 c b 1 κ 1 c b 2 σ where additional constants κ and σ are 0 41 and 2 3 respectively f w on the other hand is given by 8 f w g 1 c w 3 6 g 6 c w 3 1 6 here c w 3 2 while g is given by 9 g r c w 2 r 6 r where r is 10 r min ν s κ 2 d 2 10 additionally s is 11 s ω ν κ 2 d 2 f ν 2 where ω and d are the magnitude of vorticity and the distance from the mesh nodes to the nearest wall respectively finally f ν 2 is 12 f ν 2 1 χ 1 χ f ν 1 we solve these equations numerically using the pimple algorithm which combines the transient solver piso with the steady state solver simple for improved numerical stability 2 3 dynamic mesh motion in this study the cylinder in viv moves perpendicular to the free stream direction the motion unavoidably distorts the mesh around it degrading important mesh metrics such as non orthogonality and skewness however we can diffuse the mesh deformation to the neighbouring nodes as per the following laplace equation 13 γ u 0 here u represents the mesh deformation velocity and γ is displacement diffusion we chose γ 1 l 2 where l is the cell centre distance to the nearest cylinder edges we implement the gamg linear solver with the gauss seidel smoother to solve eq 13 the dynamic mesh algorithm then updates the mesh node positions according to the following equation 14 x new x old u δ t the solver resumes the solution of eqs 1 and 2 once the mesh node positions are updated another dynamic mesh handling technique used in this study is the arbitrarily coupled mesh interface acmi that allows non conforming meshes to slide over another thus preserving the mesh quality around a moving object the tiny gap between the cylinder and strip plate limits our ability to diffuse the mesh deformation to the surrounding space acmi is thus implemented at the centre of the gap between the circular cylinder and the strip plate as shown in fig 2 to circumvent this problem this method has been successfully implemented in the works of ding et al 2015b zhang et al 2018 preserving the quality of their mesh and controlling their courant friedrichs lewy cfl number 2 4 open flow channel experiment we set up an experimental rig to validate our numerical results at reduced velocity u 22 7 we chose u 22 7 because that value of u is where the vibration driving mechanism is known to transit from karman to streamwise vortex shedding koide et al 2013 the experimental rig consists of a closed loop open channel circuit based on the water tunnel used by nguyen et al 2012 shown in fig 3 the cross section of our test section is a square with sides 100 mm in length the test section is 1500 mm long the system for providing elastic support and damping to the circular cylinder follows closely those used by kawabata et al 2013 and koide et al 2013 2017 which can be summarised as follows the stiffness coefficient k of the plate spring is determined through a simple weight versus displacement test sun et al 2016 at various active lengths of the spring this provides a calibration curve of stiffness coefficient k against plate spring length l we can then adjust the length of the plate spring to obtain the desired value for k on the other hand the damping of the system is adjusted using t shaped aluminium plates fixed at either end of the cylinder endplate and a pair of neodymium magnets contained in a claw shaped casing the further the t shaped plate is pushed into the opening of the claw the denser the magnetic field it needs to cut through during motion thus dissipating more energy we then calibrate the damping produced at various depths at which the t shaped plate is pushed into the casing via free decay tests of the cylinder in still water the procedure for conducting free decay tests are detailed in raghavan 2007 flow inside the open channel is driven by a 3 728 kw 5 hp centrifugal pump controlled using a voltage controller the input voltage for the centrifugal pump is calibrated against the centreline velocity of the test section 750 mm from the inlet i e mid length of the test section we show this schematically in fig 4 here we define the centreline of the test section as the line 50 mm from the bottom and 50 mm from either of the sidewalls of the test section we placed the cylinder in the same position during experimental runs the centreline velocity u cent is measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv sampling at 200 hz the resulting calibration curve is applicable for determining u cent at input voltages 30 v in v 100 we measured the turbulence intensity along the centreline to be about 5 we obtained the time history for cylinder displacement y by using a video camera pointed normal to the cylinder endplate we placed a visual marker on the endplate and the motion of the marker captured by the camera is analysed using tracker a motion analysis tool built on the open source physics java framework to validate our experimental setup we tuned to the best of our ability our experimental parameters to the values used by koide et al 2013 and test whether we can replicate their results table 2 summarises the parameters in lieu of that paper we show a sample of the normalised displacement y y d time series in fig 5 computing the statistics of y and the normalised cylinder vibration frequency f f cyl f n f cyl being the vibration frequency of the cylinder from several runs gave us a value of y 0 33 0 03 and f 1 03 0 04 koide et al 2013 obtained y 0 32 and f 1 09 under a similar u condition we thus take this fairly successful reproduction of the results of koide et al 2013 as an indication of readiness for further data collection 3 numerical setup validation 3 1 grid independency study via richardson extrapolation and grid convergence index a common method for checking the grid independency of quantities of interest in a numerical study is by demonstrating that one obtained similar results on all variants of the spatial discretisation usually three grids and then proceeding with the numerical study using the medium variant on the computational domain see e g ding et al 2013 ding et al 2019 or wang et al 2020 which settled on the coarse variant of their spatial discretisation our method of choice however checks for the convergence of the quantities of interest as one solves the governing equation on successively finer grid resolutions richardson and gaunt 1927 stern et al 2001 this method pays attention not only on the presumed converged value but also on the trend of convergence literature that employ this method impose a monotonic convergence condition stern et al 2001 mat ali et al 2011 ali et al 2012 maruai et al 2018 on their quantities of interest adding an extra layer of confidence in the final form of the spatial discretisation additionally this method allows for a quantitative description of the degree of convergence through the grid convergence index gci let f 1 f 2 f 3 f k denote the quantity of interest obtained from several grids a larger subscript indicates a coarser grid thus f 1 denotes the finest while f k denotes the coarsest grid let the difference between successive solutions be ε 2 1 ε 3 2 ε 4 3 ε n n 1 where ε 2 1 f 2 f 1 ε 3 2 f 3 f 2 and so on then the gci is defined as 15 gci i 1 i f s ε i 1 i f i r p 1 100 where f s f i and r p denotes the safety factor 1 25 quantity of interest and the refinement ratio r between successive grids raised to the order of accuracy of the series of solution p we refer the reader to stern et al 2001 langley research centre 2018 for a more detailed discussion on r p we can estimate what the solution approaches as the grid size approaches zero by using the p th method briefly we compute the generalised richardson extrapolation of the quantity of interest as follows 16 f re f 1 f 1 f 2 r p 1 where f re is the richardson extrapolation of the quantity of interest using f re to estimate the limit of the monotonically convergent series of f i we can determine the percentage difference of our solution on our finest grid from this limit as 17 e i f i f re f re 100 table 3 summarises the result of our grid independency study for the sviv reduced velocity of u 22 7 we identified three quantities central to the investigation of fluid structure phenomena especially the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder they are the vibration amplitude vibration frequency and lift coefficient of the cylinder we solve the governing equations on three grids which are numbered 1 for the finest 2 for the medium and 3 for the coarsest shown in fig 6 if we let v i be the volume of the i th cell in the grid and n be the total number of cells in the domain then the average cell size is 18 h 1 n i 1 n v i 1 3 and the normalised average cell size is hence 19 h d 1 n d i 1 n v i 1 3 both y rms and cl rms starts at an initial value smaller than their richardson extrapolations f re before approaching it as we decrease the average cell size h this similar trend can perhaps be attributed to the causal relationship between the lift coefficient and vibration amplitude the lift drives and sustains the vibration hence a small lift produces a small vibration and when the lift amplitude becomes higher so too does the vibration amplitude the vibration frequency on the other hand starts at a value larger than its f re before approaching f re the quantity cl rms experiences the most significant drop in gci as we refine the grid the gci is close to one third 30 92 as we refine the grid from coarse to medium with a refinement ratio of 1 376 the refinement ratio is calculated by dividing the number of cells in one grid with the next one down the refinement line following the grid numbering convention explained previously dividing the number of cells in the fine grid grid 1 with the number of cells in the medium grid grid 2 gives us the refinement ratio from medium to fine or r 2 1 similarly dividing the number of cells in the medium grid grid 2 with the number of cells in the coarse grid grid 3 gives us the refinement ratio from coarse to medium or r 3 2 we can generalise this to i number of grids as follows 20 r i 1 i s grid i 1 s grid i where s grid i denotes the total number of cells in the i th grid the gci of cl rms drops further to 1 63 as the mesh is refined more with a refinement ratio of 1 304 the gci for y rms also drops by one order of magnitude as can be seen by comparing gci 3 2 with gci 2 1 again this similar trend of improvement points to the causal relationship between lift and displacement of the cylinder the gci for f however drops by approximately a factor of 6 instead of one order of magnitude unlike the gcis of y rms and cl rms we provide visual representations of the convergent cl rms y rms and f series in figs 7 9 note how the quantity of interest is very close to its richardson extrapolation at the fine grid grid 1 for all cl rms y rms and f this implies that the fine grid already provides adequate spatial discretisation for the problem we are studying and further refinements while able to nudge our solutions even closer to the limit that is the richardson extrapolation may not be optimal in terms of usage of computational resources values of y rms and f at the fine grid already fall within experimental uncertainty as evidenced by our measurement in 2 4 and the work by koide et al 2013 hence all succeeding numerical data are gathered from the fine grid as for the temporal discretisation we relied on a simple cfl number based scheme hemsuwan et al 2018a c b in which the time step is chosen such that the maximum cfl number c in the computational domain is always less than 1 the cfl number c is defined in eq 21 as 21 c u δ t δ x where u δ t and δ x represents the flow velocity time step and characteristic length of cell respectively 4 single plate amplitude and frequency response 4 1 amplitude response we compared our experiment and numerical results with those from koide et al 2013 and nguyen et al 2012 in fig 10 fig 10a shows the amplitude response of our single plate experiment and simulation we use the root mean square value of the cylinder displacement to represent the amplitude responses instead of the maximum displacement the reason for this is twofold first using y rms facilitates comparison of data with nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 who also used y rms in their work second because the cylinder displacement is an intermediate quantity for the estimation of harnessed power maruai et al 2017 2018 and the usage of root mean square amplitude of cylinder displacement gives a direct preview of mean harnessed power there is virtually no vibration for both our experiment and simulation when u 18 2 except for a small peak at u 6 8 we attribute this peak to the upper branch of kviv which still exists although suppressed due to the cruciform configuration of the system shirakashi et al 1989 nguyen et al 2012 however when u exceeds 18 2 we observe a sudden jump in u right up to about 0 4 for both our experiment and simulation this we attribute to the formation of the streamwise vortices that drive sviv after the inception of sviv the value for y rms drops down to approximately 0 3 before recovering to a value that is close to what was observed by nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 this sudden jump followed by a gradual drop and a gradual rise in y rms was not found in the works of nguyen et al 2012 nor koide et al 2013 even though their experimental parameters are reasonably close to what we use in both our experiment and simulation we therefore attribute this difference to the higher turbulence level set in our work the turbulence level in the works of nguyen et al 2012 for example was 2 8 throughout their range of reynolds number instead the initial turbulence level in our setup both experimental and numerical is approximately double that value because of this the turbulence amplification due to the onset of streamwise vortices zhao and lu 2018 especially for a circular cylinder strip plate cruciform koide et al 2017 is also higher compared to the experiments of nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 this higher compound turbulence warps the dominant vortical structure and introduces an increasing amount of intermittency to the lift signal and by extension to the displacement time history of the cylinder an intermittent lift signal imposes the same trend on the y t signal reducing its overall mean amplitude which we compute in this work as y rms one can simply inspect the error bars within 18 2 u 22 7 in fig 10a to verify the greater sample dispersion within that range of u this intermittency ultimately vanishes as the dominant vortical structures become sufficiently stable to retain enough periodicity in its formation our numerical results also seem to support this argument as evidenced by the time history of u within 18 2 u 29 5 in fig 11 there exists a distinct increase in intermittency for the time histories in fig 11a that disappears once u 23 as can be seen in fig 11b we interpret this as the vortical structures becoming more energised and resilient against ambient excitation the further we advance into the sviv regime 4 2 frequency response fig 10b compares the frequency responses of our experiment and numerical results with those in nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 we use the normalised frequency f in fig 10b and the vibration strouhal number in fig 10c to aid comparison between the results here f is computed as the mean instantaneous frequency of the dominant component of y which we obtain in the course of calculating the phase lag between y and lift the procedure employed to decompose the y signal and obtain the instantaneous frequency is elaborated in 5 1 in our experiments the value for f always fall close to unity however if we inspect the size of the error bars we observed a range of u where there exists a higher degree of variance in the sample measurements between 13 6 u 20 5 the reason for this lies in 13 6 u 20 5 coinciding with the desynchronization region of the kviv regime up to u 18 2 and then overlaps with the intermittent vibration of sviv up to u 20 5 within these two regimes the cylinder displacement time history from which f is calculated varies considerably in amplitude and periodicity resulting in larger error bars in fig 10c we can see the overall trend being more similar to the results of koide et al 2013 rather than nguyen et al 2012 which is likely due to a higher similarity between our experimental setup with that of koide et al 2013 most striking in terms of the gap ratio g g d which is identical our numerical results exhibit a significantly different trend but only up to u 15 9 we observe in fig 10b that the vibration frequency of the cylinder increases linearly even past u 6 8 which is the upper branch of the kviv regime converting f into strouhal number reveals that the cylinder is vibrating close to the karman frequency of the system the karman frequency of a smooth fixed circular cylinder refers to the shedding frequency of karman vortices in its wake an empirical relationship with reynolds number exists for 250 re 2 10 5 which is the following blevins 1990 22 st 0 198 1 19 7 re the values we get using eq 22 are nearly constant about 0 19 for u 13 6 the slight discrepancy from our strouhal number mean 0 16 in the u 13 6 range can be ascribed to us studying a cruciform structure instead of the smooth circular cylinder upon which eq 22 was originally based blevins 1990 the discrepancies found especially in fig 10b most probably stem from the same reasons explained by nguyen et al 2012 the lowest y rms recorded in our simulation within 6 8 u 13 6 was in the order of 10 5 m 10 μm a numerical study has no problem recording vibration of this order as the precision of the numerical solution is only limited by the processor architecture experimental work however requires not only the sensitivity but also the isolation from the background noise that forces the cylinder to vibrate close to the natural frequency of the system f n nguyen et al 2012 which consequently overpowers this minimal amplitude vibration the values of f between 6 8 u 13 6 can therefore be considered as the limit of f in that range of u that is approached as the random background forcing present in experimental works tend to zero once streamwise vortices form however their shedding and cylinder vibration synchronises close to f n thus locking the normalised vibration frequency back to f 1 5 temporal evolution of the lift coefficient 5 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition and hilbert transform to obtain a clearer picture of the temporal characteristics of the lift and cylinder displacement signals we decided to employ the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method huang et al 1998 wu and huang 2008 on the signals and compute their instantaneous phase lag frequency and amplitude using the hilbert transform the hilbert transform ht has been used in the past to study the instantaneous phase and frequencies of kviv khalak and williamson 1999 however the signal must be monochromatic if we are to obtain a physically meaningful result after applying ht eemd is a way to pre process the signal and get components that 1 have zero mean and 2 have an equal number of extrema and zero crossings or they differ only by one functions that fulfil these criteria are called intrinsic mode functions imf and they guarantee a physically meaningful result to ht gumelar et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 unlike fourier transform which is an analytical method of signal decomposition based on circular functions in the complex plane eemd is algorithmic and the processes undertaken can be summarised as follows produce 150 white noise signals of length equal to the original signal and amplitude equal to 0 2 of the standard deviation of the original signal then add to the set of white noises the original signal creating 150 variations of the original signal following that we apply the empirical mode decomposition emd algorithm on each of the 150 signals the emd algorithm is summarised below 1 construct the envelope of the signal by connecting all maxima minima with cubic splines 2 find the local mean of the envelope for the span of the data 3 find the difference between the local mean and the original data 4 repeat steps 5 1 and 5 1 on the difference in 5 1 for ten times wu and huang 2008 the steps above produce a set of intrinsic mode functions or imfs for each of the 150 variations of the original signal then we average the first imf component from each of the decomposed original signal variations to obtain the first eemd imf c 1 of the original signal we do the same for the second third until the i th component for each of the 150 original signal variations thus obtaining c 2 c 3 c i to compute the phase lag between the characteristic imfs of the lift coefficient and normalised cylinder displacement we select the imf components with the highest correlation to the y signal at that particular u to represent the signals denoted as c y y for the characteristic normalised cylinder displacement and c cl y as the characteristic lift coefficient signal the phase lag instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude of the signal is subsequently computed by constructing an analytical signal z t from c 1 c 2 c i by computing the hilbert transform of the imf h i 23 h i t 1 π pv c i τ t τ d τ where pv denotes the cauchy principal value and then constructing the analytical signal as follows 24 z t c i t i h i t note that i in eq 24 is the complex number we refer the reader interested in the details of eemd and hilbert transform also collectively known as the hilbert huang transform hht to the following excellent texts on the subject huang and attoh okine 2005 huang 2014 5 2 the kviv regime u 13 6 at reduced velocities u 2 3 and 4 5 the phase lags φ deg between cl and u are practically zero throughout the whole observation time the characteristic imfs of cl and y at u 4 5 exemplifies this trend as showcased in fig 12 here fig 12a shows the temporal evolution of c y y and c cl y which are the characteristic imfs of y and cl respectively fig 12b shows the phase lag between c y y and c cl y and fig 12c presents the hht spectrogram of cl the hht spectrogram visualises the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the imf components of cl the trend that one notices in fig 12b is similar to what was observed in khalak and williamson 1999 a study that also employs the hilbert transform to obtain the instantaneous phase albeit without eemd the dominant imf component imf component sustaining the highest amplitude throughout the whole observation time of the lift coefficient has a normalised frequency f cl f cl f n fig 12c centred at approximately f cl 0 75 once we enter the upper branch of kviv at u 6 8 φ jumps to approximately 110 deg this jump in φ is characteristic of the transition to the upper branches as also observed by maruai et al 2018 among others both c cl y and c y y signals are visibly very periodic and the dominant frequency band of cl is centred at 1 as one can verify in fig 13 c as we increase u even further up to u 13 6 we see a similar trend for all u 9 1 11 4 13 6 examined c y y and c cl y are both qualitatively very periodic their phase lags are very close to 180 deg and the dominant cl frequency bands exhibit a time averaged value that increases linearly with respect to u in a manner that the strouhal number of cl is always 0 16 on average we present the representative case of u 13 6 in fig 14 note how φ in this range of u varies much less with respect to time compared to φ at u 6 8 and the dominant frequency band of cl is much narrower compared to the dominant frequency band at u 6 8 indicating a highly periodic and self similar oscillation of lift 5 3 transition to sviv 15 9 u 18 2 previously in the u 13 6 range we observed that the temporal profile of both cl and y are very similar to each other except that cl leads y by a certain amount this similarity in profile supports the assertion that the vibration within u 13 6 is driven exclusively by the shedding of karman vortices which brings the onset of the alternating lift analogously one might expect a similar profile between cl and y when streamwise vortices drive the vibration however this does not seem to be the case once we reach u 15 9 we observe that it has become difficult to argue that the profile of y is just a lagged version of the profile of cl this is shown in fig 15 a with the enlarged version in fig 15b the profile of cl looks like the result of several signals in superposition which one can almost distinguish from the presence of two types of maxima at two different amplitude heights we put a red dashed line and a red dashed dot line in fig 15b as visual cues indicating the two amplitude heights decomposing the lift coefficient signal using eemd reveals partial evidence supporting the compound signal hypothesis once we have decomposed the signal using eemd we replot fig 15a using c cl y and c y y in fig 16 a one can clearly see that the part of cl signal responsible for driving the vibration at u 15 9 is embedded in the original cl signal fig 16a and decomposition via eemd managed to recover this signal which leads c y y by approximately 150 deg on average throughout the whole observation time fig 16b this decline from φ 180 deg at reduced velocities 9 1 u 13 6 to φ 150 deg at u 15 9 is quite sizeable suggesting a fundamental change in flow dynamics particularly in terms of vortical structure another notable change is the increased temporal variation in φ from its time averaged value in contrast to the evolution of φ in the range 9 1 u 13 6 which has very little jitter throughout the observation time inspecting the hht spectrogram in fig 16c reveals two dominant bands in the frequency domain the first one marked with a white continuous rectangular box is the instantaneous frequency for the imf component of lift shown in fig 16a and its mean frequency lies close to the natural frequency of the system f cl 1 there is however a second band of the frequency with nearly similar amplitude around f cl 3 3 marked with a white dashed rectangular box computing the strouhal number from this frequency returns a value of st 0 20 which is very close to the strouhal number for karman vortices as predicted by eq 22 at the reynolds number equivalent to u 15 9 which is re 7 9 10 3 we thus attribute this second band of frequency as being the footprint left by the shedding of karman vortices and the first band as the result of streamwise vortex shedding through visual inspection of fig 16c both of these dominant frequency bands are markedly wider and the individual values are more scattered from their time averaged values than any of their counterparts within u 13 6 the knowledge that karman vortices continue to exist and shed from a cruciform structure during sviv is not new in the literature however this is the first time the lift signal from a cruciform structure undergoing sviv has been subjected to eemd revealing the signature of the two dominant vortical structures regulating the flow around the cruciform although the amplitude size of the instantaneous frequency band due to karman vortex is comparable to the streamwise vortex the reason why the cylinder resists locking into its frequency is perhaps that its frequency too distant from the natural frequency of the system f n the shedding frequency of the streamwise vortex is much closer to f n and is thus preferred by the cylinder we consider the transition to sviv to be complete at u 18 2 when the time averaged phase lag drops further to 20 deg fig 17 a and b documents this observation the instantaneous phase lag is observed to slip through 360 deg a little past the 2 s 2s time stamp by inspecting fig 17a we found that a little past 2s is when distortions in the periodicity of c cl y occur the slipping through 360 deg was also observed by khalak and williamson 1999 in their work on kviv highlighting the quasi periodic nature of the signal being analysed there the slip appeared in khalak and williamson 1999 at the initial branch of kviv the overall low value of φ 20 deg for the whole observation time at u 18 2 coupled with the presence of φ slippage are suggestive of the possibility for u 18 2 being the initial branch of sviv 5 4 the stable sviv regime u 20 5 as u is increased to 20 5 we can see a jump in φ from a mean value of approximately 20 deg to about 120 deg shown in fig 18 a the phase slippage discussed previously is also observed indicating the quasi periodic nature of the lift coefficient signal at this u incidentally this quasi periodicity seems to be the norm for the lift signals up to u 27 3 as suggested by the phase slippages evident in fig 18b c and d the slippage only stops once u reaches 29 5 suggesting a more periodic behaviour of the lift coefficient compared to its counterparts between 20 5 u 27 3 although the instantaneous phase between 20 5 u 27 3 implies a quasi periodic nature their time averaged values at each u are contained in the narrow region 114 φ deg 135 as is the value for φ at u 29 5 this observation that the time averaged value of φ to only slowly vary with respect to u once u increases past 20 5 can be interpreted as the dominant flow structures settling into a stable form that becomes more resilient against external excitations based on this feature we classified 20 5 u 29 5 as the upper branch of sviv the data on the evolution of φ allows us to construct a map of the branches of vibration modes observed in the range of u that we studied as the branches are mapped against u we need a representative value of φ at each u to achieve this we took the time averaged values of φ i e φ mean and plotted them against u in fig 19 the region a indicates the initial branch of kviv where φ mean is close to zero region b denotes the upper lower branch of kviv where the system experiences a jump from φ mean 0 to greater than 110 deg the value of φ mean settles very close to 180 deg towards the end of this upper lower branch then φ mean experiences a slight drop from about one sixth the value of φ mean in region b as we enter region c marking the start of the transition to the sviv regime following this the system undergoes a more sudden drop to φ mean 20 deg at u 18 2 this we designate as region d finally in region e we observe another jump in φ mean from φ mean 20 deg in region d to approximately 120 deg when u 20 5 6 estimation of harnessable power 6 1 mathematical model for power estimation the mathematical model for harnessable power estimation in this study follows that which had been derived in raghavan et al 2007 in these works the authors mentioned that work done by the oscillating cylinder w cyl during one cycle of oscillation t osc is as follows 25 w cyl 0 t osc f l y d t where both the lift f l and cylinder velocity y are both functions of time through several manipulations and simplifying assumptions sun et al 2016 the power captured by the system can be written using our parameters as the fluid power 26 p fluid rms 1 2 ρ π c cl rms u 2 f cyl y rms d l sin φ or the mechanical power 27 p mech rms 8 π 3 m eff ζ t o t y rms f cyl 2 f n here p fluid rms p mech rms l c cl rms ζ t o t and m eff are the root mean square of fluid power root mean square of mechanical power length of the circular cylinder characteristic root mean square of lift amplitude total damping coefficient and the system effective mass respectively we use c cl y to represent c cl rms in eq 26 we choose to use root mean square parameters with subscript rms quantities in eq 25 instead of the maximum values like the original authors because that may lead to a misunderstanding that the maximum value is sustained throughout the observation window this obviously is not always the case in our study especially once the system transits into the sviv regime recall that the time series analysis of y t and cl t in 4 1 revealed that there is a degree of intermittency in both signals that cannot be overlooked at certain ranges of u using the root mean square value allows us to partially take this into account in the estimation of harnessable power fig 20 shows the comparison between power estimated from our experiment and numerical results with the experimental results of nguyen et al 2012 and the direct power measurement of koide et al 2013 only the value for p mech rms is computed from our experimental results due to the absence of lift data our numerical results have both lift and cylinder displacement data and hence we calculated both p fluid rms and p mech rms we estimated the power from the experimental results of nguyen et al 2012 by interpolating missing data points in both their amplitude and frequency responses to compute the value of p mech rms at a given value of u the direct power measurement by koide et al 2013 was done by connecting the elastic support of the cylinder to a coil the coil moves with the cylinder thus creating a relative pistoning motion against a fixed magnet and produces an alternating current the estimated power in the kviv regime u 15 9 produces power only in the order of μ w which is relatively insignificant in contrast to the magnitude of power produced in the sviv regime mw in the region 18 2 u 22 7 p mech rms for our experiment and numerical work exhibits a similar trend where we observed a sudden jump in power output followed by a gradual decrease this gradual decrease can be attributed to the increased turbulence level right after the onset of sviv that imposes a degree of intermittency to the normalised cylinder displacement signal y for p fluid rms however the quantity exhibits a monotonic increase in the range 18 2 u 22 7 we only observe a dip in p fluid rms at u 25 0 suggesting an increase in intermittency of c cl y at this u in the experimental work of nguyen et al 2012 p mech rms only experiences a monotonic increase in the region 18 2 u 22 7 this decidedly different response of the system compared to ours most likely stem from the difference in the actual cruciform used by nguyen et al 2012 they used two circular cylinders of diameter 10 mm as their cruciform whereas we used a circular cylinder strip plate in both our experiments and numerical work there are no data from the direct power measurement of koide et al 2013 to compare with within 18 2 u 22 7 in the range 25 0 u 29 5 we find a reasonably good agreement between the trend found in all data compared they increase monotonically with respect to u although the value of our p fluid rms falls quite notably below the value of p mech rms at u 25 0 other values of p fluid rms p mech rms from our numerical results and the direct power measurements by koide et al 2013 agree well within 27 3 u 29 5 the only set of power data that consistently falls quite a distance below the others is the p mech rms estimated from the experimental data of nguyen et al 2012 which again is most probably due to the difference in the actual geometry of the cruciform used in their investigation 6 2 possibility for increasing fluid power p fluid rms recall in fig 20 that although p fluid rms is computed according to eq 26 which uses c cl rms instead of the actual root mean square amplitude of lift cl rms the resulting power estimate does not result in a trend that is totally different from the trend found in the other datasets furthermore except for p mech rms estimated from the experimental data of nguyen et al 2012 the values of p fluid rms are in fairly good agreement with other data that it is compared against at high u u 27 3 and 29 5 we see this is an indication that the lift component selected for use in computation of p fluid rms is an arguably faithful representation of the force driving the motion of the cylinder this suggests that the motion of the cylinder once it enters the sviv regime is driven only by one component and not the totality of the lift force this component that has a time averaged frequency close to the natural frequency of the system f n is the streamwise component of lift another significant imf component of the lift force in the sviv regime is the component whose mean frequency is close to the karman frequency of vortex shedding as explained in 5 3 this karman component of lift has a similar amplitude size as the streamwise component of lift as evidenced in fig 21 and as such is also a dominant component of lift the karman components are marked with a dashed white box and the streamwise components are marked with a solid white box following the convention in figs 12 14 and 16 and 17 however the karman component fails to affect the cylinder vibration like the streamwise component most probably due to the large difference between the mean frequency of the karman component and the natural frequency of the system f n the streamwise component has a mean frequency close to f n and is hence able to synchronise with the vibration of the cylinder producing a sizeable amplitude response fig 22 shows the root mean square amplitude of the karman and streamwise components of lift in the sviv regime u 18 2 between 18 2 u 22 7 the magnitude of the karman and streamwise components are nearly equal however once we exceed u 22 7 fig 22 shows that the contribution to the root mean square amplitude of total lift by the karman component is on average twice the contribution of the streamwise component having such a significant contribution towards the root mean square amplitude of total lift implies that there is a significant portion of energy from the free stream being used to energise the karman vortex structure in the flow let us assume a hypothetical situation where we can transfer the contribution by the karman component to the streamwise component of lift in other words consider the situation where we can completely redirect the energy from the karman to the streamwise vortex then the value for c cl rms in eq 26 will increase close to a factor of 2 when 18 2 u 22 7 and close to a factor of 3 when 25 0 u 29 5 this increase in c cl rms will lead to the scaling of p fluid rms by the same factor keeping the other parameters in eq 26 constant this exercise demonstrates the room for improvement possible for p fluid rms in future developments of cruciform energy harvesters one possible method of improving p fluid rms is by implementing a modified version of the cruciform that is able to enforce the dominance of the vortical structure that is able to lock into f n which in fig 22 is the streamwise vortex against the vortical structures that do not i e the karman vortices we will outline such a method in our future work 7 conclusions in this study we numerically investigated the temporal evolution of the lift coefficient and cylinder displacement signals of an elastically supported cruciform system in the range 1 1 10 3 re 14 6 10 3 or 2 3 u 29 5 our circular cylinder diameter is 10 mm and the natural frequency of the system is 4 4 hz validation of key numerical results was made experimentally in a custom built open flow channel using a cruciform system whose parameters were tuned as close as possible to the quantities used in the numerical study decomposing the lift coefficient signal in the sviv regime 15 9 u 29 5 using eemd allows us to see that the complexity of the lift coefficient signal as being caused by the superpositioning of two dominant components of lift one due to the shedding of karman and the other due to the shedding of streamwise vortices the former has a frequency close to the vortex shedding frequency of karman vortex from a smooth isolated circular cylinder while the latter has a mean frequency close to f n application of the hilbert huang transform on the dominant component of cylinder displacement and the component of lift most correlated to it allows for the computation of the instantaneous phase lag between lift and cylinder displacement the time averaged phase lag revealed five branches of vibration among which is the initial branch of sviv at u 18 2 which has never been identified before in the literature we also computed the instantaneous frequency of the lift coefficient thus revealing the loss of periodicity and self similarity in the lift coefficient signal as the system enters the sviv regime estimation of power from our results show that the root mean square mechanical and fluid power computed from our experimental and numerical work agree to varying degrees depending on u with data from similar studies in the literature finally we estimated that the root mean square fluid power can potentially be increased close to a factor of 2 within 18 2 u 22 7 and close to a factor of 3 when 25 0 u 29 5 we base this estimation on the premise of redirecting the contribution to the root mean square amplitude of total lift from karman vortex shedding towards the streamwise component of lift alone credit authorship contribution statement ahmad adzlan conceptualization methodology

21013,we investigated the displacement and lift time series of a circular cylinder strip plate cruciform system for energy harvesting in the reynolds number range 1 1 10 3 re 14 6 10 3 numerically using the open source c library openfoam the karman vortex induced vibration kviv regime was identified between reduced velocity u 2 3 and 13 6 while the streamwise vortex induced vibration sviv regime was identified between 18 2 u 29 5 we analysed the cylinder displacement and lift time series using the hilbert huang transform hht within this range of u karman vortex shedding contributes nearly as much as streamwise vortex shedding to the root mean square amplitude of total lift while between 25 0 u 29 5 the karman component contribution is on average twice that of the streamwise component these findings hint at the possibility to improve the power output of the harvester by a factor of two between 18 2 u 22 7 and by a factor of three between 25 0 u 29 5 if we can unite the contribution to the root mean square amplitude of the total lift under a single vibration driving mechanism the shedding of streamwise vortex graphical abstract image 1 keywords vortex induced vibration vibration energy harvester cfd simulation streamwise vorticity ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd hilbert transform 1 introduction streamwise vortex induced vibration sviv is a type of vortex induced vibration viv driven by vortical structures whose vorticity vector points in the direction of the free stream in recent decades there have been efforts to exploit the sviv phenomenon from cruciform structures for energy harvesting an example of which is given in fig 1 the literature on this subject can be broadly categorised into two groups how the mechanical properties of the oscillator e g mass ratio damping etc affects the amplitude frequency response of sviv koide et al 2009 2013 nguyen et al 2012 and how the minutiae of the flow field affect the force driving the vibration of the cylinder i e the fluid mechanical aspect of the system deng et al 2007 koide et al 2017 zhao and lu 2018 in the first focus area researchers studied some permutation of the following method to convert the vibration into electrical power the method consists of a coil and magnet the coil which moves with the vibrating cylinder creates relative motion against the magnet which is placed in the hollow of the coil koide et al 2009 while investigating the system at a reynolds number in the order of re o 10 4 koide et al 2009 showed that increased damping due to energy harvesting reduces the maximum vibration amplitude close to a factor of 4 amplitude reduction due to increased total damping was also mentioned in bernitsas et al 2008 bernitsas and raghavan 2008 bernitsas et al 2009 further investigation in nguyen et al 2012 revealed that damping not only affects the amplitude response of the cylinder but also narrows the synchronisation region between vortex shedding and cylinder vibration moreover nguyen et al 2012 demonstrated a strong coupling between mass ratio and damping in determining both the width of the synchronisation region and the maximum amplitude response of the cylinder in the second focus area investigators turned their attention to the details of the flow where streamwise vortex shedding occurs one such study carefully shot motion pictures of the dye injected flow koide et al 2017 at reynolds number in the order of re o 10 3 a lower reynolds number re reduces the amount of turbulence in the flow allowing a clearer shot of the vortex structures their study also highlights the higher level of turbulence produced by the circular cylinder strip plate cruciform in contrast to the twin circular cylinder cruciform which diminishes the periodicity of vortex shedding although visually enlightening this and other more qualitative studies contribute little towards improving our understanding of the relationship between vortex shedding and the resulting lift deng et al 2007 demonstrated a way to overcome such a shortcoming in their study deng et al 2007 examined the flow field of a twin circular cylinder cruciform using computational fluid dynamics cfd their domain stretches 28 d in the streamwise direction 16 d in the transverse direction and 12 d in the spanwise direction they studied an re range yet another order of magnitude smaller than that studied by koide et al 2017 possibly to get an even clearer visualisation of the vortical structures with less turbulence and to ease computational requisites at a fixed re 150 streamwise vortices form even at a gap ratio of 2 this result differs quite strikingly from koide et al 2006 2007 conducted at an re twice the order of magnitude of deng et al 2007 an indication that the minimum gap ratio needed for the onset of streamwise varies with respect to re they also observed that when the gap ratio g which they denote as l d in their paper increases from 3 to 4 the maximum amplitude of the lift coefficient increases by almost threefold this can be attributed quite easily to the current vortex pair shed by the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder immediately disturbs the pair shed from the upstream cylinder when g 3 the lift coefficient increases by about a factor of 3 when this immediate disturbance diminishes at g 4 the visualisation of three dimensional 3d vorticity isocontours enables us to quickly establish this link vis à vis the lift coefficient signal the authors use of cfd made this possible a similar study in the order of magnitude re o 10 2 by zhao and lu 2018 particularly highlighted the immense utility of cfd as a tool to research sviv or flow around a cruciform in general they computed the sectional lift coefficient along the upstream cylinder and the time history of this sectional lift coefficient revealed two different modes of vortex shedding namely parallel and k shaped they also paid attention to the local flow patterns that vary along the length of the upstream cylinder such as the trailing vortex flow necklace vortex flow and flow in the small gap denoted as sg flow the discontinuities in the phase angle of the sectional lift coefficient along the upstream cylinder seems to suggest the inadequateness of attributing the lift coefficient to streamwise vortex shedding alone particularly when karman vortex streamlines were also observed some distance away from the junction of the cruciform shirakashi et al 1989 also made a similar observation in their experimental work this leads us to hypothesise that the lift signal is more appropriately viewed as the streamwise karman vortex induced composite lift signal however we could not find studies that took this viewpoint and worked out its implication on power generation in their investigation of sviv the objectives of this study are thus threefold 1 to take a closer look at the amplitude and frequency response of a circular cylinder strip plate cruciform especially in reduced velocity u ranges where the transition from kviv to sviv occurs 2 to demonstrate the compositeness of the lift signal of an sviv system and establish the difference between the lift signal characteristics in the kviv and sviv regime and 3 to shed light on how the contribution from the karman and streamwise components of lift changes as we increase u after the onset of sviv and predict how much improvement in the power generation can be anticipated if we are able to unify the lift amplitude contributions due to karman and streamwise vortex shedding here u u f n d with u f n and d being the freestream velocity natural frequency of the system and the diameter of the circular cylinder respectively the following 2 details the methodology we employ to conduct this study we present and discuss our results in 4 5 and 6 we describe our conclusions in 7 2 methodology 2 1 problem geometry the geometrical setup for this study builds on the work of maruai et al 2017 2018 who studied both experimentally and numerically the flow induced motion fim of a square cylinder with a downstream flat plate their simulation results are in good agreement with their own experiment and with the experimental results of kawabata et al 2013 in the reynolds number range 3 6 10 3 re 12 5 10 3 this is well within the reynolds number studied in this work i e 1 1 10 3 re 14 6 10 3 our x y plane fundamentally follows the dimensions used in maruai et al 2017 2018 except for the cylinder shape which in this study is circular and the 20 d distance to the outlet is measured from the downstream face of the strip plate this is shown in fig 2 we chose the cylinder plate gap g to be 0 16 d as koide et al 2013 has shown that this gap size sustains the highest sviv amplitude over the widest range of u in comparison to other gap sizes as the problem geometry is explicitly three dimensional 3d the x y plane is extruded in the z direction thus obtaining a 3d domain as can be seen in fig 2 the circular cylinder extends from z d 7 5 to z d 7 5 while the strip plate extends from 10 5 to y d 10 5 the z direction extent is set as z d 7 5 is already more than twice the spanwise reach of the streamwise vortex thus sufficient for the vortices to materialise in our numerical solution to compare the spanwise extent of the numerical study by deng et al 2007 is z d 6 and the spanwise extents of experiments by nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 are z d 5 table 1 summarises the boundary conditions imposed on each of the boundary patches in the simulation domain see fig 6 the symbols u p ν t and ν refer to the flow velocity pressure kinetic eddy viscosity and its mediating variable respectively at the inlet the fixedvalue for u is the freestream velocity u m s while u 0 m s at the strip plate the fixedvalue for p at the outlet is 0 m2 s2 and the fixedvalue for ν is 0 m2 s at the cylinder and strip plate patches 2 2 numerical method the objectives of our study necessitate the solution of the continuity and 3d unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 3d urans equations we achieve this by using openfoam an open source computational fluid dynamics cfd platform written in c specifically we work to solve the following continuity and urans equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 p p x i x j 2 ν s i j u j u i the symbols u x t ρ p ν s and u are the mean component of velocity spatial component time density pressure kinematic viscosity mean strain rate and the fluctuating component of velocity respectively the mean strain rate s i j is given by 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i this study employs the spalart allmaras turbulence model to approximate the reynolds stress tensor τ i j u j u i this turbulence model has been shown to produce results that agree reasonably well with experiments in similar flow induced motion fim studies ding et al 2015a b we use the boussinesq approximation to relate the reynolds stress tensor to the mean velocity gradient 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j where ν t represents the kinetic eddy viscosity ν t is in turn a function of ν and f ν 1 while f ν 1 is a function of χ and c ν 1 and χ a function of ν and ν as shown in eq 5 5a ν t ν f ν 1 5b f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 5c x ν ν here ν serves to mediate the turbulence model and dictates how ν is conserved ν t u j ν x j c b 1 s ν c w 1 f w ν d 2 6 1 σ x j ν ν ν x j c b 2 ν x i ν x i c b 1 c b 2 and c ν 1 are constant with values 0 1335 0 622 and 7 1 respectively c w 1 is given by 7 c w 1 c b 1 κ 1 c b 2 σ where additional constants κ and σ are 0 41 and 2 3 respectively f w on the other hand is given by 8 f w g 1 c w 3 6 g 6 c w 3 1 6 here c w 3 2 while g is given by 9 g r c w 2 r 6 r where r is 10 r min ν s κ 2 d 2 10 additionally s is 11 s ω ν κ 2 d 2 f ν 2 where ω and d are the magnitude of vorticity and the distance from the mesh nodes to the nearest wall respectively finally f ν 2 is 12 f ν 2 1 χ 1 χ f ν 1 we solve these equations numerically using the pimple algorithm which combines the transient solver piso with the steady state solver simple for improved numerical stability 2 3 dynamic mesh motion in this study the cylinder in viv moves perpendicular to the free stream direction the motion unavoidably distorts the mesh around it degrading important mesh metrics such as non orthogonality and skewness however we can diffuse the mesh deformation to the neighbouring nodes as per the following laplace equation 13 γ u 0 here u represents the mesh deformation velocity and γ is displacement diffusion we chose γ 1 l 2 where l is the cell centre distance to the nearest cylinder edges we implement the gamg linear solver with the gauss seidel smoother to solve eq 13 the dynamic mesh algorithm then updates the mesh node positions according to the following equation 14 x new x old u δ t the solver resumes the solution of eqs 1 and 2 once the mesh node positions are updated another dynamic mesh handling technique used in this study is the arbitrarily coupled mesh interface acmi that allows non conforming meshes to slide over another thus preserving the mesh quality around a moving object the tiny gap between the cylinder and strip plate limits our ability to diffuse the mesh deformation to the surrounding space acmi is thus implemented at the centre of the gap between the circular cylinder and the strip plate as shown in fig 2 to circumvent this problem this method has been successfully implemented in the works of ding et al 2015b zhang et al 2018 preserving the quality of their mesh and controlling their courant friedrichs lewy cfl number 2 4 open flow channel experiment we set up an experimental rig to validate our numerical results at reduced velocity u 22 7 we chose u 22 7 because that value of u is where the vibration driving mechanism is known to transit from karman to streamwise vortex shedding koide et al 2013 the experimental rig consists of a closed loop open channel circuit based on the water tunnel used by nguyen et al 2012 shown in fig 3 the cross section of our test section is a square with sides 100 mm in length the test section is 1500 mm long the system for providing elastic support and damping to the circular cylinder follows closely those used by kawabata et al 2013 and koide et al 2013 2017 which can be summarised as follows the stiffness coefficient k of the plate spring is determined through a simple weight versus displacement test sun et al 2016 at various active lengths of the spring this provides a calibration curve of stiffness coefficient k against plate spring length l we can then adjust the length of the plate spring to obtain the desired value for k on the other hand the damping of the system is adjusted using t shaped aluminium plates fixed at either end of the cylinder endplate and a pair of neodymium magnets contained in a claw shaped casing the further the t shaped plate is pushed into the opening of the claw the denser the magnetic field it needs to cut through during motion thus dissipating more energy we then calibrate the damping produced at various depths at which the t shaped plate is pushed into the casing via free decay tests of the cylinder in still water the procedure for conducting free decay tests are detailed in raghavan 2007 flow inside the open channel is driven by a 3 728 kw 5 hp centrifugal pump controlled using a voltage controller the input voltage for the centrifugal pump is calibrated against the centreline velocity of the test section 750 mm from the inlet i e mid length of the test section we show this schematically in fig 4 here we define the centreline of the test section as the line 50 mm from the bottom and 50 mm from either of the sidewalls of the test section we placed the cylinder in the same position during experimental runs the centreline velocity u cent is measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv sampling at 200 hz the resulting calibration curve is applicable for determining u cent at input voltages 30 v in v 100 we measured the turbulence intensity along the centreline to be about 5 we obtained the time history for cylinder displacement y by using a video camera pointed normal to the cylinder endplate we placed a visual marker on the endplate and the motion of the marker captured by the camera is analysed using tracker a motion analysis tool built on the open source physics java framework to validate our experimental setup we tuned to the best of our ability our experimental parameters to the values used by koide et al 2013 and test whether we can replicate their results table 2 summarises the parameters in lieu of that paper we show a sample of the normalised displacement y y d time series in fig 5 computing the statistics of y and the normalised cylinder vibration frequency f f cyl f n f cyl being the vibration frequency of the cylinder from several runs gave us a value of y 0 33 0 03 and f 1 03 0 04 koide et al 2013 obtained y 0 32 and f 1 09 under a similar u condition we thus take this fairly successful reproduction of the results of koide et al 2013 as an indication of readiness for further data collection 3 numerical setup validation 3 1 grid independency study via richardson extrapolation and grid convergence index a common method for checking the grid independency of quantities of interest in a numerical study is by demonstrating that one obtained similar results on all variants of the spatial discretisation usually three grids and then proceeding with the numerical study using the medium variant on the computational domain see e g ding et al 2013 ding et al 2019 or wang et al 2020 which settled on the coarse variant of their spatial discretisation our method of choice however checks for the convergence of the quantities of interest as one solves the governing equation on successively finer grid resolutions richardson and gaunt 1927 stern et al 2001 this method pays attention not only on the presumed converged value but also on the trend of convergence literature that employ this method impose a monotonic convergence condition stern et al 2001 mat ali et al 2011 ali et al 2012 maruai et al 2018 on their quantities of interest adding an extra layer of confidence in the final form of the spatial discretisation additionally this method allows for a quantitative description of the degree of convergence through the grid convergence index gci let f 1 f 2 f 3 f k denote the quantity of interest obtained from several grids a larger subscript indicates a coarser grid thus f 1 denotes the finest while f k denotes the coarsest grid let the difference between successive solutions be ε 2 1 ε 3 2 ε 4 3 ε n n 1 where ε 2 1 f 2 f 1 ε 3 2 f 3 f 2 and so on then the gci is defined as 15 gci i 1 i f s ε i 1 i f i r p 1 100 where f s f i and r p denotes the safety factor 1 25 quantity of interest and the refinement ratio r between successive grids raised to the order of accuracy of the series of solution p we refer the reader to stern et al 2001 langley research centre 2018 for a more detailed discussion on r p we can estimate what the solution approaches as the grid size approaches zero by using the p th method briefly we compute the generalised richardson extrapolation of the quantity of interest as follows 16 f re f 1 f 1 f 2 r p 1 where f re is the richardson extrapolation of the quantity of interest using f re to estimate the limit of the monotonically convergent series of f i we can determine the percentage difference of our solution on our finest grid from this limit as 17 e i f i f re f re 100 table 3 summarises the result of our grid independency study for the sviv reduced velocity of u 22 7 we identified three quantities central to the investigation of fluid structure phenomena especially the flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder they are the vibration amplitude vibration frequency and lift coefficient of the cylinder we solve the governing equations on three grids which are numbered 1 for the finest 2 for the medium and 3 for the coarsest shown in fig 6 if we let v i be the volume of the i th cell in the grid and n be the total number of cells in the domain then the average cell size is 18 h 1 n i 1 n v i 1 3 and the normalised average cell size is hence 19 h d 1 n d i 1 n v i 1 3 both y rms and cl rms starts at an initial value smaller than their richardson extrapolations f re before approaching it as we decrease the average cell size h this similar trend can perhaps be attributed to the causal relationship between the lift coefficient and vibration amplitude the lift drives and sustains the vibration hence a small lift produces a small vibration and when the lift amplitude becomes higher so too does the vibration amplitude the vibration frequency on the other hand starts at a value larger than its f re before approaching f re the quantity cl rms experiences the most significant drop in gci as we refine the grid the gci is close to one third 30 92 as we refine the grid from coarse to medium with a refinement ratio of 1 376 the refinement ratio is calculated by dividing the number of cells in one grid with the next one down the refinement line following the grid numbering convention explained previously dividing the number of cells in the fine grid grid 1 with the number of cells in the medium grid grid 2 gives us the refinement ratio from medium to fine or r 2 1 similarly dividing the number of cells in the medium grid grid 2 with the number of cells in the coarse grid grid 3 gives us the refinement ratio from coarse to medium or r 3 2 we can generalise this to i number of grids as follows 20 r i 1 i s grid i 1 s grid i where s grid i denotes the total number of cells in the i th grid the gci of cl rms drops further to 1 63 as the mesh is refined more with a refinement ratio of 1 304 the gci for y rms also drops by one order of magnitude as can be seen by comparing gci 3 2 with gci 2 1 again this similar trend of improvement points to the causal relationship between lift and displacement of the cylinder the gci for f however drops by approximately a factor of 6 instead of one order of magnitude unlike the gcis of y rms and cl rms we provide visual representations of the convergent cl rms y rms and f series in figs 7 9 note how the quantity of interest is very close to its richardson extrapolation at the fine grid grid 1 for all cl rms y rms and f this implies that the fine grid already provides adequate spatial discretisation for the problem we are studying and further refinements while able to nudge our solutions even closer to the limit that is the richardson extrapolation may not be optimal in terms of usage of computational resources values of y rms and f at the fine grid already fall within experimental uncertainty as evidenced by our measurement in 2 4 and the work by koide et al 2013 hence all succeeding numerical data are gathered from the fine grid as for the temporal discretisation we relied on a simple cfl number based scheme hemsuwan et al 2018a c b in which the time step is chosen such that the maximum cfl number c in the computational domain is always less than 1 the cfl number c is defined in eq 21 as 21 c u δ t δ x where u δ t and δ x represents the flow velocity time step and characteristic length of cell respectively 4 single plate amplitude and frequency response 4 1 amplitude response we compared our experiment and numerical results with those from koide et al 2013 and nguyen et al 2012 in fig 10 fig 10a shows the amplitude response of our single plate experiment and simulation we use the root mean square value of the cylinder displacement to represent the amplitude responses instead of the maximum displacement the reason for this is twofold first using y rms facilitates comparison of data with nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 who also used y rms in their work second because the cylinder displacement is an intermediate quantity for the estimation of harnessed power maruai et al 2017 2018 and the usage of root mean square amplitude of cylinder displacement gives a direct preview of mean harnessed power there is virtually no vibration for both our experiment and simulation when u 18 2 except for a small peak at u 6 8 we attribute this peak to the upper branch of kviv which still exists although suppressed due to the cruciform configuration of the system shirakashi et al 1989 nguyen et al 2012 however when u exceeds 18 2 we observe a sudden jump in u right up to about 0 4 for both our experiment and simulation this we attribute to the formation of the streamwise vortices that drive sviv after the inception of sviv the value for y rms drops down to approximately 0 3 before recovering to a value that is close to what was observed by nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 this sudden jump followed by a gradual drop and a gradual rise in y rms was not found in the works of nguyen et al 2012 nor koide et al 2013 even though their experimental parameters are reasonably close to what we use in both our experiment and simulation we therefore attribute this difference to the higher turbulence level set in our work the turbulence level in the works of nguyen et al 2012 for example was 2 8 throughout their range of reynolds number instead the initial turbulence level in our setup both experimental and numerical is approximately double that value because of this the turbulence amplification due to the onset of streamwise vortices zhao and lu 2018 especially for a circular cylinder strip plate cruciform koide et al 2017 is also higher compared to the experiments of nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 this higher compound turbulence warps the dominant vortical structure and introduces an increasing amount of intermittency to the lift signal and by extension to the displacement time history of the cylinder an intermittent lift signal imposes the same trend on the y t signal reducing its overall mean amplitude which we compute in this work as y rms one can simply inspect the error bars within 18 2 u 22 7 in fig 10a to verify the greater sample dispersion within that range of u this intermittency ultimately vanishes as the dominant vortical structures become sufficiently stable to retain enough periodicity in its formation our numerical results also seem to support this argument as evidenced by the time history of u within 18 2 u 29 5 in fig 11 there exists a distinct increase in intermittency for the time histories in fig 11a that disappears once u 23 as can be seen in fig 11b we interpret this as the vortical structures becoming more energised and resilient against ambient excitation the further we advance into the sviv regime 4 2 frequency response fig 10b compares the frequency responses of our experiment and numerical results with those in nguyen et al 2012 and koide et al 2013 we use the normalised frequency f in fig 10b and the vibration strouhal number in fig 10c to aid comparison between the results here f is computed as the mean instantaneous frequency of the dominant component of y which we obtain in the course of calculating the phase lag between y and lift the procedure employed to decompose the y signal and obtain the instantaneous frequency is elaborated in 5 1 in our experiments the value for f always fall close to unity however if we inspect the size of the error bars we observed a range of u where there exists a higher degree of variance in the sample measurements between 13 6 u 20 5 the reason for this lies in 13 6 u 20 5 coinciding with the desynchronization region of the kviv regime up to u 18 2 and then overlaps with the intermittent vibration of sviv up to u 20 5 within these two regimes the cylinder displacement time history from which f is calculated varies considerably in amplitude and periodicity resulting in larger error bars in fig 10c we can see the overall trend being more similar to the results of koide et al 2013 rather than nguyen et al 2012 which is likely due to a higher similarity between our experimental setup with that of koide et al 2013 most striking in terms of the gap ratio g g d which is identical our numerical results exhibit a significantly different trend but only up to u 15 9 we observe in fig 10b that the vibration frequency of the cylinder increases linearly even past u 6 8 which is the upper branch of the kviv regime converting f into strouhal number reveals that the cylinder is vibrating close to the karman frequency of the system the karman frequency of a smooth fixed circular cylinder refers to the shedding frequency of karman vortices in its wake an empirical relationship with reynolds number exists for 250 re 2 10 5 which is the following blevins 1990 22 st 0 198 1 19 7 re the values we get using eq 22 are nearly constant about 0 19 for u 13 6 the slight discrepancy from our strouhal number mean 0 16 in the u 13 6 range can be ascribed to us studying a cruciform structure instead of the smooth circular cylinder upon which eq 22 was originally based blevins 1990 the discrepancies found especially in fig 10b most probably stem from the same reasons explained by nguyen et al 2012 the lowest y rms recorded in our simulation within 6 8 u 13 6 was in the order of 10 5 m 10 μm a numerical study has no problem recording vibration of this order as the precision of the numerical solution is only limited by the processor architecture experimental work however requires not only the sensitivity but also the isolation from the background noise that forces the cylinder to vibrate close to the natural frequency of the system f n nguyen et al 2012 which consequently overpowers this minimal amplitude vibration the values of f between 6 8 u 13 6 can therefore be considered as the limit of f in that range of u that is approached as the random background forcing present in experimental works tend to zero once streamwise vortices form however their shedding and cylinder vibration synchronises close to f n thus locking the normalised vibration frequency back to f 1 5 temporal evolution of the lift coefficient 5 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition and hilbert transform to obtain a clearer picture of the temporal characteristics of the lift and cylinder displacement signals we decided to employ the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method huang et al 1998 wu and huang 2008 on the signals and compute their instantaneous phase lag frequency and amplitude using the hilbert transform the hilbert transform ht has been used in the past to study the instantaneous phase and frequencies of kviv khalak and williamson 1999 however the signal must be monochromatic if we are to obtain a physically meaningful result after applying ht eemd is a way to pre process the signal and get components that 1 have zero mean and 2 have an equal number of extrema and zero crossings or they differ only by one functions that fulfil these criteria are called intrinsic mode functions imf and they guarantee a physically meaningful result to ht gumelar et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 unlike fourier transform which is an analytical method of signal decomposition based on circular functions in the complex plane eemd is algorithmic and the processes undertaken can be summarised as follows produce 150 white noise signals of length equal to the original signal and amplitude equal to 0 2 of the standard deviation of the original signal then add to the set of white noises the original signal creating 150 variations of the original signal following that we apply the empirical mode decomposition emd algorithm on each of the 150 signals the emd algorithm is summarised below 1 construct the envelope of the signal by connecting all maxima minima with cubic splines 2 find the local mean of the envelope for the span of the data 3 find the difference between the local mean and the original data 4 repeat steps 5 1 and 5 1 on the difference in 5 1 for ten times wu and huang 2008 the steps above produce a set of intrinsic mode functions or imfs for each of the 150 variations of the original signal then we average the first imf component from each of the decomposed original signal variations to obtain the first eemd imf c 1 of the original signal we do the same for the second third until the i th component for each of the 150 original signal variations thus obtaining c 2 c 3 c i to compute the phase lag between the characteristic imfs of the lift coefficient and normalised cylinder displacement we select the imf components with the highest correlation to the y signal at that particular u to represent the signals denoted as c y y for the characteristic normalised cylinder displacement and c cl y as the characteristic lift coefficient signal the phase lag instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude of the signal is subsequently computed by constructing an analytical signal z t from c 1 c 2 c i by computing the hilbert transform of the imf h i 23 h i t 1 π pv c i τ t τ d τ where pv denotes the cauchy principal value and then constructing the analytical signal as follows 24 z t c i t i h i t note that i in eq 24 is the complex number we refer the reader interested in the details of eemd and hilbert transform also collectively known as the hilbert huang transform hht to the following excellent texts on the subject huang and attoh okine 2005 huang 2014 5 2 the kviv regime u 13 6 at reduced velocities u 2 3 and 4 5 the phase lags φ deg between cl and u are practically zero throughout the whole observation time the characteristic imfs of cl and y at u 4 5 exemplifies this trend as showcased in fig 12 here fig 12a shows the temporal evolution of c y y and c cl y which are the characteristic imfs of y and cl respectively fig 12b shows the phase lag between c y y and c cl y and fig 12c presents the hht spectrogram of cl the hht spectrogram visualises the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the imf components of cl the trend that one notices in fig 12b is similar to what was observed in khalak and williamson 1999 a study that also employs the hilbert transform to obtain the instantaneous phase albeit without eemd the dominant imf component imf component sustaining the highest amplitude throughout the whole observation time of the lift coefficient has a normalised frequency f cl f cl f n fig 12c centred at approximately f cl 0 75 once we enter the upper branch of kviv at u 6 8 φ jumps to approximately 110 deg this jump in φ is characteristic of the transition to the upper branches as also observed by maruai et al 2018 among others both c cl y and c y y signals are visibly very periodic and the dominant frequency band of cl is centred at 1 as one can verify in fig 13 c as we increase u even further up to u 13 6 we see a similar trend for all u 9 1 11 4 13 6 examined c y y and c cl y are both qualitatively very periodic their phase lags are very close to 180 deg and the dominant cl frequency bands exhibit a time averaged value that increases linearly with respect to u in a manner that the strouhal number of cl is always 0 16 on average we present the representative case of u 13 6 in fig 14 note how φ in this range of u varies much less with respect to time compared to φ at u 6 8 and the dominant frequency band of cl is much narrower compared to the dominant frequency band at u 6 8 indicating a highly periodic and self similar oscillation of lift 5 3 transition to sviv 15 9 u 18 2 previously in the u 13 6 range we observed that the temporal profile of both cl and y are very similar to each other except that cl leads y by a certain amount this similarity in profile supports the assertion that the vibration within u 13 6 is driven exclusively by the shedding of karman vortices which brings the onset of the alternating lift analogously one might expect a similar profile between cl and y when streamwise vortices drive the vibration however this does not seem to be the case once we reach u 15 9 we observe that it has become difficult to argue that the profile of y is just a lagged version of the profile of cl this is shown in fig 15 a with the enlarged version in fig 15b the profile of cl looks like the result of several signals in superposition which one can almost distinguish from the presence of two types of maxima at two different amplitude heights we put a red dashed line and a red dashed dot line in fig 15b as visual cues indicating the two amplitude heights decomposing the lift coefficient signal using eemd reveals partial evidence supporting the compound signal hypothesis once we have decomposed the signal using eemd we replot fig 15a using c cl y and c y y in fig 16 a one can clearly see that the part of cl signal responsible for driving the vibration at u 15 9 is embedded in the original cl signal fig 16a and decomposition via eemd managed to recover this signal which leads c y y by approximately 150 deg on average throughout the whole observation time fig 16b this decline from φ 180 deg at reduced velocities 9 1 u 13 6 to φ 150 deg at u 15 9 is quite sizeable suggesting a fundamental change in flow dynamics particularly in terms of vortical structure another notable change is the increased temporal variation in φ from its time averaged value in contrast to the evolution of φ in the range 9 1 u 13 6 which has very little jitter throughout the observation time inspecting the hht spectrogram in fig 16c reveals two dominant bands in the frequency domain the first one marked with a white continuous rectangular box is the instantaneous frequency for the imf component of lift shown in fig 16a and its mean frequency lies close to the natural frequency of the system f cl 1 there is however a second band of the frequency with nearly similar amplitude around f cl 3 3 marked with a white dashed rectangular box computing the strouhal number from this frequency returns a value of st 0 20 which is very close to the strouhal number for karman vortices as predicted by eq 22 at the reynolds number equivalent to u 15 9 which is re 7 9 10 3 we thus attribute this second band of frequency as being the footprint left by the shedding of karman vortices and the first band as the result of streamwise vortex shedding through visual inspection of fig 16c both of these dominant frequency bands are markedly wider and the individual values are more scattered from their time averaged values than any of their counterparts within u 13 6 the knowledge that karman vortices continue to exist and shed from a cruciform structure during sviv is not new in the literature however this is the first time the lift signal from a cruciform structure undergoing sviv has been subjected to eemd revealing the signature of the two dominant vortical structures regulating the flow around the cruciform although the amplitude size of the instantaneous frequency band due to karman vortex is comparable to the streamwise vortex the reason why the cylinder resists locking into its frequency is perhaps that its frequency too distant from the natural frequency of the system f n the shedding frequency of the streamwise vortex is much closer to f n and is thus preferred by the cylinder we consider the transition to sviv to be complete at u 18 2 when the time averaged phase lag drops further to 20 deg fig 17 a and b documents this observation the instantaneous phase lag is observed to slip through 360 deg a little past the 2 s 2s time stamp by inspecting fig 17a we found that a little past 2s is when distortions in the periodicity of c cl y occur the slipping through 360 deg was also observed by khalak and williamson 1999 in their work on kviv highlighting the quasi periodic nature of the signal being analysed there the slip appeared in khalak and williamson 1999 at the initial branch of kviv the overall low value of φ 20 deg for the whole observation time at u 18 2 coupled with the presence of φ slippage are suggestive of the possibility for u 18 2 being the initial branch of sviv 5 4 the stable sviv regime u 20 5 as u is increased to 20 5 we can see a jump in φ from a mean value of approximately 20 deg to about 120 deg shown in fig 18 a the phase slippage discussed previously is also observed indicating the quasi periodic nature of the lift coefficient signal at this u incidentally this quasi periodicity seems to be the norm for the lift signals up to u 27 3 as suggested by the phase slippages evident in fig 18b c and d the slippage only stops once u reaches 29 5 suggesting a more periodic behaviour of the lift coefficient compared to its counterparts between 20 5 u 27 3 although the instantaneous phase between 20 5 u 27 3 implies a quasi periodic nature their time averaged values at each u are contained in the narrow region 114 φ deg 135 as is the value for φ at u 29 5 this observation that the time averaged value of φ to only slowly vary with respect to u once u increases past 20 5 can be interpreted as the dominant flow structures settling into a stable form that becomes more resilient against external excitations based on this feature we classified 20 5 u 29 5 as the upper branch of sviv the data on the evolution of φ allows us to construct a map of the branches of vibration modes observed in the range of u that we studied as the branches are mapped against u we need a representative value of φ at each u to achieve this we took the time averaged values of φ i e φ mean and plotted them against u in fig 19 the region a indicates the initial branch of kviv where φ mean is close to zero region b denotes the upper lower branch of kviv where the system experiences a jump from φ mean 0 to greater than 110 deg the value of φ mean settles very close to 180 deg towards the end of this upper lower branch then φ mean experiences a slight drop from about one sixth the value of φ mean in region b as we enter region c marking the start of the transition to the sviv regime following this the system undergoes a more sudden drop to φ mean 20 deg at u 18 2 this we designate as region d finally in region e we observe another jump in φ mean from φ mean 20 deg in region d to approximately 120 deg when u 20 5 6 estimation of harnessable power 6 1 mathematical model for power estimation the mathematical model for harnessable power estimation in this study follows that which had been derived in raghavan et al 2007 in these works the authors mentioned that work done by the oscillating cylinder w cyl during one cycle of oscillation t osc is as follows 25 w cyl 0 t osc f l y d t where both the lift f l and cylinder velocity y are both functions of time through several manipulations and simplifying assumptions sun et al 2016 the power captured by the system can be written using our parameters as the fluid power 26 p fluid rms 1 2 ρ π c cl rms u 2 f cyl y rms d l sin φ or the mechanical power 27 p mech rms 8 π 3 m eff ζ t o t y rms f cyl 2 f n here p fluid rms p mech rms l c cl rms ζ t o t and m eff are the root mean square of fluid power root mean square of mechanical power length of the circular cylinder characteristic root mean square of lift amplitude total damping coefficient and the system effective mass respectively we use c cl y to represent c cl rms in eq 26 we choose to use root mean square parameters with subscript rms quantities in eq 25 instead of the maximum values like the original authors because that may lead to a misunderstanding that the maximum value is sustained throughout the observation window this obviously is not always the case in our study especially once the system transits into the sviv regime recall that the time series analysis of y t and cl t in 4 1 revealed that there is a degree of intermittency in both signals that cannot be overlooked at certain ranges of u using the root mean square value allows us to partially take this into account in the estimation of harnessable power fig 20 shows the comparison between power estimated from our experiment and numerical results with the experimental results of nguyen et al 2012 and the direct power measurement of koide et al 2013 only the value for p mech rms is computed from our experimental results due to the absence of lift data our numerical results have both lift and cylinder displacement data and hence we calculated both p fluid rms and p mech rms we estimated the power from the experimental results of nguyen et al 2012 by interpolating missing data points in both their amplitude and frequency responses to compute the value of p mech rms at a given value of u the direct power measurement by koide et al 2013 was done by connecting the elastic support of the cylinder to a coil the coil moves with the cylinder thus creating a relative pistoning motion against a fixed magnet and produces an alternating current the estimated power in the kviv regime u 15 9 produces power only in the order of μ w which is relatively insignificant in contrast to the magnitude of power produced in the sviv regime mw in the region 18 2 u 22 7 p mech rms for our experiment and numerical work exhibits a similar trend where we observed a sudden jump in power output followed by a gradual decrease this gradual decrease can be attributed to the increased turbulence level right after the onset of sviv that imposes a degree of intermittency to the normalised cylinder displacement signal y for p fluid rms however the quantity exhibits a monotonic increase in the range 18 2 u 22 7 we only observe a dip in p fluid rms at u 25 0 suggesting an increase in intermittency of c cl y at this u in the experimental work of nguyen et al 2012 p mech rms only experiences a monotonic increase in the region 18 2 u 22 7 this decidedly different response of the system compared to ours most likely stem from the difference in the actual cruciform used by nguyen et al 2012 they used two circular cylinders of diameter 10 mm as their cruciform whereas we used a circular cylinder strip plate in both our experiments and numerical work there are no data from the direct power measurement of koide et al 2013 to compare with within 18 2 u 22 7 in the range 25 0 u 29 5 we find a reasonably good agreement between the trend found in all data compared they increase monotonically with respect to u although the value of our p fluid rms falls quite notably below the value of p mech rms at u 25 0 other values of p fluid rms p mech rms from our numerical results and the direct power measurements by koide et al 2013 agree well within 27 3 u 29 5 the only set of power data that consistently falls quite a distance below the others is the p mech rms estimated from the experimental data of nguyen et al 2012 which again is most probably due to the difference in the actual geometry of the cruciform used in their investigation 6 2 possibility for increasing fluid power p fluid rms recall in fig 20 that although p fluid rms is computed according to eq 26 which uses c cl rms instead of the actual root mean square amplitude of lift cl rms the resulting power estimate does not result in a trend that is totally different from the trend found in the other datasets furthermore except for p mech rms estimated from the experimental data of nguyen et al 2012 the values of p fluid rms are in fairly good agreement with other data that it is compared against at high u u 27 3 and 29 5 we see this is an indication that the lift component selected for use in computation of p fluid rms is an arguably faithful representation of the force driving the motion of the cylinder this suggests that the motion of the cylinder once it enters the sviv regime is driven only by one component and not the totality of the lift force this component that has a time averaged frequency close to the natural frequency of the system f n is the streamwise component of lift another significant imf component of the lift force in the sviv regime is the component whose mean frequency is close to the karman frequency of vortex shedding as explained in 5 3 this karman component of lift has a similar amplitude size as the streamwise component of lift as evidenced in fig 21 and as such is also a dominant component of lift the karman components are marked with a dashed white box and the streamwise components are marked with a solid white box following the convention in figs 12 14 and 16 and 17 however the karman component fails to affect the cylinder vibration like the streamwise component most probably due to the large difference between the mean frequency of the karman component and the natural frequency of the system f n the streamwise component has a mean frequency close to f n and is hence able to synchronise with the vibration of the cylinder producing a sizeable amplitude response fig 22 shows the root mean square amplitude of the karman and streamwise components of lift in the sviv regime u 18 2 between 18 2 u 22 7 the magnitude of the karman and streamwise components are nearly equal however once we exceed u 22 7 fig 22 shows that the contribution to the root mean square amplitude of total lift by the karman component is on average twice the contribution of the streamwise component having such a significant contribution towards the root mean square amplitude of total lift implies that there is a significant portion of energy from the free stream being used to energise the karman vortex structure in the flow let us assume a hypothetical situation where we can transfer the contribution by the karman component to the streamwise component of lift in other words consider the situation where we can completely redirect the energy from the karman to the streamwise vortex then the value for c cl rms in eq 26 will increase close to a factor of 2 when 18 2 u 22 7 and close to a factor of 3 when 25 0 u 29 5 this increase in c cl rms will lead to the scaling of p fluid rms by the same factor keeping the other parameters in eq 26 constant this exercise demonstrates the room for improvement possible for p fluid rms in future developments of cruciform energy harvesters one possible method of improving p fluid rms is by implementing a modified version of the cruciform that is able to enforce the dominance of the vortical structure that is able to lock into f n which in fig 22 is the streamwise vortex against the vortical structures that do not i e the karman vortices we will outline such a method in our future work 7 conclusions in this study we numerically investigated the temporal evolution of the lift coefficient and cylinder displacement signals of an elastically supported cruciform system in the range 1 1 10 3 re 14 6 10 3 or 2 3 u 29 5 our circular cylinder diameter is 10 mm and the natural frequency of the system is 4 4 hz validation of key numerical results was made experimentally in a custom built open flow channel using a cruciform system whose parameters were tuned as close as possible to the quantities used in the numerical study decomposing the lift coefficient signal in the sviv regime 15 9 u 29 5 using eemd allows us to see that the complexity of the lift coefficient signal as being caused by the superpositioning of two dominant components of lift one due to the shedding of karman and the other due to the shedding of streamwise vortices the former has a frequency close to the vortex shedding frequency of karman vortex from a smooth isolated circular cylinder while the latter has a mean frequency close to f n application of the hilbert huang transform on the dominant component of cylinder displacement and the component of lift most correlated to it allows for the computation of the instantaneous phase lag between lift and cylinder displacement the time averaged phase lag revealed five branches of vibration among which is the initial branch of sviv at u 18 2 which has never been identified before in the literature we also computed the instantaneous frequency of the lift coefficient thus revealing the loss of periodicity and self similarity in the lift coefficient signal as the system enters the sviv regime estimation of power from our results show that the root mean square mechanical and fluid power computed from our experimental and numerical work agree to varying degrees depending on u with data from similar studies in the literature finally we estimated that the root mean square fluid power can potentially be increased close to a factor of 2 within 18 2 u 22 7 and close to a factor of 3 when 25 0 u 29 5 we base this estimation on the premise of redirecting the contribution to the root mean square amplitude of total lift from karman vortex shedding towards the streamwise component of lift alone credit authorship contribution statement ahmad adzlan conceptualization methodology

21014,wave impacts on vertical caissons may cause breakwaters failures this paper focuses on the analysis of the stability of breakwaters under violent wave impacts by using a triple coupled fluid porous solid model the fluid model is described by the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in which the nonlinear forchheimer equations for the porous medium are added to the inertia terms the solid model based on the dda method which is an implicit dem method has been used to analyze the movement and the stability of the caisson and armour units by taking into account the shapes of the armor units as well as the contact between blocks the developed model has been used for multiple purposes firstly to estimate the variation of the maximum height of the impacting wave with the breakwater slope a new formula has then been established for this purpose secondly to analyze the influence of the porosity and of the thickness of the porous layer on the turbulence kinetic energy tke distribution around the breakwater structure the results show that the higher the thickness the lower the tke intensity will be finally the model has been used to analyze the stability of shaped armour units placed behind the caisson keywords breakwater stability violent wave impacts fluid porous model cfd dem coupling 1 introduction breakwaters are used for the protection of harbors and beaches against wave action their failure may be caused by the motion of the caissons and the global instability of the rubble mound oumeraci 1994 takahashi et al 2001 for the motion of caissons the most common forms are sliding subsidence and overturning takahashi et al 2014 which may induce the movement of armour units to increase the failure of the breakwater elsewhere breakwater failures have been investigated by several empirical studies cuomo et al 2010 doan et al 2020 and by some numerical and experimental methods elchahal et al 2008 hofland et al 2010 for the computational techniques the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is the most common tool used to describe the wave impacts kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 discussed the impact of dam break induced shock waves on a vertical wall by a cfd rans vof solution the simulation results show that the impact of dam break flood waves on the vertical wall causes wave reflection against the wall and the occurrence of a negative wave the impacts of waves on the vertical wall were also investigated by liu et al 2019 using a two phase compressible cfd solver recently many researchers made a series of attempts to couple the fluid and solid models discrete element method dem is usually used to calculate the movement of armour units a wave structure interaction method was proposed by latham et al 2009 in this method the forces and the volume fraction from the cfd model are mapped onto the dem structure ren et al 2014 used a coupled sph dem method to investigate the stability of armour units in rubble mound breakwaters an interfacial force balance condition achieved the coupling between the fluid particle sph and the solid spheres dem due to the complexity of the breakwater structure the porous medium should also be considered traditionally darcy s law and forchheimer law were used to investigate linear and non linear structures for porous armour layer whitaker 1996 hsu et al 2002 proposed a mathematical model based on the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations that coupled the fluid and the porous medium to describe surface wave motions in the vicinity of a coastal structure in this model the forchheimer law was adds by the volume averaged process additionally this fluid and porous medium coupled model are also developed in openfoam higuera et al 2014 alcérreca huerta and oumeraci 2016 liang and jeng 2018 guler et al 2018 an extended forchheimer law which adds a mass term that accelerates a certain amount of water considered in this paper we present a triple coupled fluid porous solid model the fluid model is described by the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations in which the extended forchheimer law used to calculate the porous medium flow is added to the inertia terms hsu et al 2002 the solid model which is based on the discontinuous deformation analysis dda method a kind of dem method is used to compute the movement of the caisson and armour units shi 1992 this method enables to take into account the shapes of armour units as well as the contact between blocks the coupling between the fluid and the solid is carried out by a transmission strategy of the fluid mesh nodes pressure towards the solid polygon vertices while the coupling between the fluid and the porous medium consists of the equations of the porous model in the terms of the inertia of the fluid model the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 equations of motion for the fluid and for the solid are introduced the governing equations of the fluid porous coupled model and of the dda method are detailed a transmission strategy is also given to couple the fluid and solid model section 3 is devoted to the validation of fluid and solid models simulation results of the flow patterns around the breakwater and the stability of armour units are presented in section 4 section 5 concludes the paper 2 mathematical formulation of the problem a schematic illustration of the studied problem is shown in fig 1 in order to investigate the problem a numerical approach that couples the fluid porous model and the solid dda model is proposed wherein the fluid model is based on the volume averaged rans equations the solid model is based on the dda method and the porous model is described by the non linear forchheimer model the governing equations of the models are shown below 2 1 governing equations of fluid porous coupled model 2 1 1 rans equations for turbulent flow the fluid flow are been investigated by the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the mass and momentum conservation functions are ji et al 2014a 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 ρ u t ρ uu p g x ρ μ e f f u σ κ α where u is the

κ α α 2 1 2 extended forchheimer equations for porous medium darcy s law has been traditionally used for describing the transport properties of porous media however as the flow velocity increases darcy s law became inapplicable as the relationship between pressure and velocity becomes non linear a correction term see the second term in eq 3 based on a quadratic velocity was added by forchheimer whitaker 1996 to take this non linearity into account furthermore in the present study an added mass term c a higuera et al 2014 was considered to accelerate the same volume of water in a porous medium additional momentum is required mèndez et al 2001 the extended forchheimer equation can be written as 3 p p o r o u s a u b u u ρ n c a u t where p p o r o u s is the porous medium pressure and the coefficients a and b are van gent 1996 higuera et al 2014 4 a μ 1 1 n 3 n 2 μ d 50 2 5 b μ 2 1 7 5 k c 1 n n 2 ρ d 50 where d 50 is the mean diameter of the porous material μ 1 and μ

period of the oscillation van gent 1996 2 1 3 volume averaged rans equation for incompressible fluid porous medium coupling in what follow we consider an incompressible flow thus in order to correspond the extended forchheimer eq 3 with the rans equations we introduce the volume averaged velocity u that exists in the interstices of the solid framework of the porous medium given by 6 u 1 v v f u d v where u is the hydrodynamic velocity with respect to the fluid v is the total volume and v f is the part of v which is occupied by the fluid in what follows we set the porosity n v f v then by substituting volume averaged velocity eq 6 in the rans eqs 1 and 2 we obtain the following varans equations for incompressible fluid 7 u 0 8 1 c a ρ n t u ρ n 2 u u p g x ρ 1 n μ e f f u σ κ α a u

with a two phase model fluid air and the free surface that separates these two phases can cut a cell of the computational mesh into two unequal parts each part contains a quantity of each phase in what follows the volume of fluid vof method is used to describe the volume fraction of the fluid inside each computational cell which will be transmitted to varans it is based on the following transport equation guler et al 2018 9 α t 1 n α u 1 n α 1 α u c 0 where α is the fluid phase fraction laying between 0 and 1 where α 0 corresponds to full of air and α 1 corresponds to full of fluid however in order to obtain physical results there must be some limitations a clear interface must be maintained and α must be limited between 0 and 1 weller 2002 added an artificial compression term α 1 α this method only uses non zero values at the interface in addition u c m i n c α u m a x u where the factor c α can be specified if u c is normal to the interface the fluid will not be compressed which points to a larger value of α and therefore from the air to the water phase the boundedness of this equation is achieved by the specially designed solver mules multi dimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in the present study the varans models are solved by using the pimple algorithm pressure implicit with the splitting of operators to compute the pressure and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm to obtain the velocity fields its main structure is inherited from the original piso but allows equations to be relaxed to ensure the convergence of all equations at each time step higuera et al 2014 cai et al 2017 2 2 governing equations of the solid model in order to investigate the movement and the stability of the caisson and armour units the discontinuous deformation analysis dda method is used in this method the displacement at any point x y of a block i can be described by its first order approximation shi 1992 10 χ i u i v i t i d i where t i 1 0 y y 0 x x 0 0 y y 0 2 0 1 x x 0 0 y y 0 x x 0 2 is the transformation matrix and d i u 0 v 0 γ 0 ε x x ε y y ε x y t is the displacement matrix which is associated with six variables u 0 and v 0 are the translations of the block gravity center in x and y directions γ 0 is the rotation around x 0 y 0 and ε x x ε y y and ε x y are the normal and shear strains based on the relationship between the strain and the displacement for block i we have 11 ε x 0 0 y 1 2 y 1 2 x u v l χ where l is the differential operator matrix for a 2d problem here we assume that the deformation is elastic and linear therefore we get 12 ε i l t i d i b d i 13 σ i e ε i eb d i where e is the elastic matrix shi 1992 and b 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 the total potential energy π p of the block i which is the summation of all the potential energy sources which includes the elastic strain energy initial stress potential energy body force potential energy and inertial energy is given by 14 π p a i 1 2 ε i t σ i d a i a i ε i t σ 0 d a i a i χ i t f b d a i a i χ i t m t i d i d a i where f b is the body forces applied on a block i m is the block mass per unit area and σ 0 is the initial stress substituting eqs 10 12 and 13 into eq 14 the total potential energy of a system of n blocks is expressed as 15 π p i 1 n d i t m d i 1 2 d i t k d i d i t f where m a i m t i t t i d a i is the mass matrix k a i b t eb d a i is the stiffness matrix and f a i t i t f b b t σ 0 d a i is the external forces matrix by minimizing the potential energy we obtain 16 π p d i t 0 m d kd f then the displacement and the velocity in eq 16 can be approximated by the newmark β method 17 d n 1 d n δ t d n δ t 2 2 1 2 β 1 d n 2 β 1 d n 1 d n 1 d n δ t 1 β 2 d n β 2 d n 1 where d and d are the acceleration and velocity matrices respectively and β 1 1 2 and β 2 1 for the implicit scheme ding et al 2020 substituting eq 17 into eq 16 we obtain 18 k 2 m δ t 2 d n 1 f 2 m δ t d n and then the compact form is given by 19 k ˆ d f ˆ consequently we get the global matrix 20 k ˆ 11 k ˆ 12 k ˆ 13 k ˆ 1 n k ˆ 21 k ˆ 22 k ˆ 23 k ˆ 2 n k ˆ 31 k ˆ 32 k ˆ 33 k ˆ 3 n k ˆ n 1 k ˆ n 2 k ˆ n 3 k ˆ nn d 1 d 2 d 3 d n f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 f ˆ 3 f ˆ n where f ˆ i and d i are the sub matrices of force and displacement which are 6 1 sub matrices the k ˆ i j are 6 6 sub matrices sub matrices k ˆ i j i j are determined by the block material properties whereas k ˆ i j i j are related to the contacts between blocks it should be noted that when the contact between the blocks takes place the associated potential energy must be added to the global equilibrium equation eq 15 and then the associated contact sub matrices have to be added to the global matrix eq 20 in the present study the surface contact constraints of blocks are enforced by the penalty method taking the contact of two blocks i and j as an example where the penetration distance of point p 1 into edge p 2 p 3 of block j is δ using the penalty method is equivalent to placing a spring between the two blocks as shown in fig 2 the strain energy of the contact spring reads 21 π c 1 2 p δ 2 where p is the coefficient of penalty which can vary between 10e and 1000e where e denotes young s modulus shi 1992 the block kinematics of the dda method are obtained by the open close iteration which is adding or removing a stiff spring in each time step at the contact position where tension and interpenetration do not exist 2 3 coupling procedure of fluid solid interaction the coupling between the fluid and the solid models requires a transfer of data from one model to another in our case the fluid model uses meshes while the solid model is meshless see fig 3 a since it is based on the dda method therefore an adequate data transfer strategy is required in order to faithfully reproduce the studied physical phenomena kaidi et al 2012 it consists in converting the nodal pressure forces of the fluid f i f j into equivalent forces f i at the vertex points of the solid see fig 3 b c and eq 23 it is specified that in this fluid solid coupling the transfer is retroactive where the fluid transfers to the solid the pressure force a force considered external to the solid where p i and p j are the fluid pressures at nodes i and j and d is the distance of the finite element edge from node i to node j finally the global forces f 1 f 2 acting on the dda block can be written as see kaidi et al 2012 23 f 1 x i 1 n f i n x d 2 d 1 d 2 f 1 y i 1 n f i n z d 2 d 1 d 2 f 2 x i 1 n f i n x d 1 d 1 d 2 f 2 y i 1 n f i n z d 1 d 1 d 2 where n is the total number of nodes in the edge d 1 and d 2 are the distances from the given node to vertices 1 and 2 and n x and n y represent the directions along x and y respectively a flowchart of procedures and connections between the coupled fluid porous solid models including boundaries inputs and outputs of each model has been created as previously described and is shown in fig 4 3 numerical model and validation the numerical simulations were performed to analyze the flow evolution and to characterize the forces on the breakwater subjected to violent wave impacts the breakwater is composed of a vertical caisson with shoreward armour units and a porous seaward armour layer see fig 5 the hydrodynamic impact is generated by the solitary wave with a wave height h w 6 m and a water depth d w 10 m the caisson position x h c 15 96 where h c 13 m is the height of the caisson fang et al 2015 martin medina et al 2018 it is worth noting that the armour layer protects the structure from the attacks of incident waves by dissipating their energy these armour layers are often built of large armour units and can be considered as a porous medium indeed many recent scientific studies have considered the porosity parameter to represent different types of armour units in the cfd simulations van gent 1996 proposed a value laying between 0 25 and 0 4 for cube shaped units and suggested a porosity value of 0 49 for tetrapod shaped units an armour layer thickness of 2 m and a porosity value of 0 49 are used in the following simulations the location of the gauges is also identified in fig 5 numbered from 1 to 5 to monitor the surface and the velocity of waves 3 1 boundary conditions in the input computational domain the free surface elevation η is given by 24 η h w s e c h 2 3 h w 4 d w 3 x ψ where x x c t h w is the wave height d w is the water depth ψ is the wave phase shift and the wave celerity c is g h w d w the horizontal and vertical velocity components

horizontal and the vertical space variables here we assume that the boundary is at x 0 and the free surface will start from the highest point of the solitary wave at the top boundary we assume p p a t m o s p h e r i c at the bottom boundary we set a slip condition where the roughness can be assumed to be negligible 3 2 mesh and time step convergence the validation of the fluid model is carried out by comparing the calculated horizontal velocity and water height with the theoretical free surface elevation η at transect p1 see fig 5 deduced from eq 24 three types of meshes are used for mesh convergence validation which contain 24510 48000 and 94080 tetrahedral mesh elements respectively a refinement ratio 2 is used for the mesh validation ji et al 2014b the grid spacing of the coarser meshes δ x c δ y c to grid spacing of the finer meshes δ x f δ y f is given as 27 r g δ x c δ x f δ y c δ y f 2 fig 6 1 shows that the fine and medium meshes have similar results and give better than coarse mesh considering both the accuracy and the simulation time the medium mesh is used for the following studies three time steps are designed fig 6 2 shows that the results of the three time step cases are all reasonable the accuracy of the case δ t 0 1 s is clearly enough therefore we use time steps of 0 1 s in this work the refinement of the space or time steps can improve the quality of the results however this is not enough it is therefore necessary to use digital diagrams or models such as serre do carmo et al 2018 2019 or extended boussinesq like models ouahsine et al 2013 in the future study which have good dispersive capacities for accurate prediction of wave activity 3 3 solid model validation the validation of the solid model is carried out by comparing the dda numerical results with both the experimental and the numerical results given by komodromos et al 2008 thus the behavior of seven 48 m m 48 m m 29 m m blocks with a mass of 135 5 g under harmonic excitations at the base is simulated by dda wherein we assume that the contact stiffness is 10 7 n m and friction angle φ is 34 o and the peak ground accelerations is 2 15 m s 2 for four different frequencies the computed results are compared with the experimental observations the dda simulations show similar responses to experimental observations as shown in fig 7 furthermore compared to the dem results the dda results have higher accuracy for four different frequencies the acceleration a i n i t i a t e to initiate the rocking or sliding is calculated by the dda model the results from the experimental have a great agreement with the numerical simulations as shown in fig 8 therefore the dda can be used to investigate the displacement of the vertical caisson and the discrete rear structures 4 simulation results 4 1 flow patterns around the breakwater the simulation of the flow patterns around the breakwater was done by considering the fluid porous coupling the wave evolution around the breakwater presented in fig 9 shows that as the wave approaches the vertical caisson grows considerably in amplitude until the breaking process occurs fig 9 b this then leads to an up moving jet due to the wave squeezing processes fig 9 c the distribution of the wave pressure in front of the vertical caisson is shown in fig 10 the normal pressure due to solitary waves is mainly located between 20 s and 25 s the results show that the fluid pressure is relatively high in the lower half of the caisson which can induce a risk of sliding of the structure or even give rise to a liftforce which could accentuate the overturning process since the maximum pressure is located at the caisson s toe see point a fig 10 at the vicinity of the breakwater the height of the waves expressed as h η d w increases considerably as they approach the breakwater until the breaking process occurs as shown in fig 11 the wave breaking process happens after the impact between the wave and the caisson ouahsine et al 2013 three main reasons cause this wave breaking process 1 non linear terms and secondary waves 2 reflection on the porous medium and the caisson 3 wave wave interactions 4 2 solution behavior with the breakwater seaward slopes the wave motion and the flow pattern on the breakwater seaward slope are simulated by the fluid porous model in which four slopes are considered the slopes are assumed to be 1 s where s is the ratio of the slope bottom length to the slope height which equals 1 2 3 and 4 the simulation results are shown in fig 12 we then define the maximum impacting wave height iwh m a x as the peak of the incoming wave height after it impacts the caisson as shown in fig 12 due to the squeezing process of the breakwater we observe that a larger s induces a bigger iwh m a x but less water is ejected hence the impacting wave height iwh m a x can be fitted through the following formula 28 i w h m a x α 1 α 2 e α 3 s where α 1 0 41 α 2 1 45 and α 3 0 5 fitting results are shown in fig 13 the seaward porous medium affects the wave the turbulent kinetic energy k for various thickness of the porous layer is shown in fig 14 the large porous layer has less turbulent kinetic energy due to a large dissipation several turbulences can be found on the upper side of the caisson on the shoreward side in the middle of caisson on the seaward side as well as at the top and bottom of the porous medium the flow in the porous medium initially coincides with the direction of the wave and then opposes it van der meer et al 2016 the porous medium significantly reduces the effects of the breaking waves 4 3 solution behavior with the shape of shoreward armour units in order to analyze the stability of the shoreward armour units and the influence of their shape three typically shaped armour kaidi et al 2012 see fig 15 are modeled and placed on the shoreward side of the breakwater the armour units are optimally arranged to ensure the initial position stability six units numbered from 1 to 6 are shown in fig 16 the breakwater is then subjected to a violent solitary wave impact whose input external force is calculated by eq 23 see the flow in figs 9 and 10 the material parameters used for the solid dda model are shown in table 1 fig 16 shows the initial and the final position of the three various shapes of armour units the displacement of the caisson hindered by armour units is almost zero and stable while varying degrees of sliding and rotating happen on the armour units the cubic units are more unstable than the other two in fact cubic unit no 2 experienced a significant fall we found that units no 2 and no 3 have larger vertical displacement while units no 3 and no 6 have large horizontal displacement therefore a falling process always happens on the rear side of the caisson and a sliding process happens on the toe of the breakwater structure as for the displacement the accropod and the tetrapod units followed the cubic units in that there is no significant drop however the rotation of the units can be seen because the two shaped units are under force the armour units move to rearrange and the structure becomes more stable with the tetrapod units the standard deviation sd of the displacement or the rotation of the armour units is used to describe the stability of the breakwater which is calculated by 29 s d σ i 1 n φ i φ 2 n where φ i denotes the displacement or rotation value of units i at the final position φ is the average displacement or rotation value and n 6 the standard deviations of the horizontal displacement the vertical displacement and the rotation are shown in fig 17 for the displacement of the armour units we have obtained s d c u b e s d a c c r o p o d s d t e t r a p o d for the rotation however the accropod units are greater than the cubic and tetrapod units furthermore the cubic units have larger displacements most of which are in the form of sliding along the slope based on the simulation results the tetrapod units are the most stable followed by the accropods and then by the cubic armour units the reason is that cubic armour units bring resistance to the breakwater through mass whereas tetrapod and accropod blocks bring resistance through mass and interlock forces among units 4 4 effect of cohesion in this simulation a cohesion c f 2 m p a and a tensile strength σ t 0 7 m p a are imposed which may actually represent concrete placed on the surfaces and contact points kaidi et al 2012 these values are obtained by adopting the extended mohr coulomb failure criterion based on the tension cut off it consists in reducing the tensile strength of the material by imposing a value of σ t while ensuring the following condition σ t c c o t a n φ thus by fixing σ t 0 7 m p a we decrease the value of c to c f which corresponds to the movement of one block of the caisson c f is considered optimal fig 18 shows that the displacement of the armour units without cohesion is bigger than the units with cohesion all the units behind the caisson have been moved but the units no 2 and 5 have moved significantly therefore we have chosen to present only the movements of units no 2 and no 5 as shown in fig 19 for unit no 2 when cohesion forces work the steady state can be reached in about 22 0 s and the maximum displacement is 1 2 m which is far less than 1 90 m without cohesion for unit no 5 it reaches steady state at 22 0 s with cohesion and 24 0 s without cohesion in total the displacement of the two units was lower by 36 8 and 23 8 respectively as compared to when cohesion is absent therefore we conclude that cohesion enforces the stability of the breakwater 5 conclusions this paper presents a fluid porous solid triple coupled model to simulate the stability of a caisson type breakwater the fluid model is described by the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations in which the nonlinear forchheimer equations for the porous medium are implemented as the terms of inertia the solid model is based on the dda method to take the discrete behavior of armor units into account the coupling between the fluid and the solid is carried out by a transmission strategy of the fluid mesh nodes pressure towards the solid polygon vertices the results of the numerical simulation show that the porosity and the thickness of the porous layer have a significant influence on the distribution of the kinetic energy of turbulence tke around the structure of the breakwater the greater the thickness the lower the intensity of the tke indeed the porous layer located just in front of the caisson acts as a support structure that effectively dissipates and absorbs the turbulent kinetic energy of the impacting waves it reduces the growth of wave crests and the overtopping of the caisson and also allows slope adjustment just in front of the caisson to avoid possible progressive or severe raveling of the lower part of the structure the results of the numerical simulations also show that the maximum impacting wave height depends on the slope of the structure of the breakwater thus a new formula has been established for this purpose moreover the results also show that the shape of the armour units is a major factor to be taken into account in the study of the stability of the structure in particular they show that tetrapod shaped units are the most stable followed by acropod shaped units and then by cubic shaped units and that cohesion enforces the stability of the breakwater declaration of competing interest

21014,wave impacts on vertical caissons may cause breakwaters failures this paper focuses on the analysis of the stability of breakwaters under violent wave impacts by using a triple coupled fluid porous solid model the fluid model is described by the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in which the nonlinear forchheimer equations for the porous medium are added to the inertia terms the solid model based on the dda method which is an implicit dem method has been used to analyze the movement and the stability of the caisson and armour units by taking into account the shapes of the armor units as well as the contact between blocks the developed model has been used for multiple purposes firstly to estimate the variation of the maximum height of the impacting wave with the breakwater slope a new formula has then been established for this purpose secondly to analyze the influence of the porosity and of the thickness of the porous layer on the turbulence kinetic energy tke distribution around the breakwater structure the results show that the higher the thickness the lower the tke intensity will be finally the model has been used to analyze the stability of shaped armour units placed behind the caisson keywords breakwater stability violent wave impacts fluid porous model cfd dem coupling 1 introduction breakwaters are used for the protection of harbors and beaches against wave action their failure may be caused by the motion of the caissons and the global instability of the rubble mound oumeraci 1994 takahashi et al 2001 for the motion of caissons the most common forms are sliding subsidence and overturning takahashi et al 2014 which may induce the movement of armour units to increase the failure of the breakwater elsewhere breakwater failures have been investigated by several empirical studies cuomo et al 2010 doan et al 2020 and by some numerical and experimental methods elchahal et al 2008 hofland et al 2010 for the computational techniques the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is the most common tool used to describe the wave impacts kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 discussed the impact of dam break induced shock waves on a vertical wall by a cfd rans vof solution the simulation results show that the impact of dam break flood waves on the vertical wall causes wave reflection against the wall and the occurrence of a negative wave the impacts of waves on the vertical wall were also investigated by liu et al 2019 using a two phase compressible cfd solver recently many researchers made a series of attempts to couple the fluid and solid models discrete element method dem is usually used to calculate the movement of armour units a wave structure interaction method was proposed by latham et al 2009 in this method the forces and the volume fraction from the cfd model are mapped onto the dem structure ren et al 2014 used a coupled sph dem method to investigate the stability of armour units in rubble mound breakwaters an interfacial force balance condition achieved the coupling between the fluid particle sph and the solid spheres dem due to the complexity of the breakwater structure the porous medium should also be considered traditionally darcy s law and forchheimer law were used to investigate linear and non linear structures for porous armour layer whitaker 1996 hsu et al 2002 proposed a mathematical model based on the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations that coupled the fluid and the porous medium to describe surface wave motions in the vicinity of a coastal structure in this model the forchheimer law was adds by the volume averaged process additionally this fluid and porous medium coupled model are also developed in openfoam higuera et al 2014 alcérreca huerta and oumeraci 2016 liang and jeng 2018 guler et al 2018 an extended forchheimer law which adds a mass term that accelerates a certain amount of water considered in this paper we present a triple coupled fluid porous solid model the fluid model is described by the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations in which the extended forchheimer law used to calculate the porous medium flow is added to the inertia terms hsu et al 2002 the solid model which is based on the discontinuous deformation analysis dda method a kind of dem method is used to compute the movement of the caisson and armour units shi 1992 this method enables to take into account the shapes of armour units as well as the contact between blocks the coupling between the fluid and the solid is carried out by a transmission strategy of the fluid mesh nodes pressure towards the solid polygon vertices while the coupling between the fluid and the porous medium consists of the equations of the porous model in the terms of the inertia of the fluid model the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 equations of motion for the fluid and for the solid are introduced the governing equations of the fluid porous coupled model and of the dda method are detailed a transmission strategy is also given to couple the fluid and solid model section 3 is devoted to the validation of fluid and solid models simulation results of the flow patterns around the breakwater and the stability of armour units are presented in section 4 section 5 concludes the paper 2 mathematical formulation of the problem a schematic illustration of the studied problem is shown in fig 1 in order to investigate the problem a numerical approach that couples the fluid porous model and the solid dda model is proposed wherein the fluid model is based on the volume averaged rans equations the solid model is based on the dda method and the porous model is described by the non linear forchheimer model the governing equations of the models are shown below 2 1 governing equations of fluid porous coupled model 2 1 1 rans equations for turbulent flow the fluid flow are been investigated by the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the mass and momentum conservation functions are ji et al 2014a 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 ρ u t ρ uu p g x ρ μ e f f u σ κ α where u is the

κ α α 2 1 2 extended forchheimer equations for porous medium darcy s law has been traditionally used for describing the transport properties of porous media however as the flow velocity increases darcy s law became inapplicable as the relationship between pressure and velocity becomes non linear a correction term see the second term in eq 3 based on a quadratic velocity was added by forchheimer whitaker 1996 to take this non linearity into account furthermore in the present study an added mass term c a higuera et al 2014 was considered to accelerate the same volume of water in a porous medium additional momentum is required mèndez et al 2001 the extended forchheimer equation can be written as 3 p p o r o u s a u b u u ρ n c a u t where p p o r o u s is the porous medium

period of the oscillation van gent 1996 2 1 3 volume averaged rans equation for incompressible fluid porous medium coupling in what follow we consider an incompressible flow thus in order to correspond the extended forchheimer eq 3 with the rans equations we introduce the volume averaged velocity u that exists in the interstices of the solid framework of the porous medium given by 6 u 1 v v f u d v where u is the hydrodynamic velocity with respect to the fluid v is the total volume and v f is the part of v which is occupied by the fluid in what follows we set the porosity n v f v then by substituting volume averaged velocity eq 6 in the rans eqs 1 and 2 we obtain the following varans equations for incompressible fluid 7 u 0 8 1 c a ρ n t u ρ n 2 u u p g x ρ 1 n μ e f f u σ κ α a u

with a two phase model fluid air and the free surface that separates these two phases can cut a cell of the computational mesh into two unequal parts each part contains a quantity of each phase in what follows the volume of fluid vof method is used to describe the volume fraction of the fluid inside each computational cell which will be transmitted to varans it is based on the following transport equation guler et al 2018 9 α t 1 n α u 1 n α 1 α u c 0 where α is the fluid phase fraction laying between 0 and 1 where α 0 corresponds to full of air and α 1 corresponds to full of fluid however in order to obtain physical results there must be some limitations a clear interface must be maintained and α must be limited between 0 and 1 weller 2002 added an artificial compression term α 1 α this method only uses non zero values at the interface in addition u c m i n c α u m a x u where the factor c α can be specified if u c is normal to the interface the fluid will not be compressed which points to a larger value of α and therefore from the air to the water phase the boundedness of this equation is achieved by the specially designed solver mules multi dimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in the present study the varans models are solved by using the pimple algorithm pressure implicit with the splitting of operators to compute the pressure and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm to obtain the velocity fields its main structure is inherited from the original piso but allows equations to be relaxed to ensure the convergence of all equations at each time step higuera et al 2014 cai et al 2017 2 2 governing equations of the solid model in order to investigate the movement and the stability of the caisson and armour units the discontinuous deformation analysis dda method is used in this method the displacement at any point x y of a block i can be described by its first order approximation shi 1992 10 χ i u i v i t i d i where t i 1 0 y y 0 x x 0 0 y y 0 2 0 1 x x 0 0 y y 0 x x 0 2 is the transformation matrix and d i u 0 v 0 γ 0 ε x x ε y y ε x y t is the displacement matrix which is associated with six variables u 0 and v 0 are the translations of the block gravity center in x and y directions γ 0 is the rotation around x 0 y 0 and ε x x ε y y and ε x y are the normal and shear strains based on the relationship between the strain and the displacement for block i we have 11 ε x 0 0 y 1 2 y 1 2 x u v l χ where l is the differential operator matrix for a 2d problem here we assume that the deformation is elastic and linear therefore we get 12 ε i l t i d i b d i 13 σ i e ε i eb d i where e is the elastic matrix shi 1992 and b 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 the total potential energy π p of the block i which is the summation of all the potential energy sources which includes the elastic strain energy initial stress potential energy body force potential energy and inertial energy is given by 14 π p a i 1 2 ε i t σ i d a i a i ε i t σ 0 d a i a i χ i t f b d a i a i χ i t m t i d i d a i where f b is the body forces applied on a block i m is the block mass per unit area and σ 0 is the initial stress substituting eqs 10 12 and 13 into eq 14 the total potential energy of a system of n blocks is expressed as 15 π p i 1 n d i t m d i 1 2 d i t k d i d i t f where m a i m t i t t i d a i is the mass matrix k a i b t eb d a i is the stiffness matrix and f a i t i t f b b t σ 0 d a i is the external forces matrix by minimizing the potential energy we obtain 16 π p d i t 0 m d kd f then the displacement and the velocity in eq 16 can be approximated by the newmark β method 17 d n 1 d n δ t d n δ t 2 2 1 2 β 1 d n 2 β 1 d n 1 d n 1 d n δ t 1 β 2 d n β 2 d n 1 where d and d are the acceleration and velocity matrices respectively and β 1 1 2 and β 2 1 for the implicit scheme ding et al 2020 substituting eq 17 into eq 16 we obtain 18 k 2 m δ t 2 d n 1 f 2 m δ t d n and then the compact form is given by 19 k ˆ d f ˆ consequently we get the global matrix 20 k ˆ 11 k ˆ 12 k ˆ 13 k ˆ 1 n k ˆ 21 k ˆ 22 k ˆ 23 k ˆ 2 n k ˆ 31 k ˆ 32 k ˆ 33 k ˆ 3 n k ˆ n 1 k ˆ n 2 k ˆ n 3 k ˆ nn d 1 d 2 d 3 d n f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 f ˆ 3 f ˆ n where f ˆ i and d i are the sub matrices of force and displacement which are 6 1 sub matrices the k ˆ i j are 6 6 sub matrices sub matrices k ˆ i j i j are determined by the block material properties whereas k ˆ i j i j are related to the contacts between blocks it should be noted that when the contact between the blocks takes place the associated potential energy must be added to the global equilibrium equation eq 15 and then the associated contact sub matrices have to be added to the global matrix eq 20 in the present study the surface contact constraints of blocks are enforced by the penalty method taking the contact of two blocks i and j as an example where the penetration distance of point p 1 into edge p 2 p 3 of block j is δ using the penalty method is equivalent to placing a spring between the two blocks as shown in fig 2 the strain energy of the contact spring reads 21 π c 1 2 p δ 2 where p is the coefficient of penalty which can vary between 10e and 1000e where e denotes young s modulus shi 1992 the block kinematics of the dda method are obtained by the open close iteration which is adding or removing a stiff spring in each time step at the contact position where tension and interpenetration do not exist 2 3 coupling procedure of fluid solid interaction the coupling between the fluid and the solid models requires a transfer of data from one model to another in our case the fluid model uses meshes while the solid model is meshless see fig 3 a since it is based on the dda method therefore an adequate data transfer strategy is required in order to faithfully reproduce the studied physical phenomena kaidi et al 2012 it consists in converting the nodal pressure forces of the fluid f i f j into equivalent forces f i at the vertex points of the solid see fig 3 b c and eq 23 it is specified that in this fluid solid coupling the transfer is retroactive where the fluid transfers to the solid the pressure force a force considered external to the solid where p i and p j are the fluid pressures at nodes i and j and d is the distance of the finite element edge from node i to node j finally the global forces f 1 f 2 acting on the dda block can be written as see kaidi et al 2012 23 f 1 x i 1 n f i n x d 2 d 1 d 2 f 1 y i 1 n f i n z d 2 d 1 d 2 f 2 x i 1 n f i n x d 1 d 1 d 2 f 2 y i 1 n f i n z d 1 d 1 d 2 where n is the total number of nodes in the edge d 1 and d 2 are the distances from the given node to vertices 1 and 2 and n x and n y represent the directions along x and y respectively a flowchart of procedures and connections between the coupled fluid porous solid models including boundaries inputs and outputs of each model has been created as previously described and is shown in fig 4 3 numerical model and validation the numerical simulations were performed to analyze the flow evolution and to characterize the forces on the breakwater subjected to violent wave impacts the breakwater is composed of a vertical caisson with shoreward armour units and a porous seaward armour layer see fig 5 the hydrodynamic impact is generated by the solitary wave with a wave height h w 6 m and a water depth d w 10 m the caisson position x h c 15 96 where h c 13 m is the height of the caisson fang et al 2015 martin medina et al 2018 it is worth noting that the armour layer protects the structure from the attacks of incident waves by dissipating their energy these armour layers are often built of large armour units and can be considered as a porous medium indeed many recent scientific studies have considered the porosity parameter to represent different types of armour units in the cfd simulations van gent 1996 proposed a value laying between 0 25 and 0 4 for cube shaped units and suggested a porosity value of 0 49 for tetrapod shaped units an armour layer thickness of 2 m and a porosity value of 0 49 are used in the following simulations the location of the gauges is also identified in fig 5 numbered from 1 to 5 to monitor the surface and the velocity of waves 3 1 boundary conditions in the input computational domain the free surface elevation η is given by 24 η h w s e c h 2 3 h w 4 d w 3 x ψ where x x c t h w is the wave height d w is the water depth ψ is the wave phase shift and the wave celerity c is g h w d w the horizontal and vertical velocity components u h and u v verify lee et al 1982 25 u h η g d w d w 1 η 4 d w d w 2 3 η 1 3 y 2 2 d w 2 d 2 η d x 2 and 26 u v y g d w d w 1 η 2 d w d η d x 1 3 d w 2 1 y 2 2 d w 2 d 3 η d x 3 where x and y are the horizontal and the vertical space variables here we assume that the boundary is at x 0 and the free surface will start from the highest point of the solitary wave at the top boundary we assume p p a t m o s p h e r i c at the bottom boundary we set a slip condition where the roughness can be assumed to be negligible 3 2 mesh and time step convergence the validation of the fluid model is carried out by comparing the calculated horizontal velocity and water height with the theoretical free surface elevation η at transect p1 see fig 5 deduced from eq 24 three types of meshes are used for mesh convergence validation which contain 24510 48000 and 94080 tetrahedral mesh elements respectively a refinement ratio 2 is used for the mesh validation ji et al 2014b the grid spacing of the coarser meshes δ x c δ y c to grid spacing of the finer meshes δ x f δ y f is given as 27 r g δ x c δ x f δ y c δ y f 2 fig 6 1 shows that the fine and medium meshes have similar results and give better than coarse mesh considering both the accuracy and the simulation time the medium mesh is used for the following studies three time steps are designed fig 6 2 shows that the results of the three time step cases are all reasonable the accuracy of the case δ t 0 1 s is clearly enough therefore we use time steps of 0 1 s in this work the refinement of the space or time steps can improve the quality of the results however this is not enough it is therefore necessary to use digital diagrams or models such as serre do carmo et al 2018 2019 or extended boussinesq like models ouahsine et al 2013 in the future study which have good dispersive capacities for accurate prediction of wave activity 3 3 solid model validation the validation of the solid model is carried out by comparing the dda numerical results with both the experimental and the numerical results given by komodromos et al 2008 thus the behavior of seven 48 m m 48 m m 29 m m blocks with a mass of 135 5 g under harmonic excitations at the base is simulated by dda wherein we assume that the contact stiffness is 10 7 n m and friction angle φ is 34 o and the peak ground accelerations is 2 15 m s 2 for four different frequencies the computed results are compared with the experimental observations the dda simulations show similar responses to experimental observations as shown in fig 7 furthermore compared to the dem results the dda results have higher accuracy for four different frequencies the acceleration a i n i t i a t e to initiate the rocking or sliding is calculated by the dda model the results from the experimental have a great agreement with the numerical simulations as shown in fig 8 therefore the dda can be used to investigate the displacement of the vertical caisson and the discrete rear structures 4 simulation results 4 1 flow patterns around the breakwater the simulation of the flow patterns around the breakwater was done by considering the fluid porous coupling the wave evolution around the breakwater presented in fig 9 shows that as the wave approaches the vertical caisson grows considerably in amplitude until the breaking process occurs fig 9 b this then leads to an up moving jet due to the wave squeezing processes fig 9 c the distribution of the wave pressure in front of the vertical caisson is shown in fig 10 the normal pressure due to solitary waves is mainly located between 20 s and 25 s the results show that the fluid pressure is relatively high in the lower half of the caisson which can induce a risk of sliding of the structure or even give rise to a liftforce which could accentuate the overturning process since the maximum pressure is located at the caisson s toe see point a fig 10 at the vicinity of the breakwater the height of the waves expressed as h η d w increases considerably as they approach the breakwater until the breaking process occurs as shown in fig 11 the wave breaking process happens after the impact between the wave and the caisson ouahsine et al 2013 three main reasons cause this wave breaking process 1 non linear terms and secondary waves 2 reflection on the porous medium and the caisson 3 wave wave interactions 4 2 solution behavior with the breakwater seaward slopes the wave motion and the flow pattern on the breakwater seaward slope are simulated by the fluid porous model in which four slopes are considered the slopes are assumed to be 1 s where s is the ratio of the slope bottom length to the slope height which equals 1 2 3 and 4 the simulation results are shown in fig 12 we then define the maximum impacting wave height iwh m a x as the peak of the incoming wave height after it impacts the caisson as shown in fig 12 due to the squeezing process of the breakwater we observe that a larger s induces a bigger iwh m a x but less water is ejected hence the impacting wave height iwh m a x can be fitted through the following formula 28 i w h m a x α 1 α 2 e α 3 s where α 1 0 41 α 2 1 45 and α 3 0 5 fitting results are shown in fig 13 the seaward porous medium affects the wave the turbulent kinetic energy k for various thickness of the porous layer is shown in fig 14 the large porous layer has less turbulent kinetic energy due to a large dissipation several turbulences can be found on the upper side of the caisson on the shoreward side in the middle of caisson on the seaward side as well as at the top and bottom of the porous medium the flow in the porous medium initially coincides with the direction of the wave and then opposes it van der meer et al 2016 the porous medium significantly reduces the effects of the breaking waves 4 3 solution behavior with the shape of shoreward armour units in order to analyze the stability of the shoreward armour units and the influence of their shape three typically shaped armour kaidi et al 2012 see fig 15 are modeled and placed on the shoreward side of the breakwater the armour units are optimally arranged to ensure the initial position stability six units numbered from 1 to 6 are shown in fig 16 the breakwater is then subjected to a violent solitary wave impact whose input external force is calculated by eq 23 see the flow in figs 9 and 10 the material parameters used for the solid dda model are shown in table 1 fig 16 shows the initial and the final position of the three various shapes of armour units the displacement of the caisson hindered by armour units is almost zero and stable while varying degrees of sliding and rotating happen on the armour units the cubic units are more unstable than the other two in fact cubic unit no 2 experienced a significant fall we found that units no 2 and no 3 have larger vertical displacement while units no 3 and no 6 have large horizontal displacement therefore a falling process always happens on the rear side of the caisson and a sliding process happens on the toe of the breakwater structure as for the displacement the accropod and the tetrapod units followed the cubic units in that there is no significant drop however the rotation of the units can be seen because the two shaped units are under force the armour units move to rearrange and the structure becomes more stable with the tetrapod units the standard deviation sd of the displacement or the rotation of the armour units is used to describe the stability of the breakwater which is calculated by 29 s d σ i 1 n φ i φ 2 n where φ i denotes the displacement or rotation value of units i at the final position φ is the average displacement or rotation value and n 6 the standard deviations of the horizontal displacement the vertical displacement and the rotation are shown in fig 17 for the displacement of the armour units we have obtained s d c u b e s d a c c r o p o d s d t e t r a p o d for the rotation however the accropod units are greater than the cubic and tetrapod units furthermore the cubic units have larger displacements most of which are in the form of sliding along the slope based on the simulation results the tetrapod units are the most stable followed by the accropods and then by the cubic armour units the reason is that cubic armour units bring resistance to the breakwater through mass whereas tetrapod and accropod blocks bring resistance through mass and interlock forces among units 4 4 effect of cohesion in this simulation a cohesion c f 2 m p a and a tensile strength σ t 0 7 m p a are imposed which may actually represent concrete placed on the surfaces and contact points kaidi et al 2012 these values are obtained by adopting the extended mohr coulomb failure criterion based on the tension cut off it consists in reducing the tensile strength of the material by imposing a value of σ t while ensuring the following condition σ t c c o t a n φ thus by fixing σ t 0 7 m p a we decrease the value of c to c f which corresponds to the movement of one block of the caisson c f is considered optimal fig 18 shows that the displacement of the armour units without cohesion is bigger than the units with cohesion all the units behind the caisson have been moved but the units no 2 and 5 have moved significantly therefore we have chosen to present only the movements of units no 2 and no 5 as shown in fig 19 for unit no 2 when cohesion forces work the steady state can be reached in about 22 0 s and the maximum displacement is 1 2 m which is far less than 1 90 m without cohesion for unit no 5 it reaches steady state at 22 0 s with cohesion and 24 0 s without cohesion in total the displacement of the two units was lower by 36 8 and 23 8 respectively as compared to when cohesion is absent therefore we conclude that cohesion enforces the stability of the breakwater 5 conclusions this paper presents a fluid porous solid triple coupled model to simulate the stability of a caisson type breakwater the fluid model is described by the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations in which the nonlinear forchheimer equations for the porous medium are implemented as the terms of inertia the solid model is based on the dda method to take the discrete behavior of armor units into account the coupling between the fluid and the solid is carried out by a transmission strategy of the fluid mesh nodes pressure towards the solid polygon vertices the results of the numerical simulation show that the porosity and the thickness of the porous layer have a significant influence on the distribution of the kinetic energy of turbulence tke around the structure of the breakwater the greater the thickness the lower the intensity of the tke indeed the porous layer located just in front of the caisson acts as a support structure that effectively dissipates and absorbs the turbulent kinetic energy of the impacting waves it reduces the growth of wave crests and the overtopping of the caisson and also allows slope adjustment just in front of the caisson to avoid possible progressive or severe raveling of the lower part of the structure the results of the numerical simulations also show that the maximum impacting wave height depends on the slope of the structure of the breakwater thus a new formula has been established for this purpose moreover the results also show that the shape of the armour units is a major factor to be taken into account in the study of the stability of the structure in particular they show that tetrapod shaped units are the most stable followed by acropod shaped units and then by cubic shaped units and that cohesion enforces the stability of the breakwater declaration of competing interest
