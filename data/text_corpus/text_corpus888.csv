4440,water markets are considered as effective mechanisms to support efficient use of limited water resources and to increase crop production in agricultural systems this study presents an agent based modeling abm framework to explore the performance of an agricultural water market under the joint influence of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors the abm employs a power law function to simulate water permit distribution among farmers for any given level of inequality measured by the gini coefficient farmers irrigation behavior i e sensitivity to soil dryness and bidding behaviors i e degree of rent seeking and learning rate coefficient are explicitly incorporated into the abm to represent farmers decision making in a water market based on double auction through a set of scenario analyses in a study area in texas we find that the water market performance to increase basin level crop production is constrained by a joint effect of especially the complex and non linear interplay between the inequality of water permit allocation farmers behaviors and hydrological conditions the potential market performance is higher when water permits are more unequally distributed the relative market performance is higher when the inequality of water allocation is at a moderate level the modeling results can advance our understanding of the key contributing factors in market transactions and provide policy implications to assess the comparative advantage between institutional development and farmers behavioral change for improving market performance this study also provides model implications for future research to draw more robust conclusions about market benefits in the real world keywords water permit allocation gini coefficient agent based model farmers behaviors agricultural water market 1 introduction many countries and regions are highly dependent on surface water and or groundwater for irrigation and food production with agriculture being the primary water consumer in many major river basins donohew 2009 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 plunkett et al 2010 however satisfying irrigation demand is becoming increasingly challenging due to increasing water demands from other sectors e g industry and municipality along with changes in water availability due to climate change ringler and zhu 2015 in response to rising water scarcity water markets have been advocated as effective tools to support efficient use of limited freshwater resources by enabling reallocation of water rights from low to high valued uses delorit and block 2018

in the world such as australia brennan 2006 gao et al 2013 grafton and horne 2014 qureshi et al 2009 the united states griffin and boadu 1992 howe and goemans 2003 yoskowitz 1999 chile hadjigeorgalis

before its actual implementation in a specific region easter et al 1998 for policymakers seeking to assess potential benefits of water markets performance evaluations have an important role to play in assessing expected market performance and in exploring ways to improve market efficiency many studies have attempted to understand the performance of water markets under the influence of some important factors these include but are not limited to 1 water legislation systems that define the ownership of property rights bauer 2015 2010 griffin 1998 griffin and boadu 1992 johnson et al 1981 wheeler et al 2017 2 engineering infrastructures for delivering water resources and monitoring water consumption brewer et al 2008 xu et al 2018 3 transaction cost and third party effects that could introduce barriers and externalities for water trading deng et al 2017 elbakidze et al 2018 erfani et al 2014 raffensperger 2011 womble and hanemann 2020 zhu et al 2019 and 4 market mechanisms and institutions that affect the ways in which water permits are traded breviglieri et al 2018 loch et al 2012 qureshi et al 2009 tisdell 2011 recently studies have also assessed the role played by social norms and farmers risk attitudes towards the uncertainty in future water supply and endowment in water markets aghaie et al 2020a delorit et al 2019 delorit and block 2020 2019 2018 water scarcity is considered as one of the primary driving forces that promote the market based approach for reallocating water permits bjornlund 2003 hadjigeorgalis 2008b some studies have specifically assessed water market performance under different climate and hydrological conditions e g khan brown 2019 luo et al 2007 however the degree of water scarcity is affected not only by total physical water availability but also by the institutional context that determines how water permits are allocated among water right holders in other words a fixed amount of total available water could result in varied degrees of water scarcity among the population e g water permits are equally allocated among the population versus most of the water permits are allocated to a small portion of population and as a result varied market performances therefore it is reasonable for us to hypothesize that the performance of a water market could be affected by the degree of inequality regarding how water permits are allocated among farmers it is essential to systematically assess the quantitative relationship between water market performance and the inequality of water allocation which is the key research question we aim to address in this study to assess water market performances previous studies have often employed the top down optimization based approach assuming perfect market efficiency erfani et al 2014 kuwayama and brozoviÄ‡ 2013 luo et al 2007 raffensperger and milke 2005 zeng et al 2015 however the conditions for perfectly efficient water markets e g sufficient information to search for trading partners effective bargaining processes to determine water price are rarely satisfied in the real world elbakidze et al 2018 matthews 2004 nguyen et al 2013 pulido velazquez et al 2008 in particular market transactions are affected by the collective behaviors of all the market participants who are embedded with heterogeneous characteristics motivations and interacting decision rules which further complicate market performance and cannot be well represented by the top down optimization based approach rand and rust 2011 vytelingum et al 2008 to address this issue some studies have applied the bottom up agent based modeling abm approach to simulating water markets aghaie et al 2020b heckbert et al 2010 iftekhar et al 2013 ng et al 2011 smajgl et al 2009 such an approach simulates markets as complex systems by treating market participants as autonomous adaptive and interacting decision makers by which the assumptions of perfectly efficient market conditions and fully rational well informed market actors in the optimization based approach can be relaxed heckbert et al 2010 therefore bottom up abms can provide unique insights into market performances under different institutional settings and agents behaviors farmer and foley 2009 in this study we aim to explore the joint impacts of the inequality of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors on market performance we develop an abm framework that incorporates 1 a water allocation module for modeling water permit allocation among farmers and 2 farmers irrigation and bidding behaviors in a water market based on a double auction we apply our modeling framework to the guadalupe river basin a small watershed with intensive agriculture in texas through a set of scenario analyses the modeling results demonstrate that water market performance can be jointly affected by the inequality of permit allocation farmers behaviors and hydrological conditions this study therefore identifies some new factors i e the interplay between water allocation and farmer behaviors that affect market performance which can advance our understanding of the contributing factors in market transactions and yield policy implications to improve market performance this study contributes to the literature in several aspects firstly this study incorporates the inequality of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors in a consistent modeling framework for water market analysis which advances our understanding of the key factors associated with market transactions secondly the water allocation module in this study adopts a novel power law method to realize different levels of inequality in water permit allocation which extends the previous studies that assess environmental and natural resource allocation with a fixed degree of inequality dai et al 2018 ge et al 2016 hu et al 2016 iftekhar and fogarty 2017 thirdly the scenario analyses of the interplay between water allocation farmer behaviors and hydrological conditions have identified some key contributing factors in market transactions which provide 1 modeling implications for future research efforts to simulate more realistic water markets under various conditions of water allocation and farmer behaviors and 2 policy implications for decision makers to improve market performance via promoting farmers behavioral change under a given water endowment the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodology including the water allocation module and the development of the abm section 3 gives an overview of the case study area and scenario design for model application section 4 presents the modeling results followed by discussions on modeling and policy implications in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 2 methodology in this section we first introduce the proposed water allocation module section 2 1 farmers behaviors section 2 2 and the mechanism of the water market section 2 3 sections 2 4 presents how the abm is developed to integrate the above components into a consistent modeling framework 2 1 water permit allocation module in agricultural systems with well defined and enforced property rights the amount of water permits constrains the total volume of water that can be withdrawn from surface water and or groundwater over a given time period garcia et al 2009 due to some socioeconomic and institutional reasons e g the purpose of water use the location specific water doctrine at the time of requesting water permits farmers are not always entitled to an equal share of water permits in agricultural systems considering the variation in the size of farmland between farmers we use per area water permits w to measure the inequality of farmers water permit allocation druckman and jackson 2008 the gini coefficient has been widely used by economists and social scientists as a simple and effective measurement of income and social inequality bosi and seegmuller 2006 druckman and jackson 2008 gastwirth 2017 lambert and aronson 1993 recently it has also been applied to measure the inequality of natural resource allocation hu et al 2016 iftekhar and fogarty 2017 liu et al 2019 sadras and bongiovanni 2004 teng et al 2011 yuan et al 2017 for example hu et al 2016 use the gini coefficient to measure environmental resource equity and build a multi objective programming model to examine the optimal allocation of regional water resources that specifically considers the equity efficiency tradeoff iftekhar fogarty 2017 develop an optimization model to assess the impacts of agricultural management policies on the groundwater system under unequal water allocation conditions in western australia following these studies here we adopt the gini coefficient denoted by g to measure the inequality of water permit allocation within a given basin or management unit the gini coefficient ranges from zero i e representing perfectly equal distribution in which every member in the population gets an equal portion of a resource to one i e representing completely unequal distribution in which one member gets all of a resource and the others get none the gini coefficient can be calculated based on the lorenz curve which plots the percentage of total resources shared by the bottom ratio of the population sadras and bongiovanni 2004 tuholske et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 a s a denotes the area between the line of perfect equality and the lorenz curve and s b denotes the area under the lorenz curve from these values the gini coefficient of the resource allocation can be obtained by eq 1 1 g s a s a s b furthermore let l x represent the function of the lorenz curve the gini coefficient can be obtained by eq 2 2 g 1 2 0 1 l x d x it can be seen that resource allocation including distributions of water permits can be derived based on the shape of the lorenz curve in this study we apply the power law function to model the shape of the lorenz curve for its simplicity and effectiveness to mimic the inequality in real world resource distributions jantzen and volpert 2012 substituting the power law function l x x p x 0 1 where p and x are the power term and the percentage of population respectively into eq 2 we obtain the relationship between the power law term p and the gini coefficient g as shown in eq 3 3 g p 1 p 1 eq 3 allows us to model water allocation to each individual water right holder e g farmer for a known level of inequality here we perform a demonstration of applying the power law method to allocate a total volume of 300 acre feet water permits to 300 farmers with the gini coefficient set as 0 1 and 0 7 respectively the results in fig 1c d show that the power law method can capture the distributional features of resource allocation with different degrees of inequality a summary of the steps involved in allocating water permit based on the gini coefficient is depicted in fig 2 additional introduction to the gini coefficient and its numerical derivation is provided in the supporting information 2 2 modeling farmers behaviors in the water market in this study each farmer is represented by a decision unit i e an agent that makes 1 irrigation decision to satisfy crop water demand and 2 bidding decision to buy or sell water permits in the water market the behavioral parameters associated with these decision making processes are described in turn as follows irrigation plays an important role in buffering crop production against drought and rainfall variability helping to maintain sufficient soil moisture to avoid or limit water related yield losses following standard water balance approaches to irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 we assume that farmers irrigation practices are triggered by comparing on a daily basis the observed soil water deficit d c with a management allowed water deficit d mad that defines the level of soil moisture depletion at which irrigation will be triggered the soil moisture based irrigation scheduling applied in this study is consistent with both real world farmer irrigation behaviors usda 2008 and prior models for agricultural water use simulation foster et al 2014 foster and brozoviÄ‡ 2018 to capture the heterogeneity in farmers sensitivity to soil water deficit ozdogan et al 2010 we introduce a behavioral parameter Î» to represent a farmer s decision about when to trigger irrigation relative to an average recommended agronomic management practices a small value of Î» represents a farmer that is more sensitive to soil water deficit and will irrigation crops before actual depletion exceeds d mad whereas a large value of Î» represents a farmer that will delay irrigation until after depletion exceeds d mad miro 2012 noÃ«l and cai 2017 considering the effects of Î» the irrigation decision of a farmer is represented by eq 4 4 irrigation yes if d c Î» d mad no if d c Î» d mad bidding behaviors describe how an agent makes bids to sell or buy water permits in a marketplace which is assumed to be a sealed bid double auction market in this study loy et al 2014 an agent s bid Ï† i d r p q consists of four variables 1 the agent s unique index id 2 the agent s role in the water market r which is a categorical variable indicating if the agent is a seller r s or a buyer r b in the auction 3 bid price p acre feet representing the agent s willingness to pay for buyers or willingness to accept for sellers for each unit of water permits and this value can be affected by the marginal value of water permits and the agent s bidding strategies and 4 bid amount q acre feet representing the amount of water permits the agent seeks to trade in the current auction round in agricultural systems the marginal benefit of irrigation affects farmers reservation price in an auction market i e the upper bound price for buying water or lower bound price for selling water which is dependent on some agronomic and economic factors such as crop type crop price crop growth stage yield response factors and soil properties therefore farmers reservation prices may vary across farmers and vary over time in this study farmers bidding strategies are represented by the behavioral rules of the zero intelligence plus zip agents which has been widely used to simulate agents bidding behaviors in various types of double auction markets cliff and bruten 1997 gonzales and ajami 2019 luca and cliff 2011 pourebrahimi et al 2008 vytelingum et al 2008 let Î¾ i t denote the agent i s reservation price at time t his bid price can be represented by eq 5 5 p i t 1 Î¼ i t Î¾ i t for buyer 0 Î¼ i t 1 1 Î¼ i t Î¾ i t for seller Î¼ i t 0 where Î¼ i t is a behavioral parameter that represents the percentage of profit that the agent aims to obtain for the transaction agents with a larger Î¼ seek to obtain more profit from trade than those with a smaller Î¼ e g a seller with a larger Î¼ will bid a higher price than those with a smaller Î¼ given that an agent s bid may result in a successful or failure transaction its degree of rent seeking Î¼ will change over time based on its past trade experiences for example if a seller s bid did not result in a successful transaction in the past auction round i e indicating that the seller has bid a higher price in the market it may consider to bid a lower price in the next round i e reducing the value of Î¼ to increase the chance of reaching a successful transaction and vice versa it can be seen that Î¼ is a time varying variable representing an agent s update of its greediness in profit seeking based on its past trade experiences after an agent decides to update its degree of rent seeking Î¼ the change rate is affected by the agent s learning rate coefficient Î² as shown in eq 6 6 Î¼ i t 1 Î¼ i t Î² i Ï„ t p i t Î¾ i t where Ï„ t is the price signal obtained from the water market which can be set as the average transaction price released by the water market at time t Î² is a behavioral parameter measuring the extent to which the agent is willing to change its degree of rent seeking agents with a larger Î² changes its degree of rent seeking by a greater value than those with a smaller Î² note that Î² is a static behavioral parameter representing an agent s individual learning capability however the value of Î² may vary from one agent to another in the system due to their behavioral heterogeneity previous studies have shown that the bidding behaviors Î¼ and Î² can reasonably represent market participants empirical bidding behaviors in a double auction market cliff and bruten 1997 das et al 2001 for more introduction of the two behavioral parameters and their applications in market simulation see vytelingum et al 2008 du et al 2017 and gonzales ajami 2019 2 3 mechanism of the bid matching processes in the water market after all of the agents submit their bids to the market which are private to each other the auction center will match these bids and implement their transactions here we employ the discriminatory price double auction as the market mechanism in which the transaction prices are dependent on each pair of the two winning bidders nyborg and strebulaev 2004 in other words transaction prices in the discriminatory auction could differ between agents depending on their bidding strategies and behaviors the advantage of such an auction mechanism compared with the optimization based market simulation is that it does not require the market to obtain the agents private held valuation of the goods preferences and or beliefs nicolaisen et al 2001 the procedure of the bid matching processes is described as follows fig 3 shows an illustrative example of how agents bids are matched to derive water permit transactions first sellers and buyers are sorted in ascending and descending orders respectively according to their bid prices then each agent s feasible trading partners can be determined with the sorted bid list for a seller buyer i with bid price p i his feasible trading partners are all of the buyers sellers whose bid prices are higher lower than p i for example in the market transaction case of fig 3 agent 01 s feasible trading partners are agent 03 and agent 04 next the seller with the lowest bid price will be matched with the buyer with the highest bid price e g agent 01 and agent 03 are firstly matched the two bids will result in a transaction if the buyer s bid price is higher than the seller s bid price the transaction price is set as the average of the two prices and the amount of transacted water permits is the smaller one of the two bid amounts e g the transaction price and transaction amount are 18 5 acre feet and 5 acre feet respectively for the trade between agent 01 and agent 03 if the two bid amounts are not equal the one whose bid amounts are not fully met will be matched with the second best bid among his feasible trading partners e g agent 01 will sell 4 acre feet water permits to agent 04 with transaction price of 17 5 acre feet the matching processes will continue until the highest bid price for buyers is lower than the lowest bid price for sellers in the auction list for a more detailed introduction to the matching processes see nguyen et al 2013 after the market center matches the agents bids and implements their transactions for each auction round the transaction prices for water permits are released to the public as the water price signal based on that the agents can update their bidding prices in the next auction round in the water market an agent can sell its available water permits i e total water permits minus total water withdrawals to others through the market when its irrigation demand has been satisfied however we assume that an agent can buy water permits only when its current water permits cannot satisfy its irrigation demand i e farmers are not allowed to buy water permits more than their own irrigation demand note that there could be instances in which sellers water supply does not meet buyers water demand in the market due to the disparity in the price and or the amount of their bids under such circumstances agents will adjust their bids in the next round to fulfill the unmet transactions for example if an agent is not able to buy sufficient water permits to meet its irrigation demand in the current round it will increase its bid price in the next round to increase the chance of realizing successful transactions 2 4 development of the abm framework we develop the abm framework using the objective oriented programming language java the design of the abm follows the standard overview design concepts details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 detailed description of the odd protocol is provided in the supporting information of this paper the abm consists of three major components that have each been described in turn in the previous sections 1 the water permit allocation module 2 the crop growth module and 3 the water market module the water permit allocation module distributes the basin level total water permits to farmers represented by agents based on a given level of allocation inequality measured by the gini coefficient the crop growth module incorporates the key functions in the aquacrop crop model developed by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model simulates soil moisture water demand and crop production as a response to diverse environmental agronomic hydrological and management e g irrigation conditions if water permits are insufficient to meet irrigation demand we assume that farmers will reduce per area irrigation intensity on farmlands the deficit irrigation will lead to a decrease in crop evapotranspiration compared to that without a water stress at the end of crop growing season actual crop yield is obtained by a crop water production function that compares actual evapotranspiration and the maximum evapotranspiration without a water stress which is a widely adopted approach to calculating crop production for deficit irrigation allen et al 2005 foster and brozoviÄ‡ 2018 steduto et al 2009 wang and cai 2009 it is noteworthy that farms at different locations experience varied hydrogeological and meteorological conditions e g soil type precipitation evapotranspiration in this study we also consider the heterogeneity in farmers irrigation decisions reflected by their sensitivity to soil water deficit leading to various irrigation practices among farmers therefore the water use crop yield relationship will differ from location to location and from farmer to farmer fig 4 presents the flowchart of model running processes the model starts with selecting the scenario for farmers behavioral parameters and the gini coefficient for water permit allocation these parameters will be used to construct the farmer agents then at each time step i e daily in this study the crop module calculates each agent s irrigation demand and agent will make a bidding decision to buy or sell water permits based on his available water permits and irrigation demand e g an agent will need to buy water permits if his remainder water permits are not sufficient to satisfy irrigation demand after collecting all the agents bids the water market calculates the transaction results for each agent the market level average water price is sent to the public as the water price signal for the next auction round at the end of the crop growth season the model returns crop production for each agent and calculate basin level total crop production 3 case study and scenario design 3 1 case study site and data collection we apply the model to the guadalupe river basin grb a small watershed in southern texas with the total area of approximate 1 5 104 km2 fig 5 a the guadalupe river the main river in the basin flows from the kerr county in the northwest to san antonio bay in the southeast and drains into the gulf of mexico irrigation is one of the largest water consumers in the grb over the past decades agricultural development has resulted in reduced base flow and water pollution in the guadalupe river and its tributaries which has become a major environmental concern for the watershed arismendez et al 2009 water resources in the grb are owned by the state and the state grants the right to use water to various stakeholders e g farmers cities and industries garcia et al 2009 following the local water right system farmers are issued a fixed amount of water permits from texas commission on environmental quality tceq a government agency that manages water resources in the watershed fig 5b plots the per area water permits for the 334 active agricultural water right holders in the basin it can be seen that water permits are not equally allocated among farmers with the gini coefficient of the water allocation equal to 0 31 see the supporting information for the derivation of the gini coefficient water scarcity is a common challenge for farmers during droughts especially for those with fewer water permits and or large irrigation water demands in this study we simulate a water market based on the double auction to evaluate how farmers behaviors and the inequality of water permit allocation jointly affect market performances such a market is not currently a formal part of management processes but our interactions with stakeholders in the basin highlight interest amongst users in the ability to trade water rights the grb thus represents an ideal test case for our simulation framework to evaluate the performance of a double auction water market prior to its actual implementation in the region we collect data from various sources to implement the model data for the 334 active agricultural water right holders corresponding to 334 agents in our model are collected from the tceq database including each farmer s cropland area and allocated water permits https www tceq texas gov agency data the soil properties of the farmland are obtained from the usda soil survey http websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov the meteorology data e g daily precipitation temperature

response factor to water deficit are obtained from usda statistics services http quickstats nass usda gov and from allen et al 1998 irrigation cost i e fuel and labor cost is set as 2 47 acre inch foster et al 2014 irrigation efficiency i e central pivot irrigation system and leaching fraction i e an agricultural management practice that applies a small amount of excess irrigation for salinity control are set as 90 and 15 respectively letey et al 2011 wagner 2012 finally the coefficient of transaction cost for the water market is set as 10 based on the sensitivity analysis by du et al 2017 3 2 model comparison and scenario design in order to assess the market performance under the influence of water allocation and agent behaviors the modeling results of the proposed abm based water market referred to as model a in the following sections of this paper are compared with 1 a baseline model referred to as model b1 and 2 a benchmark model referred to as model b2 the baseline model b1 simulates the case without an agricultural water market for water trading agents are only allowed to use their entitled water permits to irrigate crop the benchmark model b2 simulates an optimal water market in which agents bid decisions could result in perfect market efficiency this model adopts a centralized optimization approach for water trading so that the water market can automatically enable available water permits to be used by the cropland with the highest crop productivity followed by the ones with relatively lower productivity it is expected that model b2 will yield more crop production than model a while model b1 will yield the least crop production two sets of experiments are designed to assess the joint impacts of water permit allocation and farmer s behaviors on the water market table 1 the first experiment sets the gini coefficient of water permit allocation g as 0 31 to mimic the current distribution of water permits within the grb the three behavioral parameters are varied from 0 4 to 1 8 for agents sensitivity to soil water deficit Î» irrigation behavior from 0 to 0 8 for degree of rent seeking Î» and from 0 to 0 6 for learning rate coefficient Î² bidding behaviors our hypothesis is that market performance in model a is constrained by agents behavioral parameters and cannot achieve the level of the optimization based model b2 the second experiment aims to understand the joint impacts of the inequality of water permit allocation and agent behaviors the gini coefficient g is varied from 0 1 to 0 8 representing different levels of water allocation inequality our hypothesis is that when water permits become more unequally allocated the potential performance of the water market i e obtained by model b2 will increase however we expect that the actual market performance i e obtained by model a will be constrained by farmers bidding behaviors which do not guarantee perfect market efficiency without sufficient empirical knowledge about the distribution of farmers behavioral parameters in the study site we apply a scenario based approach to assessing the joint impacts of farmers behaviors and water permit allocation on the water market as illustrated in table 1 we use the gaussian distribution for each scenario to generate a set of behavioral parameters and randomly assign them to the agents in the system the coefficient of variation in the gaussian distribution is used to represent agents behavioral heterogeneity this can introduce certain level of randomness to the modeling results following the concept of the monte carlo approach decker 1991 we run the model 100 times the number to ensure output stabilization in this study to obtain the average modeling results for each scenario here we use 1 the basin level total crop production tcp bushel 2 the increased crop production achieved by a water market by comparing the scenario with and without the water market icp bushel and 3 total traded water permits in the market ttw acre feet to measure water market performance note that water markets distributional impacts among farmers can also be insightful and important hadjigeorgalis 2008a khan and brown 2019 but such analyses are beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in our future work 4 results this section presents the modeling results first section 4 1 compares the water market performance for the three models under the influence of farmers behaviors based on experiment 1 next the results in experiment 2 investigate the impacts of water permit allocation on the water market performance section 4 2 finally sections 4 3 and 4 4 explore the joint impacts of farmers behaviors and water permit allocation under various hydrological conditions 4 1 overview of the water market performance for the three models we summarize the result of the total crop production tcp during the simulation period from 2001 to 2013 for the three models i e model a for the abm based water market model b1 without a water market and model b2 for the optimization based water market the result shows that tcp for model a is higher than model b1 and lower than model b2 for all of the simulation years fig 6 a this concurs with our hypothesis that a water market can increase system level crop production compared with the scenario without a water market but the market performance can be constrained by agents bidding behaviors which do not necessarily ensure perfect market efficiency these results are consistent with our prior work du et al 2017 and therefore demonstrate that the proposed power law method to allocate water permits can reflect the role of farmers behaviors and the overall market performance a detailed sensitivity analysis of the impacts of agents behaviors on market performance is presented in the supporting information of this paper comparing fig 6a b we can see that the water market has greater potential to increase tcp when the weather is drier the difference of tcp between model a and model b1 is higher in 2011 a dry year than that in 2010 a normal year therefore it could be more beneficial to implement a water market in arid areas during dry seasons in which farmers typically face severe water scarcity issues this concurs with the argument that scarcity is the primary driving force for implementing a water market bjornlund 2003 4 2 impacts of water permit allocation on water market performance experiment 2 explores the influence of water permit allocation on the performance of the water market fig 7 a compares tcp among the three model formulations it is shown that tcp decreases when the gini coefficient g increases if a water market is not available model b1 in comparison a water market allows agents who are entitled to more water permits to sell part of their permits to those with water scarcity resulting in an increase in tcp i e the black dots of model a the tcp does not change with g when the water market is perfectly efficient for trading water permits model b2 as we can see when the gini coefficient for water permit allocation is set as zero the crop productions from the three models are similar this is because under the condition of perfectly equal water permit allocation the agents will obtain an equal share of water permits i e 1 05 feet per acre which is more than the average irrigation water demand i e around 0 89 foot under the climate condition of year 2010 therefore agents are not expected to experience water scarcity if water permits are equally allocated as a result the total crop productions from the three models are all maintained at a high level without water scarcity when the gini coefficient is zero fig 7b shows that the water market performance icp for model a increases with the gini coefficient g and the relationship between icp and g is nonlinear for example icp increases dramatically with g when g is smaller than 0 5 however only a slight increase in icp is observed when g becomes larger than 0 5 note that when the gini coefficient is 0 6 the declining trend of crop production for model b1 is less dramatic which leads to a less significant increase of icp however the declining trends of the total crop production responding to increasing inequality in water permit allocation are consistent for the two models i e a and b1 the nonlinear relationship between g and icp suggests that the actual performance of the water market is constrained by farmers bidding behaviors to a greater extent when the inequality level of water permit allocation is higher this implies that when water permits are more unequally distributed water market institution needs to encourage farmers to optimize their bidding behaviors by for example submitting more competitive bids e g consider lower degree of rent seeking and higher level of learning rate in order to result in successful transactions while fig 7b focuses on the marker performance of model a fig 7c evaluates the relative market performance that measures the extent to which model a can achieve optimal market performance of model b2 i e icp for model a compared with icp for model b2 the results show that the relative market performance is higher when the inequality of water permit allocation is at a moderate level i e the gini coefficient g is between 0 3 and 0 5 the difference between the market performance for model a and model b2 can be explained by the assumption of the perfectly efficient market in model b2 that enables market performance to be maximized elbakidze et al 2018 however in the real world the lack of market information and agents non perfect rationality partially due to the fact that agents reservation prices and preferences are held privately can affect their bidding decisions a competitive agent may offer a bid price that fails to result in transactions therefore the maximum performance of water markets can rarely be achieved when these factors are considered our modeling results concur with the concerns and empirical observations of some poorly performed water markets in the real world bitran et al 2014 kaufman 2012 li et al 2011 matthews 2004 4 3 the joint impacts of water permit allocation and bidding behaviors while the above sections overview the role of farmers bidding behaviors section 4 1 and water permit allocation section 4 2 separately this section explicitly examines their joint impacts on market performance fig 8 shows that the joint impacts of water permit allocation and farmers bidding behaviors on market performance are complex and non linear the basin level total crop production tcp is higher when the gini coefficient of water allocation g is smaller the degree of rent seeking Î¼ is smaller and the learning rate coefficient Î² is larger the amount of total traded water permits ttw is smaller when the gini coefficient of water allocation g is smaller more importantly it is found that the role of farmers bidding behaviors i e Î¼ and Î² in the water market is intensified when water permits are more unequally distributed for example tcp is maintained at a relatively high level regardless of the values of Î¼ and Î² when g is small however the influences of Î¼ and Î² on tcp become more significant when g becomes larger these results emphasize the complex and non linear influence of water allocation and agent behaviors as well as their joint impacts on the water market importantly we show that influence of one particular parameter on modeling results highly depends on the settings of other parameters it can also be seen that the inequality of water allocation determines the potential performance of the water market whereas agents bidding behaviors determine the extent to which the actual market performance can be obtained the above sections have focused on agents bidding behaviors here we explore the role of 1 farmers irrigation behavior i e sensitivity to soil water deficit Î» and 2 hydrological condition in the water market fig 9 fig 9a shows that tcp is smaller when Î» is larger in particular the reduced tcp caused by increasing Î» e g from 0 6 to 1 4 becomes smaller when g is larger for example when g is 0 1 tcp decreases from 2 78 million bushel to 2 51 million bushel a reduction of 0 27 million bushel as Î» increases from 0 6 to 1 4 in comparison when g is 0 8 tcp decreases from 2 31 million bushel to 2 12 million bushel a reduction of 0 19 million bushel for the same change of Î» the results suggest that when water permits are more equally allocated the potential benefits of implementing the water market are more limited but improvement of irrigation scheduling could still increase crop production fig 9b emphasizes the role of hydrological conditions in market performance it shows that the influence of farmers bidding behaviors and initial water permit allocation on the water market is more noticeable in dry years e g 2011 than in wet years e g 2007 the reason for these differences is that in wet years farmers irrigation demand can be satisfied mostly through precipitation resulting in lower demand for water permits and less participation in the water market in contrast in dry years farmers rely on irrigation to meet a significant proportion of crop water needs this increases demand for trades from farmers with fewer permits and stimulates greater trading in the market conditional on the influence of initial water permit allocations and the heterogeneity in farmers behaviors 4 4 emerging interplay patterns of multiple influencing factors in the water market this section combines 1 water permit allocation g 2 irrigation behavior Î» and 3 bidding behavior Î² to investigate their joint impacts on the water market as shown in fig 10 the key finding in fig 10 is that among the three modeling parameters the impact of one particular parameter on the modeling results highly depends on the joint setting of other parameters the interplay of the three parameters exhibits three emerging patterns which will be discussed in turn below the first pattern is that changing the value of one parameter affects the potential performance of the water market i e the maximum value of tcp but does not change the sensitive parameters in the system note that here we refer to a parameter as a sensitive one if the modeling results change dramatically when the value of this parameter changes this pattern applies for the role of farmers sensitivity to soil dryness Î» and the interplay between farmers learning rate coefficient Î² and the inequality of water permit allocation g fig 10a c for example both Î² and g are sensitive parameters that affect tcp regardless of the value of Î» however the maximum value of tcp increases when farmers are more sensitive to soil dryness i e when Î» is smaller the second pattern is that changing the value of one parameter will not affect the potential performance of the water market nor will it change the sensitive parameters in the system this pattern applies for the role of Î² and the interplay between Î» and g fig 10d f the maximum value of tcp does not change as farmers learning rate coefficient Î² changes furthermore both Î» and g are sensitive parameters in the system regardless the value of Î² the third pattern is that changing the value of one parameter not only affects the potential performance of the water market but also changes the sensitive parameters in the system this pattern applies for the role of g and the interplay between Î» and Î² fig 10g i when water permits are more equally allocated i e when g is small the maximum value of tcp is larger and farmers sensitivity to soil dryness Î» is a sensitive parameter in the system but farmers learning rate coefficient Î² is not however as water permits become more unequally allocated i e when g becomes larger the maximum value of tcp decreases and farmers learning rate coefficient becomes a sensitive parameter in the system understanding the complex interplay of the three parameters can provide some policy implications to improve water market performance which will be discussed in the next section 5 discussion 5 1 model implications for future market modeling efforts the modeling results in this study could provide several modeling implications to future research efforts on simulating agricultural water markets in this study by incorporating a water allocation module and farmers behavior parameters we show that the water market performance is between the scenario without a water market i e model b1 and the scenario of the optimization based water market i e model b2 the actual market performance could vary dramatically depending on the joint settings of agent behaviors and the inequality of water permit allocation this finding implies that the optimization based approach is able to reflect the maximum benefit a market can generate but could probably over estimate the actual benefits of the water market if some empirical institutional and behavioral factors of market participants are not fully incorporated in the model therefore in order to draw more robust and practical conclusions about the benefits of a water market future research efforts need to re examine the assumptions behind the optimization approach in particular it is necessary to consider farmers behavioral characteristics and personal preferences that could affect their water trading decisions in markets the cross model comparison of different modeling approaches such as the one presented in this study might lead to a more conservative and more realistic assessment of the actual market performance in the real world furthermore using an abm rather than a traditional optimization model to simulate a water market suggests that basin managers should take a bottom up approach to assessing possible water market benefits considering the role played by individual farmers regarding their behaviors and responses in the water market policy makers can design effective market institutions to improve market performances by promoting farmers behavioral changes for example given that farmers degree of rent seeking and learning rate coefficient play an essential role in market performances water market center can provide more transparent transaction information to market participants based on that agents can response to market condition and adjust their bidding strategies to increase market transactions under the condition of low transactions policies can also be designed to encourage farmers to be more conservative i e choosing a smaller degree of rent seeking when making bids in the water market 5 2 policy implications for improving water market performance the modeling results in this study also have implications for the design and assessment of market based mechanisms for water management in irrigation dependent regions the modeling results in this study show that the total crop production is higher when 1 farmers are more sensitive to soil dryness i e Î» is smaller and 2 agents bidding prices are closer to their reservation prices i e Î¼ is smaller and or Î² is larger 3 water permits are more equally allocated among agents i e g is smaller this conclusion is based on the modeling results for market conditions in our study area a small watershed where farmers have a similar crop planting pattern and water productivity if farmers have significantly different water productivity levels in an agricultural system a more equal water permit allocation does not necessarily lead to an increase in their total crop production farmers with greater water productivity could be allocated with more amount of water permits if the water management goal is to increase the system level crop production future studies can explicitly assess the role played by the heterogeneity in farmers water productivity and the inequality of water permit allocation in water market performances the results regarding the role of water allocation and farmer behaviors in the water market provide important policy implications to increase crop production in agricultural systems for example to improve farmers irrigation behavior Î» an agricultural consulting program e g crop adviser could be helpful to educate farmers to be more sensitive to soil dryness and irrigate crops before crop soil moisture falls below the water deficit threshold eanes et al 2019 on the other hand from a technology development perspective equipping an agricultural system with soil moisture monitoring sensors could help farmers to better assess soil dryness and to perform a more timely irrigation scheduling ozdogan et al 2010 the complex interplay between farmers behaviors and water permit allocation could also contribute to the analysis of their comparative advantages when multiple policies for improving water market performance are available for example besides improving farmers irrigation behavior i e to decrease Î» as discussed above our modeling results show that allocating water permits more equally i e to decrease g can increase total crop production e g fig 7a therefore it becomes critically important for policy makers to assess which one of the two programs can yield more benefits fig 11 provides a quantitative evaluation framework that compares the benefits of 1 crop advisory program to change farmers irrigation behaviors and 2 water allocation program to reallocate water permits which is more on institutional change it shows that the optimal policy choice highly depends on the joint setting of Î» and g under the condition of 1 low inequality of water allocation g 0 2 and 2 farmers less sensitive to soil dryness Î» 1 4 as indicated by point a in fig 11 setting up the crop advisory program to change farmers irrigation behaviors i e from point a to point a1 can yield more benefits than promoting a water allocation program to redistribute water permits i e from point a to point a2 however an institutional change to redistribute water permits could yield more benefits than the crop advisory program under the condition of 1 high inequality of water allocation and 2 farmers more sensitive attitude to soil dryness as indicated by the point b in fig 11 5 3 model limitations and future directions it is important to discuss the model limitations and future directions of this study as the abm presented here is subject to some model assumptions due to data incompleteness and the scope of this work firstly in this study we apply the power law function to approximate the shape of the lorenz curve and to allocate water permits however other types of functions e g the polynomial function the pareto distribution function or hybrid functions that combine multiple functions may also be feasible options for the curve approximation jantzen and volpert 2012 future work can compare multiple types of approximation functions for the analysis secondly the water market presented in this study does not consider some social institutional and physical factors that may affect water trading for example engineering infrastructures e g channel system for delivering water information platform for sharing and exchanging market information are essential for operating a water market however in this study we simply assume that these engineering infrastructures and information hub are available which might not be true for some regions farmers behaviors in agricultural systems could also be affected by wider social and economic factors these include but are not limited to farmers household income family size budget constraint risk attitude towards the uncertainties in future climate land area access to information or extensive advice and the behaviors of the neighboring farmers barnes et al 2013 hadjigeorgalis 2008a malawska and topping 2016 tadesse and bahiigwa 2015 van duinen et al 2016 future work could include a social module that specifically accounts for these additional components in farmers decision making and enhance the abm framework s capability to represent more comprehensive and more realistic relationships between water permit allocation the relevant socioeconomic factors and farmers behavioral changes thirdly this study mainly focuses on water as the limiting factor to crop yield in the crop model under a water limited crop management condition allen et al 1998 foster et al 2017 it is noteworthy that other factors such as fertilizer pesticide and biotechnology can also affect crop yield which may in turn affect agricultural water use and market performance in particular this study has not considered farmers alternative agricultural management practices when a water market is available such as fallowing the land to make profits by selling water permits to other farmers in the system adjusting the size of crop area based on changing weather conditions and reducing irrigation area instead of per area irrigation intensity when water permits are insufficient to meet irrigation demand hadjigeorgalis 2008a future work can incorporate these factors in the model to simulate more flexible and more realistic farmer behaviors in the water market lastly the abm in this study has not been coupled with a hydrological model and therefore we do not explore how trade between two agents may alter distributions of water use across the basin in particular our model does not consider the potential for trading to exacerbate local externalities of agricultural water abstractions for example through concentrating pumping in specific locations or through increased consumptive use of water future work needs to couple the presented abm with a groundwater model and or a river routing model to assess the third party effects of the water market these future works can make this study more comprehensive it is noteworthy that water permits in many river basins have been allocated under historical compacts many decades ago altering these established water permit allocations by imposing a reallocation of rights would be a complex and political challenging issue the specific legal institutional economic and geopolitical efforts that are needed to achieve successful reallocation of initial water permits might vary from region to region and from time to time which are beyond the scope of this study instead this study focuses on evaluating market performances conditional on a fixed baseline allocation of water permits with differing levels of inequality to reflect the differences in the equity of historical permit allocation observed in the real world 6 conclusions this study focuses on exploring the role of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors in agricultural water markets we propose an agent based modeling framework that incorporates 1 a water allocation module that adopts a power law method to distribute water permits with a given level of inequality and 2 farmers irrigation and bidding behaviors in an agricultural water market based on a double auction we also develop a baseline model representing the scenario without a water market and a benchmark model representing a water market with perfect efficiency for model comparison we apply the models to the guadalupe river basin a small river basin in southern texas to assess the performance of the water market under the joint impacts of the inequality of water permit allocation farmers behaviors and hydrological conditions we find the benefits of the water market i e represented by the maximum crop production that can be achieved by the water market is jointly determined by the inequality of water permit allocation farmers sensitivity to soil dryness and hydrological conditions farmers bidding behaviors determine the extent to which the market benefits can be realized the water market can increase more crop production when 1 water permits are unequally allocated 2 farmers are more sensitive to soil dryness and 3 farmers bid their true valuations of water permits the modeling framework can be applied to assess the comparative advantages of different policies that aim to increase water market performance for example we show that the change of farmers irrigation behavior through agricultural advisory programs could yield more increase in crop production than the change of water permit allocation through institutional development when water permits are allocated in a relatively equal manner and farmers are not sufficiently sensitive to soil dryness in contrast changing water permit allocation is shown to be more beneficial than changing farmers irrigation behavior when water permits are unequally allocated and farmers are sensitive to soil dryness these results have emphasized the importance of a holistic examination of the complex interplay of these influencing factors when designing water market policies this study still has some limitations that need to be addressed recommended future work includes incorporating some institutional and physical constraints in the water market coupling the current modeling framework with a hydrological model for the analysis of market externalities and third party effects and incorporating more agent behaviors and decision processes that may affect water market performance we envision that these improvements can better assess the role of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors in water markets and provide more useful modeling and policy implications to improve market

4440,water markets are considered as effective mechanisms to support efficient use of limited water resources and to increase crop production in agricultural systems this study presents an agent based modeling abm framework to explore the performance of an agricultural water market under the joint influence of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors the abm employs a power law function to simulate water permit distribution among farmers for any given level of inequality measured by the gini coefficient farmers irrigation behavior i e sensitivity to soil dryness and bidding behaviors i e degree of rent seeking and learning rate coefficient are explicitly incorporated into the abm to represent farmers decision making in a water market based on double auction through a set of scenario analyses in a study area in texas we find that the water market performance to increase basin level crop production is constrained by a joint effect of especially the complex and non linear interplay between the inequality of water permit allocation farmers behaviors and hydrological conditions the potential market performance is higher when water permits are more unequally distributed the relative market performance is higher when the inequality of water allocation is at a moderate level the modeling results can advance our understanding of the key contributing factors in market transactions and provide policy implications to assess the comparative advantage between institutional development and farmers behavioral change for improving market performance this study also provides model implications for future research to draw more robust conclusions about market benefits in the real world keywords water permit allocation gini coefficient agent based model farmers behaviors agricultural water market 1 introduction many countries and regions are highly dependent on surface water and or groundwater for irrigation and food production with agriculture being the primary water consumer in many major river basins donohew 2009 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 plunkett et al 2010 however satisfying irrigation demand is becoming increasingly challenging due to increasing water demands from other sectors e g industry and municipality along with changes in water availability due to climate change ringler and zhu 2015 in response to rising water scarcity water markets have been advocated as effective tools to support efficient use of limited freshwater resources by enabling reallocation of water rights from low to high valued uses delorit and block 2018 easter et al 1999 endo et al 2018 griffin 1998 marston and cai 2016 raffensperger et al 2009 turral et al 2005 zhao et al 2013 in the past decades water markets have been implemented in many countries in the world such as australia brennan 2006 gao et al 2013 grafton and horne 2014 qureshi et al 2009 the united states griffin and boadu 1992 howe and goemans 2003 yoskowitz 1999 chile hadjigeorgalis

before its actual implementation in a specific region easter et al 1998 for policymakers seeking to assess potential benefits of water markets performance evaluations have an important role to play in assessing expected market performance and in exploring ways to improve market efficiency many studies have attempted to understand the performance of water markets under the influence of some important factors these include but are not limited to 1 water legislation systems that define the ownership of property rights bauer 2015 2010 griffin 1998 griffin and boadu 1992 johnson et al 1981 wheeler et al 2017 2 engineering infrastructures for delivering water resources and monitoring water consumption brewer et al 2008 xu et al 2018 3 transaction cost and third party effects that could

institutions that affect the ways in which water permits are traded breviglieri et al 2018 loch et al 2012 qureshi et al 2009 tisdell 2011 recently studies have also assessed the role played by social norms and farmers risk attitudes towards the uncertainty in future water supply and endowment in water markets aghaie et al 2020a delorit et al 2019 delorit and block 2020 2019 2018 water scarcity is considered as one of the primary driving forces that promote the market based approach for reallocating water permits bjornlund 2003 hadjigeorgalis 2008b some studies have specifically assessed water market performance under different climate and hydrological conditions e g khan brown 2019 luo et al 2007 however the degree of water scarcity is affected not only by total physical water availability but also by the institutional context that determines how water permits are allocated among water right holders in other words a fixed amount of total available water could result in varied degrees of water scarcity among the population e g water permits are equally allocated among the population versus most of the water permits are allocated to a small portion of population and as a result varied market performances therefore it is reasonable for us to hypothesize that the performance of a water market could be affected by the degree of inequality regarding how water permits are allocated among farmers it is essential to systematically assess the quantitative relationship between water market performance and the inequality of water allocation which is the key research question we aim to address in this study to assess water market performances previous studies have often employed the top down optimization based approach assuming perfect market efficiency erfani et al 2014 kuwayama and brozoviÄ‡ 2013 luo et al 2007 raffensperger and milke 2005 zeng et al 2015 however the conditions for perfectly efficient water markets e g sufficient information to search for trading partners effective bargaining processes to determine water price are rarely satisfied in the real world elbakidze et al 2018 matthews 2004 nguyen et al 2013 pulido velazquez et al 2008 in particular market transactions are affected by the collective behaviors of all the market participants who are embedded with heterogeneous characteristics motivations and interacting decision rules which further complicate market performance and cannot be well represented by the top down optimization based approach rand and rust 2011 vytelingum et al 2008 to address this issue some studies have applied the bottom up agent based modeling abm approach to simulating water markets aghaie et al 2020b heckbert et al 2010 iftekhar et al 2013 ng et al 2011 smajgl et al 2009 such an approach simulates markets as complex systems by treating market participants as autonomous adaptive and interacting decision makers by which the assumptions of perfectly efficient market conditions and fully rational well informed market actors in the optimization based approach can be relaxed heckbert et al 2010 therefore bottom up abms can provide unique insights into market performances under different institutional settings and agents behaviors farmer and foley 2009 in this study we aim to explore the joint impacts of the inequality of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors on market performance we develop an abm framework that incorporates 1 a water allocation module for modeling water permit allocation among farmers and 2 farmers irrigation and bidding behaviors in a water market based on a double auction we apply our modeling framework to the guadalupe river basin a small watershed with intensive agriculture in texas through a set of scenario analyses the modeling results demonstrate that water market performance can be jointly affected by the inequality of permit allocation farmers behaviors and hydrological conditions this study therefore identifies some new factors i e the interplay between water allocation and farmer behaviors that affect market performance which can advance our understanding of the contributing factors in market transactions and yield policy implications to improve market performance this study contributes to the literature in several aspects firstly this study incorporates the inequality of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors in a consistent modeling framework for water market analysis which advances our understanding of the key factors associated with market transactions secondly the water allocation module in this study adopts a novel power law method to realize different levels of inequality in water permit allocation which extends the previous studies that assess environmental and natural resource allocation with a fixed degree of inequality dai et al 2018 ge et al 2016 hu et al 2016 iftekhar and fogarty 2017 thirdly the scenario analyses of the interplay between water allocation farmer behaviors and hydrological conditions have identified some key contributing factors in market transactions which provide 1 modeling implications for future research efforts to simulate more realistic water markets under various conditions of water allocation and farmer behaviors and 2 policy implications for decision makers to improve market performance via promoting farmers behavioral change under a given water endowment the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodology including the water allocation module and the development of the abm section 3 gives an overview of the case study area and scenario design for model application section 4 presents the modeling results followed by discussions on modeling and policy implications in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 2 methodology in this section we first introduce the proposed water allocation module section 2 1 farmers behaviors section 2 2 and the mechanism of the water market section 2 3 sections 2 4 presents how the abm is developed to integrate the above components into a consistent modeling framework 2 1 water permit allocation module in agricultural systems with well defined and enforced property rights the amount of water permits constrains the total volume of water that can be withdrawn from surface water and or groundwater over a given time period garcia et al 2009 due to some socioeconomic and institutional reasons e g the purpose of water use the location specific water doctrine at the time of requesting water permits farmers are not always entitled to an equal share of water permits in agricultural systems considering the variation in the size of farmland between farmers we use per area water permits w to measure the inequality of farmers water permit allocation druckman and jackson 2008 the gini coefficient has been widely used by economists and social scientists as a simple and effective measurement of income and social inequality bosi and seegmuller 2006 druckman and jackson 2008 gastwirth 2017 lambert and aronson 1993 recently it has also been applied to measure the inequality of natural resource allocation hu et al 2016 iftekhar and fogarty 2017 liu et al 2019 sadras and bongiovanni 2004 teng et al 2011 yuan et al 2017 for example hu et al 2016 use the gini coefficient to measure environmental resource equity and build a multi objective programming model to examine the optimal allocation of regional water resources that specifically considers the equity efficiency tradeoff iftekhar fogarty 2017 develop an optimization model to assess the impacts of agricultural management policies on the groundwater system under unequal water allocation conditions in western australia following these studies here we adopt the gini coefficient denoted by g to measure the inequality of water permit allocation within a given basin or management unit the gini coefficient ranges from zero i e representing perfectly equal distribution in which every member in the population gets an equal portion of a resource to one i e representing completely unequal distribution in which one member gets all of a resource and the others get none the gini coefficient can be calculated based on the lorenz curve which plots the percentage of total resources shared by the bottom ratio of the population sadras and bongiovanni 2004 tuholske et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 a s a denotes the area between the line of perfect equality and the lorenz curve and s b denotes the area under the lorenz curve from these values the gini coefficient of the resource allocation can be obtained by eq 1 1 g s a s a s b furthermore let l x represent the function of the lorenz curve the gini coefficient can be obtained by eq 2 2 g 1 2 0 1 l x d x it can be seen that resource allocation including distributions of water permits can be derived based on the shape of the lorenz curve in this study we apply the power law function to model the shape of the lorenz curve for its simplicity and effectiveness to mimic the inequality in real world resource distributions jantzen and volpert 2012 substituting the power law function l x x p x 0 1 where p and x are the power term and the percentage of population respectively into eq 2 we obtain the relationship between the power law term p and the gini coefficient g as shown in eq 3 3 g p 1 p 1 eq 3 allows us to model water allocation to each individual water right holder e g farmer for a known level of inequality here we perform a demonstration of applying the power law method to allocate a total volume of 300 acre feet water permits to 300 farmers with the gini coefficient set as 0 1 and 0 7 respectively the results in fig 1c d show that the power law method can capture the distributional features of resource allocation with different degrees of inequality a summary of the steps involved in allocating water permit based on the gini coefficient is depicted in fig 2 additional introduction to the gini coefficient and its numerical derivation is provided in the supporting information 2 2 modeling farmers behaviors in the water market in this study each farmer is represented by a decision unit i e an agent that makes 1 irrigation decision to satisfy crop water demand and 2 bidding decision to buy or sell water permits in the water market the behavioral parameters associated with these decision making processes are described in turn as follows irrigation plays an important role in buffering crop production against drought and rainfall variability helping to maintain sufficient soil moisture to avoid or limit water related yield losses following standard water balance approaches to irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 we assume that farmers irrigation practices are triggered by comparing on a daily basis the observed soil water deficit d c with a management allowed water deficit d mad that defines the level of soil moisture depletion at which irrigation will be triggered the soil moisture based irrigation scheduling applied in this study is consistent with both real world farmer irrigation behaviors usda 2008 and prior models for agricultural water use simulation foster et al 2014 foster and brozoviÄ‡ 2018 to capture the heterogeneity in farmers sensitivity to soil water deficit ozdogan et al 2010 we introduce a behavioral parameter Î» to represent a farmer s decision about when to trigger irrigation relative to an average recommended agronomic management practices a small value of Î» represents a farmer that is more sensitive to soil water deficit and will irrigation crops before actual depletion exceeds d mad whereas a large value of Î» represents a farmer that will delay irrigation until after depletion exceeds d mad miro 2012 noÃ«l and cai 2017 considering the effects of Î» the irrigation decision of a farmer is represented by eq 4 4 irrigation yes if d c Î» d mad no if d c Î» d mad bidding behaviors describe how an agent makes bids to sell or buy water permits in a marketplace which is assumed to be a sealed bid double auction market in this study loy et al 2014 an agent s bid Ï† i d r p q consists of four variables 1 the agent s unique index id 2 the agent s role in the water market r which is a categorical variable indicating if the agent is a seller r s or a buyer r b in the auction 3 bid price p acre feet representing the agent s willingness to pay for buyers or willingness to accept for sellers for each unit of water permits and this value can be affected by the marginal value of water permits and the agent s bidding strategies and 4 bid amount q acre feet representing the amount of water permits the agent seeks to trade in the current auction round in agricultural systems the marginal benefit of irrigation affects farmers reservation price in an auction market i e the upper bound price for buying water or lower bound price for selling water which is dependent on some agronomic and economic factors such as crop type crop price crop growth stage yield response factors and soil properties therefore farmers reservation prices may vary across farmers and vary over time in this study farmers bidding strategies are represented by the behavioral rules of the zero intelligence plus zip agents which has been widely used to simulate agents bidding behaviors in various types of double auction markets cliff and bruten 1997 gonzales and ajami 2019 luca and cliff 2011 pourebrahimi et al 2008 vytelingum et al 2008 let Î¾ i t denote the agent i s reservation price at time t his bid price can be represented by eq 5 5 p i t 1 Î¼ i t Î¾ i t for buyer 0 Î¼ i t 1 1 Î¼ i t Î¾ i t for seller Î¼ i t 0 where Î¼ i t is a behavioral parameter that represents the percentage of profit that the agent aims to obtain for the transaction agents with a larger Î¼ seek to obtain more profit from trade than those with a smaller Î¼ e g a seller with a larger Î¼ will bid a higher price than those with a smaller Î¼ given that an agent s bid may result in a successful or failure transaction its degree of rent seeking Î¼ will change over time based on its past trade experiences for example if a seller s bid did not result in a successful transaction in the past auction round i e indicating that the seller has bid a higher price in the market it may consider to bid a lower price in the next round i e reducing the value of Î¼ to increase the chance of reaching a successful transaction and vice versa it can be seen that Î¼ is a time varying variable representing an agent s update of its greediness in profit seeking based on its past trade experiences after an agent decides to update its degree of rent seeking Î¼ the change rate is affected by the agent s learning rate coefficient Î² as shown in eq 6 6 Î¼ i t 1 Î¼ i t Î² i Ï„ t p i t Î¾ i t where Ï„ t is the price signal obtained from the water market which can be set as the average transaction price released by the water market at time t Î² is a behavioral parameter measuring the extent to which the agent is willing to change its degree of rent seeking agents with a larger Î² changes its degree of rent seeking by a greater value than those with a smaller Î² note that Î² is a static behavioral parameter representing an agent s individual learning capability however the value of Î² may vary from one agent to another in the system due to their behavioral heterogeneity previous studies have shown that the bidding behaviors Î¼ and Î² can reasonably represent market participants empirical bidding behaviors in a double auction market cliff and bruten 1997 das et al 2001 for more introduction of the two behavioral parameters and their applications in market simulation see vytelingum et al 2008 du et al 2017 and gonzales ajami 2019 2 3 mechanism of the bid matching processes in the water market after all of the agents submit their bids to the market which are private to each other the auction center will match these bids and implement their transactions here we employ the discriminatory price double auction as the market mechanism in which the transaction prices are dependent on each pair of the two winning bidders nyborg and strebulaev 2004 in other words transaction prices in the discriminatory auction could differ between agents depending on their bidding strategies and behaviors the advantage of such an auction mechanism compared with the optimization based market simulation is that it does not require the market to obtain the agents private held valuation of the goods preferences and or beliefs nicolaisen et al 2001 the procedure of the bid matching processes is described as follows fig 3 shows an illustrative example of how agents bids are matched to derive water permit transactions first sellers and buyers are sorted in ascending and descending orders respectively according to their bid prices then each agent s feasible trading partners can be determined with the sorted bid list for a seller buyer i with bid price p i his feasible trading partners are all of the buyers sellers whose bid prices are higher lower than p i for example in the market transaction case of fig 3 agent 01 s feasible trading partners are agent 03 and agent 04 next the seller with the lowest bid price will be matched with the buyer with the highest bid price e g agent 01 and agent 03 are firstly matched the two bids will result in a transaction if the buyer s bid price is higher than the seller s bid price the transaction price is set as the average of the two prices and the amount of transacted water permits is the smaller one of the two bid amounts e g the transaction price and transaction amount are 18 5 acre feet and 5 acre feet respectively for the trade between agent 01 and agent 03 if the two bid amounts are not equal the one whose bid amounts are not fully met will be matched with the second best bid among his feasible trading partners e g agent 01 will sell 4 acre feet water permits to agent 04 with transaction price of 17 5 acre feet the matching processes will continue until the highest bid price for buyers is lower than the lowest bid price for sellers in the auction list for a more detailed introduction to the matching processes see nguyen et al 2013 after the market center matches the agents bids and implements their transactions for each auction round the transaction prices for water permits are released to the public as the water price signal based on that the agents can update their bidding prices in the next auction round in the water market an agent can sell its available water permits i e total water permits minus total water withdrawals to others through the market when its irrigation demand has been satisfied however we assume that an agent can buy water permits only when its current water permits cannot satisfy its irrigation demand i e farmers are not allowed to buy water permits more than their own irrigation demand note that there could be instances in which sellers water supply does not meet buyers water demand in the market due to the disparity in the price and or the amount of their bids under such circumstances agents will adjust their bids in the next round to fulfill the unmet transactions for example if an agent is not able to buy sufficient water permits to meet its irrigation demand in the current round it will increase its bid price in the next round to increase the chance of realizing successful transactions 2 4 development of the abm framework we develop the abm framework using the objective oriented programming language java the design of the abm follows the standard overview design concepts details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 detailed description of the odd protocol is provided in the supporting information of this paper the abm consists of three major components that have each been described in turn in the previous sections 1 the water permit allocation module 2 the crop growth module and 3 the water market module the water permit allocation module distributes the basin level total water permits to farmers represented by agents based on a given level of allocation inequality measured by the gini coefficient the crop growth module incorporates the key functions in the aquacrop crop model developed by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model simulates soil moisture water demand and crop production as a response to diverse environmental agronomic hydrological and management e g irrigation conditions if water permits are insufficient to meet irrigation demand we assume that farmers will reduce per area irrigation intensity on farmlands the deficit irrigation will lead to a decrease in crop evapotranspiration compared to that without a water stress at the end of crop growing season actual crop yield is obtained by a crop water production function that compares actual evapotranspiration and the maximum evapotranspiration without a water stress which is a widely adopted approach to calculating crop production for deficit irrigation allen et al 2005 foster and brozoviÄ‡ 2018 steduto et al 2009 wang and cai 2009 it is noteworthy that farms at different locations experience varied hydrogeological and meteorological conditions e g soil type precipitation evapotranspiration in this study we also consider the heterogeneity in farmers irrigation decisions reflected by their sensitivity to soil water deficit leading to various irrigation practices among farmers therefore the water use crop yield relationship will differ from location to location and from farmer to farmer fig 4 presents the flowchart of model running processes the model starts with selecting the scenario for farmers behavioral parameters and the gini coefficient for water permit allocation these parameters will be used to construct the farmer agents then at each time step i e daily in this study the crop module calculates each agent s irrigation demand and agent will make a bidding decision to buy or sell water permits based on his available water permits and irrigation demand e g an agent will need to buy water permits if his remainder water permits are not sufficient to satisfy irrigation demand after collecting all the agents bids the water market calculates the transaction results for each agent the market level average water price is sent to the public as the water price signal for the next auction round at the end of the crop growth season the model returns crop production for each agent and calculate basin level total crop production 3 case study and scenario design 3 1 case study site and data collection we apply the model to the guadalupe river basin grb a small watershed in southern texas with the total area of approximate 1 5 104 km2 fig 5 a the guadalupe river the main river in the basin flows from the kerr county in the northwest to san antonio bay in the southeast and drains into the gulf of mexico irrigation is one of the largest water consumers in the grb over the past decades agricultural development has resulted in reduced base flow and water pollution in the guadalupe river and its tributaries which has become a major environmental concern for the watershed arismendez et al 2009 water resources in the grb are owned by the state and the state grants the right to use water to various stakeholders e g farmers cities and industries garcia et al 2009 following the local water right system farmers are issued a fixed amount of water permits from texas commission on environmental quality tceq a government agency that manages water resources in the watershed fig 5b plots the per area water permits for the 334 active agricultural water right holders in the basin it can be seen that water permits are not equally allocated among farmers with the gini coefficient of the water allocation equal to 0 31 see the supporting information for the derivation of the gini coefficient water scarcity is a common challenge for farmers during droughts especially for those with fewer water permits and or large irrigation water demands in this study we simulate a water market based on the double auction to evaluate how farmers behaviors and the inequality of water permit allocation jointly affect market performances such a market is not currently a formal part of management processes but our interactions with stakeholders in the basin highlight interest amongst users in the ability to trade water rights the grb thus represents an ideal test case for our simulation framework to evaluate the performance of a double auction water market prior to its actual implementation in the region we collect data from various sources to implement the model data for the 334 active agricultural water right holders corresponding to 334 agents in our model are collected from the tceq database including each farmer s cropland area and allocated water permits https

3 2 model comparison and scenario design in order to assess the market performance under the influence of water allocation and agent behaviors the modeling results of the proposed abm based water market referred to as model a in the following sections of this paper are compared with 1 a baseline model referred to as model b1 and 2 a benchmark model referred to as model b2 the baseline model b1 simulates the case without an agricultural water market for water trading agents are only allowed to use their entitled water permits to irrigate crop the benchmark model b2 simulates an optimal water market in which agents bid decisions could result in perfect market efficiency this model adopts a centralized optimization approach for water trading so that the water market can automatically enable available water permits to be used by the cropland with the highest crop productivity followed by the ones with relatively lower productivity it is expected that model b2 will yield more crop production than model a while model b1 will yield the least crop production two sets of experiments are designed to assess the joint impacts of water permit allocation and farmer s behaviors on the water market table 1 the first experiment sets the gini coefficient of water permit allocation g as 0 31 to mimic the current distribution of water permits within the grb the three behavioral parameters are varied from 0 4 to 1 8 for agents sensitivity to soil water deficit Î» irrigation behavior from 0 to 0 8 for degree of rent seeking Î» and from 0 to 0 6 for learning rate coefficient Î² bidding behaviors our hypothesis is that market performance in model a is constrained by agents behavioral parameters and cannot achieve the level of the optimization based model b2 the second experiment aims to understand the joint impacts of the inequality of water permit allocation and agent behaviors the gini coefficient g is varied from 0 1 to 0 8 representing different levels of water allocation inequality our hypothesis is that when water permits become more unequally allocated the potential performance of the water market i e obtained by model b2 will increase however we expect that the actual market performance i e obtained by model a will be constrained by farmers bidding behaviors which do not guarantee perfect market efficiency without sufficient empirical knowledge about the distribution of farmers behavioral parameters in the study site we apply a scenario based approach to assessing the joint impacts of farmers behaviors and water permit allocation on the water market as illustrated in table 1 we use the gaussian distribution for each scenario to generate a set of behavioral parameters and randomly assign them to the agents in the system the coefficient of variation in the gaussian distribution is used to represent agents behavioral heterogeneity this can introduce certain level of randomness to the modeling results following the concept of the monte carlo approach decker 1991 we run the model 100 times the number to ensure output stabilization in this study to obtain the average modeling results for each scenario here we use 1 the basin level total crop production tcp bushel 2 the increased crop production achieved by a water market by comparing the scenario with and without the water market icp bushel and 3 total traded water permits in the market ttw acre feet to measure water market performance note that water markets distributional impacts among farmers can also be insightful and important hadjigeorgalis 2008a khan and brown 2019 but such analyses are beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in our future work 4 results this section presents the modeling results first section 4 1 compares the water market performance for the three models under the influence of farmers behaviors based on experiment 1 next the results in experiment 2 investigate the impacts of water permit allocation on the water market performance section 4 2 finally sections 4 3 and 4 4 explore the joint impacts of farmers behaviors and water permit allocation under various hydrological conditions 4 1 overview of the water market performance for the three models we summarize the result of the total crop production tcp during the simulation period from 2001 to 2013 for the three models i e model a for the abm based water market model b1 without a water market and model b2 for the optimization based water market the result shows that tcp for model a is higher than model b1 and lower than model b2 for all of the simulation years fig 6 a this concurs with our hypothesis that a water market can increase system level crop production compared with the scenario without a water market but the market performance can be constrained by agents bidding behaviors which do not necessarily ensure perfect market efficiency these results are consistent with our prior work du et al 2017 and therefore demonstrate that the proposed power law method to allocate water permits can reflect the role of farmers behaviors and the overall market performance a detailed sensitivity analysis of the impacts of agents behaviors on market performance is presented in the supporting information of this paper comparing fig 6a b we can see that the water market has greater potential to increase tcp when the weather is drier the difference of tcp between model a and model b1 is higher in 2011 a dry year than that in 2010 a normal year therefore it could be more beneficial to implement a water market in arid areas during dry seasons in which farmers typically face severe water scarcity issues this concurs with the argument that scarcity is the primary driving force for implementing a water market bjornlund 2003 4 2 impacts of water permit allocation on water market performance experiment 2 explores the influence of water permit allocation on the performance of the water market fig 7 a compares tcp among the three model formulations it is shown that tcp decreases when the gini coefficient g increases if a water market is not available model b1 in comparison a water market allows agents who are entitled to more water permits to sell part of their permits to those with water scarcity resulting in an increase in tcp i e the black dots of model a the tcp does not change with g when the water market is perfectly efficient for trading water permits model b2 as we can see when the gini coefficient for water permit allocation is set as zero the crop productions from the three models are similar this is because under the condition of perfectly equal water permit allocation the agents will obtain an equal share of water permits i e 1 05 feet per acre which is more than the average irrigation water demand i e around 0 89 foot under the climate condition of year 2010 therefore agents are not expected to experience water scarcity if water permits are equally allocated as a result the total crop productions from the three models are all maintained at a high level without water scarcity when the gini coefficient is zero fig 7b shows that the water market performance icp for model a increases with the gini coefficient g and the relationship between icp and g is nonlinear for example icp increases dramatically with g when g is smaller than 0 5 however only a slight increase in icp is observed when g becomes larger than 0 5 note that when the gini coefficient is 0 6 the declining trend of crop production for model b1 is less dramatic which leads to a less significant increase of icp however the declining trends of the total crop production responding to increasing inequality in water permit allocation are consistent for the two models i e a and b1 the nonlinear relationship between g and icp suggests that the actual performance of the water market is constrained by farmers bidding behaviors to a greater extent when the inequality level of water permit allocation is higher this implies that when water permits are more unequally distributed water market institution needs to encourage farmers to optimize their bidding behaviors by for example submitting more competitive bids e g consider lower degree of rent seeking and higher level of learning rate in order to result in successful transactions while fig 7b focuses on the marker performance of model a fig 7c evaluates the relative market performance that measures the extent to which model a can achieve optimal market performance of model b2 i e icp for model a compared with icp for model b2 the results show that the relative market performance is higher when the inequality of water permit allocation is at a moderate level i e the gini coefficient g is between 0 3 and 0 5 the difference between the market performance for model a and model b2 can be explained by the assumption of the perfectly efficient market in model b2 that enables market performance to be maximized elbakidze et al 2018 however in the real world the lack of market information and agents non perfect rationality partially due to the fact that agents reservation prices and preferences are held privately can affect their bidding decisions a competitive agent may offer a bid price that fails to result in transactions therefore the maximum performance of water markets can rarely be achieved when these factors are considered our modeling results concur with the concerns and empirical observations of some poorly performed water markets in the real world bitran et al 2014 kaufman 2012 li et al 2011 matthews 2004 4 3 the joint impacts of water permit allocation and bidding behaviors while the above sections overview the role of farmers bidding behaviors section 4 1 and water permit allocation section 4 2 separately this section explicitly examines their joint impacts on market performance fig 8 shows that the joint impacts of water permit allocation and farmers bidding behaviors on market performance are complex and non linear the basin level total crop production tcp is higher when the gini coefficient of water allocation g is smaller the degree of rent seeking Î¼ is smaller and the learning rate coefficient Î² is larger the amount of total traded water permits ttw is smaller when the gini coefficient of water allocation g is smaller more importantly it is found that the role of farmers bidding behaviors i e Î¼ and Î² in the water market is intensified when water permits are more unequally distributed for example tcp is maintained at a relatively high level regardless of the values of Î¼ and Î² when g is small however the influences of Î¼ and Î² on tcp become more significant when g becomes larger these results emphasize the complex and non linear influence of water allocation and agent behaviors as well as their joint impacts on the water market importantly we show that influence of one particular parameter on modeling results highly depends on the settings of other parameters it can also be seen that the inequality of water allocation determines the potential performance of the water market whereas agents bidding behaviors determine the extent to which the actual market performance can be obtained the above sections have focused on agents bidding behaviors here we explore the role of 1 farmers irrigation behavior i e sensitivity to soil water deficit Î» and 2 hydrological condition in the water market fig 9 fig 9a shows that tcp is smaller when Î» is larger in particular the reduced tcp caused by increasing Î» e g from 0 6 to 1 4 becomes smaller when g is larger for example when g is 0 1 tcp decreases from 2 78 million bushel to 2 51 million bushel a reduction of 0 27 million bushel as Î» increases from 0 6 to 1 4 in comparison when g is 0 8 tcp decreases from 2 31 million bushel to 2 12 million bushel a reduction of 0 19 million bushel for the same change of Î» the results suggest that when water permits are more equally allocated the potential benefits of implementing the water market are more limited but improvement of irrigation scheduling could still increase crop production fig 9b emphasizes the role of hydrological conditions in market performance it shows that the influence of farmers bidding behaviors and initial water permit allocation on the water market is more noticeable in dry years e g 2011 than in wet years e g 2007 the reason for these differences is that in wet years farmers irrigation demand can be satisfied mostly through precipitation resulting in lower demand for water permits and less participation in the water market in contrast in dry years farmers rely on irrigation to meet a significant proportion of crop water needs this increases demand for trades from farmers with fewer permits and stimulates greater trading in the market conditional on the influence of initial water permit allocations and the heterogeneity in farmers behaviors 4 4 emerging interplay patterns of multiple influencing factors in the water market this section combines 1 water permit allocation g 2 irrigation behavior Î» and 3 bidding behavior Î² to investigate their joint impacts on the water market as shown in fig 10 the key finding in fig 10 is that among the three modeling parameters the impact of one particular parameter on the modeling results highly depends on the joint setting of other parameters the interplay of the three parameters exhibits three emerging patterns which will be discussed in turn below the first pattern is that changing the value of one parameter affects the potential performance of the water market i e the maximum value of tcp but does not change the sensitive parameters in the system note that here we refer to a parameter as a sensitive one if the modeling results change dramatically when the value of this parameter changes this pattern applies for the role of farmers sensitivity to soil dryness Î» and the interplay between farmers learning rate coefficient Î² and the inequality of water permit allocation g fig 10a c for example both Î² and g are sensitive parameters that affect tcp regardless of the value of Î» however the maximum value of tcp increases when farmers are more sensitive to soil dryness i e when Î» is smaller the second pattern is that changing the value of one parameter will not affect the potential performance of the water market nor will it change the sensitive parameters in the system this pattern applies for the role of Î² and the interplay between Î» and g fig 10d f the maximum value of tcp does not change as farmers learning rate coefficient Î² changes furthermore both Î» and g are sensitive parameters in the system regardless the value of Î² the third pattern is that changing the value of one parameter not only affects the potential performance of the water market but also changes the sensitive parameters in the system this pattern applies for the role of g and the interplay between Î» and Î² fig 10g i when water permits are more equally allocated i e when g is small the maximum value of tcp is larger and farmers sensitivity to soil dryness Î» is a sensitive parameter in the system but farmers learning rate coefficient Î² is not however as water permits become more unequally allocated i e when g becomes larger the maximum value of tcp decreases and farmers learning rate coefficient becomes a sensitive parameter in the system understanding the complex interplay of the three parameters can provide some policy implications to improve water market performance which will be discussed in the next section 5 discussion 5 1 model implications for future market modeling efforts the modeling results in this study could provide several modeling implications to future research efforts on simulating agricultural water markets in this study by incorporating a water allocation module and farmers behavior parameters we show that the water market performance is between the scenario without a water market i e model b1 and the scenario of the optimization based water market i e model b2 the actual market performance could vary dramatically depending on the joint settings of agent behaviors and the inequality of water permit allocation this finding implies that the optimization based approach is able to reflect the maximum benefit a market can generate but could probably over estimate the actual benefits of the water market if some empirical institutional and behavioral factors of market participants are not fully incorporated in the model therefore in order to draw more robust and practical conclusions about the benefits of a water market future research efforts need to re examine the assumptions behind the optimization approach in particular it is necessary to consider farmers behavioral characteristics and personal preferences that could affect their water trading decisions in markets the cross model comparison of different modeling approaches such as the one presented in this study might lead to a more conservative and more realistic assessment of the actual market performance in the real world furthermore using an abm rather than a traditional optimization model to simulate a water market suggests that basin managers should take a bottom up approach to assessing possible water market benefits considering the role played by individual farmers regarding their behaviors and responses in the water market policy makers can design effective market institutions to improve market performances by promoting farmers behavioral changes for example given that farmers degree of rent seeking and learning rate coefficient play an essential role in market performances water market center can provide more transparent transaction information to market participants based on that agents can response to market condition and adjust their bidding strategies to increase market transactions under the condition of low transactions policies can also be designed to encourage farmers to be more conservative i e choosing a smaller degree of rent seeking when making bids in the water market 5 2 policy implications for improving water market performance the modeling results in this study also have implications for the design and assessment of market based mechanisms for water management in irrigation dependent regions the modeling results in this study show that the total crop production is higher when 1 farmers are more sensitive to soil dryness i e Î» is smaller and 2 agents bidding prices are closer to their reservation prices i e Î¼ is smaller and or Î² is larger 3 water permits are more equally allocated among agents i e g is smaller this conclusion is based on the modeling results for market conditions in our study area a small watershed where farmers have a similar crop planting pattern and water productivity if farmers have significantly different water productivity levels in an agricultural system a more equal water permit allocation does not necessarily lead to an increase in their total crop production farmers with greater water productivity could be allocated with more amount of water permits if the water management goal is to increase the system level crop production future studies can explicitly assess the role played by the heterogeneity in farmers water productivity and the inequality of water permit allocation in water market performances the results regarding the role of water allocation and farmer behaviors in the water market provide important policy implications to increase crop production in agricultural systems for example to improve farmers irrigation behavior Î» an agricultural consulting program e g crop adviser could be helpful to educate farmers to be more sensitive to soil dryness and irrigate crops before crop soil moisture falls below the water deficit threshold eanes et al 2019 on the other hand from a technology development perspective equipping an agricultural system with soil moisture monitoring sensors could help farmers to better assess soil dryness and to perform a more timely irrigation scheduling ozdogan et al 2010 the complex interplay between farmers behaviors and water permit allocation could also contribute to the analysis of their comparative advantages when multiple policies for improving water market performance are available for example besides improving farmers irrigation behavior i e to decrease Î» as discussed above our modeling results show that allocating water permits more equally i e to decrease g can increase total crop production e g fig 7a therefore it becomes critically important for policy makers to assess which one of the two programs can yield more benefits fig 11 provides a quantitative evaluation framework that compares the benefits of 1 crop advisory program to change farmers irrigation behaviors and 2 water allocation program to reallocate water permits which is more on institutional change it shows that the optimal policy choice highly depends on the joint setting of Î» and g under the condition of 1 low inequality of water allocation g 0 2 and 2 farmers less sensitive to soil dryness Î» 1 4 as indicated by point a in fig 11 setting up the crop advisory program to change farmers irrigation behaviors i e from point a to point a1 can yield more benefits than promoting a water allocation program to redistribute water permits i e from point a to point a2 however an institutional change to redistribute water permits could yield more benefits than the crop advisory program under the condition of 1 high inequality of water allocation and 2 farmers more sensitive attitude to soil dryness as indicated by the point b in fig 11 5 3 model limitations and future directions it is important to discuss the model limitations and future directions of this study as the abm presented here is subject to some model assumptions due to data incompleteness and the scope of this work firstly in this study we apply the power law function to approximate the shape of the lorenz curve and to allocate water permits however other types of functions e g the polynomial function the pareto distribution function or hybrid functions that combine multiple functions may also be feasible options for the curve approximation jantzen and volpert 2012 future work can compare multiple types of approximation functions for the analysis secondly the water market presented in this study does not consider some social institutional and physical factors that may affect water trading for example engineering infrastructures e g channel system for delivering water information platform for sharing and exchanging market information are essential for operating a water market however in this study we simply assume that these engineering infrastructures and information hub are available which might not be true for some regions farmers behaviors in agricultural systems could also be affected by wider social and economic factors these include but are not limited to farmers household income family size budget constraint risk attitude towards the uncertainties in future climate land area access to information or extensive advice and the behaviors of the neighboring farmers barnes et al 2013 hadjigeorgalis 2008a malawska and topping 2016 tadesse and bahiigwa 2015 van duinen et al 2016 future work could include a social module that specifically accounts for these additional components in farmers decision making and enhance the abm framework s capability to represent more comprehensive and more realistic relationships between water permit allocation the relevant socioeconomic factors and farmers behavioral changes thirdly this study mainly focuses on water as the limiting factor to crop yield in the crop model under a water limited crop management condition allen et al 1998 foster et al 2017 it is noteworthy that other factors such as fertilizer pesticide and biotechnology can also affect crop yield which may in turn affect agricultural water use and market performance in particular this study has not considered farmers alternative agricultural management practices when a water market is available such as fallowing the land to make profits by selling water permits to other farmers in the system adjusting the size of crop area based on changing weather conditions and reducing irrigation area instead of per area irrigation intensity when water permits are insufficient to meet irrigation demand hadjigeorgalis 2008a future work can incorporate these factors in the model to simulate more flexible and more realistic farmer behaviors in the water market lastly the abm in this study has not been coupled with a hydrological model and therefore we do not explore how trade between two agents may alter distributions of water use across the basin in particular our model does not consider the potential for trading to exacerbate local externalities of agricultural water abstractions for example through concentrating pumping in specific locations or through increased consumptive use of water future work needs to couple the presented abm with a groundwater model and or a river routing model to assess the third party effects of the water market these future works can make this study more comprehensive it is noteworthy that water permits in many river basins have been allocated under historical compacts many decades ago altering these established water permit allocations by imposing a reallocation of rights would be a complex and political challenging issue the specific legal institutional economic and geopolitical efforts that are needed to achieve successful reallocation of initial water permits might vary from region to region and from time to time which are beyond the scope of this study instead this study focuses on evaluating market performances conditional on a fixed baseline allocation of water permits with differing levels of inequality to reflect the differences in the equity of historical permit allocation observed in the real world 6 conclusions this study focuses on exploring the role of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors in agricultural water markets we propose an agent based modeling framework that incorporates 1 a water allocation module that adopts a power law method to distribute water permits with a given level of inequality and 2 farmers irrigation and bidding behaviors in an agricultural water market based on a double auction we also develop a baseline model representing the scenario without a water market and a benchmark model representing a water market with perfect efficiency for model comparison we apply the models to the guadalupe river basin a small river basin in southern texas to assess the performance of the water market under the joint impacts of the inequality of water permit allocation farmers behaviors and hydrological conditions we find the benefits of the water market i e represented by the maximum crop production that can be achieved by the water market is jointly determined by the inequality of water permit allocation farmers sensitivity to soil dryness and hydrological conditions farmers bidding behaviors determine the extent to which the market benefits can be realized the water market can increase more crop production when 1 water permits are unequally allocated 2 farmers are more sensitive to soil dryness and 3 farmers bid their true valuations of water permits the modeling framework can be applied to assess the comparative advantages of different policies that aim to increase water market performance for example we show that the change of farmers irrigation behavior through agricultural advisory programs could yield more increase in crop production than the change of water permit allocation through institutional development when water permits are allocated in a relatively equal manner and farmers are not sufficiently sensitive to soil dryness in contrast changing water permit allocation is shown to be more beneficial than changing farmers irrigation behavior when water permits are unequally allocated and farmers are sensitive to soil dryness these results have emphasized the importance of a holistic examination of the complex interplay of these influencing factors when designing water market policies this study still has some limitations that need to be addressed recommended future work includes incorporating some institutional and physical constraints in the water market coupling the current modeling framework with a hydrological model for the analysis of market externalities and third party effects and incorporating more agent behaviors and decision processes that may affect water market performance we envision that these improvements can better assess the role of water permit allocation and farmers behaviors in water markets and provide more useful modeling and policy implications to improve market

4441,recurring drought in the lower mekong countries has inflicted enormous pressure on the natural ecosystem rice productivity and water resources a regional scale assessment over cambodia was carried out to examine the linkages between rice productivity and meteorological hydrologic drought variability from 2000 to 2016 we implemented a comprehensive drought and crop yield information system the regional hydrologic extremes assessment system rheas framework that couples a hydrologic model with a crop growth model to capture the subtle intrinsic nature of drought and assess the impact on inter seasonal and intra annual rice yields simulations based on rheas show good agreement with observations r2 0 65 for soil moisture from the hydrologic model r2 0 84 for crop model using a suite of standardized drought indices the onset and prevalence of dry and wet periods throughout the study period were examined at multiple temporal scales the temporal variability in drought intensity exhibited higher water stress during the initial months mar may indicating prevalence of medium to severe dry conditions prior to the planting season however the onset of monsoon at the beginning of the growing season june resulted in the prevalence of normal to moderate wet conditions a linear trend analysis for the period 2000 2016 showed a consistent increase 2900 kg ha in 2000 to 3550 kg ha in 2016 in rice yields although drought stricken provinces showed lower yields 1650 kg ha throughout the study period overall a continuous increase in annual rice yields irrespective of the stress conditions was noted with no clear pattern linking drought parameters with crop yields on a regional scale the application of chemical based fertilizers has steadily increased over the years since 2008 and the consistent increase in observed rice yields correlated with increased fertilizer use r2 0 84 information from the hydrologic and crop model components within rheas enables

yield crop model 1 introduction among all the natural hazards drought is by far the most expensive complex and uncertain weather related disaster worldwide resulting in large annual socio economic losses pandey et al 2007 often characterized by a prolonged deficit of precipitation and long periods of abnormally dry conditions there is no universally accepted definition of drought van loon et al 2016a droughts originate from a range of hydrometeorological processes that reflect the long term imbalance between water supply and water demand due to their high variability both spatially and temporally the effects of drought can be localized thus making its characterization complex and uncertain recurring droughts have crippled countries throughout the course of human history having profound impacts on agriculture food security water resources human livelihood and the natural ecosystem wilhite 2000 numerous studies have attributed the severity duration location and timing of droughts to regional and global scale processes in the united states andreadis et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 india aadhar and mishra 2017 amazon duffy et al 2015 wongchuig correa et al 2017 europe grillakis 2019 africa gebremeskel haile et al 2019 sheffield et al 2014 china zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2016 and have well documented the variability and the nature of drought from these studies it is obvious that the frequency and intensity of droughts have arguably increased over the years and exacerbated due to other adversely influencing factors dai 2013 van loon et al 2016b such as population growth rapid urbanization land use changes and altering precipitation regimes these factors along with the impacts of climate change have inflicted enormous pressure on many countries thus raising serious concerns pertaining to food and water security godfray et al 2010 the over reliance on water resources attributed to agriculture has heavily weighed on the water budget mishra and singh 2010 diminishing natural resources shrinking croplands frequent exposure to extreme events drought floods etc expansion of agricultural systems and energy power sectors have further aggravated the situation ultimately resulting in seasonal water shortages thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 such changes are distinctly evident in the southern stretches of the mekong basin wherein the mekong countries have been vulnerable to the negative consequences of climate change thus posing risks for agricultural systems and human livelihoods the mekong river is imperative to the region both environmentally and economically mrc 2014 however the recent infrastructure e g hydropower and irrigation developments in the upstream mekong have changed the magnitude and seasonality of flow hoang et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2018 especially in the lower stretches of the basin near tonle sap lake cambodia in addition extreme drought events in the past decades notably in 1997 98 2003 05 ipcc 2007 and late 2015 2016 guo et al 2017 son et al 2012 had significant impact on the agricultural sector leading to huge crop losses and lower agricultural productivity despite the increased vulnerability of agriculture to droughts the impacts have been somewhat overlooked and arguably less understood compared to floods kim et al 2019 nearly 70 percent of the population is actively engaged in agricultural activities in the lower mekong basin lmb region most of the agricultural systems in the region are rain fed thus making them vulnerable to the risks and uncertainties associated with seasonality johnston et al 2012 mrc 2003 as there are no alternative sources of income other than agriculture the crop losses associated with seasonality take a huge toll on the livelihoods of the lower income and other marginalized groups mrc 2014 rice being the principal crop is particularly sensitive to climate and has been negatively impacted by climatic change mainuddin et al 2013 the low lying areas near tonle sap lake and the deltaic regions of vietnam are highly vulnerable to these physical shocks with the increasing demand for rice production reaching an expected estimate of 3720 kg ha and 6530 kg ha respectively for cambodia and vietnam by 2025 mrc 2014 there is an acute need of minimizing the risks associated with seasonal extremities and simultaneously improving the agricultural yields there is increasing recognition of the need for both a regional and a national perspective on drought risk management interventions to reduce the vulnerability of affected communities adb 2009 hence there is a compelling need to monitor current hydrologic conditions drought status and crop yield estimates and make those data available to stakeholders on a regular basis this information pertaining to inter seasonal intra annual hydrologic drought and rice yield indicators and forecasts will facilitate risk management and planning for decision makers despite the advent of numerous drought monitoring tools such as the united states drought monitor svoboda et al 2002 and the global drought early warning monitoring framework gdewf pozzi et al 2013 the accurate assessment and prediction of drought characteristics still proves challenging inconsistent records and poor quality of spatial coverage data from ground based observational networks has long been a primary reason hindering long term hydro agricultural studies however recent advances in dynamic modeling and the use of satellite based observations have created the potential for operational drought monitoring klisch and atzberger 2016 the introduction of targeted drought indicators in modeling frameworks has not only improved the existing monitoring techniques and capabilities but facilitated insightful information on early warning preventive measures and mitigation strategies hence using a suite of single multivariate remote sensing based indices or data the numerical representation of drought characteristics from a range of extensive hydroclimatic conditions provides useful information on the overall qualitative state of drought hao et al 2015 oftentimes there exists a gap between science applications and end users resulting in the partial implementation of effective adaptation strategies andreadis et al 2017 this fundamental disconnect is distinct within the agriculture sector so bridging the gap will be helpful in facilitating better decision making though many software frameworks have explored the integration of modeling systems the internal representation of datasets has always proven to be challenging often resulting in compatibility issues within the constituent models beran and piasecki 2009 a novel aspect of this study involves the application of the recently developed end to end information system regional hydrologic extremes assessment system rheas andreadis et al 2017 that couples physically based hydrologic and crop models and uses data assimilation primarily using remote sensing observations and projections to provide nowcasts and seasonal forecasts 3 6 months in advance of yield estimates and associated drought indicators while the previous study did not include any model validation region specific information etc this study incorporates site specific information and sufficient validation against observations for effective drought and yield nowcasting another novel aspect of this work is the investigation of the potential impact of growing season drought states on rice yields this information is especially important for local governments stakeholders for facilitating decision making here we integrate readily available observations of meteorological e g precipitation and hydrologic variables e g soil moisture via a coupled hydro agricultural model offered by the rheas framework to identify changes in drought conditions and their impact on rice production in the lower mekong region despite the availability of the rheas implementation over the entire lmb we opted to focus our analysis on cambodia as its economy is especially reliant on agriculture and droughts adversely affect both livelihoods and food security our primary objective in this study was to assess the spatiotemporal evolution of drought and rice yields over cambodia and to investigate the potential impacts of drought on interannual variability of rice yields using a suite of hydrologic datasets we analyzed the derived model simulations e g soil moisture yield etc with remote sensing products and other observations the approach and results described here are expected to improve our understanding of the environmental conditions and hydrology related to crop yields by providing a quantitative historical perspective to support and improve decision making processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in southeast asia the transboundary mekong river has an estimated length of 4 350 km with a mean annual discharge of approximately 475 km3 making it the tenth largest river in the world in terms of mean annual flow at its mouth liu et al 2007 depending on the location of the river the landscape and climate range from hilly mountainous terrains 4500 m elevation of lao to the low level deltaic plains of vietnam rising from high mountain ranges the river flows through deep narrow gorges traverses through floodplains for 2600 km before entering the south china sea via a wide delta draining an area of 810 000 km2 mrc 2014 lauri et al 2014 the mekong river basin is typically portioned into the upper basin and the lower basin the lmb covers about 77 606 000 km2 of the basin and is important both environmentally and economically the lmb consisting of the four riparian countries cambodia lao pdr thailand and viet nam covers an approximate area of 618 783 km2 fig 1 the region has a typical monsoon climate having two distinct seasons i wet southwest monsoon may oct and ii dry northeast monsoon nov apr with annual precipitation between 1200 and 2500 mm year respectively the region receives 85 of the annual precipitation in the wet season with the dry season bearing minimal precipitation kite 2001 temperature and evaporation rates throughout the basin vary with elevation typically ranging between 22 and 28 c and 1 000 2 000 mm year respectively the river flows through extensive wetland habitats supporting productive ecosystems particularly the tonle sap lake in cambodia the lake and its surrounding floodplains in the heart of cambodia play an important role in inducing a seasonal change in the direction of the flow in the river this seasonality greatly influences the floodplains and the agricultural productivity downstream lower provinces of cambodia and the mekong delta the tonle sap floodplains and the delta host a population of 35 million and account for more than 90 percent of paddy plantation mrc 2014 as shown in fig 1b the majority of the agricultural activities and wetland ecosystems in cambodia are concentrated along the tonle sap lake and the southeastern provinces although substantial improvements have been made within the agriculture sector large discrepancies in mechanization irrigation capacity etc have limited the production capacity of cambodia behind its neighboring countries mainuddin et al 2013 2 2 model description rheas was developed at the jet propulsion laboratory nasa jpl and has been implemented at the nasa servir hubs at the regional centre for mapping of resources for development rcmrd in nairobi and asian disaster preparedness center adpc in bangkok and covers regions over east africa and the lower mekong region at a spatial resolution of 25 km and 5 km over a limited coverage area for different water resources applications andreadis et al 2017 rheas integrates multiple remote sensing products across different components of the terrestrial water cycle to effectively monitor water stress as indicated by the drought status the main component of the rheas architecture hosts a spatially enabled relational postgis database that ingests a suite of earth science products model datasets and satellite observations that provide a range of hydrologic and agricultural variables postgis an extension to postgresql database uses and extends the sql language combined with other features and allows the functionality of querying and managing spatial geometries rheas follows a hybrid approach that allows the seamless coupling of the constituent models thus making its design distinct and unique from other information systems such design of combining modular and object oriented programming has several advantages i better transferability of data across models ii system modularity since all the models incorporated within the framework must interface with the postgis database and not the internal formats of other models in addition this arrangement allows easy implementation and customization with minimal input requirements from end users thus extending the system s applicability fig 2 presents a simplified flow chart of the rheas architecture with the constituent models and meteorological forcing the logic of integrating the hydrologic and crop models is intended to capture the whole gamut of hydrological processes and the full extent of process dynamics involved in the soil plant atmosphere continuum detailed information about the model design architecture installation and operation is readily available at https github com nasa rheas the macroscale variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 hydrologic model is the primary component in the rheas information system vic simulates the land atmosphere fluxes and computes the energy and water balance at the land surface at daily time steps in addition vic generates a multitude of hydrologic variables and drought indicators that are used to quantify the uncertainties across different components of the hydrologic cycle these variables and indicators are tightly constrained by in situ and satellite observations of soil moisture precipitation runoff evapotranspiration et groundwater and snow if needed the process based decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 crop model is incorporated within rheas to simulate the crop growth development and yield under different management practices and soil properties the crop component within rheas has a modified version of the baseline dssat m dssat crop model with 50 ensemble members that can stop and restart every day whereas crop models generally run continuously from sowing until maturity harvest ines et al 2013 this modification was necessary to facilitate data assimilation of leaf area index lai and soil moisture during different phases of crop growth in addition this refinement also helps to better capture the history of crop growth towards the harvest season by producing a realistic crop yield forecast than what could otherwise be obtained by just using model based forcing from a seasonal climate forecast 2 3 data at a minimum all land surface models require high quality meteorological

pentad climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 gridded precipitation product was used to force the hydrologic model from 1981 through the present due to its long historical records low latency and temporally consistent datasets the chirps precipitation product was used to simulate the near real time initial hydrologic conditions many precursory studies have successfully used the chirps precipitation product for flood and drought monitoring katsanos et al 2016 totÃ© et al 2015 other variables such as air temperature and wind speed were obtained using the national centre for environmental prediction ncep kalnay et al 1996 gridded reanalysis product the land coverage information was obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m global product at yearly intervals friedl et al 2010 information on soil characteristics is an essential component of crop model simulations absence of any well established soil database and gridded products over the mekong region has made modeling soil processes difficult arrouays et al 2014 because of the gridded nature of rheas a 10 km spatial resolution soil database based on the soilgrids1km han et al 2019 was used for regional crop modeling in this study other ancillary information such as fertilizer application rates and cultivar varieties were obtained from various external sources e g local bodies government agencies etc and previous studies table 1 briefly summarizes a list of datasets that are available within the rheas database 2 4 methodology a regional study was carried out over the lmb region with an extensive focus over cambodia for the period of 1981 2019 the simulations were performed by providing information on the mode of operation nowcast forecast selection of simulation type crop m dssat hydrologic vic through a text based configuration file after the ingestion of the required forcing and ancillary information the vic hydrologic model explicitly computes the hydrologic and drought characteristics for each grid cell 0 25 over the study region vic has a unique representation of sub grid variability and better characterization of vertical soil moisture distribution thus making it an ideal choice for hydrologic simulations another important aspect of vic is calibration of the model parameters for hydrologic applications however we have opted to not perform additional calibrations on top of the vic model calibrations previously reported in the literature for two reasons firstly as rheas is a modeling framework aimed at deployments in data poor regions our objective was to evaluate its performance with as little in situ data as possible moreover the default parameters included in the rheas implementation were derived from a global calibration of the vic model performed in several previous studies sheffield and wood 2007 zhang et al 2018 that demonstrated the accuracy of the model when simulating hydrologic fluxes and states in this study we have solely focused on agricultural and meteorological droughts agricultural drought is especially intricate and difficult to distinguish from other types due to the high disparity of water requirement for different crops rheas uses the soil moisture deficit index smdi and drought severity indicator for characterizing agricultural drought the smdi computes weekly soil water deficit to represent the overall soil water availability in the root zone using the long term median of weekly averaged soil water and maximum and minimum weekly soil water recording smdi provides the soil moisture deficit in percent at various depths of the soil profile this information is especially used to discern the optimal crop water requirements of different crops at various stages of growth likewise the drought severity index allows for the categorization of various levels of moisture availability dryness wetness wherein the moisture content is expressed as a percentile of the model climatology for each grid cell precipitation is the most critical variable that is subjected to major fluctuations compared to other hydrologic states such as runoff soil moisture groundwater thus quantifying the impact of precipitation deficit on other hydrologic states e g streamflow groundwater will help characterize meteorological drought hence the normalized spi was used to reflect the precipitation deficit at multiple timescales notably 1 3 6 and 12 month based on the historic long term precipitation records the spi provides a standardized value for dry wet conditions for a specific period tables s1 and s2 supplementary material provide information on spi and smdi on a standardized scale where positive values represent wet and negative values represent dry conditions also rheas generates other indicators such as standardized runoff index sri and dryspells which are used to characterize hydrologic drought conditions information regarding the frequency of drought dry spells i e number of days between two drought events supplements the system and plays a vital role in decision making during the growing season following a similar technique as mentioned above the crop model simulations were carried out by providing the essential information through a configuration file using the same information and model forcings same as vic the modified dssat m dssat model is run on a yearly basis to generate the inter annual yields it becomes extremely important to supplement the crop model with specific information on local practices such as rice cultivar types in the region planting dates from crop calendar for optimal modeling of agricultural productivity typical information on management practices was obtained from local bodies governments and previous studies although no specific information on cultivar varieties and fertilizer application rates were available from local authorities in cambodia we used the information from previous studies and world bank fao food and agriculture organization for rice cultivar genetic coefficients calibration using in situ field data is essential under no stress condition boote 1999 the calibrated cultivar should achieve the observed yield and biomass since we did not have any field data of rice cultivation under no stress condition we adapted the calibrated rice cultivars genetic coefficients for cambodia from wang et al 2017 who used field data under no stress condition the rice cultivar genetic coefficients from wang et al 2017 table s3 supplementary material are well calibrated with the field experiment conducted in 2011 and validated against yield data from years 2010 and 2013 wang et al 2017 reported that the simulated yields of rice cultivars were nearly same as the observed yields in the calibration year 2011 while 1 2 to 3 1 of rice yields were higher in the validation years 2010 and 2013 respectively the vic generated outputs are used to initialize the surface boundary conditions and root zone profiles of the crop model i e m dssat through an ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 fig 3 illustrates the integration of classical sequential enkf houtekamer and mitchell 1998 whitaker and hamill 2002 within the dssat csm in this approach the m dssat runs 50 ensemble members simultaneously while waiting to subsequently update the next suite of state variables and model parameters when observations or measured data are available the enkf assimilation is done when observations are available to update the model forecasts to generate the analysis which caters as input for the next timestep of ensemble dssat modeling the ensembles are run through dssat model again until the next update of observations are available these model ensembles are used to estimate the uncertainties in crop modeling simulations by capturing the structural and internal variability in agricultural systems arising from either model parameter values fertilizer rates soil profile or other ancillary information in this framework input and output i o variables and the updated variables from enkf are stored in software modules and then passed as arguments to the crop model to re initialize restore the current model variable values before the model proceeds with integration to the next time step the rheas framework performs data assimilation of surface soil moisture das and mohanty 2006 das et al 2008 and lai ines et al 2013 the data assimilation of surface soil moisture also updates the status of root zone soil moisture this is accomplished by using the covariance matrix of the soil profile unlike the assimilation of surface soil moisture the assimilation of lai from modis data is not straightforward this is because lai is physically related to many other vegetation related variables and parameters e g plant leaf area leaf weight and plant carbohydrates the values of updated lai from data assimilation are used to adjust these variables for each ensemble member before simulating the next time step of the crop model 3 results and discussions 3 1 model validation as hydrological model outputs and state variables are heterogeneous in nature it is challenging to validate them in data poor regions over space and time however scientific validation with geophysical state variables provides an estimate of the skill of the model while addressing associated uncertainties for the purpose of validating the rheas output an independent source of data for a state variable is required soil moisture data from remote sensing is one such source another reason for using surface soil moisture has to do with the key nature of soil moisture as a variable that links the water and energy balances at the soil atmosphere interface critical for many hydrologic processes first the vic hydrologic model was validated against surface soil moisture over cambodia the nasa smap mission provides composite estimates of surface soil moisture for the top 5 cm at a global extent taking advantage of such useful information on surface soil moisture conditions we used the top layer soil moisture output from rheas to validate against the smap based soil moisture in spatial and temporal fashion over cambodia the rheas model spatial resolution 25 km is also nearly compatible with the smap observation spatial resolution of 30 km in general the smap l band radiometer does not observe soil moisture below 5 cm depth we also assume that the surface soil moisture dynamics is physically linked with the evolution of rootzone soil moisture hence validating the surface moisture indirectly validates the rootzone soil moisture the validation of annual mean soil moisture presented good accordance with observations r2 0 65 for the top 5 cm soil layer fig 4 a the correlation between model outputs and observations consistently indicates a high correlation over most places except some coastal areas and water bodies e g tonle sap lake where the smap measurements are of inferior quality fig 4b as the smap soil moisture is an independent product it is assumed to be suitable for validation against the vic generated profile surface soil moisture in addition validation with remote sensing observations also provides confidence in model performance this is essential to ensure the accurate characterization of drought indices from the validated parameters hence the results from the model can be used to define the agricultural hydrologic drought status and the water stress conditions at various spatial temporal scales similarly a regional scale validation was carried out using end of season yields aggregated at country scale between 2000 and 2016 the interannual rice yields from m dssat over cambodia were validated against an independent source of yield records obtained from fao fig 5 presents comparisons of observed and model generated annual end of year yields soil and phenological data were collected for the period 2010 2013 and used in wang et al 2017 and the same genetic coefficients were used in our simulations as well therefore rice yield comparisons with data around this period are shown in fig 5 which exhibited good correlation r2 0 84 with very low bias between observed and rheas simulated yield estimates however extending the simulations to an earlier timeframe 2000 2008 fig s1 showed substantial bias compared to the latter part of the simulation period 2008 2016 fig 5 the large bias 750 kg ha in the rice yields observed for the initial 5 years i e 2000 2004 can be attributed to the following a lack of farm management data such as fertilizer application rates and b subpar rice cultivar genetic coefficients although the calibrated cultivar genetic coefficients from wang et al 2017 were used throughout the simulation period the lack of information on cultivar verities used during the initial period is a source of significant uncertainty we anticipate that a change in rice cultivars might be one of the reasons for such disparate behavior of yields incorporating a calibrated cultivar variety for years 2000 2004 could potentially improve the rice yields however such calibration would call for additional data that are not available accurate estimation of these variables is heavily reliant on the input data quality e g meteorological forcing vegetation and large uncertainties can be expected due to the lack of detailed information on cultivar type planting dates etc as well physical inaccessibility of some sites e g station based measurements which hinder efforts to quantify the agricultural states however field data during the initial period of simulation 2000 2004 under no stress condition are not available another reason for such disparate behavior is probably due to the application of low fertilizer rates 5 kg ha based on data from fao world bank for this period this low fertilizer application rate is probably a major contributor to the large bias during the initial years of study however we have no other means in cambodia to verify the fao fertilizer application rates during the initial years in the recent past the farm management data collection through various agencies working in cambodia has improved and that reflects in the much better results from year 2005 onwards 3 2 hydrological modeling based on the final products e g soil moisture profile runoff evapotranspiration derived from the vic hydrologic model common drought monitoring indices were produced over the lmb region fig 6 illustrates the sample outputs based on rheas drought indicators for 2014 both rows present the fundamental drought indicators including the 3 month standardized precipitation index agricultural drought severity and soil moisture deficit dry spells and standardized runoff index as seen the mekong plain comprising of low lying areas of cambodia lao pdr and the mekong delta had been under severe stress throughout the year based on the probability of seasonal precipitation the aggregated 3 month spi reflects the short term moisture conditions while the drought severity provides a standardized measurement i e fluctuations anomalies of the moisture deficit dry wet at the root zone it should be noted the 3 month standardized precipitation index and other indices may be exhibiting a slightly lower value due to the spatial averaging whereas in reality some grids may have values as low as 3 the soil moisture deficit index apprises the potential crop water extraction amount from different soil depths during various stages of crop growth it takes the spatial average of a particular week of every month into account instead of averaging it temporally over the entire month the northern parts of the lmb show smdi value of 3 representing higher root zone moisture availability the bottom row shows the overall dry spells annual precipitation totals and the standardized runoff index it should also be noted the large spatial variability in all the drought indicators reflects the large spatial distribution of wet dry conditions across the region as most of the drought indices are based on the core hydrologic variables such as precipitation and soil moisture the indices follow a similar pattern this behavior is quite evident wherein the areas under stress remain congruent for all the indices irrespective of their nature of quantification e g precipitation for spi and soil moisture for smdi severity for the snapshots shown in fig 6 rheas showcased reasonable performance in capturing the drought stress as shown all the indicators exhibited a consistent stress in the drought striven regions the 3 month spi precipitation and sri3 indicators exhibited consistent spatial stress over cambodia southern lao lower stretches of thailand and the vietnam delta similarly the soil moisture deficit index and drought severity depicted a similar behavior over the same regions to gain in depth knowledge of the persistence behavior of drought in the region a detailed study was carried out over cambodia fig s2 supplementary material illustrates the differences in the behavior of spi and sri indices over cambodia at various timescales for the years 1990 2019 as spi and sri are based on the standard deviations of precipitation and runoff from median values for long term period they were used to evaluate the relationship between precipitation conditions and hydrological conditions and characterizing the nature of drought on a range of timescales the analysis indicated the exposure of the region to extreme dry wet conditions over a period of 30 years the 3 month spi spi3 exhibited a frequent change in dry wet conditions than the longer duration equivalent i e spi6 and spi12 the spi3 and spi1 was more effective in capturing the precipitation trends and short and medium term moisture availability during the rice growing season the spi3 and sri3 better captured the seasonal anomalies proportion of dry or wet months within a year notably during the 1988 99 and 2015 16 drought events guo et al 2017 however these shorter timescale indices spi1 sri1 or spi3 sri3 can be misleading in regions with normal to mild wetness or normal dryness for a particular 3 month period this interpretation emerges due to potentially inaccurate accumulation of impacts on shorter time scales wherein the wetness or dryness for that 3 month period depicts a temporary wet dry period hence the larger timescale meteorological indices spi6 sri6 or spi12 sri12 are much more effective in quantifying long term wet or dry season trends the spi and sri exhibit a similar pattern at larger timescales 12 month the 3 month spi and sri behave distinctly wherein the sri tends to be less variable than spi due to the storage of incoming precipitation as soil moisture that limits the amount of surface runoff this behavior can be clearly seen during the drought events of 1998 99 and 2015 16 where the 3 month spi and sri follow a slightly different pattern with a lag as compared to the respective 12 month timeframe as the 12 month indices are based on the cumulative result of shorter periods spi and sri show a lower frequency of positive and negative standardized values when compared to the 3 month values fig s3 supplementary material shows the mean annual precipitation and runoff over cambodia for the years 1990 2019 there was a clear indication of seasonal influence in the region with prevailing wet periods at the start of the growing season june onwards and subsequent dry conditions from nov mar furthermore a detailed regional study was carried out for the 2015 drought year illustrated in fig 7 the spatial variability in drought severity intensity for mar apr may mam and jun jul aug jja was well captured by rheas exhibiting higher stress during the initial time period compared to the latter fig 7a similarly the spatial distribution of the soil moisture deficit index shows good agreement with drought severity fig 7c a comparison of the moisture deficit between the 22nd week 4th week of may and 33rd week 2nd week of aug clearly shows a higher moisture deficit during the initial period of the year though the overall annual precipitation totals have increased over the years except for the drought years the interannual spatial variability shows lower levels of rainfall during mam as compared to jas fig 7d the 3 month spi during the initial months fma exhibited a relative moderate to severe dry conditions over the region while the latter period jja presented a near normal to moderate wet conditions due to the onset of the southwest monsoon fig 7b the spi3 index provides a better estimation of precipitation deficit and short to medium term moisture conditions and is considered critical in capturing the precipitation trends during reproductive and early grain filling stages similarly dry spells are used to detect significant changes in drought frequency due to the fluctuations in water energy fluxes overall there had been a consistent prevalence of high stress conditions during the initial time period april onwards as compared to the mid months with extreme stress conditions in the southeast provinces of prey veng and takeo and normal to moderate dry conditions over the western provinces of pailin and battambang 3 3 crop modeling the other objective of this study was the estimation of interannual rice yields over cambodia so that growers and policymakers could reduce agricultural losses due to drought events fig s4a c supplementary material presents the annual yields over cambodia in 2005 and 2015 simulated from the m dssat crop model within the rheas framework there is a clear indication of an increase in yields 2900 kg ha in 2005 to 3550 kg ha in 2015 over the years however the drought striven provinces exhibited identical patterns of low yields over the 10 year period mostly due to the frequent exposure of prolonged periods of dry spells however the tonle sap basin and nearby areas have seen an increase in rice yields over the 10 yr period partly due to the improvement in technology and farm management practices fig s4d supplementary material presents the average yields over each province for the entire study period 2000 2016 clearly indicating low yields in the southeast regions the low yield over the southeast provinces can also be well matched with the drought indicators from the vic model wherein the provinces with high precipitation deficit and severity experienced lower productivity however the western provinces e g battambang exhibit higher yields despite high exposure to drought events the reason for such behavior can be attributed to the differences in soil properties and the better adaptability of paddy to local conditions nonetheless specific improvements and analysis are being currently carried out on a regional basis to further improve the performance and stability of the rheas framework in addition the next phase of studies would include assimilation of various state variables e g ndvi which would further improve model performance 3 4 correlation with crop yield fig 8 presents a comparison of the impact of growing season jjaso rice yields with the standardized drought indices and hydrologic variables over cambodia between 2000 and 2016 we evaluated the drought severity precipitation totals number of days exceeding temperatures of 30 c etc for the growing season against observed and simulated yields while simulations based on crop models anticipate water supply substantially driving crop yields capturing the relationship between weather and crop yields shows no clear association as shown in fig 8 the climatology of the drought indices predominantly remains the same having negligible impact on annual rice yields this can be better represented during the drought year 2015 wherein the annual yields increased despite the prevalence of stress conditions throughout the country however this situation can be better interpreted by the decrease in yield in 2016 mainly due to the persistence of drought spell from 2015 until mid 2016 overall we see a continuous increase in annual yields irrespective of the stress conditions and no conclusive pattern in the behavior of drought parameters and crop yields can be deduced on a regional basis as drought is primarily a local phenomenon such trends may be more distinct on provincial levels fig s4 supplementary material simulated yields are shown for selected provinces e g pailin preah vihear but due to the lack of actual provincial yields data conclusions could not be drawn from the analysis the severity index and precipitation totals showed a good correlation with the prevalence of severe stress conditions i e high severity and lower precipitation during the start of growing season june and a gradual reduction of stress conditions i e less severity and increased precipitation in the subsequent months sep oct similarly we investigated the number of days with air temperature exceeding 30 c fig 8e within each growing season to identify any noticeable impact on agricultural yields most crops have an energy budget from sowing to harvest accounted for using the growing degree day gdd which was computed based on the maximum minimum and average ambient temperatures however the plant productivity photosynthetic capacity almost becomes negligible above an average temperature of 30 c therefore we analyzed the number of days where the ambient average temperature is above 30 c to evaluate the stress on the crop we found record number of days above 30 c in the planting season during the stress periods most notably during the 2015 2016 drought event likewise the standardized drought indices 3 12 month spi drought severity and precipitation totals were examined the 3 and 12 month spi for the growing season period jun oct were compared with the rice yields to analyze the stress conditions during the growing season fig 8a and 8b the 3 month index was used to capture the short and medium term moisture conditions and estimate the precipitation trends during the important stages of crop growth whereas the 12 month standardized index provided a cumulative overview of the short term precipitation patterns i e long term precipitation patterns rheas was able to capture the decrease in yield during the drought events of 2002 2004 and 2008 but exhibited a contrasting behavior during the later drought events e g 2010 2015 it should be noted that the agreement between the drought indices and yield only accounts for the physical changes within the growing season however the growing season drought variability invariably remains normal to mild wet spi 0 for most years 2005 onwards during the simulation period thus following an increasing trend of rice yields during those years as shown in fig 8 the growing season jun oct exhibited negligible impact from water stress conditions however the study does not categorically indicate the prevalence of stress free conditions throughout the study period instead as shown in fig 7 stress conditions mostly occurred during the initial months feb may which subsequently alleviated to mild near normal conditions at the onset of the growing season as the drought conditions were notably significant in capturing the interannual yield variability we evaluated other management factors such as fertilizer application rates cultivar varieties that could possibly drive the associated changes since the meteorological variables e g precipitation ambient temperature etc and cultivar varieties from wang et al 2017 remained same throughout the study period the only variable factor in the analysis was the rate of fertilizer application adopted from fao world bank since 2008 the fertilizer rates have steadily increased over the years echoing a strong resemblance with observed and simulated yields fig 9 a strong correlation is noted between observed yields and fertilizer application rates during the 2008 2016 period r2 0 84 with a similarly high value between simulated yields and fertilizer rates r2 0 92 although less information was available on the local application rates a significant pattern can be noted from the analysis with increased consumption of fertilizer rates since 2008 the interannual yields have been steadily increasing each year as seen in fig 9 prior to the aforementioned period the fertilizer application rates remained the same hence the initial timeframe 2000 2005 arrayed lower yields as the management practices e g fertilizer application rates in a country depend on the socioeconomic conditions of the farmers and the support of local governments the fertilizer application rates in cambodia have still not reached optimum levels compared to the neighboring mekong countries such as vietnam and thailand and exhibit abundant scope for improvement in the near future hence considering the results obtained from rheas the consistent increase in yield can be significantly attributed to the application of chemical based fertilizers 4 conclusions the rheas framework facilitates end to end modeling that helps understand the impacts of evolving weather hydrology climate and farm management practices on the crop status and yield thus making its design unique based on the current application rheas showed reasonable performance in capturing the agricultural and meteorological drought variability over lmb based on the information available from the drought indices the results from the study depicted a common persistence of mild medium dry conditions over cambodia during the initial months but the overall stress dwindles with the onset of monsoon at the start of the growing season june onwards in short the feb may period witnesses significant stress conditions whereas the growing season post june achieved a near normal to moderate wet conditions although mean annual precipitation has seen an increase over the years barring a few drought years there has been a decrease in dry season precipitation due to the irregularities in weather regimes however the continuous prevalence of severe drought events notably in 2015 16 has raised fears of occurrence of similar stress conditions in the drought prone provinces considering the results obtained from rheas there is a clear indication of a significant increase of drought prevalence in most areas of the lmb that may or may not have serious implications on the agriculture sector the rice yields in cambodia have been steadily witnessing an upward trend since the last decade mainly due to increasing fertilizer application rates and to some extent due to the modernization of farm practices techniques mechanization and improvements in technology the mekong river commission has cited a similar conclusion in their annual reports mrc 2014 of an increase in annual production of the four major crops including rice rheas was able to adequately capture the interannual variability of rice yields with observations r2 0 84 with low bias from 2005 onwards the growing season hydrologic stress conditions when compared with annual yields also did not reflect any significant effect on the crop status barring a few drought years however the drought indices exhibited lower agricultural yields in the water stress provinces located in the southeast regions of cambodia throughout the study period thus reflecting the impact of drought on crop status at provincial levels while the aforementioned situation envisages lower future yields due to elevating stress conditions substantial arguments can be made on comparing drought conditions with annual yields drought solely does not affect agricultural yields as cambodia inherently gets affected by flash flooding waterlogging possibly resulting in decreased yields and crop losses as the meteorological variables and cultivar type were kept the same throughout the study period the only variable factor for attaining higher yields can be attributed to the use of chemical fertilizers although the fertilizer application rates in cambodia are well behind the neighboring mekong countries

4441,recurring drought in the lower mekong countries has inflicted enormous pressure on the natural ecosystem rice productivity and water resources a regional scale assessment over cambodia was carried out to examine the linkages between rice productivity and meteorological hydrologic drought variability from 2000 to 2016 we implemented a comprehensive drought and crop yield information system the regional hydrologic extremes assessment system rheas framework that couples a hydrologic model with a crop growth model to capture the subtle intrinsic nature of drought and assess the impact on inter seasonal and intra annual rice yields simulations based on rheas show good agreement with observations r2 0 65 for soil moisture from the hydrologic model r2 0 84 for crop model using a suite of standardized drought indices the onset and prevalence of dry and wet periods throughout the study period were examined at multiple temporal scales the temporal variability in drought intensity exhibited higher water stress during the initial months mar may indicating prevalence of medium to severe dry conditions prior to the planting season however the onset of monsoon at the beginning of the growing season june resulted in the prevalence of normal to moderate wet conditions a linear trend analysis for the period 2000 2016 showed a consistent increase 2900 kg ha in 2000 to 3550 kg ha in 2016 in rice yields although drought stricken provinces showed lower yields 1650 kg ha throughout the study period overall a continuous increase in annual rice yields irrespective of the stress conditions was noted with no clear pattern linking drought parameters with crop yields on a regional scale the application of chemical based fertilizers has steadily increased over the years since 2008 and the consistent increase in observed rice yields correlated with increased fertilizer use r2 0 84 information from the hydrologic and crop model components within rheas enables development of critical regional and local thresholds reflecting the increasing levels of risk and vulnerability towards drought keywords drought lower mekong basin cambodia hydrologic modeling rice yield crop model 1 introduction among all the natural hazards drought is by far the most expensive complex and uncertain weather related disaster worldwide resulting in large annual socio economic losses pandey et al 2007 often characterized by a prolonged deficit of precipitation and long periods of abnormally dry conditions there is no universally accepted definition of drought van loon et al 2016a droughts originate from a range of hydrometeorological processes that reflect the long term imbalance between water supply and water demand due to their high variability both spatially and temporally the effects of drought can be localized thus making its characterization complex and uncertain recurring droughts have crippled countries throughout the course of human history having profound impacts on agriculture food security water resources human livelihood and the natural ecosystem wilhite 2000 numerous studies have attributed the severity duration location and timing of droughts to regional and global scale processes in the united states andreadis et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 india aadhar and mishra 2017 amazon duffy et al 2015 wongchuig correa et al 2017 europe grillakis 2019 africa gebremeskel haile et al 2019 sheffield et al 2014 china zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2016 and have well documented the variability and the nature of drought from these studies it is obvious that the frequency and intensity of droughts have arguably increased over the years and exacerbated due to other adversely influencing factors dai 2013 van loon et al 2016b such as population growth rapid urbanization land use changes and altering precipitation regimes these factors along with the impacts of climate change have inflicted enormous pressure on many countries thus raising serious concerns pertaining to food and water security godfray et al 2010 the over reliance on water resources attributed to agriculture has heavily weighed on the water budget mishra and singh 2010 diminishing natural resources shrinking croplands frequent exposure to extreme events drought floods etc expansion of agricultural systems and energy power sectors have further aggravated the situation ultimately resulting in seasonal water shortages thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 such changes are distinctly evident in the southern stretches of the mekong basin wherein the mekong countries have been vulnerable to the negative consequences of climate change thus posing risks for agricultural systems and human livelihoods the mekong river is imperative to the region both environmentally and economically mrc 2014 however the recent infrastructure e g hydropower and irrigation developments in the upstream mekong have changed the magnitude and seasonality of flow hoang et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2018 especially in the lower stretches of the basin near tonle sap lake cambodia in addition extreme drought events in the past decades notably in 1997 98 2003 05 ipcc 2007 and late 2015 2016 guo et al 2017 son et al 2012 had significant impact on the agricultural sector leading to huge crop losses and lower agricultural productivity despite the increased vulnerability of agriculture to droughts the impacts have been somewhat overlooked and arguably less understood compared to floods kim et al 2019 nearly 70 percent of the population is actively engaged in agricultural activities in the lower mekong basin lmb region most of the agricultural systems in the region are rain fed thus making them vulnerable to the risks and uncertainties associated with seasonality johnston et al 2012 mrc 2003 as there are no alternative sources of income other than agriculture the crop losses associated with seasonality take a huge toll on the livelihoods of the lower income and other marginalized groups mrc 2014 rice being the principal crop is particularly sensitive to climate and has been negatively impacted by climatic change mainuddin et al 2013 the low lying areas near tonle sap lake and the deltaic regions of vietnam are highly vulnerable to these physical shocks with the increasing demand for rice production reaching an expected estimate of 3720 kg ha and 6530 kg ha respectively for cambodia and vietnam by 2025 mrc 2014 there is an acute need of minimizing the risks associated with seasonal extremities and simultaneously improving the agricultural yields there is increasing recognition of the need for both a regional and a national perspective on drought risk management interventions to reduce the vulnerability of affected communities adb 2009 hence there is a compelling need to monitor current hydrologic conditions drought status and crop yield estimates and make those data available to stakeholders on a regular basis this information pertaining to inter seasonal intra annual hydrologic drought and rice yield indicators and forecasts will facilitate risk management and planning for decision makers despite the advent of numerous drought monitoring tools such as the united states drought monitor svoboda et al 2002 and the global drought early warning monitoring framework gdewf pozzi et al 2013 the accurate assessment and prediction of drought characteristics still proves challenging inconsistent records and poor quality of spatial coverage data from ground based observational networks has long been a primary reason hindering long term hydro agricultural studies however recent advances in dynamic modeling and the use of satellite based observations have created the potential for operational drought monitoring klisch and atzberger 2016 the introduction of targeted drought indicators in modeling frameworks has not only improved the existing monitoring techniques and capabilities but facilitated insightful information on early warning preventive measures and mitigation strategies hence using a suite of single multivariate remote sensing based indices or data the numerical representation of drought characteristics from a range of extensive hydroclimatic conditions provides useful information on the overall qualitative state of drought hao et al 2015 oftentimes there exists a gap between science applications and end users resulting in the partial implementation of effective adaptation strategies andreadis et al 2017 this fundamental disconnect is distinct within the agriculture sector so bridging the gap will be helpful in facilitating better decision making though many software frameworks have explored the integration of modeling systems the internal representation of datasets has always proven to be challenging often resulting in compatibility issues within the constituent models beran and piasecki 2009 a novel aspect of this study involves the application of the recently developed end to end information system regional hydrologic extremes assessment system rheas andreadis et al 2017 that couples physically based hydrologic and crop models and uses data assimilation primarily using remote sensing observations and projections to provide nowcasts and seasonal forecasts 3 6 months in advance of yield estimates and associated drought indicators while the previous study did not include any model validation region specific information etc this study incorporates site specific information and sufficient validation against observations for effective drought and yield nowcasting another novel aspect of this work is the investigation of the potential impact of growing season drought states on rice yields this information is especially important for local governments stakeholders for facilitating decision making here we integrate readily available observations of meteorological e g precipitation and hydrologic variables e g soil moisture via a coupled hydro agricultural model offered by the rheas framework to identify changes in drought conditions and their impact on rice production in the lower mekong region despite the availability of the rheas implementation over the entire lmb we opted to focus our analysis on cambodia as its economy is especially reliant on agriculture and droughts adversely affect both livelihoods and food security our primary objective in this study was to assess the spatiotemporal evolution of drought and rice yields over cambodia and to investigate the potential impacts of drought on interannual variability of rice yields using a suite of hydrologic datasets we analyzed the derived model simulations e g soil moisture yield etc with remote sensing products and other observations the approach and results described here are expected to improve our understanding of the environmental conditions and hydrology related to crop yields by providing a quantitative historical perspective to support and improve decision making processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in southeast asia the transboundary mekong river has an estimated length of 4 350 km with a mean annual discharge of approximately 475 km3 making it the tenth largest river in the world in terms of mean annual flow at its mouth liu et al 2007 depending on the location of the river the landscape and climate range from hilly mountainous terrains 4500 m elevation of lao to the low level deltaic plains of vietnam rising from high mountain ranges the river flows through deep narrow gorges traverses through floodplains for 2600 km before entering the south china sea via a wide delta draining an area of 810 000 km2 mrc 2014 lauri et al 2014 the mekong river basin is typically portioned into the upper basin and the lower basin the lmb covers about 77 606 000 km2 of the basin and is important both environmentally and economically the lmb consisting of the four riparian countries cambodia lao pdr thailand and viet nam covers an approximate area of 618 783 km2 fig 1 the region has a typical monsoon climate having two distinct seasons i wet southwest monsoon may oct and ii dry northeast monsoon nov apr with annual precipitation between 1200 and 2500 mm year respectively the region receives 85 of the annual precipitation in the wet season with the dry season bearing minimal precipitation kite 2001 temperature and evaporation rates throughout the basin vary with elevation typically ranging between 22 and 28 c and 1 000 2 000 mm year respectively the river flows through extensive wetland habitats supporting productive ecosystems particularly the tonle sap lake in cambodia the lake and its surrounding floodplains in the heart of cambodia play an important role in inducing a seasonal change in the direction of the flow in the river this seasonality greatly influences the floodplains and the agricultural productivity downstream lower provinces of cambodia and the mekong delta the tonle sap floodplains and the delta host a population of 35 million and account for more than 90 percent of paddy plantation mrc 2014 as shown in fig 1b the majority of the agricultural activities and wetland ecosystems in cambodia are concentrated along the tonle sap lake and the southeastern provinces although substantial improvements have been made within the agriculture sector large discrepancies in mechanization irrigation capacity etc have limited the production capacity of cambodia behind its neighboring countries mainuddin et al 2013 2 2 model description rheas was developed at the jet propulsion laboratory nasa jpl and has been implemented at the nasa servir hubs at the regional centre for mapping of resources for development rcmrd in nairobi and asian disaster preparedness center adpc in bangkok and covers regions over east africa and the lower mekong region at a spatial resolution of 25 km and 5 km over a limited coverage area for different water resources applications andreadis et al 2017 rheas integrates multiple remote sensing products across different components of the terrestrial water cycle to effectively monitor water stress as indicated by the drought status the main component of the rheas architecture hosts a spatially enabled relational postgis database that ingests a suite of earth science products model datasets and satellite observations that provide a range of hydrologic and agricultural variables postgis an extension to postgresql database uses and extends the sql language combined with other features and allows the functionality of querying and managing spatial geometries rheas follows a hybrid approach that allows the seamless coupling of the constituent models thus making its design distinct and unique from other information systems such design of combining modular and object oriented programming has several advantages i better transferability of data across models ii system modularity since all the models incorporated within the framework must interface with the postgis database and not the internal formats of other models in addition this arrangement allows easy implementation and customization with minimal input requirements from end users thus extending the system s applicability fig 2 presents a simplified flow chart of the rheas architecture with the constituent models and meteorological forcing the logic of integrating the hydrologic and crop models is intended to capture the whole gamut of hydrological processes and the full extent of process dynamics involved in the soil plant atmosphere continuum detailed information about the model design architecture installation and operation is readily available at https github com nasa rheas the macroscale variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 hydrologic model is the primary component in the rheas information system vic simulates the land atmosphere fluxes and computes the energy and water balance at the land surface at daily time steps in addition vic generates a multitude of hydrologic variables and drought indicators that are used to quantify the uncertainties across different components of the hydrologic cycle these variables and indicators are tightly constrained by in situ and satellite observations of soil moisture precipitation runoff evapotranspiration et groundwater and snow if needed the process based decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 crop model is incorporated within rheas to simulate the crop growth development and yield under different management practices and soil properties the crop component within rheas has a modified version of the baseline dssat m dssat crop model with 50 ensemble members that can stop and restart every day whereas crop models generally run continuously from sowing until maturity harvest ines et al 2013 this modification was necessary to facilitate data assimilation of leaf area index lai and soil moisture during different phases of crop growth in addition this refinement also helps to better capture the history of crop growth towards the harvest season by producing a realistic crop yield forecast than what could otherwise be obtained by just using model based forcing from a seasonal climate forecast 2 3 data at a minimum all land surface models require high quality meteorological

pentad climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 gridded precipitation product was used to force the hydrologic model from 1981 through the present due to its long historical records low latency and temporally consistent datasets the chirps precipitation product was used to simulate the near real time initial hydrologic conditions many precursory studies have successfully used the chirps precipitation product for flood and drought monitoring katsanos et al 2016 totÃ© et al 2015 other variables such as air temperature and wind speed were obtained using the national centre for environmental prediction ncep kalnay et al 1996 gridded reanalysis product the land coverage information was obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m global product at yearly intervals friedl et al 2010 information on soil characteristics is an essential component of crop model simulations absence of any well established soil database and gridded products over the mekong region has made modeling soil processes difficult arrouays et al 2014 because of the gridded nature of rheas a 10 km spatial resolution soil database based on the soilgrids1km han et al 2019 was used for regional crop modeling in this study other ancillary information such as fertilizer application rates and cultivar varieties were obtained from various external sources e g local bodies government agencies etc and previous studies table 1 briefly summarizes a list of datasets that are available within the rheas database 2 4 methodology a regional study was carried out over the lmb region with an extensive focus over cambodia for the period of 1981 2019 the simulations were performed by providing information on the mode of operation nowcast forecast selection of simulation type crop m dssat hydrologic vic through a text based configuration file after the ingestion of the required forcing and ancillary information the vic hydrologic model explicitly computes the hydrologic and drought characteristics for each grid cell 0 25 over the study region vic has a unique representation of sub grid variability and better characterization of vertical soil moisture distribution thus making it an ideal choice for hydrologic simulations another important aspect of vic is calibration of the model parameters for hydrologic applications however we have opted to not perform additional calibrations on top of the vic model calibrations previously reported in the literature for two reasons firstly as rheas is a modeling framework aimed at deployments in data poor regions our objective was to evaluate its performance with as little in situ data as possible moreover the default parameters included in the rheas implementation were derived from a global calibration of the vic model performed in several previous studies sheffield and wood 2007 zhang et al 2018 that demonstrated the accuracy of the model when simulating hydrologic fluxes and states in this study we have solely focused on agricultural and meteorological droughts agricultural drought is especially intricate and difficult to distinguish from other types due to the high disparity of water requirement for different crops rheas uses the soil moisture deficit index smdi and drought severity indicator for characterizing agricultural drought the smdi computes weekly soil water deficit to represent the overall soil water availability in the root zone using the long term median of weekly averaged soil water and maximum and minimum weekly soil water recording smdi provides the soil moisture deficit in percent at various depths of the soil profile this information is especially used to discern the optimal crop water requirements of different crops at various stages of growth likewise the drought severity index allows for the categorization of various levels of moisture availability dryness wetness wherein the moisture content is expressed as a percentile of the model climatology for each grid cell precipitation is the most critical variable that is subjected to major fluctuations compared to other hydrologic states such as runoff soil moisture groundwater thus quantifying the impact of precipitation deficit on other hydrologic states e g streamflow groundwater will help characterize meteorological drought hence the normalized spi was used to reflect the precipitation deficit at multiple timescales notably 1 3 6 and 12 month based on the historic long term precipitation records the spi provides a standardized value for dry wet conditions for a specific period tables s1 and s2 supplementary material provide information on spi and smdi on a standardized scale where positive values represent wet and negative values represent dry conditions also rheas generates other indicators such as standardized runoff index sri and dryspells which are used to characterize hydrologic drought conditions information regarding the frequency of drought dry spells i e number of days between two drought events supplements the system and plays a vital role in decision making during the growing season following a similar technique as mentioned above the crop model simulations were carried out by providing the essential information through a configuration file using the same information and model forcings same as vic the modified dssat m dssat model is run on a yearly basis to generate the inter annual yields it becomes extremely important to supplement the crop model with specific information on local practices such as rice cultivar types in the region planting dates from crop calendar for optimal modeling of agricultural productivity typical information on management practices was obtained from local bodies governments and previous studies although no specific information on cultivar varieties and fertilizer application rates were available from local authorities in cambodia we used the information from previous studies and world bank fao food and agriculture organization for rice cultivar genetic coefficients calibration using in situ field data is essential under no stress condition boote 1999 the calibrated cultivar should achieve the observed yield and biomass since we did not have any field data of rice cultivation under no stress condition we adapted the calibrated rice cultivars genetic coefficients for cambodia from wang et al 2017 who used field data under no stress condition the rice cultivar genetic coefficients from wang et al 2017 table s3 supplementary material are well calibrated with the field experiment conducted in 2011 and validated against yield data from years 2010 and 2013 wang et al 2017 reported that the simulated yields of rice cultivars were nearly same as the observed yields in the calibration year 2011 while 1 2 to 3 1 of rice yields were higher in the validation years 2010 and 2013 respectively the vic generated outputs are used to initialize the surface boundary conditions and root zone profiles of the crop model i e m dssat through an ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 fig 3 illustrates the integration of classical sequential enkf houtekamer and mitchell 1998 whitaker and hamill 2002 within the dssat csm in this approach the m dssat runs 50 ensemble members simultaneously while waiting to subsequently update the next suite of state variables and model parameters when observations or measured data are available the enkf assimilation is done when observations are available to update the model forecasts to generate the analysis which caters as input for the next timestep of ensemble dssat modeling the ensembles are run through dssat model again until the next update of observations are available these model ensembles are used to estimate the uncertainties in crop modeling simulations by capturing the structural and internal variability in agricultural systems arising from either model parameter values fertilizer rates soil profile or other ancillary information in this framework input and output i o variables and the updated variables from enkf are stored in software modules and then passed as arguments to the crop model to re initialize restore the current model variable values before the model proceeds with integration to the next time step the rheas framework performs data assimilation of surface soil moisture das and mohanty 2006 das et al 2008 and lai ines et al 2013 the data assimilation of surface soil moisture also updates the status of root zone soil moisture this is accomplished by using the covariance matrix of the soil profile unlike the assimilation of surface soil moisture the assimilation of lai from modis data is not straightforward this is because lai is physically related to many other vegetation related variables and parameters e g plant leaf area leaf weight and plant carbohydrates the values of updated lai from data assimilation are used to adjust these variables for each ensemble member before simulating the next time step of the crop model 3 results and discussions 3 1 model validation as hydrological model outputs and state variables are heterogeneous in nature it is challenging to validate them in data poor regions over space and time however scientific validation with geophysical state variables provides an estimate of the skill of the model while addressing associated uncertainties for the purpose of validating the rheas output an independent source of data for a state variable is required soil moisture data from remote sensing is one such source another reason for using surface soil moisture has to do with the key nature of soil moisture as a variable that links the water and energy balances at the soil atmosphere interface critical for many hydrologic processes first the vic hydrologic model was validated against surface soil moisture over cambodia the nasa smap mission provides composite estimates of surface soil moisture for the top 5 cm at a global extent taking advantage of such useful information on surface soil moisture conditions we used the top layer soil moisture output from rheas to validate against the smap based soil moisture in spatial and temporal fashion over cambodia the rheas model spatial resolution 25 km is also nearly compatible with the smap observation spatial resolution of 30 km in general the smap l band radiometer does not observe soil moisture below 5 cm depth we also assume that the surface soil moisture dynamics is physically linked with the evolution of rootzone soil moisture hence validating the surface moisture indirectly validates the rootzone soil moisture the validation of annual mean soil moisture presented good accordance with observations r2 0 65 for the top 5 cm soil layer fig 4 a the correlation between model outputs and observations consistently indicates a high correlation over most places except some coastal areas and water bodies e g tonle sap lake where the smap measurements are of inferior quality fig 4b as the smap soil moisture is an independent product it is assumed to be suitable for validation against the vic generated profile surface soil moisture in addition validation with remote sensing observations also provides confidence in model performance this is essential to ensure the accurate characterization of drought indices from the validated parameters hence the results from the model can be used to define the agricultural hydrologic drought status and the water stress conditions at various spatial temporal scales similarly a regional scale validation was carried out using end of season yields aggregated at country scale between 2000 and 2016 the interannual rice yields from m dssat over cambodia were validated against an independent source of yield records obtained from fao fig 5 presents comparisons of observed and model generated annual end of year yields soil and phenological data were collected for the period 2010 2013 and used in wang et al 2017 and the same genetic coefficients were used in our simulations as well therefore rice yield comparisons with data around this period are shown in fig 5 which exhibited good correlation r2 0 84 with very low bias between observed and rheas simulated yield estimates however extending the simulations to an earlier timeframe 2000 2008 fig s1 showed substantial bias compared to the latter part of the simulation period 2008 2016 fig 5 the large bias 750 kg ha in the rice yields observed for the initial 5 years i e 2000 2004 can be attributed to the following a lack of farm management data such as fertilizer application rates and b subpar rice cultivar genetic coefficients although the calibrated cultivar genetic coefficients from wang et al 2017 were used throughout the simulation period the lack of information on cultivar verities used during the initial period is a source of significant uncertainty we anticipate that a change in rice cultivars might be one of the reasons for such disparate behavior of yields incorporating a calibrated cultivar variety for years 2000 2004 could potentially improve the rice yields however such calibration would call for additional data that are not available accurate estimation of these variables is heavily reliant on the input data quality e g meteorological forcing vegetation and large uncertainties can be expected due to the lack of detailed information on cultivar type planting dates etc as well physical inaccessibility of some sites e g station based measurements which hinder efforts to quantify the agricultural states however field data during the initial period of simulation 2000 2004 under no stress condition are not available another reason for such disparate behavior is probably due to the application of low fertilizer rates 5 kg ha based on data from fao world bank for this period this low fertilizer application rate is probably a major contributor to the large bias during the initial years of study however we have no other means in cambodia to verify the fao fertilizer application rates during the initial years in the recent past the farm management data collection through various agencies working in cambodia has improved and that reflects in the much better results from year 2005 onwards 3 2 hydrological modeling based on the final products e g soil moisture profile runoff evapotranspiration derived from the vic hydrologic model common drought monitoring indices were produced over the lmb region fig 6 illustrates the sample outputs based on rheas drought indicators for 2014 both rows present the fundamental drought indicators including the 3 month standardized precipitation index agricultural drought severity and soil moisture deficit dry spells and standardized runoff index as seen the mekong plain comprising of low lying areas of cambodia lao pdr and the mekong delta had been under severe stress throughout the year based on the probability of seasonal precipitation the aggregated 3 month spi reflects the short term moisture conditions while the drought severity provides a standardized measurement i e fluctuations anomalies of the moisture deficit dry wet at the root zone it should be noted the 3 month standardized precipitation index and other indices may be exhibiting a slightly lower value due to the spatial averaging whereas in reality some grids may have values as low as 3 the soil moisture deficit index apprises the potential crop water extraction amount from different soil depths during various stages of crop growth it takes the spatial average of a particular week of every month into account instead of averaging it temporally over the entire month the northern parts of the lmb show smdi value of 3 representing higher root zone moisture availability the bottom row shows the overall dry spells annual precipitation totals and the standardized runoff index it should also be noted the large spatial variability in all the drought indicators reflects the large spatial distribution of wet dry conditions across the region as most of the drought indices are based on the core hydrologic variables such as precipitation and soil moisture the indices follow a similar pattern this behavior is quite evident wherein the areas under stress remain congruent for all the indices irrespective of their nature of quantification e g precipitation for spi and soil moisture for smdi severity for the snapshots shown in fig 6 rheas showcased reasonable performance in capturing the drought stress as shown all the indicators exhibited a consistent stress in the drought striven regions the 3 month spi precipitation and sri3 indicators exhibited consistent spatial stress over cambodia southern lao lower stretches of thailand and the vietnam delta similarly the soil moisture deficit index and drought severity depicted a similar behavior over the same regions to gain in depth knowledge of the persistence behavior of drought in the region a detailed study was carried out over cambodia fig s2 supplementary material illustrates the differences in the behavior of spi and sri indices over cambodia at various timescales for the years 1990 2019 as spi and sri are based on the standard deviations of precipitation and runoff from median values for long term period they were used to evaluate the relationship between precipitation conditions and hydrological conditions and characterizing the nature of drought on a range of timescales the analysis indicated the exposure of the region to extreme dry wet conditions over a period of 30 years the 3 month spi spi3 exhibited a frequent change in dry wet conditions than the longer duration equivalent i e spi6 and spi12 the spi3 and spi1 was more effective in capturing the precipitation trends and short and medium term moisture availability during the rice growing season the spi3 and sri3 better captured the seasonal anomalies proportion of dry or wet months within a year notably during the 1988 99 and 2015 16 drought events guo et al 2017 however these shorter timescale indices spi1 sri1 or spi3 sri3 can be misleading in regions with normal to mild wetness or normal dryness for a particular 3 month period this interpretation emerges due to potentially inaccurate accumulation of impacts on shorter time scales wherein the wetness or dryness for that 3 month period depicts a temporary wet dry period hence the larger timescale meteorological indices spi6 sri6 or spi12 sri12 are much more effective in quantifying long term wet or dry season trends the spi and sri exhibit a similar pattern at larger timescales 12 month the 3 month spi and sri behave distinctly wherein the sri tends to be less variable than spi due to the storage of incoming precipitation as soil moisture that limits the amount of surface runoff this behavior can be clearly seen during the drought events of 1998 99 and 2015 16 where the 3 month spi and sri follow a slightly different pattern with a lag as compared to the respective 12 month timeframe as the 12 month indices are based on the cumulative result of shorter periods spi and sri show a lower frequency of positive and negative standardized values when compared to the 3 month values fig s3 supplementary material shows the mean annual precipitation and runoff over cambodia for the years 1990 2019 there was a clear indication of seasonal influence in the region with prevailing wet periods at the start of the growing season june onwards and subsequent dry conditions from nov mar furthermore a detailed regional study was carried out for the 2015 drought year illustrated in fig 7 the spatial variability in drought severity intensity for mar apr may mam and jun jul aug jja was well captured by rheas exhibiting higher stress during the initial time period compared to the latter fig 7a similarly the spatial distribution of the soil moisture deficit index shows good agreement with drought severity fig 7c a comparison of the moisture deficit between the 22nd week 4th week of may and 33rd week 2nd week of aug clearly shows a higher moisture deficit during the initial period of the year though the overall annual precipitation totals have increased over the years except for the drought years the interannual spatial variability shows lower levels of rainfall during mam as compared to jas fig 7d the 3 month spi during the initial months fma exhibited a relative moderate to severe dry conditions over the region while the latter period jja presented a near normal to moderate wet conditions due to the onset of the southwest monsoon fig 7b the spi3 index provides a better estimation of precipitation deficit and short to medium term moisture conditions and is considered critical in capturing the precipitation trends during reproductive and early grain filling stages similarly dry spells are used to detect significant changes in drought frequency due to the fluctuations in water energy fluxes overall there had been a consistent prevalence of high stress conditions during the initial time period april onwards as compared to the mid months with extreme stress conditions in the southeast provinces of prey veng and takeo and normal to moderate dry conditions over the western provinces of pailin and battambang 3 3 crop modeling the other objective of this study was the estimation of interannual rice yields over cambodia so that growers and policymakers could reduce agricultural losses due to drought events fig s4a c supplementary material presents the annual yields over cambodia in 2005 and 2015 simulated from the m dssat crop model within the rheas framework there is a clear indication of an increase in yields 2900 kg ha in 2005 to 3550 kg ha in 2015 over the years however the drought striven provinces exhibited identical patterns of low yields over the 10 year period mostly due to the frequent exposure of prolonged periods of dry spells however the tonle sap basin and nearby areas have seen an increase in rice yields over the 10 yr period partly due to the improvement in technology and farm management practices fig s4d supplementary material presents the average yields over each province for the entire study period 2000 2016 clearly indicating low yields in the southeast regions the low yield over the southeast provinces can also be well matched with the drought indicators from the vic model wherein the provinces with high precipitation deficit and severity experienced lower productivity however the western provinces e g battambang exhibit higher yields despite high exposure to drought events the reason for such behavior can be attributed to the differences in soil properties and the better adaptability of paddy to local conditions nonetheless specific improvements and analysis are being currently carried out on a regional basis to further improve the performance and stability of the rheas framework in addition the next phase of studies would include assimilation of various state variables e g ndvi which would further improve model performance 3 4 correlation with crop yield fig 8 presents a comparison of the impact of growing season jjaso rice yields with the standardized drought indices and hydrologic variables over cambodia between 2000 and 2016 we evaluated the drought severity precipitation totals number of days exceeding temperatures of 30 c etc for the growing season against observed and simulated yields while simulations based on crop models anticipate water supply substantially driving crop yields capturing the relationship between weather and crop yields shows no clear association as shown in fig 8 the climatology of the drought indices predominantly remains the same having negligible impact on annual rice yields this can be better represented during the drought year 2015 wherein the annual yields increased despite the prevalence of stress conditions throughout the country however this situation can be better interpreted by the decrease in yield in 2016 mainly due to the persistence of drought spell from 2015 until mid 2016 overall we see a continuous increase in annual yields irrespective of the stress conditions and no conclusive pattern in the behavior of drought parameters and crop yields can be deduced on a regional basis as drought is primarily a local phenomenon such trends may be more distinct on provincial levels fig s4 supplementary material simulated yields are shown for selected provinces e g pailin preah vihear but due to the lack of actual provincial yields data conclusions could not be drawn from the analysis the severity index and precipitation totals showed a good correlation with the prevalence of severe stress conditions i e high severity and lower precipitation during the start of growing season june and a gradual reduction of stress conditions i e less severity and increased precipitation in the subsequent months sep oct similarly we investigated the number of days with air temperature exceeding 30 c fig 8e within each growing season to identify any noticeable impact on agricultural yields most crops have an energy budget from sowing to harvest accounted for using the growing degree day gdd which was computed based on the maximum minimum and average ambient temperatures however the plant productivity photosynthetic capacity almost becomes negligible above an average temperature of 30 c therefore we analyzed the number of days where the ambient average temperature is above 30 c to evaluate the stress on the crop we found record number of days above 30 c in the planting season during the stress periods most notably during the 2015 2016 drought event likewise the standardized drought indices 3 12 month spi drought severity and precipitation totals were examined the 3 and 12 month spi for the growing season period jun oct were compared with the rice yields to analyze the stress conditions during the growing season fig 8a and 8b the 3 month index was used to capture the short and medium term moisture conditions and estimate the precipitation trends during the important stages of crop growth whereas the 12 month standardized index provided a cumulative overview of the short term precipitation patterns i e long term precipitation patterns rheas was able to capture the decrease in yield during the drought events of 2002 2004 and 2008 but exhibited a contrasting behavior during the later drought events e g 2010 2015 it should be noted that the agreement between the drought indices and yield only accounts for the physical changes within the growing season however the growing season drought variability invariably remains normal to mild wet spi 0 for most years 2005 onwards during the simulation period thus following an increasing trend of rice yields during those years as shown in fig 8 the growing season jun oct exhibited negligible impact from water stress conditions however the study does not categorically indicate the prevalence of stress free conditions throughout the study period instead as shown in fig 7 stress conditions mostly occurred during the initial months feb may which subsequently alleviated to mild near normal conditions at the onset of the growing season as the drought conditions were notably significant in capturing the interannual yield variability we evaluated other management factors such as fertilizer application rates cultivar varieties that could possibly drive the associated changes since the meteorological variables e g precipitation ambient temperature etc and cultivar varieties from wang et al 2017 remained same throughout the study period the only variable factor in the analysis was the rate of fertilizer application adopted from fao world bank since 2008 the fertilizer rates have steadily increased over the years echoing a strong resemblance with observed and simulated yields fig 9 a strong correlation is noted between observed yields and fertilizer application rates during the 2008 2016 period r2 0 84 with a similarly high value between simulated yields and fertilizer rates r2 0 92 although less information was available on the local application rates a significant pattern can be noted from the analysis with increased consumption of fertilizer rates since 2008 the interannual yields have been steadily increasing each year as seen in fig 9 prior to the aforementioned period the fertilizer application rates remained the same hence the initial timeframe 2000 2005 arrayed lower yields as the management practices e g fertilizer application rates in a country depend on the socioeconomic conditions of the farmers and the support of local governments the fertilizer application rates in cambodia have still not reached optimum levels compared to the neighboring mekong countries such as vietnam and thailand and exhibit abundant scope for improvement in the near future hence considering the results obtained from rheas the consistent increase in yield can be significantly attributed to the application of chemical based fertilizers 4 conclusions the rheas framework facilitates end to end modeling that helps understand the impacts of evolving weather hydrology climate and farm management practices on the crop status and yield thus making its design unique based on the current application rheas showed reasonable performance in capturing the agricultural and meteorological drought variability over lmb based on the information available from the drought indices the results from the study depicted a common persistence of mild medium dry conditions over cambodia during the initial months but the overall stress dwindles with the onset of monsoon at the start of the growing season june onwards in short the feb may period witnesses significant stress conditions whereas the growing season post june achieved a near normal to moderate wet conditions although mean annual precipitation has seen an increase over the years barring a few drought years there has been a decrease in dry season precipitation due to the irregularities in weather regimes however the continuous prevalence of severe drought events notably in 2015 16 has raised fears of occurrence of similar stress conditions in the drought prone provinces considering the results obtained from rheas there is a clear indication of a significant increase of drought prevalence in most areas of the lmb that may or may not have serious implications on the agriculture sector the rice yields in cambodia have been steadily witnessing an upward trend since the last decade mainly due to increasing fertilizer application rates and to some extent due to the modernization of farm practices techniques mechanization and improvements in technology the mekong river commission has cited a similar conclusion in their annual reports mrc 2014 of an increase in annual production of the four major crops including rice rheas was able to adequately capture the interannual variability of rice yields with observations r2 0 84 with low bias from 2005 onwards the growing season hydrologic stress conditions when compared with annual yields also did not reflect any significant effect on the crop status barring a few drought years however the drought indices exhibited lower agricultural yields in the water stress provinces located in the southeast regions of cambodia throughout the study period thus reflecting the impact of drought on crop status at provincial levels while the aforementioned situation envisages lower future yields due to elevating stress conditions substantial arguments can be made on comparing drought conditions with annual yields drought solely does not affect agricultural yields as cambodia inherently gets affected by flash flooding waterlogging possibly resulting in decreased yields and crop losses as the meteorological variables and cultivar type were kept the same throughout the study period the only variable factor for attaining higher yields can be attributed to the use of chemical fertilizers although the fertilizer application rates in cambodia are well behind the neighboring mekong countries

4442,stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation which are sensitive to climate change and the water cycle are widely used as natural tracers to investigate hydrological processes and paleoclimate reconstruction high resolution event based precipitation sampling was conducted in guilin a subtropical monsoon climate region in southwest china from 2010 to 2016 to identify the temporal variability of stable isotopes of precipitation and its dominant meteorological factors the results showed that the stable isotopes of precipitation exhibited significant seasonal variability with lower values in the wet season and higher values in the dry season reflecting the changes in the character of precipitation in response to seasonal variability of the moisture sources and atmospheric dynamics Î´18o values were significantly negatively correlated with temperature and potential evapotranspiration et0 on the daily and monthly timescales however there was no significant correlation between monthly Î´18o and the amount of rainfall multivariate regression analysis showed that when temperature precipitation amount and et0 were considered 39 of the variability of the monthly oxygen isotope composition of precipitation was explained monthly mean temperature had a higher covariation with precipitation Î´18o indicating that the variations of precipitation isotope were more dependent on temperature but not substantially dependent on the amount effect of rainfall howerver the main influence of meteorological factors on the isotopic variations of precipitation varied seasonally temperature strongly influenced the isotopic composition of precipitation in summer while the amount effect was prominent due to the enhanced convective activity characterized by more depleted Î´18o values although evapotranspiration is a minor contributor of precipitation isotope variability the impact of evapotranspiration on the enrichment of precipitation isotopes in autumn is a substantial control and should be considered which makes a major contribution to compensate for the depletion in heavy isotopes of rainfall the non linear relationship between d excess and et0 was attributed to the variable contribution of large scale convective moisture and local evaporation as well as water vapor transfer processes the response of precipitation stable isotopes to convective events was characterized by distinct stage patterns associated with the water vapor sources and physical processes during rainout the significant depletion of precipitation Î´18o values during convective events was not due to the amount effect but due to large scale convection activity these findings provide further insight into intraevent scale isotopic variations associated with organized convection and their key influencing factors which ultimately improves our interpretation of the paleoclimate records in subtropical monsoon regions keywords hydrogen and oxygen isotopes d excess evapotranspiration moisture mass source convection activity 1 introduction stable isotopes i e 2h and 18o in natural waters are widely used as tracers to investigate climate change and hydrological processes dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 clark and fritz 1997 sÃ¡nchez murillo et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 tian and wang 2019 since they are constituents of the water molecule and are deemed as fingerprints of water stable isotopic signals of modern precipitation preserved in speleothem ice cores tree ring cellulose etc are very important for reconstructing paleoclimate environments dayem et al 2010 pfahl and sodemann 2014 markowsk et al 2016 krklec et al 2018 however complex isotopic fractionation effects are involved in the water cycle transfer processes gat 1971 stewart 1975 resulting in stable isotopes of precipitation that are closely related to environmental parameters krklec et al 2018 yang et al 2019 therefore enhancing our understanding of the environmental information contained in rainfall and the mechanism underlying current isotopic changes is of significance increasing studies have been done to determine the factors controlling precipitation isotopes in low and middle latitude regions with a strong monsoon influence kurita et al 2009 dayem et al 2010 ansari et al 2020 which are widely applied to interpret the paleoclimate implications aggarwal et al 2016 thompson et al 2000 risi et al 2008b ishizaki et al 2012 the global relationship between Î´d and Î´18o in meteoric waters was firstly recognized by craig 1961a and subsequently defined as the global meteoric water line gmwl Î´d 8 Î´18o 10 which provides a foundational reference to identify whether equilibrium or non equilibrium fractionation processes affect the precipitation isotopes sÃ¡nchez murillo et al 2016 esquivel hernÃ¡ndez et al 2019 in 1961 the water resources program of the international atomic energy agency iaea and world meteorological organization wmo established the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip which was used to delineate the controls on spatio temporal patterns of global precipitation isotopes rozanski et al 1993 unfortunately many stations have terminated the monitoring projects and these monitoring data mainly provide the monthly weighted values therefore there is still a lack of high resolution dataset to characterize long term variations of daily Î´18o and Î´d of precipitation moreover there are many factors that influence the changes in precipitation Î´18o and Î´d such as latitude precipitation amount temperature and elevation gat 1971 dublyansky et al 2018 different moisture sources trajectory of air masses xie et al 2011 krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 sÃ¡nchez murillo et al 2016 yu et al 2017 krklec et al 2018 xia et al 2019 ansari et al 2020 and orographic effects balagizi et al 2018 antunes et al 2019 can also modify the stable isotope of precipitation in recent years increasing isotope studies have been conducted to investigate spatio temporal variations of precipitation isotopes antunes et al 2019 guo et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 xia et al 2019 bedaso et al 2020 and their dominant influencing factors kumar et

determined the effects of water vapor sources and weather conditions on the stable isotope changes in precipitation in asia he and richards 2016 investigated the influence of monsoon on the moisture dynamics and annual variability during the onset of summer monsoon and the prevailing summer monsoon season in nagqu qinghai tibeteau plateau guo et al 2019 analyzed the spatial distribution of precipitation Î´18o and Î´d in china and the influencing factors many studies have recently been conducted across china including hong kong yang et al 2019 guangzhou xie et al 2011 fuzhou xu et al 2019 changsha wu et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 lanzhou chen et al 2015 2017 nagqu he and richards 2016 and qinghai tibetan plateau gao et al 2013 yu et al 2017 for guilin many researchers have also studied the temporal variations of stable isotopes in precipitation and their influencing factors for example liu et al 1987 first established the lmwl for guilin by using the monthly average Î´18o and Î´d values in precipitation from 1983 to 1985 and found a negative relationship between monthly average Î´18o values and the amount of precipitation tu et al 2004 analyzed the stable isotopic compositions of precipitation based on the monthly average dataset 1983 1998 obtained from the gnip network and then revised the lmwl zhang et al 2015 characterized the daily variations in the Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation from 2008 to 2012 zhu et al 2017 examined the temporal variations of precipitation Î´18o values in 2012 and its relationship with the water vapor sources although previous studies have assessed the variations of precipitation isotopes in guilin to reveal the key controlling factors and determine the influence of moisture sources on the variations of stable isotope of precipitation knowledge gaps still exist on long term temporal variations in stable isotopes of precipitation and their controlling factors on the event based scale moreover the isotope composition of event based samples can provide more detailed information on water dynamics especially short term water vapor exchange and rainout crawford et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 bedaso and wu 2020 although stable isotopes have been monitored in event based precipitation risi et al 2008b xie et al 2011 crawford et al 2013 yang et al 2019 zhou and li 2018 the sampling durations are still relatively short approximately 1 2 years to our knowledge neither the variable patterns of precipitation isotopes nor the control factors have been better studied with ongoing global climate change in particular the influence of continuous heavy rainfall events on variations in the Î´18o and Î´d of precipitation is unclear evapotranspiration and sub cloud evaporation are considered to have important effects on the precipitation isotopes gat 1995 aemisegger et al 2015 dayem et al 2010 ishizaki et al 2012 salamalikis et al 2016 christner et al 2018 wang et al 2021 furthermore many studies have demonstrated that the variability of precipitation stable isotopes was driven by large scale atmospheric circulation berkelhammer et al 2012 wang et al 2021 a proper understanding of the large scale convection berg et al 2013 water vopor recycling trenberth 1999 and below cloud interaction between raindrops and ambient water vapor is crucial yang et al 2011 aemisegger et al 2015 salamalikis et al 2016 mÃ¼ller et al 2017 which may be reflect the character of precipitation in response to changes in climate the complexity of dynamical and microphysical processes can give rise to significant modification of precipitation isotopes and even could overshadow the dependence of Î´18o on temperature and amount of precipitation on short timescales bowen and wilkinson 2002 zwart et al 2018 it is expected to provide implementation constraints for the unrecognized mechanisms determining isotopic variations of water vapor and precipitation this will be very important for interpreting isotope variability in proxy archives such as speleothems and tropical ice krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 christner et al 2018 however these microphysical processes affecting the falling hydrometeors from the cloud base towards the ground are still poorly constrained because they are difficult to observe or model with an insufficient high resolution datasets yang et al 2011 aggarwal et al 2016 salamalikis et al 2016 for the previous studies these controls are ignored or considered negligibly in comparison with the classical isotope effects i e altitude latitude or continental effects dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 to evaluate their impact however an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that these effects are significant contributors to the stable isotope variability of precipitation krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 aemisegger et al 2015 aggarwal et al 2016 christner et al 2018 wang et al 2020 for example berkelhammer et al 2012 found that approximately 40 of event scale isotopic variability arised from the percentage of convective precipitation and relative humidity conditions in california usa risi et al 2008b reported that predominant fractionation processes in tropical areas are related to the falling process and reevaporation of precipitation due to diffusive exchange with surrounding vapor aemisegger 2018 and christner et al 2018 highlighted the impacts of below cloud evaporation rainout and evapotranspiration on short term variability of stable isotopes in near surface water vapor and precipitation associated with central european cold fronts more importantly recent studies pointed out that the large scale circulation regimes are closely linked to cloud modes rainfall types and the properties of convection berkelhammer et al 2012 aggarwal et al 2016 zwart et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2020 moreover deuterium excess dansgaard 1964 hereafter referred to d excess can act as an effective parameter to infer the influence of evaporation on changes in the stable isotopes of precipitation and enrichment effects aemisegger 2018 the d excess which depends on sea surface temperature relative humidity and wind speed at the source of moisture merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 aemisegger and sjolte 2018 can provide more insight into moisture recycling processes therefore in our study we evaluated the effects of evapotranspiration on the stable isotopes of precipitation and discussed the seasonal relationships between d excess and et0 from 2010 to 2016 at present the effects of evaporation on Î´18o and Î´d are of more concern in the fields of cave drip water markowsk et al 2016 surface river wu et al 2019 and lake and wetland hydrology stewart 1975 mayr et al 2007 to reveal the effects of evaporation on hydrological processes and the uncertainty of cave sediment responses to climate change markowsk et al 2016 esquivel hernÃ¡ndez et al 2018 affolter et al 2020 in this study we synthesized some precipitation isotopic data for other stations in the subtropical monsoon region of southern china from previous studies the objectives of our study were to estimate the temporal variability of stable isotopes in precipitation from 2010 to 2016 and their dominant influencing factors in guilin southwest china to further investigate how evaporation controls the evolution of precipitation stable isotopes and to investigate the response of stable isotopes to individual convective event we established the relationship between the lowest Î´18o values and precipitation amount to determine whether the amount effect during convective events was the dominant factor controlling the changes in precipitation stable isotopes 2 study area guilin 25 15 23 n 110 19 25 e is located in the northeast of the guangxi autonomous region southwest china fig 1 this study area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with a hot rainy summer and a cold dry winter based on data from the guilin meteoriological station during the period 1951 to 2017 the average annual rainfall was 1884 mm and is mainly concentrated in april through august which accounts for approximately 70 in the total annual precipitation amount the annual average air temperature was approximately 19 0 c with the maximum temperature of 28 2 c in july the minimum temperature 7 9 c was observed in january maximum and minimum monthly precipitation of 359 mm and 50 mm were observed in june and december respectively the local atmospheric circulation is mainly controlled by different monsoon systems generally the warm summer prevails from april to september when the moisture originates from the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western subtropical pacific zhang et al 2015 however during the winter season october to march the water vapor masses originate mostly from the westerlies or from continental areas around guilin liu et al 1987 zhu et al 2017 recycled moisture is an important contributor to precipitation in the winter season wu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zhang 2020 the study site exhibits four distinct astronomical seasons of spring february april summer may july autumn august october and winter november january 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling precipitation sampling was performed at the institute of karst geology 25 15 n 110 19 e altitude 152 m a s l guilin southwest china a combined dataset of 543 daily precipitation samples was collected from 2010 to 2016 of these the Î´d and Î´18o data of precipitation in guilin from 2010 to 2012 was collected from the published studies by wu et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015 the remaining data 2013 2016 of about 264 samples was the new data in 2013 specifically there were only seven samples for stable isotope analyses available between november and december 2013 the sampling device was installed on the roof of the laboratory building in the institute of karst geology at a height of 2 m above the ground the device was comprised of a funnel connected to a cylindrical vessel to prevent evaporation of water samples we put a ping pong ball on the funnel to help seal the collector and a film of paraffin oil was added to the bottom of the container to reduce evaporative loss samples were removed from collectors immediately after each rain stopped except in the case of light rainfall which resulted in an insufficient sample the water samples were immediately filtered through 0 45 Î¼m filter membranes and sealed in 15 ml high density polyethylene vials they were stored in a refrigerator at approximately 4 c until being analyzed during summer monsoon rainstorms high resolution sampling was conducted at hourly intervals moreover we collected some extremely negative Î´18o data of convective precipitation with an extended period of 2008 2010 from zhang et al 2015 in order to confirm whether the amount effect of precipitation is the main cause of the more negative Î´18o signal in convective precipitation events meteorological data of the same period were documented by the guilin meteorological station 7 km away from the sampling site we also collected isotopic data with relatively long time series from eight sites within subtropical monsoon climate regions of southern china chongqing changsha fuzhou guangzhou guiyang hong kong kunming and xiamen these data are available in public repositories such as the gnip dataset http www naweb iaea org or derived from publications these stations were included as references to illustrate the changes in the stable isotopes of precipitation in guilin and regional atmospheric circulation regimes the locations of the sampling sites are projected in fig 1 the geographic position and meteorological information for each site are summarized in table 1 3 2 isotopic analysis stable water isotopes of precipitation samples were analyzed using a laser absorption water vapour isotope analyser picarro i2130 ca usa conducted at the chinese academy of geological sciences for every isotopic standard and sample an analytical run requires six consecutive injections via a microliter syringe to reduce the instrument s memory effect the first two analysis results were discarded and the arithmetic mean value of the last four records was considered as the final result zhou et al 2019 all analysis results are expressed as Î´ values in per mille relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961b gonfiantini 1978 iaea 2017 with the precision of 0 1 for Î´18o values and 1 for Î´d values note that the isotopic measurements is not only affected by the analytical uncertainty associated with rainfall isotopes and possibly also by small biases due to evaporation during sample collection aemisegger et al 2015 fischer et al 2019 the definition of Î´ as the relative difference of the isotopic ration with respect to vsmow is 1 Î´ r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard stand for the isotope ratios 2h 1h and 18o 16o of the sample and the vsmow standard respectively in this study the measured daily mean Î´18o and Î´d data during 2010 2016 were used to formulate the local meteoric water line lmwl equation using the ordinary least squares linear regression 3 3 potential evapotranspiration et0 the penman monteith model is regarded as a standard method for estimating the potential evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 due to its physically based characteristics that enable the incorporation of aerodynamic and physiological parameters the penman monteith formula is e

http data cma cn 3 4 data analysis in this study pearson correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the correlations between isotope composition of precipitation Î´18o Î´d and d excess and climate parameters such as temperature precipitation amount and et0 using the spss 20 0 software the correlation coefficients at different time scales are summarized in table 3 and table s1 the variables affecting the stable isotope composition of precipitation are relatively well known dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 however the empirical correlation of these controls termed temperature effect amount effect is inadequate to interpret the stable isotope variability in terms of paleoclimate ishizaki et al 2012 because it is assumed that the isotopic composition of precipitation is controlled by a single climatic factor duy et al 2018 however the isotopic signature of precipitation has been found to be not simply related to single meteorological factor but to precipitation seasonality large scale monsoon circulation and microphysical processes risi et al 2008a sturm et al 2010 aggarwal et al 2016 this means that the isotopic composition of rainfall cannot be described adequately by single factor linear correlations otherwise it can lead to a larger bias for the paleoclimate reconstructions sturm et al 2010 duy et al 2018 therefore a multivariate linear regression was developed in this study to quantitatively identify the integrated influence of all possible factor combinations on the isotopic variation of precipitation the multivariate regression model is described as 3 Î´ 18 o Î² 1 x 1 Î² 2 x 2 Î² 3 x 3 Î² n x n Î² 0 where Î²n is the partial regression coefficient with respect to different climatic factors xn refers to the possible meteorological parameters and Î²0 is the constant or the intercept in this study monthly mean values of temperature precipitation amount and et0 are considered in the multivariate linear regression model 4 results 4 1 temporal variations of stable isotopes in precipitation stable isotope data of all precipitation events and corresponding daily air temperature precipitation and et0 in guilin between 2010 and 2016 are presented in fig 2 the average daily temperature was 19 8 c ranging from 0 2 to 32 6 c the maximum monthly temperature occurred in july while the minimum monthly temperature was in january daily rainfall varied from 0 to 145 7 mm the maximum monthly precipitation amount 444 7 mm occurred in june while the minimum amount 41 6 mm occurred in october fig 3 daily mean et0 varied from 0 7 to 7 5 mm with an average of 3 0 mm and a strong seasonal pattern controlled by meteorological conditions based on all of the isotopic measurements the daily Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation varied from 17 07 to 2 48 and from 139 5 to 43 2 with average values of 5 55 and 31 7 respectively mean weighted daily Î´18o and Î´d values were 6 20 and 37 5 respectively which were relatively more negative than the calculated average values the monthly average Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation during the period 2010 to 2016 ranged from 12 40 to 0 75 and 97 9 to 10 5 with average values of 5 59 and 32 1 respectively table 2 moreover the more negative Î´18o values were observed in august instead of in june with the maximum monthly precipitation fig 3 guo et al 2015 antunes et al 2019 according to fig 2 the Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation also exhibited significant seasonal and inter annual variation table 2 with more negative isotope values in the wet season may september and less negative isotopes in the winter precipitation october mid april generally the maximum Î´18o value was observed in spring while the minimum value was observed in autumn the average Î´18o and Î´d values in summer were similar to or slightly more negative than the daily weighted average values table 2 at the inter annual scale the most negative Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation were observed in 2014 and the most enriched Î´18o and Î´d values were observed in 2016 the magnitude of the interannual variations of the weighted mean Î´18o and Î´d values was 2 47 and 22 1 respectively 4 2 deuterium excess the deuterium excess d Î´d 8 Î´ 18o was proposed by dansgaard 1964 and is associated with meteorological conditions in vapor source regions the variation in d excess originates from the contributions of non equilibrium fractionation in the water vapor transfer process i e evaporation and condensation aemisegger et al 2014 indicating the secondary evaporation effect the d excess values in guilin ranged from 14 82 to 36 04 with a mean value of 12 66 in the rainy season the range of d excess values was from 14 82 to 23 93 with an arithmetic mean of 10 1 in the cold season it ranged from 4 56 to 36 04 with a mean of 16 5 the characteristics of seasonal and inter annual variation were also represented in d excess fig 4 the lower values of d excess 10 were observed during the summer monsoon may mid october while the higher values 10 occurred during the dry season late october april table 2 the highest monthly mean d excess value was 18 85 in december while the lowest was 6 30 in august moreover the average d excess in autumn was lower than 10 and in summer it was very close to the global average value 4 3 local meteoric water line according to the event based stable water isotope data the lmwl was established as Î´d 8 82 Î´18o 17 21 r2 0 97 p 0 01 n 543 fig 5 a the slope and intercept of the lmwl were both higher than those of the gmwl and the meteoric water line of china cmwl Î´d 7 9 Î´18o 8 2 r2 0 98 zheng et al 1983 the linear regression line for the monthly precipitation isotopes defined lmwl as Î´d 9 05 Î´18o 18 55 r2 0 97 p 0 01 n 70 table 2 a higher slope and intercept were found compared to that for all samples taken together due to reducing the bias associated with small rainfall to illustrate the impact that the seasons have on the lmwl fig 5b shows the Î´18o and Î´d data of every month in summer may june most of july samples and part of autumn september october samples lie above or close to the gmwl for spring february and april partial autumn august and summer samples e g samples in july 2016 they ploy below the gmwl in winter november january and partial spring march most of the samples lie above the gmwl with a higher d excess table 2 according to fig 5c and table 2 there are distinct linear relationships in different seasons on the seasonal scale the lmwl during spring and winter e g december january february deviated slightly from that established by using the daily Î´18o and Î´d data between 2010 and 2016 it is characterized by a similar slope and intercept to the total lmwl of all the samples taken together in addition the slope and intercept in autumn were closer to the global average values the summer lmwl showed a slope of 8 54 with a lower intercept and d excess value of 10 table 2 however on a single monthly scale the slope and intercept of the fitted lines in july august and september were both lower than those of the gmwl table 2 with the exception of the intercept in september we also determined the lmwl for the dry and rainy seasons in table 2 the slopes and intercepts in both two seasons were larger than those of gmwl and cmwl reflecting the warm and humid climatic characteristics in guilin moreover the slope and intercept in the dry season were higher than those in the rainy season thus less negative Î´18o and Î´d values were found in the dry season while the rainy season showed more negative Î´18o and Î´d values 4 4 statistical relationships between precipitation Î´18o d excess and climate parameters we evaluated the relationships between precipitation Î´18o values d excess and local climate parameters table 3 fig 6 and fig s1 which varied with different time scales a weak significantly negative correlation between Î´18o values and precipitation was observed at the daily timescale r 0 141 p 0 01 n 543 while there was no significant correlation between monthly Î´18o values and the amount of rainfall r 0 155 p 0 01 n 66 comparatively speaking there

seasonal correlations between Î´18o and precipitation temperature and et0 were different a statistically significant negative correlation between Î´18o and precipitation amount appeared in autumn r 0

et0 were not significant while a positive correlation was observed in autumn r 0 181 p 0 01 supplementary table s1 as for d excess daily d excess correlated negatively with daily mean temperature r 0

table 3 however the annual weighted mean precipitation Î´18o and d excess values correlated neither with annual mean precipitation amount nor with annual mean temperature in addition they also showed

meteorological parameters 5 1 1 precipitation amount effect meteorological parameters e g temperature precipitation amount are considered to play a key controls on the stable isotope variations in precipitation dansgaard 1964 as meteorological parameters are easily available in this study we analyzed the factors controlling the changes of isotope composition of precipitation at different time scales the amount effect of precipitation is commonly observed at monthly time scale in low latitude ocean and coastal areas dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 martinelli et al 1996 however many studies suggested that the isotopic variations of precipitation did not depend on the local rainfall amount effect bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 but on the regional precipitation or upstream precipitation processes kurita et al 2009 krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2020 for example crawford et al 2013 found that the amount effect was weak in the sydney region while the precipitation Î´18o was highly correlated with the air mass s prior cumulative precipitation ansari et al 2020 showed that the amount of rainfall had a poor correlation with precipitation Î´18o values in the indian subcontinent during the indian summer monsoon nlend et al 2020 concluded that upstream convective activity is a major control of rainwater isotope composition in the tropics at daily seasonal and inter annual timescales in the present study a weak statistically significant negative correlation between Î´18o and precipitation amount was observed at a daily time scale r 0 141 p 0 01 however our data showed a poor correlation between monthly Î´18o values and the corresponding precipitation amount table 3 fig s1d in the supplementary information which is consistent with the result reported by zhu et al 2017 this is potentially attributed to the influence of small rainfall amount samples which may contribute a small proportion to the monthly mean calculation resulting in a weakened monthly Î´18o amount relationship the influences of small precipitation events also can be supported by the difference between daily mean and weighted mean Î´18o and Î´d values in addition similar results were also found in southeast china e g guangzhou changsha xie et al 2011 wu et al 2015 which share the same subtropical monsoon system these similar results highlight that the amount effect does not influence the isotopic variations at the daily and monthly timescales in the subtropical regions indicating other processes may be involved kurita et al 2009 concluded that the isotopic variation in the indochina peninsula stations reflected the atmospheric circulation pattern and was unrelated to the precipitation amount during the rainy season when the relationship between Î´18o values and rainfall amount is considered for individual years with the exception of 2012 none of them showed a significant correlation it is worth noting that positive correlation between precipitation amount and Î´18o values was observed for the year 2016 table s1 this was potentially related to droughts that occurred in 2016 when the annual rainfall was much lower than the multi year average precipitation table 2 this positive relationship in the dry years occurs mainly because of more intense evaporation from water and soil surfaces leads to relatively heavier isotope values in precipitation risi et al 2008b christner et al 2018 consequently local recycled moisture becomes a major contributor to some rainfall events zhang 2020 resulting in a weakened rainfall effect at the interannual scale correlations between the weighted annual mean Î´18o values and annual precipitation amount however are not significant r 0 358 p 0 01 moreover what controls the inter annual variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation is fairly complex this will be further explored in the future when more years of data can be available on a seasonal scale the amount effect of precipitation is more prominent in autumn and winter table s1 in our study the average monthly Î´18o values from august to october were 8 28 7 97 and 7 36 respectively with a mean value of 7 87 which was relatively depleted compared with the weighted mean values of all samples together meanwhile the arithmetic and weighted average values of the Î´18o in autumn were much lower with values of 8 23 and 8 86 respectively this situation is mainly due to the fact that the autumn is in the prevailing summer monsoon and water vapor is mostly derived from low latitude oceanic areas such as the bay of bengal the south china sea or the western pacific ocean zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 zhang 2020 which brought a relatively warm humid moisture and is prone to form strong convective events generating large volumes of precipitation this leads to the isotopic depletions and exhibits the enhanced precipitation effect in autumn however the correlation coefficient between Î´18o value and precipitation was still low in autumn r 0 218 indicating that the precipitation isotope during the strong monsoon period may reflect the integrated influences of water vapor sources and some microphysical processes risi et al 2008a associated with the large scale convection risi et al 2008b dayem et al 2010 berkelhammer et al 2012 crawford et al 2013 bedaso et al 2020 nlend et al 2020 but not substantially depend on the amount effect in guangzhou another city in the subtropical monsoon region of china xie et al 2011 reported that precipitation with more negative Î´d and Î´18o generally occurred during summer and autumn and a significant negative correlation existed between Î´18o and rainfall amount zhou et al 2019 also reported that there was obvious seasonal variations in stable isotopes of precipitation in changsha with depleted values in summer and autumn according to table 1 the monthly mean Î´18o value of precipitation in guilin is very close to that in the guangzhou chongqing and hong kong stations in addition the slopes and intercepts both for the event based samples and monthly scale were similar to those of other stations such as chongqing zhou and li 2018 changsha wu et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 guangzhou xie et al 2011 hong kong yang et al 2019 and fuzhou xu et al 2019 indicating that the rainfall belongs to the same subtropical monsoon climate region with the same water vapor sources and control factors therefore the relationship between Î´18o values and precipitation in autumn probably contributed to the mature monsoon precipitation characterized by distinctly lower Î´18o sometimes these values could be below 12 0 which were much lower than the average value of the total samples these rainfall events occur mainly in the form of tropical cyclones or typhoons influenced by strong convective activities lawrence et al 2004 kurita et al 2009 pape et al 2010 bedaso et al 2020 interestingly a significant negative relationship existed between daily Î´18o values and precipitation amount in the dry season october to march r 0 347 p 0 01 with a higher value of r2 relative to the wet season table s1 this result indicates that the observed Î´18o in the dry season is more sensitive to low precipitation than that in regimes with high summer precipitation bedaso et al 2020 this is probably due to the mixed moisture of local evapotranspirated moisture and monsoon precipitation at the onset of the wet season i e march or autumn season when rainfall events always have more depleted Î´18o values and they contribute largely to the mean seasonal rainfall in addition as the temperature decreases from november the reduced evaporation greatly limits the enrichment of rainfall isotopes which in combination leads to the effect of rainfall during the dry season in summary water vapor from the low latitude marine source region is predominant during the wet season april september with depleted isotopic precipitation this is contrary to the dry season when recycled moisture with a drier vapor source predominates yielding enriched precipitation the Î´d and Î´18o values of precipitation may provide more information on atmospheric cycle in a seasonal cycle and dry and wet dynamics in the process of air mass transfer from ocean to inland jiang et al 2019 5 1 2 temperature effect the positive correlation between isotopic value and air temperature is called the temperature effect in the present study there was a negative relationship between precipitation Î´18o and temperature at the daily monthly and seasonal scales with the exception of the autumn season fig s1b table s1 in the supplementary material reflecting an inverse temperature effect as shown in table s1 on both daily and monthly scales temperature is better correlated with Î´18o values than amount of precipitation on seasonal scales a positive correlation between Î´18o values and temperature was observed in autumn when mean air temperature 25 6 c was obviously higher than the multi year average 19 0 c accompanied by low rainfall amount table 2 under the exclusion of some heavy storms during this season it comprehensively reflected the local dry and hot climate these systems have lower humidity and easily induce a more intense terrestrial evaporation or below cloud evaporation salamalikis et al 2016 resulting in relatively enriched isotope values especially for small events in autumn or september this also can be confirmed by the monthly regression lines between Î´18o and Î´d in july august september precipitation with a lower slopes and intercepts compared to the gmwl table 2 indicating that a strong evaporation exists in the late summer or early autumn therefore the positive correlation between Î´18o and temperature was observed in autumn which can be attributed to the climatic characteristic of the study area however the slope and intercept of the regression line in autumn were very close to those of gmwl characterized by more negative average Î´18o and Î´d values table 2 the isotopic variability in precipitation was potentially related to seasonal changes in the moisture origin and rainfall types lee and fung 2008 ansari et al 2020 valdivielso et al 2020 in the autumn tropical convective rainfall is dominant and frequent and its water vapor was mainly derived from the indian and east asian summer monsoon dayem et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 zhang 2020 hence the convective air mass from distant oceans forms a more depleted isotopic signal of precipitation as previously noted there was a significant negative correlation between Î´18o and rainfall amount p 0 01 while precipitation Î´18o had a weak positive correlation with temperature in autumn and the correlation coefficient of the former 0 218 was higher than that of the latter 0 033 overall the amount effect in autumn had a greater impact on the precipitation Î´18o compared with the temperature effect which is in accordance with the results reported by zhou and li 2018 xia et al 2019 showed that the Î´18o variability of precipitation in five regions of asia were caused by the synergy between temperature and precipitation but the degree to which effect does a dominant control on isotope variation was seasonal therefore the isotopic signals of precipitation in autumn is the integrated result of moisture source and atmospheric conditions in comparison a significant negative correlation between temperature and precipitation Î´18o p 0 01 n 189 was found in summer at this time the monsoon system was gradually active which brought a large amount of warm and humid airflow and the correlation coefficient was 0 28 which was also the largest value relative to the other seasons these results indicate that the temperature effect has an important constraint on the variations of stable isotopes in precipitation in the early summer monsoon and as monsoon matures the amount effect takes control of the isotopic compositions of precipitation this result also was found in other monsoon regions he and richards 2016 zhou and li 2018 based on the above analysis the results show that precipitation Î´18o has a higher correlation with temperature than amount of precipitation on both the daily and monthly timescales especially the monthly mean temperature has a stronger correlation with the precipitation isotope signal r 0 71 p 0 01 explaining 50 of the isotope variability in precipitation however the amount of precipitation accounts for less than 3 of the varaibility in precipitation oxygen isotope composition at the two scales indicating that the amount effect of rainfall is not the dominant factor affecting the precipitation isotope variation in guilin although precipitation Î´18o had significant correlations with temperature on the daily and monthly scales or with amount of precipitation in autumn the correlation coefficients were relative low indicating a limited control of single factor over precipitation Î´18o duy et al 2018 we performed a multivariate regression analysis that considered both temperature and precipitation data to determine if these two variables could explain a larger percentage of the isotope variability of precipitation according to eq 3 the regression result showed that the combined amount of precipitation and temperature effects explain 37 of the variability of the oxygen precipitation composition p 0 01 however there is not simple sum of the two effects probably due to some overlapping controls or the nonsynergistic effects of temperature and precipitation at the same time to explain the isotopic variability of precipitation krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 it is worth noting that the slope or constant associated with temperature is higher than that of rainfall in either the single parameter correlation or the multivariate correlation moreover the significance level of the temperature s slope is more higher with a larger r2 of 0 35 p 0 0001 compared to that of precipitation amount in the multivariate regression model r2 0 01 p 0 15 implying that temperature is the main contributor of the precipitation isotope variability in guilin 5 1 3 control effect of et0 on the variation in Î´18o the processes of evaporation and condensation play crucial role in modifying the water isotopes occuring at phase changes in the hydrological cycle dansgaard 1964 rosenfeld and mintz 1988 gat 1995 dayem et al 2010 aemisegger et al 2015 salamalikis et al 2016 valdivielso et al 2020 according to the fractionation distillation the evaporation process substantially leads to the enrichment of heavy isotopes in this study using et0 as an indicator of the evaporation capacity for a particular area we evaluated the interrelation between precipitation Î´18o values and et0 in guilin a significant negative correlation between precipitation Î´18o and et0 was observed at both the daily and monthly scales see the supplementary fig s1c and table s1 which was similar to the temperature effect this result is contrary to the evaporative enrichment theory indicating that the isotope water variation does not completely comply with the extent of evaporation freshly evaporated water vapor from the continent tends to be more enriched than free tropospheric water vapor but not necessarily than evaporation from the ocean aemisegger et al 2014 in the rainy season the isotope composition of precipitation in a monsoon affected region is probably quite a bit more depleted than ocean surface water due to the large scale water vapor transport so the stable isotopes of precipitation are generally more negative which is really not related to the intensity of evaporation as opposed to this even though the mean relative humidity was high 84 during the sampling period in the dry season the weak rainfall intensities small droplets and lower falling velocities the possible lower relative humidity in the atmosphere above cloud may lead to the evaporative enrichment of precipitation aemisegger et al 2015 the below cloud evaporation has an important constraint on the processes inducing isotopic equilibration between rain droplets and ambient water vapor producing enriched isotopic signatures of precipitation salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2021 especially smaller raindrops are more favorable to evaporation trenberth 1999 the isotopic enrichment also depends on the isotope composition of soil water because soil dominates the supply of atmospheric moisture in the dry season characterized by more enriched Î´18o values due to soil evaporation aemisegger et al 2014 of course there are some small precipitation events in the wet season which is mainly derived from the local evapotranspiration they will tend to show more enriched evaporation fluxes due to high surface temperature and low rh they are generally not in isotopic equilibrium with the atmospheric water vapor ambient temperature and relative humidity are the main meteorological factors that affects the vertical isotopic variation of the falling raindrops berkelhammer et al 2012 salamalikis et al 2016 mÃ¼ller et al 2017 there is thus a strong coupling between the isotope signature of the evaporation flux and the hydrometeorology of the region e g frequency of rainfall type of rainfall systems in our study the dataset revealed distinct seasonal patterns positive relationships between Î´18o value and et0 were found in the autumn season whilst a weak negative correlation was observed in the spring summer and winter seasons table s1 moreover the correlation coefficient was largest in autumn with a value of 0 18 in particular evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation in autumn due to the higher temperature table 2 which is more susceptible to cause an intensive evaporation under a drier condition it is also supported by the positive correlation with the temperature in autumn table s1 as higher temperature promote re evaporation of raindrops combined with the linear regression analysis the rate of change of Î´18o versus et0 was 0 3898 mm in autumn it is evident that the impact of et0 on the enrichment of precipitation isotopes was mainly seen in the autumn season however as described previously the amount effect in autumn seems to conceal the temperature effect at this time the isotope composition of precipitation was relatively depleted which compensated for the rather high evaporation enrichment in autumn nevertheless the slopes and intercepts of the lmwl for the summer and autumn seasons were substantially low because of the increased evaporation thus the dual effects of precipitation amount and evaporation synergistically affect the isotope compositions of precipitation in autumn and the main role of evaporation effect was to compensate for the rainfall with the depletion in heavy isotopes however the control mechanism of water isotopes by evaporation is still rather complicated as shown in table 2 there is evidence of the evaporative enrichment of stable isotopes in precipitation with up to 3 09 for Î´18o in spring compared to the precipitation weighted values meanwhile precipitation data in winter were relatively enriched by up to 1 52 for Î´18o we also showed that this isotopic enrichment in the dry season was notably larger than that in the rainy season table 2 this result indicates that local evaporation or subcloud evaporation would be a contributing factor on the isotopic composition of precipitation in the dry season when the evapotranspiration et0 is considered together with temperature and amount of precipitation the multivariate regression explains 39 of variability in the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation p 0 01 eq 4 although the limited constraints on the precipitation variability due to evaporation effect the role of local evapotranspiration which is the major contributors to the recycled moisture mixed into the atmosphere in explaining the variability of oxygen isotope composition of precipitation in the dry conditions or during some particular months e g july october is very important for example the slopes for Î´18o et0 correlation are larger in the summer and autumn seasons with values of 0 59 and 0 55 respectively and the positive Î´18o et0 correlation may cause some alterations of precipitation Î´18o to more enriched values however the seasonal correlations of Î´18o composition with et0 were not significant see table s1 in the supplementary material only explaining 3 of the oxygen isotope variability in precipitation partial evaporation of falling droplets and their equilibration with the surrounding vapor in the atmosphere during the water vapor transfer processes could impact the isotope composition of precipitation so the isotopic variations do not potentially depend on surface evapotranspiration however the integrated effects including tempreture precipitation amount and et0 do not control the overall isotope values the results highlight that the impact of moisture sources and microphysical processes within the atmosphere may be potential contributors to the remaining variability of precipitation isotopes they thus should be considered in the future studies to quantify or model their controls according to the multivariate regression eq 4 considering the variation range of contributions from precipitation temperature and et0 the amount of precipitation has the least influence on Î´18o and the effect of evapotranspiration is also small however the coefficient associated with temperature is relatively higher suggesting that temperature has a larger covariate with precipitation Î´18o this is especially the case with summer precipitation confirming temperature is an important variable affecting the isotope composition of precipitation 5 2 relationship between d excess and et0 the raindrops that has experienced subcloud evaporation diverge from the gmwl or lmwl which tends to an increase in the d excess the d excess can act as an indicator to infer the influence of dynamic evaporation and moisture recycling crawford et al 2013 2017 aemisegger et al 2014 the relationships between d excess and et0 at different time scales were fundamentally different and were obviously observed in this study fig 6a fig 6b owing to differences in the moisture sources and microphysical processes governing rain formation aemisegger et al 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 valdivielso et al 2020 this argument is particularly well proved by the seasonal relationships between monthly mean d excess and et0 values a significant negative correlation between the monthly mean d excess and et0 was observed in the wet season may to october r 0 48 p 0 01 fig 6c with a mean value of 10 0 however a non linear relationship was found in the dry season november to april fig 6d with an average of 16 92 during the dry season falling raindrops become isotopically heavier and gradually equilibration with the heavier surrounding atmospheric vapor so the d excess values were generally more than 10 the degree of moisture isotopic exchange and atmospheric conditions during the falltime to the surface are an important controlling process in changes of the isotope content of precipitation rozanski et al 1993 salamalikis et al 2016 the larger d excess values are also closely related to the stronger continental water recycling trenberth 1999 risi et al 2008b wang et al 2021 as the continental evaporation in the dry season mainly occurs in the form of soil evaporation in addition the moisture source of precipitation in the dry season rarely depends on large scale convection from the ocean therefore the increasing contribution of local evaporation to the regional moisture budget and the decreasing importance of large scale convective moisture may be the primary reasons for explaining this d et0 non linear relation fig 6c valdivielso et al 2020 reviewed that the diverse moisture sources are reflected in changes of the d excess during the wet season precipitation is mainly sourced by summer monsoon system originating from the bay of bengal and the south china sea in forms of summer typhoons or convective rainfall events zhang et al 2015 characterized by more negative precipitation isotopes although surface evapotranspiration is higher in summer a higher rainfall rate associated with the monsoon convection dampens the evaporation of raindrops due to a shorter transit time and the degree of moisture isotopic exchange with vapor below the cloud base is lower during their fall lee and fung 2008 risi et al 2008a bedaso et al 2020 the water vapor is progressively depleted in heavy isotopes so the d excess value is normally less than 10 in this situation the effect of large scale moisture sources has a more pronounced impact on the d excess value than the effect of local evapotranspiration aemisegger et al 2014 in the present study the relationship between d excess and et0 in different seasons is more likely to be related to the different origins of the air masses and subsequent physical processes during the rain fall i e fractionation of raindrops re evaporation rain vapor interactions or mixing risi et al 2008a samuels crow et al 2014 tharammal et al 2017 christner et al 2018 ansari et al 2020 this is also the main reasons for the non linear relationship between d excess and et0 at the daily scale we found that when et0 was less than 3 0 mm the mean value of d excess was 13 84 with relatively enriched Î´d and Î´18o values indicating a relatively dry air the moisture sources mainly originated from surface recycled component into the unsaturated downdrafts trenberth 1999 characterized by a low precipitation rates thus the fraction of the reevaporated rain increases while the fractionation of a reequilibrum is less efficient because of the decreased relative humidity the isotope composition of precipitation is largely determined by soil water evaporation and the meteorological conditions salamalikis et al 2016 generally resulting in a more enriched isotopes by reevaporation when et0 was more than 3 0 mm the average d excess was 9 31 and the mean Î´d and Î´18o values of precipitation were close to the weighted average values table 4 these rainfall events mainly occurred in the summer monsoon period with a high precipitation rates associated with convective activities although the surface evapotranspiration is higher the relative humidity increases then the vapor is more depleted in heavy isotopes through the convective fluxes or through environmental subsidence into the subcloud layer moreover the diffusive exchanges become more efficient for higher precipitation rates rozanski et al 1993 risi et al 2008a therefore the isotope composition of precipitation becomes more negative as raindrops interact with the increasingly depleted vapor lee and fung 2008 aemisegger et al 2014 the large scale convection dominates the d excess variability however the influence of local evaporation is probably not negligible because a compensation for the depleted heavy isotopes and lower slopes and intercepts of the regression lines july september are found due to the evaporation effect noticeably the premise of the above results is that we excluded the lower d excess values during the strong convective events thus the effect of et0 on the d excess is not quite simple which not only depends on the isotope composition of moisture sources surface evaporation vapor from the ocean atmospheric subsiding environment raindrops reevaporation and its contributing proportion but also depends on the condensation processes in the convective updrafts dansgaard 1964 and on the non equilibrium kinetic fractionation from rain reevaporation and diffusive exchange with the surrounding vapor during the falling time rozanski et al 1993 risi et al 2008a aemisegger et al 2014 salamalikis et al 2016 5 3 response of precipitation Î´18o to convective precipitation heavy rainstorms in southern china occur frequently during the summer monsoon because of the occurrence of tropical typhoons or cyclones driven by the summer monsoon convective activities which can bring a large amount of warm and humid water vapor from low latitude oceans accompanied by the more 18o depleted precipitation lawrence and gedzelman 1996 araguÃ¡s araguÃ¡s et al 1998 however the relationship between Î´18o values and meteorological parameters during convection precipitation remain controversial based on data from previously published studies combined with our data we collected 92 rainstorm events to discuss the relationship between Î´18o values and precipitation amount the Î´18o values of rainwater in rainstorm events varied from 5 08 to 17 07 with a arithmetic mean value of 10 21 and a weithted average Î´18o value of 10 50 these obviously depleted Î´18o values in rainstorm events or typhoons were consistent with those for other regions lawrence et al 2004 li et al 2015 he et al 2018b there was a poor negative correlation between Î´18o values and rainfall amount during convective events see supplementary fig s2 we speculate that the relatively more depleted Î´ value in monsoon season is not associated with the precipitation amount but related to intensive convection precipitation and cloud spread lawrence et al 2004 risi et al 2008a lekshmy et al 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 zwart et al 2016 he et al 2018a 2018b nlend et al 2020 valdivielso et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for example dansgaard 1964 pointed out that depleted Î´18o in heavy rainfall is in association with deep convectional cooling resulting in reducing enrichment processes in fuzhou an area adjacent to guilin xu et al 2019 found that the Î´18o values of typhoon rainfall during 2013 2017 were significantly negative resulting from large scale convection systems nlend et al 2020 pointed out that the isotopic content of precipitation in the west central africa was strongly tied to the convective organization and cloud types in our study high resolution sampling of precipitation Î´18o values was performed during convective events between 2015 and 2016 six rainstorm events were selected to reveal the response processes of precipitation isotopes to convection activity the rainstorm events occurred from 14 20 may 2015 10 14 june 2015 22 27 july 2015 14 18 august 2015 10 12 november 2015 and 12 16 june 2016 respectively the most depleted Î´18o and Î´d values for these events were 14 05 and 112 7 10 55 and 78 7 17 98 and 134 4 10 75 and 73 3 11 13 and 73 5 11 87 and 86 5 respectively which are generally lower than 10 0 for Î´18o and 70 0 for Î´d further a delay in the response of water vapor to convection with extremely negative Î´18o in precipitation was best observed as shown in fig 7 a similar temporal pattern for stable isotope variability was observed from the onset to the withdrawal of the rainstorm characterized by three stages in the early stage the Î´18o of precipitation was relatively enriched in heavy isotopes 8 0 with wide fluctuations while in the mid event or latter event a significant 18o depletion in precipitation was observed 10 0 the amount effect associated with convective processes predominantly affecting the changes in precipitation isotopes in subtropical monsoon regions can be summarized as follows i at the initial stage water vapor is mainly sourced from the periphery of the rain belt characterized by higher air temperature less rainfall and low humidity thus the original condensate is enriched in Î´18o according to the rayleigh model and reevaporation of the falling rain and diffusive exchange with the surrounding vapor have an important impact on Î´18o in the pre event period as condensation increases with higher rainfall the Î´18o of precipitation gradually becomes negative ii raindrops re evaporate to a lesser extent at the cloud base due to higher ambient humidity and thus there is less enrichment of Î´18o values compared to lesser rainfall and iii unsaturated downdraft vapor and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor during convective events feed the sub cloud layer vapor then move into the convective clouds through the updraft and cause rain to be further depleted in Î´18o risi et al 2008a crawford et al 2013 lekshmy et al 2014 fig 8 after that as the typhoon moves away from the study area the rainfall decreases and precipitation Î´18o values gradually become less negative however the mean Î´18o value is still relatively depleted than that in the pre event period which could be because of the depletion of heavy isotopes in the residual water vapor re evaporation and isotopic equilibrium with ambient vapor under the cloud base contribute significantly to modify the isotope signals at the end of precipitation events therefore the isotopic variations in precipitation on shorter synoptic scene could be independent of precipitation amount dansgaard 1964 aggarwal et al 2012 2016 zwart et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 but potentially associated with microphysical processes during rainout he et al 2018b wang et al 2021 there has been increasing studies that highlighted that a poor negative correlation between the lowest Î´18o values and the amount of precipitation is not due to the amount effect but rather due to large scale convection activity risi et al 2008a crawford et al 2013 kurita 2013 lekshmy et al 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 zwart et al 2016 ansari et al 2020 for example crawford et al 2013 analyzed five years of event based precipitation samples collected in the blue mountains near sydney australia and showed that the large scale rainout during the transport of moisture to the sampling site was a more important factor influencing Î´18o variability kurita 2013 concluded that large scale convective activity containing several mesoscale convective systems is a key process in depleting the 18o isotope in tropical precipitation in addition the amplitude of the isotopic depletion was related to the intensity of the convection system kurita et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 valdivielso et al 2020 gao et al 2013 and zhou et al 2019 found that the upstream convective activity and condensation process were a dominant control influencing the precipitation isotopic composition along air mass trajectories although the influence of convective processes on isotopic composition is extremely complex little work has been done to improve our understanding of how convective behaviours physically and quantitatively contribute to determine the changes in precipitation stable isotopes datasets with high frequency rainstorm sampling are still needed to provide a useful basis for interpreting the effects of convection activities on the intra event variability of precipitation stable isotopes and its influencing regimes 6 conclusions a long term study involving event based precipitation monitoring of stable isotopic compositions was conducted between 2010 and 2016 in guilin southwest china to investigate the temporal variations of stable isotopic composition of precipitation and its dominant influencing factors to further evaluate how evaporation controls the changes in stable isotopes in precipitation and to determine the response processes of precipitation Î´18o to convective events the results showed that the Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation exhibited significant seasonal variations reflecting the changes in the character of precipitation in response to seasonal variability of the moisture sources and atmospheric conditions correlation analysis indicated significant negative correlations between precipitation Î´18o and temperature and et0 on both daily and monthly time scales however there was no significant correlation with precipitation amount multivariate regression analysis indicated that when temperature precipitation amount and et0 are considered 39 of the variability of the monthly oxygen isotope composition of precipitation was explained p 0 01 moreover the monthly mean temperature had a higher correlation with the precipitation Î´18o r2 0 50 p 0 01 confirming that temperature was the main contributor of precipitation isotope variability than the amount of precipitation in guilin however the seasonal controlling effects of meteorological variables on the rainfall isotopes is pronounced temperature principally played a dominant control on precipitation stable isotopes in the summer season an instead of the amount effect in autumn due to the increased convective activity there was a positive correlation between et0 and precipitation Î´18o in autumn but evapotranspiration only play a minor contribution to the observed variation in Î´18o of precipitation the main role of evaporation effect was to compensate for the depletion in heavy isotopes of convection rainfall the seasonal shift of continental moisture recycling and convective moisture source and microphysical processes were responsible for the non linear relationship between d excess and et0 at both the seasonal and daily scales the response of precipitation stable isotopes to convective events was closely related to water vapor transport processes producing extremely depleted precipitation Î´18o values the negative correlation between the lowest Î´18o values and rainfall amount during convective events is not necessarily related to the amount effect but rather due to large scale convection activity we found that cloud dynamics and physical processes associated with convection including re evaporation diffusive exchanges unsaturated downdraft and the recycling of depleted vapor into convective clouds are probably the key drivers in the evolution of the stable isotopic composition of precipitation during convective events a longer period that would track the seasonality of moisture sources and atmospheric cycles should be studied this study provides more insights into the long term variations of stable isotopes in precipitation and the evaporation effect

4442,stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation which are sensitive to climate change and the water cycle are widely used as natural tracers to investigate hydrological processes and paleoclimate reconstruction high resolution event based precipitation sampling was conducted in guilin a subtropical monsoon climate region in southwest china from 2010 to 2016 to identify the temporal variability of stable isotopes of precipitation and its dominant meteorological factors the results showed that the stable isotopes of precipitation exhibited significant seasonal variability with lower values in the wet season and higher values in the dry season reflecting the changes in the character of precipitation in response to seasonal variability of the moisture sources and atmospheric dynamics Î´18o values were significantly negatively correlated with temperature and potential evapotranspiration et0 on the daily and monthly timescales however there was no significant correlation between monthly Î´18o and the amount of rainfall multivariate regression analysis showed that when temperature precipitation amount and et0 were considered 39 of the variability of the monthly oxygen isotope composition of precipitation was explained monthly mean temperature had a higher covariation with precipitation Î´18o indicating that the variations of precipitation isotope were more dependent on temperature but not substantially dependent on the amount effect of rainfall howerver the main influence of meteorological factors on the isotopic variations of precipitation varied seasonally temperature strongly influenced the isotopic composition of precipitation in summer while the amount effect was prominent due to the enhanced convective activity characterized by more depleted Î´18o values although evapotranspiration is a minor contributor of precipitation isotope variability the impact of evapotranspiration on the enrichment of precipitation isotopes in autumn is a substantial control and should be considered which makes a major contribution to compensate for the depletion in heavy isotopes of rainfall the non linear relationship between d excess and et0 was attributed to the variable contribution of large scale convective moisture and local evaporation as well as water vapor transfer processes the response of precipitation stable isotopes to convective events was characterized by distinct stage patterns associated with the water vapor sources and physical processes during rainout the significant depletion of precipitation Î´18o values during convective events was not due to the amount effect but due to large scale convection activity these findings provide further insight into intraevent scale isotopic variations associated with organized convection and their key influencing factors which ultimately improves our interpretation of the paleoclimate records in subtropical monsoon regions keywords hydrogen and oxygen isotopes d

hydrological processes dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 clark and fritz 1997 sÃ¡nchez murillo et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 tian and wang 2019 since they are constituents of the water molecule and are deemed as fingerprints of water stable isotopic signals of modern precipitation preserved in speleothem ice cores tree ring cellulose etc are very important for reconstructing paleoclimate environments dayem et

in stable isotopes of precipitation that are closely related to environmental parameters krklec et al 2018 yang et al 2019 therefore enhancing our understanding of the environmental information contained in rainfall and the mechanism underlying current isotopic changes is of significance increasing studies have been done to determine the factors controlling precipitation isotopes in low and middle latitude regions with a strong monsoon influence kurita et al 2009 dayem et al 2010 ansari et al 2020 which are widely applied to interpret the paleoclimate implications aggarwal et al 2016 thompson et al 2000 risi et al 2008b ishizaki et al 2012 the global relationship between Î´d and Î´18o in meteoric waters was firstly recognized by craig 1961a and subsequently defined as the global meteoric water line gmwl Î´d 8 Î´18o 10 which provides a foundational reference to identify whether equilibrium or non equilibrium fractionation processes affect the precipitation isotopes sÃ¡nchez murillo et al 2016 esquivel hernÃ¡ndez et al 2019 in 1961 the water resources program of the international atomic energy agency iaea and world meteorological organization wmo established the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip which was used to delineate the controls on spatio temporal patterns of global precipitation isotopes rozanski et al 1993 unfortunately many stations have terminated the monitoring projects and these monitoring data mainly provide the monthly weighted values therefore there is still a lack of high resolution dataset to characterize long term variations of daily Î´18o and Î´d of precipitation moreover there are many factors that influence the changes in precipitation Î´18o and Î´d such as latitude precipitation amount temperature and elevation gat

studied the temporal variations of stable isotopes in precipitation and their influencing factors for example liu et al 1987 first established the lmwl for guilin by using the monthly average Î´18o and Î´d values in precipitation from 1983 to 1985 and found a negative relationship between monthly average Î´18o values and the amount of precipitation tu et al 2004 analyzed the stable isotopic compositions of precipitation based on the monthly average dataset 1983 1998 obtained from the gnip network and then revised the lmwl zhang et al 2015 characterized the daily variations in the Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation from 2008 to 2012 zhu et al 2017 examined the temporal variations of precipitation Î´18o values in 2012 and its relationship with the water vapor sources although previous studies have assessed the variations of precipitation isotopes in guilin to reveal the key controlling factors and determine the influence of moisture sources on the variations of stable isotope of precipitation knowledge gaps still exist on long term temporal variations in stable isotopes of precipitation and their controlling factors on the event based scale moreover the isotope composition of event based samples can provide more detailed information on water dynamics especially short term water vapor exchange and rainout crawford et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 bedaso and wu 2020 although stable isotopes have been monitored in event based precipitation risi et al 2008b xie et al 2011 crawford et al 2013 yang et al 2019 zhou and li 2018 the sampling durations are still relatively short approximately 1 2 years to our knowledge neither the variable patterns of precipitation isotopes nor the control factors have been better studied with ongoing global climate change in particular the influence of continuous heavy rainfall events on variations in the Î´18o and Î´d of precipitation is unclear evapotranspiration and sub cloud evaporation are considered to have important effects on the precipitation isotopes gat 1995 aemisegger et al 2015 dayem et al 2010 ishizaki et al 2012 salamalikis et al 2016 christner et al 2018 wang et al 2021 furthermore many studies have demonstrated that the variability of precipitation stable isotopes was driven by large scale atmospheric circulation berkelhammer et al 2012 wang et al 2021 a proper understanding of the large scale convection berg et al 2013 water vopor recycling trenberth 1999 and below cloud interaction between raindrops and ambient water vapor is crucial yang et al 2011 aemisegger et al 2015 salamalikis et al 2016 mÃ¼ller et al 2017 which may be reflect the character of precipitation in response to changes in climate the complexity of dynamical and microphysical processes can give rise to significant modification of precipitation isotopes and even could overshadow the dependence of Î´18o on temperature and amount of precipitation on short timescales bowen and wilkinson 2002 zwart et al 2018 it is expected to provide implementation constraints for the unrecognized mechanisms determining isotopic variations of water vapor and precipitation this will be very important for interpreting isotope variability in proxy archives such as speleothems and tropical ice krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 christner et al 2018 however these microphysical processes affecting the falling hydrometeors from the cloud base towards the ground are still poorly constrained because they are difficult to observe or model with an insufficient high resolution datasets yang et al 2011 aggarwal et al 2016 salamalikis et al 2016 for the previous studies these controls are ignored or considered negligibly in comparison with the classical isotope effects i e altitude latitude or continental effects dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 to evaluate their impact however an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that these effects are significant contributors to the stable isotope variability of precipitation krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 aemisegger et al 2015 aggarwal et al 2016 christner et al 2018 wang et al 2020 for example berkelhammer et al 2012 found that approximately 40 of event scale isotopic variability arised from the percentage of convective precipitation and relative humidity conditions in california usa risi et al 2008b reported that predominant fractionation processes in tropical areas are related to the falling process and reevaporation of precipitation due to diffusive exchange with surrounding vapor aemisegger 2018 and christner et al 2018 highlighted the impacts of below cloud evaporation rainout and evapotranspiration on short term variability of stable isotopes in near surface water vapor and precipitation associated with central european cold fronts more importantly recent studies pointed out that the large scale circulation regimes are closely linked to cloud modes rainfall types and the properties of convection berkelhammer et al 2012 aggarwal et al 2016 zwart et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2020 moreover deuterium excess dansgaard 1964 hereafter referred to d excess can act as an effective parameter to infer the influence of evaporation on changes in the stable isotopes of precipitation and enrichment effects aemisegger 2018 the d excess which depends on sea surface temperature relative humidity and wind speed at the source of moisture merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 aemisegger and sjolte 2018 can provide more insight into moisture recycling processes therefore in our study we evaluated the effects of evapotranspiration on the stable isotopes of precipitation and discussed the seasonal relationships between d excess and et0 from 2010 to 2016 at present the effects of evaporation on Î´18o and Î´d are of more concern in the fields of cave drip water markowsk et al 2016 surface river wu et al 2019 and lake and wetland hydrology stewart 1975 mayr et al 2007 to reveal the effects of evaporation on hydrological processes and the uncertainty of cave sediment responses to climate change markowsk et al 2016 esquivel hernÃ¡ndez et al 2018 affolter et al 2020 in this study we synthesized some precipitation isotopic data for other stations in the subtropical monsoon region of southern china from previous studies the objectives of our study were to estimate the temporal variability of stable isotopes in precipitation from 2010 to 2016 and their dominant influencing factors in guilin southwest china to further investigate how evaporation controls the evolution of precipitation stable isotopes and to investigate the response of stable isotopes to individual convective event we established the relationship between the lowest Î´18o values and precipitation amount to determine whether the amount effect during convective events was the dominant factor controlling the changes in precipitation stable isotopes 2 study area guilin 25 15 23 n 110 19 25 e is located in the northeast of the guangxi autonomous region southwest china fig 1 this study area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with a hot rainy summer and a cold dry winter based on data from the guilin meteoriological station during the period 1951 to 2017 the average annual rainfall was 1884 mm and is mainly concentrated in april through august which accounts for approximately 70 in the total annual precipitation amount the annual average air temperature was approximately 19 0 c with the maximum temperature of 28 2 c in july the minimum temperature 7 9 c was observed in january maximum and minimum monthly precipitation of 359 mm and 50 mm were observed in june and december respectively the local atmospheric circulation is mainly controlled by different monsoon systems generally the warm summer prevails from april to september when the moisture originates from the bay of bengal the south china sea and the western subtropical pacific zhang et al 2015 however during the winter season october to march the water vapor masses originate mostly from the westerlies or from continental areas around guilin liu et al 1987 zhu et al 2017 recycled moisture is an important contributor to precipitation in the winter season wu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zhang 2020 the study site exhibits four distinct astronomical seasons of spring february april summer may july autumn august october and winter november january 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling precipitation sampling was performed at the institute of karst geology 25 15 n 110 19 e altitude 152 m a s l guilin southwest china a combined dataset of 543 daily precipitation samples was collected from 2010 to 2016 of these the Î´d and Î´18o data of precipitation in guilin from 2010 to 2012 was collected from the published studies by wu et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015 the remaining data 2013 2016 of about 264 samples was the new data in 2013 specifically there were only seven samples for stable isotope analyses available between november and december 2013 the sampling device was installed on the roof of the laboratory building in the institute of karst geology at a height of 2 m above the ground the device was comprised of a funnel connected to a cylindrical vessel to prevent evaporation of water samples we put a ping pong ball on the funnel to help seal the collector and a film of paraffin oil was added to the bottom of the container to reduce evaporative loss samples were removed from collectors immediately after each rain stopped except in the case of light rainfall which resulted in an insufficient sample the water samples were immediately filtered through 0 45 Î¼m filter membranes and sealed in 15 ml high density polyethylene vials they were stored in a refrigerator at approximately 4 c until being analyzed during summer monsoon rainstorms high resolution sampling was conducted at hourly intervals moreover we collected some extremely negative Î´18o data of convective precipitation with an extended period of 2008 2010 from zhang et al 2015 in order to confirm whether the amount effect of precipitation is the main cause of the more negative Î´18o signal in convective precipitation events meteorological data of the same period were documented by the guilin meteorological station 7 km away from the sampling site we also collected isotopic data with relatively long time series from eight sites within subtropical monsoon climate regions of southern china chongqing changsha fuzhou guangzhou guiyang hong kong kunming and xiamen these data are available in public repositories such as the gnip dataset http www naweb iaea org or derived from publications these stations were included as references to illustrate the changes in the stable isotopes of precipitation in guilin and regional atmospheric circulation regimes the locations of the sampling sites are projected in fig 1 the geographic position and meteorological information for each site are summarized in table 1 3 2 isotopic analysis stable water isotopes of precipitation samples were analyzed using a laser absorption water vapour isotope analyser picarro i2130 ca usa conducted at the chinese academy of geological sciences for every isotopic standard and sample an analytical run requires six consecutive injections via a microliter syringe to reduce the instrument s memory effect the first two analysis results were discarded and the arithmetic mean value of the last four records was considered as the final result zhou et al 2019 all analysis results are expressed as Î´ values in per mille relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961b gonfiantini 1978 iaea 2017 with the precision of 0 1 for Î´18o values and 1 for Î´d values note that the isotopic measurements is not only affected by the analytical uncertainty associated with rainfall isotopes and possibly also by small biases due to evaporation during sample collection aemisegger et al 2015 fischer et al 2019 the definition of Î´ as the relative difference of the isotopic ration with respect to vsmow is 1 Î´ r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard stand for the isotope ratios 2h 1h and 18o 16o of the sample and the vsmow standard respectively in this study the measured daily mean Î´18o and Î´d data during 2010 2016 were used to formulate the local meteoric water line lmwl equation using the ordinary least squares linear regression 3 3 potential evapotranspiration et0 the penman monteith model is regarded as a standard method for estimating the potential evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 due to its physically based characteristics that enable the incorporation of aerodynamic and physiological parameters the penman monteith formula is e

http data cma cn 3 4 data analysis in this study pearson correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the correlations between isotope composition of precipitation Î´18o Î´d and d excess and climate parameters such as temperature precipitation amount and et0 using the spss 20 0 software the correlation coefficients at different time scales are summarized in table 3 and table s1 the variables affecting the stable isotope composition of precipitation are relatively well known dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 however the empirical correlation of these controls termed temperature effect amount effect is inadequate to interpret the stable isotope variability in terms of paleoclimate ishizaki et al 2012 because it is assumed that the isotopic composition of precipitation is controlled by a single climatic factor duy et al 2018 however the isotopic signature of precipitation has been found to be not simply related to single meteorological factor but to precipitation seasonality large scale monsoon circulation and microphysical processes risi et al 2008a sturm et al 2010 aggarwal et al 2016 this means that the isotopic composition of rainfall cannot be described adequately by single factor linear correlations otherwise it can lead to a larger bias for the paleoclimate reconstructions sturm et al 2010 duy et al 2018 therefore a multivariate linear regression was developed in this study to quantitatively identify the integrated influence of all possible factor combinations on the isotopic variation of precipitation the multivariate regression model is described as 3 Î´ 18 o Î² 1 x 1 Î² 2 x 2 Î² 3 x 3 Î² n x n Î² 0 where Î²n is the partial regression coefficient with respect to different climatic factors xn refers to the possible meteorological parameters and Î²0 is the constant or the intercept in this study monthly mean values of temperature precipitation amount and et0 are considered in the multivariate linear regression model 4 results 4 1 temporal variations of stable isotopes in precipitation stable isotope data of all precipitation events and corresponding daily air temperature precipitation and et0 in guilin between 2010 and 2016 are presented in fig 2 the average daily temperature was 19 8 c ranging from 0 2 to 32 6 c the maximum monthly temperature occurred in july while the minimum monthly temperature was in january daily rainfall varied from 0 to 145 7 mm the maximum monthly precipitation amount 444 7 mm occurred in june while the minimum amount 41 6 mm occurred in october fig 3 daily mean et0 varied from 0 7 to 7 5 mm with an average of 3 0 mm and a strong seasonal pattern controlled by meteorological conditions based on all of the isotopic measurements the daily Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation varied from 17 07 to 2 48 and from 139 5 to 43 2 with average values of 5 55 and 31 7 respectively mean weighted daily Î´18o and Î´d values were 6 20 and 37 5 respectively which were relatively more negative than the calculated average values the monthly average Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation during the period 2010 to 2016 ranged from 12 40 to 0 75 and 97 9 to 10 5 with average values of 5 59 and 32 1 respectively table 2 moreover the more negative Î´18o values were observed in august instead of in june with the maximum monthly precipitation fig 3 guo et al 2015 antunes et al 2019 according to fig 2 the Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation also exhibited significant seasonal and inter annual variation table 2 with more negative isotope values in the wet season may september and less negative isotopes in the winter precipitation october mid april generally the maximum Î´18o value was observed in spring while the minimum value was observed in autumn the average Î´18o and Î´d values in summer were similar to or slightly more negative than the daily weighted average values table 2 at the inter annual scale the most negative Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation were observed in 2014 and the most enriched Î´18o and Î´d values were observed in 2016 the magnitude of the interannual variations of the weighted mean Î´18o and Î´d values was 2 47 and 22 1 respectively 4 2 deuterium excess the deuterium excess d Î´d 8 Î´ 18o was proposed by dansgaard 1964 and is associated with meteorological conditions in vapor source regions the variation in d excess originates from the contributions of non equilibrium fractionation in the water vapor transfer process i e evaporation and condensation aemisegger et al 2014 indicating the secondary evaporation effect the d excess values in guilin ranged from 14 82 to 36 04 with a mean value of 12 66 in the rainy season the range of d excess values was from 14 82 to 23 93 with an arithmetic mean of 10 1 in the cold season it ranged from 4 56 to 36 04 with a mean of 16 5 the characteristics of seasonal and inter annual variation were also represented in d excess fig 4 the lower values of d excess 10 were observed during the summer monsoon may mid october while the higher values 10 occurred during the dry season late october april table 2 the highest monthly mean d excess value was 18 85 in december while the lowest was 6 30 in august moreover the average d excess in autumn was lower than 10 and in summer it was very close to the global average value 4 3 local meteoric water line according to the event based stable water isotope data the lmwl was established as Î´d 8 82 Î´18o 17 21 r2 0 97 p 0 01 n 543 fig 5 a the slope and intercept of the lmwl were both higher than those of the gmwl and the meteoric water line of china cmwl Î´d 7 9 Î´18o 8 2 r2 0 98 zheng et al 1983 the linear regression line for the monthly precipitation isotopes defined lmwl as Î´d 9 05 Î´18o 18 55 r2 0 97 p 0 01 n 70 table 2 a higher slope and intercept were found compared to that for all samples taken together due to reducing the bias associated with small rainfall to illustrate the impact that the seasons have on the lmwl fig 5b shows the Î´18o and Î´d data of every month in summer may june most of july samples and part of autumn september october samples lie above or close to the gmwl for spring february and april partial autumn august and summer samples e g samples in july 2016 they ploy below the gmwl in winter november january and partial spring march most of the samples lie above the gmwl with a higher d excess table 2 according to fig 5c and table 2 there are distinct linear relationships in different seasons on the seasonal scale the lmwl during spring and winter e g december january february deviated slightly from that established by using the daily Î´18o and Î´d data between 2010 and 2016 it is characterized by a similar slope and intercept to the total lmwl of all the samples taken together in addition the slope and intercept in autumn were closer to the global average values the summer lmwl showed a slope of 8 54 with a lower intercept and d excess value of 10 table 2 however on a single monthly scale the slope and intercept of the fitted lines in july august and september were both lower than those of the gmwl table 2 with the exception of the intercept in september we also determined the lmwl for the dry and rainy seasons in table 2 the slopes and intercepts in both two seasons were larger than those of gmwl and cmwl reflecting the warm and humid climatic characteristics in guilin moreover the slope and intercept in the dry season were higher than those in the rainy season thus less negative Î´18o and Î´d values were found in the dry season while the rainy season showed more negative Î´18o and Î´d values 4 4 statistical relationships between precipitation Î´18o d excess and climate parameters we evaluated the relationships between precipitation Î´18o values d excess and local climate parameters table 3 fig 6 and fig s1 which varied with different time scales a weak significantly negative correlation between Î´18o values and precipitation was observed at the daily timescale r 0 141 p 0 01 n 543 while there was no significant correlation between monthly Î´18o values and the amount of rainfall r 0 155 p 0 01 n 66 comparatively speaking there

seasonal correlations between Î´18o and precipitation temperature and et0 were different a statistically significant negative correlation between Î´18o and precipitation amount appeared in autumn r 0

et0 were not significant while a positive correlation was observed in autumn r 0 181 p 0 01 supplementary table s1 as for d excess daily d excess correlated negatively with daily mean temperature r 0

table 3 however the annual weighted mean precipitation Î´18o and d excess values correlated neither with annual mean precipitation amount nor with annual mean temperature in addition they also showed

meteorological parameters 5 1 1 precipitation amount effect meteorological parameters e g temperature precipitation amount are considered to play a key controls on the stable isotope variations in precipitation dansgaard 1964 as meteorological parameters are easily available in this study we analyzed the factors controlling the changes of isotope composition of precipitation at different time scales the amount effect of precipitation is commonly observed at monthly time scale in low latitude ocean and coastal areas dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 martinelli et al 1996 however many studies suggested that the isotopic variations of precipitation did not depend on the local rainfall amount effect bedaso and wu 2020 bedaso et al 2020 but on the regional precipitation or upstream precipitation processes kurita et al 2009 krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2020 for example crawford et al 2013 found that the amount effect was weak in the sydney region while the precipitation Î´18o was highly correlated with the air mass s prior cumulative precipitation ansari et al 2020 showed that the amount of rainfall had a poor correlation with precipitation Î´18o values in the indian subcontinent during the indian summer monsoon nlend et al 2020 concluded that upstream convective activity is a major control of rainwater isotope composition in the tropics at daily seasonal and inter annual timescales in the present study a weak statistically significant negative correlation between Î´18o and precipitation amount was observed at a daily time scale r 0 141 p 0 01 however our data showed a poor correlation between monthly Î´18o values and the corresponding precipitation amount table 3 fig s1d in the supplementary information which is consistent with the result reported by zhu et al 2017 this is potentially attributed to the influence of small rainfall amount samples which may contribute a small proportion to the monthly mean calculation resulting in a weakened monthly Î´18o amount relationship the influences of small precipitation events also can be supported by the difference between daily mean and weighted mean Î´18o and Î´d values in addition similar results were also found in southeast china e g guangzhou changsha xie et al 2011 wu et al 2015 which share the same subtropical monsoon system these similar results highlight that the amount effect does not influence the isotopic variations at the daily and monthly timescales in the subtropical regions indicating other processes may be involved kurita et al 2009 concluded that the isotopic variation in the indochina peninsula stations reflected the atmospheric circulation pattern and was unrelated to the precipitation amount during the rainy season when the relationship between Î´18o values and rainfall amount is considered for individual years with the exception of 2012 none of them showed a significant correlation it is worth noting that positive correlation between precipitation amount and Î´18o values was observed for the year 2016 table s1 this was potentially related to droughts that occurred in 2016 when the annual rainfall was much lower than the multi year average precipitation table 2 this positive relationship in the dry years occurs mainly because of more intense evaporation from water and soil surfaces leads to relatively heavier isotope values in precipitation risi et al 2008b christner et al 2018 consequently local recycled moisture becomes a major contributor to some rainfall events zhang 2020 resulting in a weakened rainfall effect at the interannual scale correlations between the weighted annual mean Î´18o values and annual precipitation amount however are not significant r 0 358 p 0 01 moreover what controls the inter annual variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation is fairly complex this will be further explored in the future when more years of data can be available on a seasonal scale the amount effect of precipitation is more prominent in autumn and winter table s1 in our study the average monthly Î´18o values from august to october were 8 28 7 97 and 7 36 respectively with a mean value of 7 87 which was relatively depleted compared with the weighted mean values of all samples together meanwhile the arithmetic and weighted average values of the Î´18o in autumn were much lower with values of 8 23 and 8 86 respectively this situation is mainly due to the fact that the autumn is in the prevailing summer monsoon and water vapor is mostly derived from low latitude oceanic areas such as the bay of bengal the south china sea or the western pacific ocean zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 zhang 2020 which brought a relatively warm humid moisture and is prone to form strong convective events generating large volumes of precipitation this leads to the isotopic depletions and exhibits the enhanced precipitation effect in autumn however the correlation coefficient between Î´18o value and precipitation was still low in autumn r 0 218 indicating that the precipitation isotope during the strong monsoon period may reflect the integrated influences of water vapor sources and some microphysical processes risi et al 2008a associated with the large scale convection risi et al 2008b dayem et al 2010 berkelhammer et al 2012 crawford et al 2013 bedaso et al 2020 nlend et al 2020 but not substantially depend on the amount effect in guangzhou another city in the subtropical monsoon region of china xie et al 2011 reported that precipitation with more negative Î´d and Î´18o generally occurred during summer and autumn and a significant negative correlation existed between Î´18o and rainfall amount zhou et al 2019 also reported that there was obvious seasonal variations in stable isotopes of precipitation in changsha with depleted values in summer and autumn according to table 1 the monthly mean Î´18o value of precipitation in guilin is very close to that in the guangzhou chongqing and hong kong stations in addition the slopes and intercepts both for the event based samples and monthly scale were similar to those of other stations such as chongqing zhou and li 2018 changsha wu et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 guangzhou xie et al 2011 hong kong yang et al 2019 and fuzhou xu et al 2019 indicating that the rainfall belongs to the same subtropical monsoon climate region with the same water vapor sources and control factors therefore the relationship between Î´18o values and precipitation in autumn probably contributed to the mature monsoon precipitation characterized by distinctly lower Î´18o sometimes these values could be below 12 0 which were much lower than the average value of the total samples these rainfall events occur mainly in the form of tropical cyclones or typhoons influenced by strong convective activities lawrence et al 2004 kurita et al 2009 pape et al 2010 bedaso et al 2020 interestingly a significant negative relationship existed between daily Î´18o values and precipitation amount in the dry season october to march r 0 347 p 0 01 with a higher value of r2 relative to the wet season table s1 this result indicates that the observed Î´18o in the dry season is more sensitive to low precipitation than that in regimes with high summer precipitation bedaso et al 2020 this is probably due to the mixed moisture of local evapotranspirated moisture and monsoon precipitation at the onset of the wet season i e march or autumn season when rainfall events always have more depleted Î´18o values and they contribute largely to the mean seasonal rainfall in addition as the temperature decreases from november the reduced evaporation greatly limits the enrichment of rainfall isotopes which in combination leads to the effect of rainfall during the dry season in summary water vapor from the low latitude marine source region is predominant during the wet season april september with depleted isotopic precipitation this is contrary to the dry season when recycled moisture with a drier vapor source predominates yielding enriched precipitation the Î´d and Î´18o values of precipitation may provide more information on atmospheric cycle in a seasonal cycle and dry and wet dynamics in the process of air mass transfer from ocean to inland jiang et al 2019 5 1 2 temperature effect the positive correlation between isotopic value and air temperature is called the temperature effect in the present study there was a negative relationship between precipitation Î´18o and temperature at the daily monthly and seasonal scales with the exception of the autumn season fig s1b table s1 in the supplementary material reflecting an inverse temperature effect as shown in table s1 on both daily and monthly scales temperature is better correlated with Î´18o values than amount of precipitation on seasonal scales a positive correlation between Î´18o values and temperature was observed in autumn when mean air temperature 25 6 c was obviously higher than the multi year average 19 0 c accompanied by low rainfall amount table 2 under the exclusion of some heavy storms during this season it comprehensively reflected the local dry and hot climate these systems have lower humidity and easily induce a more intense terrestrial evaporation or below cloud evaporation salamalikis et al 2016 resulting in relatively enriched isotope values especially for small events in autumn or september this also can be confirmed by the monthly regression lines between Î´18o and Î´d in july august september precipitation with a lower slopes and intercepts compared to the gmwl table 2 indicating that a strong evaporation exists in the late summer or early autumn therefore the positive correlation between Î´18o and temperature was observed in autumn which can be attributed to the climatic characteristic of the study area however the slope and intercept of the regression line in autumn were very close to those of gmwl characterized by more negative average Î´18o and Î´d values table 2 the isotopic variability in precipitation was potentially related to seasonal changes in the moisture origin and rainfall types lee and fung 2008 ansari et al 2020 valdivielso et al 2020 in the autumn tropical convective rainfall is dominant and frequent and its water vapor was mainly derived from the indian and east asian summer monsoon dayem et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 zhang 2020 hence the convective air mass from distant oceans forms a more depleted isotopic signal of precipitation as previously noted there was a significant negative correlation between Î´18o and rainfall amount p 0 01 while precipitation Î´18o had a weak positive correlation with temperature in autumn and the correlation coefficient of the former 0 218 was higher than that of the latter 0 033 overall the amount effect in autumn had a greater impact on the precipitation Î´18o compared with the temperature effect which is in accordance with the results reported by zhou and li 2018 xia et al 2019 showed that the Î´18o variability of precipitation in five regions of asia were caused by the synergy between temperature and precipitation but the degree to which effect does a dominant control on isotope variation was seasonal therefore the isotopic signals of precipitation in autumn is the integrated result of moisture source and atmospheric conditions in comparison a significant negative correlation between temperature and precipitation Î´18o p 0 01 n 189 was found in summer at this time the monsoon system was gradually active which brought a large amount of warm and humid airflow and the correlation coefficient was 0 28 which was also the largest value relative to the other seasons these results indicate that the temperature effect has an important constraint on the variations of stable isotopes in precipitation in the early summer monsoon and as monsoon matures the amount effect takes control of the isotopic compositions of precipitation this result also was found in other monsoon regions he and richards 2016 zhou and li 2018 based on the above analysis the results show that precipitation Î´18o has a higher correlation with temperature than amount of precipitation on both the daily and monthly timescales especially the monthly mean temperature has a stronger correlation with the precipitation isotope signal r 0 71 p 0 01 explaining 50 of the isotope variability in precipitation however the amount of precipitation accounts for less than 3 of the varaibility in precipitation oxygen isotope composition at the two scales indicating that the amount effect of rainfall is not the dominant factor affecting the precipitation isotope variation in guilin although precipitation Î´18o had significant correlations with temperature on the daily and monthly scales or with amount of precipitation in autumn the correlation coefficients were relative low indicating a limited control of single factor over precipitation Î´18o duy et al 2018 we performed a multivariate regression analysis that considered both temperature and precipitation data to determine if these two variables could explain a larger percentage of the isotope variability of precipitation according to eq 3 the regression result showed that the combined amount of precipitation and temperature effects explain 37 of the variability of the oxygen precipitation composition p 0 01 however there is not simple sum of the two effects probably due to some overlapping controls or the nonsynergistic effects of temperature and precipitation at the same time to explain the isotopic variability of precipitation krklec and domÃ­nguez villar 2014 it is worth noting that the slope or constant associated with temperature is higher than that of rainfall in either the single parameter correlation or the multivariate correlation moreover the significance level of the temperature s slope is more higher with a larger r2 of 0 35 p 0 0001 compared to that of precipitation amount in the multivariate regression model r2 0 01 p 0 15 implying that temperature is the main contributor of the precipitation isotope variability in guilin 5 1 3 control effect of et0 on the variation in Î´18o the processes of evaporation and condensation play crucial role in modifying the water isotopes occuring at phase changes in the hydrological cycle dansgaard 1964 rosenfeld and mintz 1988 gat 1995 dayem et al 2010 aemisegger et al 2015 salamalikis et al 2016 valdivielso et al 2020 according to the fractionation distillation the evaporation process substantially leads to the enrichment of heavy isotopes in this study using et0 as an indicator of the evaporation capacity for a particular area we evaluated the interrelation between precipitation Î´18o values and et0 in guilin a significant negative correlation between precipitation Î´18o and et0 was observed at both the daily and monthly scales see the supplementary fig s1c and table s1 which was similar to the temperature effect this result is contrary to the evaporative enrichment theory indicating that the isotope water variation does not completely comply with the extent of evaporation freshly evaporated water vapor from the continent tends to be more enriched than free tropospheric water vapor but not necessarily than evaporation from the ocean aemisegger et al 2014 in the rainy season the isotope composition of precipitation in a monsoon affected region is probably quite a bit more depleted than ocean surface water due to the large scale water vapor transport so the stable isotopes of precipitation are generally more negative which is really not related to the intensity of evaporation as opposed to this even though the mean relative humidity was high 84 during the sampling period in the dry season the weak rainfall intensities small droplets and lower falling velocities the possible lower relative humidity in the atmosphere above cloud may lead to the evaporative enrichment of precipitation aemisegger et al 2015 the below cloud evaporation has an important constraint on the processes inducing isotopic equilibration between rain droplets and ambient water vapor producing enriched isotopic signatures of precipitation salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2021 especially smaller raindrops are more favorable to evaporation trenberth 1999 the isotopic enrichment also depends on the isotope composition of soil water because soil dominates the supply of atmospheric moisture in the dry season characterized by more enriched Î´18o values due to soil evaporation aemisegger et al 2014 of course there are some small precipitation events in the wet season which is mainly derived from the local evapotranspiration they will tend to show more enriched evaporation fluxes due to high surface temperature and low rh they are generally not in isotopic equilibrium with the atmospheric water vapor ambient temperature and relative humidity are the main meteorological factors that affects the vertical isotopic variation of the falling raindrops berkelhammer et al 2012 salamalikis et al 2016 mÃ¼ller et al 2017 there is thus a strong coupling between the isotope signature of the evaporation flux and the hydrometeorology of the region e g frequency of rainfall type of rainfall systems in our study the dataset revealed distinct seasonal patterns positive relationships between Î´18o value and et0 were found in the autumn season whilst a weak negative correlation was observed in the spring summer and winter seasons table s1 moreover the correlation coefficient was largest in autumn with a value of 0 18 in particular evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation in autumn due to the higher temperature table 2 which is more susceptible to cause an intensive evaporation under a drier condition it is also supported by the positive correlation with the temperature in autumn table s1 as higher temperature promote re evaporation of raindrops combined with the linear regression analysis the rate of change of Î´18o versus et0 was 0 3898 mm in autumn it is evident that the impact of et0 on the enrichment of precipitation isotopes was mainly seen in the autumn season however as described previously the amount effect in autumn seems to conceal the temperature effect at this time the isotope composition of precipitation was relatively depleted which compensated for the rather high evaporation enrichment in autumn nevertheless the slopes and intercepts of the lmwl for the summer and autumn seasons were substantially low because of the increased evaporation thus the dual effects of precipitation amount and evaporation synergistically affect the isotope compositions of precipitation in autumn and the main role of evaporation effect was to compensate for the rainfall with the depletion in heavy isotopes however the control mechanism of water isotopes by evaporation is still rather complicated as shown in table 2 there is evidence of the evaporative enrichment of stable isotopes in precipitation with up to 3 09 for Î´18o in spring compared to the precipitation weighted values meanwhile precipitation data in winter were relatively enriched by up to 1 52 for Î´18o we also showed that this isotopic enrichment in the dry season was notably larger than that in the rainy season table 2 this result indicates that local evaporation or subcloud evaporation would be a contributing factor on the isotopic composition of precipitation in the dry season when the evapotranspiration et0 is considered together with temperature and amount of precipitation the multivariate regression explains 39 of variability in the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation p 0 01 eq 4 although the limited constraints on the precipitation variability due to evaporation effect the role of local evapotranspiration which is the major contributors to the recycled moisture mixed into the atmosphere in explaining the variability of oxygen isotope composition of precipitation in the dry conditions or during some particular months e g july october is very important for example the slopes for Î´18o et0 correlation are larger in the summer and autumn seasons with values of 0 59 and 0 55 respectively and the positive Î´18o et0 correlation may cause some alterations of precipitation Î´18o to more enriched values however the seasonal correlations of Î´18o composition with et0 were not significant see table s1 in the supplementary material only explaining 3 of the oxygen isotope variability in precipitation partial evaporation of falling droplets and their equilibration with the surrounding vapor in the atmosphere during the water vapor transfer processes could impact the isotope composition of precipitation so the isotopic variations do not potentially depend on surface evapotranspiration however the integrated effects including tempreture precipitation amount and et0 do not control the overall isotope values the results highlight that the impact of moisture sources and microphysical processes within the atmosphere may be potential contributors to the remaining variability of precipitation isotopes they thus should be considered in the future studies to quantify or model their controls according to the multivariate regression eq 4 considering the variation range of contributions from precipitation temperature and et0 the amount of precipitation has the least influence on Î´18o and the effect of evapotranspiration is also small however the coefficient associated with temperature is relatively higher suggesting that temperature has a larger covariate with precipitation Î´18o this is especially the case with summer precipitation confirming temperature is an important variable affecting the isotope composition of precipitation 5 2 relationship between d excess and et0 the raindrops that has experienced subcloud evaporation diverge from the gmwl or lmwl which tends to an increase in the d excess the d excess can act as an indicator to infer the influence of dynamic evaporation and moisture recycling crawford et al 2013 2017 aemisegger et al 2014 the relationships between d excess and et0 at different time scales were fundamentally different and were obviously observed in this study fig 6a fig 6b owing to differences in the moisture sources and microphysical processes governing rain formation aemisegger et al 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 valdivielso et al 2020 this argument is particularly well proved by the seasonal relationships between monthly mean d excess and et0 values a significant negative correlation between the monthly mean d excess and et0 was observed in the wet season may to october r 0 48 p 0 01 fig 6c with a mean value of 10 0 however a non linear relationship was found in the dry season november to april fig 6d with an average of 16 92 during the dry season falling raindrops become isotopically heavier and gradually equilibration with the heavier surrounding atmospheric vapor so the d excess values were generally more than 10 the degree of moisture isotopic exchange and atmospheric conditions during the falltime to the surface are an important controlling process in changes of the isotope content of precipitation rozanski et al 1993 salamalikis et al 2016 the larger d excess values are also closely related to the stronger continental water recycling trenberth 1999 risi et al 2008b wang et al 2021 as the continental evaporation in the dry season mainly occurs in the form of soil evaporation in addition the moisture source of precipitation in the dry season rarely depends on large scale convection from the ocean therefore the increasing contribution of local evaporation to the regional moisture budget and the decreasing importance of large scale convective moisture may be the primary reasons for explaining this d et0 non linear relation fig 6c valdivielso et al 2020 reviewed that the diverse moisture sources are reflected in changes of the d excess during the wet season precipitation is mainly sourced by summer monsoon system originating from the bay of bengal and the south china sea in forms of summer typhoons or convective rainfall events zhang et al 2015 characterized by more negative precipitation isotopes although surface evapotranspiration is higher in summer a higher rainfall rate associated with the monsoon convection dampens the evaporation of raindrops due to a shorter transit time and the degree of moisture isotopic exchange with vapor below the cloud base is lower during their fall lee and fung 2008 risi et al 2008a bedaso et al 2020 the water vapor is progressively depleted in heavy isotopes so the d excess value is normally less than 10 in this situation the effect of large scale moisture sources has a more pronounced impact on the d excess value than the effect of local evapotranspiration aemisegger et al 2014 in the present study the relationship between d excess and et0 in different seasons is more likely to be related to the different origins of the air masses and subsequent physical processes during the rain fall i e fractionation of raindrops re evaporation rain vapor interactions or mixing risi et al 2008a samuels crow et al 2014 tharammal et al 2017 christner et al 2018 ansari et al 2020 this is also the main reasons for the non linear relationship between d excess and et0 at the daily scale we found that when et0 was less than 3 0 mm the mean value of d excess was 13 84 with relatively enriched Î´d and Î´18o values indicating a relatively dry air the moisture sources mainly originated from surface recycled component into the unsaturated downdrafts trenberth 1999 characterized by a low precipitation rates thus the fraction of the reevaporated rain increases while the fractionation of a reequilibrum is less efficient because of the decreased relative humidity the isotope composition of precipitation is largely determined by soil water evaporation and the meteorological conditions salamalikis et al 2016 generally resulting in a more enriched isotopes by reevaporation when et0 was more than 3 0 mm the average d excess was 9 31 and the mean Î´d and Î´18o values of precipitation were close to the weighted average values table 4 these rainfall events mainly occurred in the summer monsoon period with a high precipitation rates associated with convective activities although the surface evapotranspiration is higher the relative humidity increases then the vapor is more depleted in heavy isotopes through the convective fluxes or through environmental subsidence into the subcloud layer moreover the diffusive exchanges become more efficient for higher precipitation rates rozanski et al 1993 risi et al 2008a therefore the isotope composition of precipitation becomes more negative as raindrops interact with the increasingly depleted vapor lee and fung 2008 aemisegger et al 2014 the large scale convection dominates the d excess variability however the influence of local evaporation is probably not negligible because a compensation for the depleted heavy isotopes and lower slopes and intercepts of the regression lines july september are found due to the evaporation effect noticeably the premise of the above results is that we excluded the lower d excess values during the strong convective events thus the effect of et0 on the d excess is not quite simple which not only depends on the isotope composition of moisture sources surface evaporation vapor from the ocean atmospheric subsiding environment raindrops reevaporation and its contributing proportion but also depends on the condensation processes in the convective updrafts dansgaard 1964 and on the non equilibrium kinetic fractionation from rain reevaporation and diffusive exchange with the surrounding vapor during the falling time rozanski et al 1993 risi et al 2008a aemisegger et al 2014 salamalikis et al 2016 5 3 response of precipitation Î´18o to convective precipitation heavy rainstorms in southern china occur frequently during the summer monsoon because of the occurrence of tropical typhoons or cyclones driven by the summer monsoon convective activities which can bring a large amount of warm and humid water vapor from low latitude oceans accompanied by the more 18o depleted precipitation lawrence and gedzelman 1996 araguÃ¡s araguÃ¡s et al 1998 however the relationship between Î´18o values and meteorological parameters during convection precipitation remain controversial based on data from previously published studies combined with our data we collected 92 rainstorm events to discuss the relationship between Î´18o values and precipitation amount the Î´18o values of rainwater in rainstorm events varied from 5 08 to 17 07 with a arithmetic mean value of 10 21 and a weithted average Î´18o value of 10 50 these obviously depleted Î´18o values in rainstorm events or typhoons were consistent with those for other regions lawrence et al 2004 li et al 2015 he et al 2018b there was a poor negative correlation between Î´18o values and rainfall amount during convective events see supplementary fig s2 we speculate that the relatively more depleted Î´ value in monsoon season is not associated with the precipitation amount but related to intensive convection precipitation and cloud spread lawrence et al 2004 risi et al 2008a lekshmy et al 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 zwart et al 2016 he et al 2018a 2018b nlend et al 2020 valdivielso et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for example dansgaard 1964 pointed out that depleted Î´18o in heavy rainfall is in association with deep convectional cooling resulting in reducing enrichment processes in fuzhou an area adjacent to guilin xu et al 2019 found that the Î´18o values of typhoon rainfall during 2013 2017 were significantly negative resulting from large scale convection systems nlend et al 2020 pointed out that the isotopic content of precipitation in the west central africa was strongly tied to the convective organization and cloud types in our study high resolution sampling of precipitation Î´18o values was performed during convective events between 2015 and 2016 six rainstorm events were selected to reveal the response processes of precipitation isotopes to convection activity the rainstorm events occurred from 14 20 may 2015 10 14 june 2015 22 27 july 2015 14 18 august 2015 10 12 november 2015 and 12 16 june 2016 respectively the most depleted Î´18o and Î´d values for these events were 14 05 and 112 7 10 55 and 78 7 17 98 and 134 4 10 75 and 73 3 11 13 and 73 5 11 87 and 86 5 respectively which are generally lower than 10 0 for Î´18o and 70 0 for Î´d further a delay in the response of water vapor to convection with extremely negative Î´18o in precipitation was best observed as shown in fig 7 a similar temporal pattern for stable isotope variability was observed from the onset to the withdrawal of the rainstorm characterized by three stages in the early stage the Î´18o of precipitation was relatively enriched in heavy isotopes 8 0 with wide fluctuations while in the mid event or latter event a significant 18o depletion in precipitation was observed 10 0 the amount effect associated with convective processes predominantly affecting the changes in precipitation isotopes in subtropical monsoon regions can be summarized as follows i at the initial stage water vapor is mainly sourced from the periphery of the rain belt characterized by higher air temperature less rainfall and low humidity thus the original condensate is enriched in Î´18o according to the rayleigh model and reevaporation of the falling rain and diffusive exchange with the surrounding vapor have an important impact on Î´18o in the pre event period as condensation increases with higher rainfall the Î´18o of precipitation gradually becomes negative ii raindrops re evaporate to a lesser extent at the cloud base due to higher ambient humidity and thus there is less enrichment of Î´18o values compared to lesser rainfall and iii unsaturated downdraft vapor and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor during convective events feed the sub cloud layer vapor then move into the convective clouds through the updraft and cause rain to be further depleted in Î´18o risi et al 2008a crawford et al 2013 lekshmy et al 2014 fig 8 after that as the typhoon moves away from the study area the rainfall decreases and precipitation Î´18o values gradually become less negative however the mean Î´18o value is still relatively depleted than that in the pre event period which could be because of the depletion of heavy isotopes in the residual water vapor re evaporation and isotopic equilibrium with ambient vapor under the cloud base contribute significantly to modify the isotope signals at the end of precipitation events therefore the isotopic variations in precipitation on shorter synoptic scene could be independent of precipitation amount dansgaard 1964 aggarwal et al 2012 2016 zwart et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 but potentially associated with microphysical processes during rainout he et al 2018b wang et al 2021 there has been increasing studies that highlighted that a poor negative correlation between the lowest Î´18o values and the amount of precipitation is not due to the amount effect but rather due to large scale convection activity risi et al 2008a crawford et al 2013 kurita 2013 lekshmy et al 2014 aggarwal et al 2016 zwart et al 2016 ansari et al 2020 for example crawford et al 2013 analyzed five years of event based precipitation samples collected in the blue mountains near sydney australia and showed that the large scale rainout during the transport of moisture to the sampling site was a more important factor influencing Î´18o variability kurita 2013 concluded that large scale convective activity containing several mesoscale convective systems is a key process in depleting the 18o isotope in tropical precipitation in addition the amplitude of the isotopic depletion was related to the intensity of the convection system kurita et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 valdivielso et al 2020 gao et al 2013 and zhou et al 2019 found that the upstream convective activity and condensation process were a dominant control influencing the precipitation isotopic composition along air mass trajectories although the influence of convective processes on isotopic composition is extremely complex little work has been done to improve our understanding of how convective behaviours physically and quantitatively contribute to determine the changes in precipitation stable isotopes datasets with high frequency rainstorm sampling are still needed to provide a useful basis for interpreting the effects of convection activities on the intra event variability of precipitation stable isotopes and its influencing regimes 6 conclusions a long term study involving event based precipitation monitoring of stable isotopic compositions was conducted between 2010 and 2016 in guilin southwest china to investigate the temporal variations of stable isotopic composition of precipitation and its dominant influencing factors to further evaluate how evaporation controls the changes in stable isotopes in precipitation and to determine the response processes of precipitation Î´18o to convective events the results showed that the Î´18o and Î´d values of precipitation exhibited significant seasonal variations reflecting the changes in the character of precipitation in response to seasonal variability of the moisture sources and atmospheric conditions correlation analysis indicated significant negative correlations between precipitation Î´18o and temperature and et0 on both daily and monthly time scales however there was no significant correlation with precipitation amount multivariate regression analysis indicated that when temperature precipitation amount and et0 are considered 39 of the variability of the monthly oxygen isotope composition of precipitation was explained p 0 01 moreover the monthly mean temperature had a higher correlation with the precipitation Î´18o r2 0 50 p 0 01 confirming that temperature was the main contributor of precipitation isotope variability than the amount of precipitation in guilin however the seasonal controlling effects of meteorological variables on the rainfall isotopes is pronounced temperature principally played a dominant control on precipitation stable isotopes in the summer season an instead of the amount effect in autumn due to the increased convective activity there was a positive correlation between et0 and precipitation Î´18o in autumn but evapotranspiration only play a minor contribution to the observed variation in Î´18o of precipitation the main role of evaporation effect was to compensate for the depletion in heavy isotopes of convection rainfall the seasonal shift of continental moisture recycling and convective moisture source and microphysical processes were responsible for the non linear relationship between d excess and et0 at both the seasonal and daily scales the response of precipitation stable isotopes to convective events was closely related to water vapor transport processes producing extremely depleted precipitation Î´18o values the negative correlation between the lowest Î´18o values and rainfall amount during convective events is not necessarily related to the amount effect but rather due to large scale convection activity we found that cloud dynamics and physical processes associated with convection including re evaporation diffusive exchanges unsaturated downdraft and the recycling of depleted vapor into convective clouds are probably the key drivers in the evolution of the stable isotopic composition of precipitation during convective events a longer period that would track the seasonality of moisture sources and atmospheric cycles should be studied this study provides more insights into the long term variations of stable isotopes in precipitation and the evaporation effect and has important implications for the interpretation of speleothem based paleoclimate reconstructions credit authorship contribution statement xiaojiao guo conceptualization methodology data curation

4443,accurate estimate of carbon sink flux resulted from carbonate weathering in the karst area is of great significance for advancing the current understanding of the global carbon cycle and climate change however the carbon sink flux may be overestimated when the natural reaction with carbonic acid is influenced by protons of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids which can reduce the carbon sink flux during carbonate weathering here we quantitatively evaluated the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate weathering and carbon sink flux under base flow condition based on the stoichiometry of chemical compositions of groundwater from a typical karst catchment guohua guangxi southwestern china seventy groundwater samples were analyzed for the characteristics of hydrochemistry and carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon Î´ 13cdic during the dry season in 2015 the results show that 1 ca2 and mg2 dominate 92 4 99 7 of the total cations while hco3 accounts for 83 0 97 4 of total anions indicating that the compositions of groundwater are primarily controlled by carbonate weathering 2 the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratios 1 00 to 1 41 and the corresponding Î´ 13cdic values 16 8 to 8 1 of groundwater are all distributed between carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids meanwhile the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 ratios of groundwater are about 1 and the ca2 mg2 equivalent concentrations have a good positive correlation with hco3 so4 2 no3 and so4 2 no3 suggesting that sulfuric and nitric acids in addition to carbonic acid have been involved in carbonate weathering 3 the contribution of sulfuric and nitric acids involved in carbonate weathering to ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varies from 0 6 to 58 0 mean value of 20 9 and from 0 3 to 40 9 mean value of 12 2 respectively the carbonate weathering rate has increased by 20 9 while the karst carbon sink flux has decreased by 12 2 therefore the carbon sink flux produced by carbonate weathering should be carefully evaluated when anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid are involved and the role of sulfuric and nitric acids in carbonate weathering could not be ignored in the global carbon cycle keywords carbonate weathering sulfuric acid nitric acid Î´ 13cdic carbon cycle karst groundwater 1 introduction rock weathering plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and thus can significantly influence global climate change bluth and kump 1994 white and blum 1995 gislason et al 1996 louvat and allÃ¨gre 1997 the conventional carbon cycle hypothesis berner and kothavala 2001 wallmann 2001 assumes that atmospheric co2 consumed by carbonate weathering will be released back to the atmosphere during the precipitation of carbonate minerals thus carbonate weathering cannot be considered as a net sink of atmospheric co2 over geological time scale however at short time scale of 102 105 yrs due to the rapid dissolution kinetics dreybrodt 1988 liu and dreybrodt 1997 kump et al 2000 and high solubility dreybrodt 1988 cappellen and qiu 1997 of carbonate the carbon sink budget generated by carbonate weathering can be as large as 6 0 108 t c a yuan 1997 liu and zhao 2000 liu et al 2010 about accounting for 18 50 of the missing carbon sink flux 1 2 109 3 4 109 t c a detwiler and charles 1988 tans et al 1990 sundquist 1993 lal 2008 therefore the carbon sink resulted from carbonate weathering is an important part of missing carbon sink budget liu et al 2010 martin 2017 so that it plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and climate change carbonic acid exists in natural environment and can weather the carbonate rocks following the reaction of eq 1 caxmg1 xco3 h2o co2 xca2 1 x mg2 2hco3 0 x 1 yuan 1997 jiang and yuan 1999 in this case half of hco3 is derived from carbonate and the other half is derived from atmospheric or soil co2 therefore the carbonate weathering by carbonic acid can uptake co2 from the atmosphere or soil by converting co2 into hco3 and thus serves as an important atmospheric co2 sink in karst groundwater hco3 is generally the dominant dissolved anion originated from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid in the current global carbon cycle model the contribution of sulfuric and nitric acids involved in weathering of carbonate has not drawn much attention liu et al 2010 martin 2017 however in recent years the increasing usage of fertilizer the discharge of sewage and the increase of acid rain with the development of agriculture urbanization and industrialization have led to the increasing concentrations of sulfuric and nitric acids in groundwater which have widely participated in chemical weathering of carbonate perrin et al 2008 raymond et al 2008 ali and atekwana 2011 martin 2017 zhu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 sulfuric and nitric acids participating in weathering of carbonate can also generate hco3 eq 2 2caxmg1 xco3 h2so4 2xca2 2 1 x mg2 2hco3 so4 2 0 x 1 eq 3 caxmg1 xco3 hno3 xca2 1 x mg2 hco3 no3 0 x 1 martin 2017 and greatly increase the hco3 concentration in water in these cases however all hco3 are totally derived from the carbonate and there is no co2 sequestration therefore the weathering of carbonate by sulfuric and nitric acids can be regarded as a source for the atmosphere co2 with no rapid balancing atmospheric co2 sink lerman et al 2007 perrin et al 2008 martin 2017 xu et al 2021 in a karst catchment hco3 produced by carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids can account for 11 40 of total hco3 in karst water jiang 2013 yu et al 2016 li and ji 2016 huang et al 2017 indicating that karst carbon sink flux can remarkably decrease by up to 40 throughout the world there are many karst catchments where sulfuric and nitric acids produced by anthropogenic activities have significantly participated in carbonate weathering such as the garonne river basin in south western france semhi et al 2000 perrin et al 2008 the mackenzie river basin in northwestern canada calmels et al 2007 the federal tailings pile karst catchment in southeastern missouri of usa ali and atekwana 2011 and the zhujiang river basin zhang et al 2007 the upper middle reaches of the wujiang river basin huang et al 2017 and liujiang river basin zhu et al 2019 in china nevertheless the role of sulfuric acid and nitric acid from anthropogenic activities in carbonate weathering is still often ignored both locally and globally and the calculation of karst carbon sink flux did not take the hco3 derived from carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids into account but assumed that all hco3 derived from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid yuan 1997 liu and zhao 2000 liu et al 2010 thus the carbon sink flux from carbonate weathering is overestimated to accurately estimate the carbon sink flux resulted from carbonate weathering the proportion of carbon sink flux from carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids should be reasonably deducted at regional and global scales as karst areas account for 12 of the world s total land area wang et al 1999 wei et al 2017 however sulfuric and nitric acids from anthropogenic activities participating in weathering of carbonate impact on regional and global carbon cycles remain poorly understood raymond and hamilton 2018 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 sun et al 2021 how to precisely evaluate the influence of anthropogenic activities on karstification process and reasonably deduct the hco3 derived from carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and or nitric acid are still key issues for accurate estimating of karst carbon sink flux li et al 2008 jiang 2013 these questions will be of great significance for advancing the current study on the global carbon cycle and climate change as sulfuric acid and nitric acid are playing a more and more significant role in carbonate weathering with the intensification of anthropogenic activities raymond et al 2008 martin 2017 raymond and hamilton 2018 zhang et al 2020 studying the mechanistic carbon sink stability of karst water under the conditions of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids involved in weathering of carbonate is imperative to optimize existing global carbon cycle model in this study we conducted catchment wide investigations into the chemical compositions and carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon Î´ 13cdic in groundwater under the base flow condition from a typical karst catchment guohua southwestern china our study conducted an extensive sampling which carefully collected all the representative groundwater types developed in all different strata in the dry season in guohua catchment the study area has been affected by anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids so that stoichiometric analyses could be used to quantitatively evaluate the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate weathering and associated carbon sink effect 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the guohua catchment 23 16 23 27 n 107 13 107 27 e is situated in the middle reaches of the youjiang river in the southwest of pingguo county of guangxi zhuang autonomous region southwestern china fig 1 this catchment is characterized by a typical karst landscape and the topography is dominated by peak cluster depressions the elevation of the catchment is between 50 and 650 m above the sea level this region has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 21 6 c and annual precipitation of 1359 mm xie et al 2017 the monsoonal climate results in a rainy season from may to september and a dry season from october to april the study area is dominantly composed of devonian d carboniferous c and permian p marine limestones and dolomitic limestones with a few triassic t carbonate rocks intercalated with a small amount of detrital rocks mudstones and shales less than 5 in the northeast of the catchment fig 1 there are no evaporite rocks in the study area karst landscapes are well developed in the catchment and karst sinkholes shafts window caves etc are widely distributed in the depressions the karst depressions valleys and surrounding gentle slopes are the main areas for agricultural activities where nitrogen potash and human and livestock manure fertilizers are commonly used in addition some scattered villages are distributed in these low relief karst terrains 2 2 sampling and analytical methods a total of 70 groundwater samples w01 w70 collected all the representative groundwater types developed in all different strata from representative epikarst springs 37 samples karst springs 12 samples and outlets and conduits of subterranean river 21 samples were sampled in november 2015 during the dry season from the study area sample locations are shown in fig 1 generally whether chemical weathering reaches thermodynamic equilibrium is controlled by the relative reaction rate and fluid residence time maher 2011 liu and han 2020a many studies have proved that the riverine solute flux is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium with a low run off e g godsey et al 2009 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 moon et al 2014 our groundwater samples were sampled during the dry season thus the groundwater was supplied by rain water with longer fluid residence time in aquifer this indicates that the chemical weathering in guohua catchment during the dry season may be under thermodynamic control the samples collected in the dry season provide an opportunity to study the chemical weathering progress and carbon cycling in karst catchment under thermodynamic equilibrium which can help better understand the chemical weathering processes and associated carbon sink budget chemical weathering in the wet season may be affected by the kinetic control west et al 2005 sun et al 2019 and the correlation between the hco3 contents and carbon isotopic values may be covered liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 liu and han 2020a therefore the samples in this study were collected in the dry season still the temporal variations of water chemistry and isotopic values with a typical frequency of seasonal monthly sampling interval need the further studies the water ph and temperature t were measured in situ using a multi3430 portable multi parameter analyzer wtw germany with a resolution of 0 01 ph unit and 0 1 c respectively the instrument was calibrated using ph 4 7 and 10 standard before each day of use hco3 and ca2 concentrations were determined by the aquamerck alkalinity and calcium tests kits merck company germany in the field with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l and 1 mg l respectively each sample was titrated two to three times and the average error was 5 all groundwater samples were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m membrane filters in order to remove suspended particles each filtered groundwater sample was stored in two clean 600 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and one 30 ml hdpe bottle one 600 ml hdpe bottle of water sample for mg2 k and na analyses was acidified with ultra purified 6 n hno3 to ph 2 and another 600 ml hdpe bottle of water sample was untreated for cl so4 2 and no3 analyses the sample for Î´ 13cdic analysis was immediately filtered through cleaned 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter kept in the 30 ml hdpe bottle with air tight cap and added 2 3 drops saturated hgcl2 solution about 0 05 ml to the bottle to prevent biological activity all samples were stored at 4 c before laboratory analysis anions cl so4 2 and no3 were measured by an ion chromatograph 861 advanced compact ic metrohm switzerland while k na and mg2 were measured by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo fisher scientific usa with a resolution of 0 01 mg l for all these ions the relative standard deviations of all the analysis were within 5 the anion concentration reported was ionic rather than elemental concentration such as no3 and so4 2 were reported as mg l no3 and so4 2 rather than mg l n and s respectively the Î´ 13cdic was measured by a gasbench ii interfaced with a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa and the result was reported at the v pdb scale with a precision better than 0 1 the saturation index of calcite sic and the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in the studied groundwater was calculated using the program watspec wigley 1977 3 results the chemical compositions and Î´ 13cdic of groundwater samples from the guohua catchment are listed in table 1 the ph values of groundwater samples ranged from 6 79 to 8 09 with a mean value of 7 20 most of the samples had ph values higher than 7 reflecting the control of carbonate weathering the sic values of groundwater samples ranged from 0 1 to 0 8 with a mean value of 0 2 and most of the values were close to 0 indicating that the water rock interaction within the aquifer is extensive and has reached equilibrium the total cationic charge tz na k 2mg2 2ca2 of groundwater ranged from 2 70 to 11 75 meq l with a mean value of 6 01 meq l and the total anionic charge tz cl 2so4 2 hco3 no3 varied from 2 76 to 9 40 meq l with a mean value of 5 80 meq l the total dissolved cations and total dissolved anions except for one sample w60 were balanced within 7 7 of the normalized inorganic charge balance nicb and nicb is near zero for most of the samples table 1 showing that the overall analytical uncertainty from this study was very small this provides evidence that the contribution of organic ligands was not significant to the charge balance ca2 concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 50 to 158 mg l with a mean value of 107 mg l the mg2 concentrations in groundwater samples varied from 0 5 to 46 1 mg l averaging 7 0 mg l ca2 and mg2 together accounted for 92 4 99 7 of the total cations hco3 was the most abundant anion in groundwater samples with concentrations ranged from 152 5 to 506 3 mg l mean value of 321 3 mg l accounting for 83 0 97 4 of the total anions the so4 2 in groundwater samples ranged from 4 9 to 47 4 mg l the concentrations of no3 cl k and na in groundwater were low ranging from 0 to 38 6 mg l mean value of 8 2 mg l from 0 4 to 9 0 mg l mean value of 2 8 mg l from 0 1 to 5 7 mg l mean value of 0 9 mg l from 0 3 to 6 5 mg l mean value of 1 4 mg l respectively the hydrochemical type of ca hco3 for most groundwater samples suggests that carbonate weathering primarily controls the chemical composition and species the Î´ 13cdic values of groundwater samples varied from 16 8 to 8 1 with a mean value of 12 9 4 discussion 4 1 involvement of sulfuric and nitric acids in carbonate weathering the study area is significantly affected by acidic precipitation cheng et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2019 and hco3 concentrations of precipitation are below the detection limit 6 mg l wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 thus the contribution of atmospheric inputs to the groundwater hco3 concentration can be ignored in addition the study catchment is far away from the sea and the ca2 0 30 3 93 mg l and mg2 0 03 0 31 mg l concentrations of precipitation are very low in southwest of china wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 thus it cannot have accountable contribution of ca2 and mg2 because the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater were several orders of magnitude higher than that of atmospheric inputs as mentioned above there are no evaporite rocks in the study area thus no ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater were derived from evaporite rocks as shown in fig 1 some surface river water derived from the parts of silicate system entered from the south of the study catchment and the northeast of the study catchment is dominantly composed of triassic carbonate rocks intercalated with detrital rocks mudstones and shales indicating that some ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions in the groundwater originated from the weathering of silicate rocks however the amount of surface river water from the silicate system was relatively very small and the detrital rocks mudstones and shales are only distributed in the northeast of the study catchment where the corresponding distribution area of detrital rocks is less than 5 which coincides with the fact that the concentrations of k and na in groundwater were very low and k and na together only accounted for 0 3 7 6 of the total cations thus the contribution of silicate weathering to ca2 mg2 and hco3 of groundwater in the catchment was not significant and can be neglected due to the rapid dissolution kinetics dreybrodt 1988 liu and dreybrodt 1997 kump et al 2000 and high solubility dreybrodt 1988 cappellen and qiu 1997 of carbonate therefore ca2 mg2 and hco3 were mainly derived from carbonate weathering as shown by eq 1 when carbonate weathering is controlled by natural pathway of carbonic acid the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio should be close to 1 however the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratios of groundwater samples varied from 1 00 to 1 41 showing that the carbonate rocks have not been dissolved exclusively by carbonic acid only other sources of acid thus should have contribution to carbonate weathering as indicated by eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 when carbonate weathering is governed by carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids only the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 equivalent ratio should be 1 fig 2 shows the equivalent ratios of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 in all of our groundwater samples were approximately equal to 1 which suggests that the calculated excess ca2 mg2 hco3 was compensated by so4 2 no3 this implies that nitric and sulfuric acids may also have played an important role in carbonate weathering in our study catchment meanwhile the equivalent concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 no3 for all groundwater samples had a very good regression correlation r2 0 9477 the corresponding slope of the regression line was 1 12 fig 2 which was very close to 1 suggesting that carbonate weathering was controlled by different contribution ratios of carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids in groundwater this result is also shown by the plot of the equivalent ratios of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 in fig 3 which shows that all groundwater samples were distributed between three end members carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and carbonate weathering by nitric acid furthermore according to eq 2 and eq 3 the equivalent concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 no3 would increase simultaneously if both nitric acid and sulfuric acid were involved in carbonate weathering the positive trend between the equivalent concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 no3 observed in our groundwater samples fig 4 supports their involvement in addition the distribution of all groundwater samples were deviated from the gypsum dissolution line fig 3 which is consistent with the fact that there are no gypsum strata distributed in the study area therefore carbonic acid could not have been the sole dissolving agent and thus both nitric acid and sulfuric acid played an important role in carbonate weathering in guohua catchment the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in groundwater samples varied from 1 239 to 67 453 ppmv with a mean value of 24 664 ppmv table 1 which was 68 5 times higher than that in atmosphere 360 ppmv cartwright 2010 and fell within the range of soil co2 concentrations in karst area 1057 60000 ppmv liu et al 1998 li et al 2002 yang et al 2015 this reflects the fact that groundwater equilibrated with pco2 in soil as such hco3 in the study area is likely to have two potential sources soil co2 and carbonate bedrock the soil co2 principally originates from degradation of organic matter and root respiration during periods of high biological activity rasse et al 2001 the carbon isotopic composition of biogenic co2 is usually similar to that of organic matter cerling et al 1991 clark and fritz 1997 generally the Î´ 13c value of soil co2 in karst areas has a wide range of 29 35 to 18 26 zheng 1999 pan et al 2002 cao et al 2011 whereas marine carbonate rocks have a Î´ 13c value close to around 0 clark and fritz 1997 telmer and veizer 1999 in general the fractionation of the carbon isotopic composition is around 9 between soil co2 and hco3 deines 2004 zhang et al 1995 thus if the hco3 in groundwater is produced from the carbonate weathering with soil co2 we should obtain a theoretical Î´ 13cdic of 20 35 to 9 26 this range is considered to represent the Î´ 13c values of hco3 produced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid only in groundwater in the study area in this study the lowest Î´ 13cdic value of groundwater in the study area was 16 8 table 1 and the corresponding ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio was 1 04 which is consistent with the theoretical ratio of the carbonate weathering by carbonic acid ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio 1 thus the value of 16 8 can represent the Î´ 13cdic value of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid however when weathering of carbonate is facilitated by sulfuric and nitric acids according to eq 2 and eq 3 all hco3 is derived from carbonate and thus hco3 should have an identical Î´ 13cdic value 0 to that of the marine carbonate and the corresponding ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio should be equal to 2 fig 5 shows that the groundwater samples were plotted between carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids supporting that ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater mainly originated from carbonate weathering by carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids 4 2 anthropogenic origin of so4 2 and no3 generally so4 2 in water is mainly derived from gypsum dissolution sulfide oxidation and anthropogenic inputs savoie and prospero 1989 li et al 2008 2014 gorman et al 2017 kaushal et al 2017 however there was little sulfur in the strata and no sulfate deposition and sulfide deposits were found in our study catchment during the field investigation and sampling process similar strata and results were also reported by previous studies in the lijiang river basin sun et al 2019 2021 and xijiang river basin yu et al 2016 southwest china thus the contribution of carbonate rocks to the groundwater so4 2 concentration can be neglected therefore so4 2 in the groundwater mainly originated from anthropogenic inputs our investigation on situation of fertilizer application in farmland in guohua catchment showed that nitrogen potash and manure fertilizers were commonly used in farmland but sulfur containing fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate were not used which is consistent with previous report huang et al 2007 thus the contribution of fertilizers to sulfur in groundwater can be neglected furthermore some scattered villages were distributed in these low relief karst terrains in guohua catchment thus the contribution of domestic sewage to sulfur in groundwater was limited as discussed above the study area is significantly affected by acidic precipitation cheng et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2019 the rainwater acidification is controlled by the existence of sulfuric and nitric acids and both of them mainly originate from anthropogenic sources singh and agrawal 2008 wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 the so4 2 concentrations of groundwater samples ranged from 2 7 to 47 4 mg l table 1 in guohua catchment which were within the range of that in precipitation 0 94 86 2 mg l wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 therefore the so4 2 in groundwater may mainly originate from precipitation according to berner and berner 1987 sulfuric acid in rainwater mainly originates from the reaction between anthropogenic so2 from coal combustion and automobile exhaust in the atmosphere and free radicals of oh and or aqueous h2o2 in droplets thus the so4 2 in groundwater in our study catchment indicated that the reaction between carbonate rocks and sulfuric acid from precipitation was the main source li et al 2008 sun et al 2019 the no3 concentrations of the samples ranged from 0 to 38 6 mg l table 1 most of which were within the range of that in precipitation 0 30 5 mg l wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 indicating that the no3 in groundwater may mainly originate from precipitation however the no3 concentrations of some groundwater samples were higher than that of precipitation thus the high content of no3 relative to precipitation is likely mainly originated from the nitrification of n fertilizers in soil gandois et al 2011 sun et al 2019 due to the fact that n fertilizers are commonly used in farmland therefore no3 was mainly sourced from precipitation and the nitrification of n fertilizers in soil in guohua catchment those results are consistent with the field investigation in the study catchment most of the groundwater recharge areas are karst depressions and karst valleys in which vast areas of agricultural land n fertilizers are frequently used are distributed therefore the discharge of nitrogen and sulfur in these recharge areas would have a great impact on the chemical compositions of karst groundwater due to agricultural activities and the input of acid precipitation admittedly the results based on the geological conditions and current situation of anthropogenic activities including atmospheric inputs fertilizer application and domestic sewage in the study area are somewhat not as robust as that obtained by isotopic fingerprints Î´ 34sso4 and Î´ 18oso4 Î´ 15nno3 and Î´ 18ono3 however simple and nearly identical lithology land cover and anthropogenic activities make using only the concentration of ions and Î´ 13cdic in groundwater to prove the sources of so4 2 and no3 become a simple task the results however provide a reliable perspective on the exploration of anthropogenic origin of so4 2 and no3 given isotopic tracers are not currently available still isotopic tracers need to be applied in the further studies to gather more persuasive evidence about the sources of so4 2 and no3 systematic analysis on groundwater chemistry and isotopes will help to solve the problem of quantitative identification of different sources of s and n in our following work 4 3 quantify the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate weathering and carbon sink effect according to eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 we assumed that k 1 mmol l carbonic acid k 2 mmol l sulfuric acid and k 3 mmol l nitric acid all simultaneously weather carbonate minerals and the carbonate weathering by these three acids can thus be described by the following generalized equation eq 4 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 caxmg1 xco3 k 1h2co3 k 2h2so4 k 3hno3 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 xca2 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 1 x mg2 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 hco3 k 2so4 2 k 3no3 0 x 1 because all ca2 mg2 and hco3 present in groundwater are assumed to have been derived from carbonate weathering by carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids the total concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 were calculated as follows ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering k 1 2 k 2 k 3 hco3 carbonate weathering 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 therefore k 1 hco3 carbonate weathering ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering the contribution ratio of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and hco3 carbonate weathering in groundwater can thus be calculated by k 1 ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and k 1 hco3 carbonate weathering respectively furthermore the contribution ratios of carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and hco3 carbonate weathering in groundwater can be calculated by 1 k 1 ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and 1 2 k 1 hco3 carbonate weathering respectively it is noted that according to eq 4 the exact value of k 2 and k 3 for carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids cannot be separately calculated one reason is that the identical molar ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 was released into groundwater when the carbonate was weathered by sulfuric acid or nitric acid another reason is that the exact concentrations of so4 2 and no3 in groundwater which resulted from carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and nitric acid respectively cannot be precisely analyzed the calculated results are presented in table 1 the contribution ratio of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varied from 42 0 to 99 4 with a mean value of 79 1 and from 59 1 to 99 7 with a mean value of 87 8 respectively while the contribution ratios of carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varied from 0 6 to 58 0 with a mean value of 20 9 and from 0 3 to 40 9 with a mean value of 12 2 respectively thus the weathering rate of carbonate has increased by 20 9 while the karst carbon sink flux has decreased by 12 2 in our study catchment suggesting that sulfuric and nitric acids introduced by anthropogenic activities in addition to carbonic acid played an important role in carbonate weathering it is notable that such karst catchment is fairly typical and the elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations are extensively reported in karst systems which is similar to other studies in many karst catchments and basins in the world e g semhi et al 2000 perrin et al 2008 calmels et al 2007 ali and atekwana 2011 zhang et al 2007 huang et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 and thus it is likely that this result can be applied to most karst catchments therefore anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid involved in carbonate weathering in karst systems are universal and may affect the globe carbon cycle because the broad karst areas accounts for 12 of the world s total land area wang et al 1999 wei et al 2017 furthermore the role of anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid in carbonate weathering should not be ignored in the global carbon cycle especially in the area of the use of a large amount of fertilizer the discharge of sewage and the increase of acid rain with the development of agriculture urbanization and industrialization in karst areas however in the current global carbon cycle model the geochemical processes of sulfuric acid and or nitric acid involved in carbonate weathering and their carbon sink flux reduction effect still have not drawn enough attention liu et al 2010 martin 2017 thus the estimate of carbon fluxes from carbonate weathering may have large uncertainties due to the fact that anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid can have variable contributions to carbonate weathering in regional and global carbon budgets therefore accurate estimates of carbon sink flux from carbonate weathering should consider the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid on carbonate weathering and the associated effect of carbon sink flux reduction 5 conclusions karst groundwater sampled from the typical karst catchment during the dry season in guohua southwestern china is characterized by abundant ca2 mg2 and hco3 indicating that the hydrochemistry is dominantly controlled by weathering of carbonate anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids in addition to carbonic acid are significantly involved in carbonate weathering in the study catchment the contributions of carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids to ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varied from 0 6 to 58 0 with a mean value of 20 9 and from 0 3 to 40 9 with a mean value of 12 2 respectively the corresponding weathering rate of carbonate increased by 20 9 while the karst carbon sink flux decreased by 12 2 therefore sulfuric acid and or nitric acid from anthropogenic activities can reduce the karst carbon sink flux by carbonate weathering and change the global carbon cycle due to the large karst areas worldwide therefore the role of anthropogenic

4443,accurate estimate of carbon sink flux resulted from carbonate weathering in the karst area is of great significance for advancing the current understanding of the global carbon cycle and climate change however the carbon sink flux may be overestimated when the natural reaction with carbonic acid is influenced by protons of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids which can reduce the carbon sink flux during carbonate weathering here we quantitatively evaluated the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate weathering and carbon sink flux under base flow condition based on the stoichiometry of chemical compositions of groundwater from a typical karst catchment guohua guangxi southwestern china seventy groundwater samples were analyzed for the characteristics of hydrochemistry and carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon Î´ 13cdic during the dry season in 2015 the results show that 1 ca2 and mg2 dominate 92 4 99 7 of the total cations while hco3 accounts for 83 0 97 4 of total anions indicating that the compositions of groundwater are primarily controlled by carbonate weathering 2 the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratios 1 00 to 1 41 and the corresponding Î´ 13cdic values 16 8 to 8 1 of groundwater are all distributed between carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids meanwhile the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 ratios of groundwater are about 1 and the ca2 mg2 equivalent concentrations have a good positive correlation with hco3 so4 2 no3 and so4 2 no3 suggesting that sulfuric and nitric acids in addition to carbonic acid have been involved in carbonate weathering 3 the contribution of sulfuric and nitric acids involved in carbonate weathering to ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varies from 0 6 to 58 0 mean value of 20 9 and from 0 3 to 40 9 mean value of 12 2 respectively the carbonate weathering rate has increased by 20 9 while the karst carbon sink flux has decreased by 12 2 therefore the carbon sink flux produced by carbonate weathering should be carefully evaluated when anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid are involved and the role of sulfuric and nitric acids in carbonate weathering could not be ignored in the global carbon cycle keywords carbonate weathering sulfuric acid nitric acid Î´ 13cdic carbon cycle karst groundwater 1 introduction rock weathering plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and thus can significantly influence global climate change bluth and kump 1994 white and blum 1995 gislason et al 1996 louvat and allÃ¨gre 1997 the conventional carbon cycle hypothesis berner and kothavala 2001 wallmann 2001 assumes that atmospheric co2 consumed by carbonate weathering will be released back to the atmosphere during the precipitation of carbonate minerals thus carbonate weathering cannot be considered as a net sink of atmospheric co2 over geological time scale however at short time scale of 102 105 yrs due to the rapid dissolution kinetics dreybrodt 1988 liu and dreybrodt 1997 kump et al 2000 and high solubility dreybrodt 1988 cappellen and qiu 1997 of carbonate the carbon sink budget generated by carbonate weathering can be as large as 6 0 108 t c a yuan 1997 liu and zhao 2000 liu et al 2010 about accounting for 18 50 of the missing carbon sink flux 1 2 109 3 4 109 t c a detwiler and charles 1988 tans et al 1990 sundquist 1993 lal 2008 therefore the carbon sink resulted from carbonate weathering is an important part of missing carbon sink budget liu et al 2010 martin 2017 so that it plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and climate change carbonic acid exists in natural environment and can weather the carbonate rocks following the reaction of eq 1 caxmg1 xco3 h2o co2 xca2 1 x mg2 2hco3 0 x 1 yuan 1997 jiang and yuan 1999 in this case half of hco3 is derived from carbonate and the other half is derived from atmospheric or soil co2 therefore the carbonate weathering by carbonic acid can uptake co2 from the atmosphere or soil by converting co2 into hco3 and thus serves as an important atmospheric co2 sink in karst groundwater hco3 is generally the dominant dissolved anion originated from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid in the current global carbon cycle model the contribution of sulfuric and nitric acids involved in weathering of carbonate has not drawn much attention liu et al 2010 martin 2017 however in recent years the increasing usage of fertilizer the discharge of sewage and the increase of acid rain with the development of agriculture urbanization and industrialization have led to the increasing concentrations of sulfuric and nitric acids in groundwater which have widely participated in chemical weathering of carbonate perrin et al 2008 raymond et al 2008 ali and atekwana 2011 martin 2017 zhu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 sulfuric and nitric acids participating in weathering of carbonate can also generate hco3 eq 2 2caxmg1 xco3 h2so4 2xca2 2 1 x mg2 2hco3 so4 2 0 x 1 eq 3 caxmg1 xco3 hno3 xca2 1 x mg2 hco3 no3 0 x 1 martin 2017 and greatly increase the hco3 concentration in water in these cases however all hco3 are totally derived from the carbonate and there is no co2 sequestration therefore the weathering of carbonate by sulfuric and nitric acids can be regarded as a source for the atmosphere co2 with no rapid balancing atmospheric co2 sink lerman et al 2007 perrin et al 2008 martin 2017 xu et al 2021 in a karst catchment hco3 produced by carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids can account for 11 40 of total hco3 in karst water jiang 2013 yu et al 2016 li and ji 2016 huang et al 2017 indicating that karst carbon sink flux can remarkably decrease by up to 40 throughout the world there are many karst catchments where sulfuric and nitric acids produced by anthropogenic activities have significantly participated in carbonate weathering such as the garonne river basin in south western france semhi et al 2000 perrin et al 2008 the mackenzie river basin in northwestern canada calmels et al 2007 the federal tailings pile karst catchment in southeastern missouri of usa ali and atekwana 2011 and the zhujiang river basin zhang et al 2007 the upper middle reaches of the wujiang river basin huang et al 2017 and liujiang river basin zhu et al 2019 in china nevertheless the role of sulfuric acid and nitric acid from anthropogenic activities in carbonate weathering is still often ignored both locally and globally and the calculation of karst carbon sink flux did not take the hco3 derived from carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids into account but assumed that all hco3 derived from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid yuan 1997 liu and zhao 2000 liu et al 2010 thus the carbon sink flux from carbonate weathering is overestimated to accurately estimate the carbon sink flux resulted from carbonate weathering the proportion of carbon sink flux from carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids should be reasonably deducted at regional and global scales as karst areas account for 12 of the world s total land area wang et al 1999 wei et al 2017 however sulfuric and nitric acids from anthropogenic activities participating in weathering of carbonate impact on regional and global carbon cycles remain poorly understood raymond and hamilton 2018 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 sun et al 2021 how to precisely evaluate the influence of anthropogenic activities on karstification process and reasonably deduct the hco3 derived from carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and or nitric acid are still key issues for accurate estimating of karst carbon sink flux li et al 2008 jiang 2013 these questions will be of great significance for advancing the current study on the global carbon cycle and climate change as sulfuric acid and nitric acid are playing a more and more significant role in carbonate weathering with the intensification of anthropogenic activities raymond et al 2008 martin 2017 raymond and hamilton 2018 zhang et al 2020 studying the mechanistic carbon sink stability of karst water under the conditions of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids involved in weathering of carbonate is imperative to optimize existing global carbon cycle model in this study we conducted catchment wide investigations into the chemical compositions and carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon Î´ 13cdic in groundwater under the base flow condition from a typical karst catchment guohua southwestern china our study conducted an extensive sampling which carefully collected all the representative groundwater types developed in all different strata in the dry season in guohua catchment the study area has been affected by anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids so that stoichiometric analyses could be used to quantitatively evaluate the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate weathering and associated carbon sink effect 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the guohua catchment 23 16 23 27 n 107 13 107 27 e is situated in the middle reaches of the youjiang river in the southwest of pingguo county of guangxi zhuang autonomous region southwestern china fig 1 this catchment is characterized by a typical karst landscape and the topography is dominated by peak cluster depressions the elevation of the catchment is between 50 and 650 m above the sea level this region has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 21 6 c and annual precipitation of 1359 mm xie et al 2017 the monsoonal climate results in a rainy season from may to september and a dry season from october to april the study area is dominantly composed of devonian d carboniferous c and permian p marine limestones and dolomitic limestones with a few triassic t carbonate rocks intercalated with a small amount of detrital rocks mudstones and shales less than 5 in the northeast of the catchment fig 1 there are no evaporite rocks in the study area karst landscapes are well developed in the catchment and karst sinkholes shafts window caves etc are widely distributed in the depressions the karst depressions valleys and surrounding gentle slopes are the main areas for agricultural activities where nitrogen potash and human and livestock manure fertilizers are commonly used in addition some scattered villages are distributed in these low relief karst terrains 2 2 sampling and analytical methods a total of 70 groundwater samples w01 w70 collected all the representative groundwater types developed in all different strata from representative epikarst springs 37 samples karst springs 12 samples and outlets and conduits of subterranean river 21 samples were sampled in november 2015 during the dry season from the study area sample locations are shown in fig 1 generally whether chemical weathering reaches thermodynamic equilibrium is controlled by the relative reaction rate and fluid residence time maher 2011 liu and han 2020a many studies have proved that the riverine solute flux is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium with a low run off e g godsey et al 2009 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 moon et al 2014 our groundwater samples were sampled during the dry season thus the groundwater was supplied by rain water with longer fluid residence time in aquifer this indicates that the chemical weathering in guohua catchment during the dry season may be under thermodynamic control the samples collected in the dry season provide an opportunity to study the chemical weathering progress and carbon cycling in karst catchment under thermodynamic equilibrium which can help better understand the chemical weathering processes and associated carbon sink budget chemical weathering in the wet season may be affected by the kinetic control west et al 2005 sun et al 2019 and the correlation between the hco3 contents and carbon isotopic values may be covered liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 liu and han 2020a therefore the samples in this study were collected in the dry season still the temporal variations of water chemistry and isotopic values with a typical frequency of seasonal monthly sampling interval need the further studies the water ph and temperature t were measured in situ using a multi3430 portable multi parameter analyzer wtw germany with a resolution of 0 01 ph unit and 0 1 c respectively the instrument was calibrated using ph 4 7 and 10 standard before each day of use hco3 and ca2 concentrations were determined by the aquamerck alkalinity and calcium tests kits merck company germany in the field with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l and 1 mg l respectively each sample was titrated two to three times and the average error was 5 all groundwater samples were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m membrane filters in order to remove suspended particles each filtered groundwater sample was stored in two clean 600 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and one 30 ml hdpe bottle one 600 ml hdpe bottle of water sample for mg2 k and na analyses was acidified with ultra purified 6 n hno3 to ph 2 and another 600 ml hdpe bottle of water sample was untreated for cl so4 2 and no3 analyses the sample for Î´ 13cdic analysis was immediately filtered through cleaned 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter kept in the 30 ml hdpe bottle with air tight cap and added 2 3 drops saturated hgcl2 solution about 0 05 ml to the bottle to prevent biological activity all samples were stored at 4 c before laboratory analysis anions cl so4 2 and no3 were measured by an ion chromatograph 861 advanced compact ic metrohm switzerland while k na and mg2 were measured by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo fisher scientific usa with a resolution of 0 01 mg l for all these ions the relative standard deviations of all the analysis were within 5 the anion concentration reported was ionic rather than elemental concentration such as no3 and so4 2 were reported as mg l no3 and so4 2 rather than mg l n and s respectively the Î´ 13cdic was measured by a gasbench ii interfaced with a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa and the result was reported at the v pdb scale with a precision better than 0 1 the saturation index of calcite sic and the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in the studied groundwater was calculated using the program watspec wigley 1977 3 results the chemical compositions and Î´ 13cdic of groundwater samples from the guohua catchment are listed in table 1 the ph values of groundwater samples ranged from 6 79 to 8 09 with a mean value of 7 20 most of the samples had ph values higher than 7 reflecting the control of carbonate weathering the sic values of groundwater samples ranged from 0 1 to 0 8 with a mean value of 0 2 and most of the values were close to 0 indicating that the water rock interaction within the aquifer is extensive and has reached equilibrium the total cationic charge tz na k 2mg2 2ca2 of groundwater ranged from 2 70 to 11 75 meq l with a mean value of 6 01 meq l and the total anionic charge tz cl 2so4 2 hco3 no3 varied from 2 76 to 9 40 meq l with a mean value of 5 80 meq l the total dissolved cations and total dissolved anions except for one sample w60 were balanced within 7 7 of the normalized inorganic charge balance nicb and nicb is near zero for most of the samples table 1 showing that the overall analytical uncertainty from this study was very small this provides evidence that the contribution of organic ligands was not significant to the charge balance ca2 concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 50 to 158 mg l with a mean value of 107 mg l the mg2 concentrations in groundwater samples varied from 0 5 to 46 1 mg l averaging 7 0 mg l ca2 and mg2 together accounted for 92 4 99 7 of the total cations hco3 was the most abundant anion in groundwater samples with concentrations ranged from 152 5 to 506 3 mg l mean value of 321 3 mg l accounting for 83 0 97 4 of the total anions the so4 2 in groundwater samples ranged from 4 9 to 47 4 mg l the concentrations of no3 cl k and na in groundwater were low ranging from 0 to 38 6 mg l mean value of 8 2 mg l from 0 4 to 9 0 mg l mean value of 2 8 mg l from 0 1 to 5 7 mg l mean value of 0 9 mg l from 0 3 to 6 5 mg l mean value of 1 4 mg l respectively the hydrochemical type of ca hco3 for most groundwater samples suggests that carbonate weathering primarily controls the chemical composition and species the Î´ 13cdic values of groundwater samples varied from 16 8 to 8 1 with a mean value of 12 9 4 discussion 4 1 involvement of sulfuric and nitric acids in carbonate weathering the study area is significantly affected by acidic precipitation cheng et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2019 and hco3 concentrations of precipitation are below the detection limit 6 mg l wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 thus the contribution of atmospheric inputs to the groundwater hco3 concentration can be ignored in addition the study catchment is far away from the sea and the ca2 0 30 3 93 mg l and mg2 0 03 0 31 mg l concentrations of precipitation are very low in southwest of china wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 thus it cannot have accountable contribution of ca2 and mg2 because the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater were several orders of magnitude higher than that of atmospheric inputs as mentioned above there are no evaporite rocks in the study area thus no ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater were derived from evaporite rocks as shown in fig 1 some surface river water derived from the parts of silicate system entered from the south of the study catchment and the northeast of the study catchment is dominantly composed of triassic carbonate rocks intercalated with detrital rocks mudstones and shales indicating that some ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions in the groundwater originated from the weathering of silicate rocks however the amount of surface river water from the silicate system was relatively very small and the detrital rocks mudstones and shales are only distributed in the northeast of the study catchment where the corresponding distribution area of detrital rocks is less than 5 which coincides with the fact that the concentrations of k and na in groundwater were very low and k and na together only accounted for 0 3 7 6 of the total cations thus the contribution of silicate weathering to ca2 mg2 and hco3 of groundwater in the catchment was not significant and can be neglected due to the rapid dissolution kinetics dreybrodt 1988 liu and dreybrodt 1997 kump et al 2000 and high solubility dreybrodt 1988 cappellen and qiu 1997 of carbonate therefore ca2 mg2 and hco3 were mainly derived from carbonate weathering as shown by eq 1 when carbonate weathering is controlled by natural pathway of carbonic acid the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio should be close to 1 however the ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratios of groundwater samples varied from 1 00 to 1 41 showing that the carbonate rocks have not been dissolved exclusively by carbonic acid only other sources of acid thus should have contribution to carbonate weathering as indicated by eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 when carbonate weathering is governed by carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids only the ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 equivalent ratio should be 1 fig 2 shows the equivalent ratios of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 in all of our groundwater samples were approximately equal to 1 which suggests that the calculated excess ca2 mg2 hco3 was compensated by so4 2 no3 this implies that nitric and sulfuric acids may also have played an important role in carbonate weathering in our study catchment meanwhile the equivalent concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 no3 for all groundwater samples had a very good regression correlation r2 0 9477 the corresponding slope of the regression line was 1 12 fig 2 which was very close to 1 suggesting that carbonate weathering was controlled by different contribution ratios of carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids in groundwater this result is also shown by the plot of the equivalent ratios of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 hco3 in fig 3 which shows that all groundwater samples were distributed between three end members carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and carbonate weathering by nitric acid furthermore according to eq 2 and eq 3 the equivalent concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 no3 would increase simultaneously if both nitric acid and sulfuric acid were involved in carbonate weathering the positive trend between the equivalent concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 no3 observed in our groundwater samples fig 4 supports their involvement in addition the distribution of all groundwater samples were deviated from the gypsum dissolution line fig 3 which is consistent with the fact that there are no gypsum strata distributed in the study area therefore carbonic acid could not have been the sole dissolving agent and thus both nitric acid and sulfuric acid played an important role in carbonate weathering in guohua catchment the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in groundwater samples varied from 1 239 to 67 453 ppmv with a mean value of 24 664 ppmv table 1 which was 68 5 times higher than that in atmosphere 360 ppmv cartwright 2010 and fell within the range of soil co2 concentrations in karst area 1057 60000 ppmv liu et al 1998 li et al 2002 yang et al 2015 this reflects the fact that groundwater equilibrated with pco2 in soil as such hco3 in the study area is likely to have two potential sources soil co2 and carbonate bedrock the soil co2 principally originates from degradation of organic matter and root respiration during periods of high biological activity rasse et al 2001 the carbon isotopic composition of biogenic co2 is usually similar to that of organic matter cerling et al 1991 clark and fritz 1997 generally the Î´ 13c value of soil co2 in karst areas has a wide range of 29 35 to 18 26 zheng 1999 pan et al 2002 cao et al 2011 whereas marine carbonate rocks have a Î´ 13c value close to around 0 clark and fritz 1997 telmer and veizer 1999 in general the fractionation of the carbon isotopic composition is around 9 between soil co2 and hco3 deines 2004 zhang et al 1995 thus if the hco3 in groundwater is produced from the carbonate weathering with soil co2 we should obtain a theoretical Î´ 13cdic of 20 35 to 9 26 this range is considered to represent the Î´ 13c values of hco3 produced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid only in groundwater in the study area in this study the lowest Î´ 13cdic value of groundwater in the study area was 16 8 table 1 and the corresponding ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio was 1 04 which is consistent with the theoretical ratio of the carbonate weathering by carbonic acid ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio 1 thus the value of 16 8 can represent the Î´ 13cdic value of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid however when weathering of carbonate is facilitated by sulfuric and nitric acids according to eq 2 and eq 3 all hco3 is derived from carbonate and thus hco3 should have an identical Î´ 13cdic value 0 to that of the marine carbonate and the corresponding ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratio should be equal to 2 fig 5 shows that the groundwater samples were plotted between carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids supporting that ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater mainly originated from carbonate weathering by carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids 4 2 anthropogenic origin of so4 2 and no3 generally so4 2 in water is mainly derived from gypsum dissolution sulfide oxidation and anthropogenic inputs savoie and prospero 1989 li et al 2008 2014 gorman et al 2017 kaushal et al 2017 however there was little sulfur in the strata and no sulfate deposition and sulfide deposits were found in our study catchment during the field investigation and sampling process similar strata and results were also reported by previous studies in the lijiang river basin sun et al 2019 2021 and xijiang river basin yu et al 2016 southwest china thus the contribution of carbonate rocks to the groundwater so4 2 concentration can be neglected therefore so4 2 in the groundwater mainly originated from anthropogenic inputs our investigation on situation of fertilizer application in farmland in guohua catchment showed that nitrogen potash and manure fertilizers were commonly used in farmland but sulfur containing fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate were not used which is consistent with previous report huang et al 2007 thus the contribution of fertilizers to sulfur in groundwater can be neglected furthermore some scattered villages were distributed in these low relief karst terrains in guohua catchment thus the contribution of domestic sewage to sulfur in groundwater was limited as discussed above the study area is significantly affected by acidic precipitation cheng et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2019 the rainwater acidification is controlled by the existence of sulfuric and nitric acids and both of them mainly originate from anthropogenic sources singh and agrawal 2008 wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 the so4 2 concentrations of groundwater samples ranged from 2 7 to 47 4 mg l table 1 in guohua catchment which were within the range of that in precipitation 0 94 86 2 mg l wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 therefore the so4 2 in groundwater may mainly originate from precipitation according to berner and berner 1987 sulfuric acid in rainwater mainly originates from the reaction between anthropogenic so2 from coal combustion and automobile exhaust in the atmosphere and free radicals of oh and or aqueous h2o2 in droplets thus the so4 2 in groundwater in our study catchment indicated that the reaction between carbonate rocks and sulfuric acid from precipitation was the main source li et al 2008 sun et al 2019 the no3 concentrations of the samples ranged from 0 to 38 6 mg l table 1 most of which were within the range of that in precipitation 0 30 5 mg l wu et al 2012 zeng et al 2020 indicating that the no3 in groundwater may mainly originate from precipitation however the no3 concentrations of some groundwater samples were higher than that of precipitation thus the high content of no3 relative to precipitation is likely mainly originated from the nitrification of n fertilizers in soil gandois et al 2011 sun et al 2019 due to the fact that n fertilizers are commonly used in farmland therefore no3 was mainly sourced from precipitation and the nitrification of n fertilizers in soil in guohua catchment those results are consistent with the field investigation in the study catchment most of the groundwater recharge areas are karst depressions and karst valleys in which vast areas of agricultural land n fertilizers are frequently used are distributed therefore the discharge of nitrogen and sulfur in these recharge areas would have a great impact on the chemical compositions of karst groundwater due to agricultural activities and the input of acid precipitation admittedly the results based on the geological conditions and current situation of anthropogenic activities including atmospheric inputs fertilizer application and domestic sewage in the study area are somewhat not as robust as that obtained by isotopic fingerprints Î´ 34sso4 and Î´ 18oso4 Î´ 15nno3 and Î´ 18ono3 however simple and nearly identical lithology land cover and anthropogenic activities make using only the concentration of ions and Î´ 13cdic in groundwater to prove the sources of so4 2 and no3 become a simple task the results however provide a reliable perspective on the exploration of anthropogenic origin of so4 2 and no3 given isotopic tracers are not currently available still isotopic tracers need to be applied in the further studies to gather more persuasive evidence about the sources of so4 2 and no3 systematic analysis on groundwater chemistry and isotopes will help to solve the problem of quantitative identification of different sources of s and n in our following work 4 3 quantify the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids on carbonate weathering and carbon sink effect according to eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 we assumed that k 1 mmol l carbonic acid k 2 mmol l sulfuric acid and k 3 mmol l nitric acid all simultaneously weather carbonate minerals and the carbonate weathering by these three acids can thus be described by the following generalized equation eq 4 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 caxmg1 xco3 k 1h2co3 k 2h2so4 k 3hno3 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 xca2 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 1 x mg2 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 hco3 k 2so4 2 k 3no3 0 x 1 because all ca2 mg2 and hco3 present in groundwater are assumed to have been derived from carbonate weathering by carbonic sulfuric and nitric acids the total concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 were calculated as follows ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering k 1 2 k 2 k 3 hco3 carbonate weathering 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 3 therefore k 1 hco3 carbonate weathering ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering the contribution ratio of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and hco3 carbonate weathering in groundwater can thus be calculated by k 1 ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and k 1 hco3 carbonate weathering respectively furthermore the contribution ratios of carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and hco3 carbonate weathering in groundwater can be calculated by 1 k 1 ca2 mg2 carbonate weathering and 1 2 k 1 hco3 carbonate weathering respectively it is noted that according to eq 4 the exact value of k 2 and k 3 for carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids cannot be separately calculated one reason is that the identical molar ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 was released into groundwater when the carbonate was weathered by sulfuric acid or nitric acid another reason is that the exact concentrations of so4 2 and no3 in groundwater which resulted from carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid and nitric acid respectively cannot be precisely analyzed the calculated results are presented in table 1 the contribution ratio of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varied from 42 0 to 99 4 with a mean value of 79 1 and from 59 1 to 99 7 with a mean value of 87 8 respectively while the contribution ratios of carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids to total concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varied from 0 6 to 58 0 with a mean value of 20 9 and from 0 3 to 40 9 with a mean value of 12 2 respectively thus the weathering rate of carbonate has increased by 20 9 while the karst carbon sink flux has decreased by 12 2 in our study catchment suggesting that sulfuric and nitric acids introduced by anthropogenic activities in addition to carbonic acid played an important role in carbonate weathering it is notable that such karst catchment is fairly typical and the elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations are extensively reported in karst systems which is similar to other studies in many karst catchments and basins in the world e g semhi et al 2000 perrin et al 2008 calmels et al 2007 ali and atekwana 2011 zhang et al 2007 huang et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 and thus it is likely that this result can be applied to most karst catchments therefore anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid involved in carbonate weathering in karst systems are universal and may affect the globe carbon cycle because the broad karst areas accounts for 12 of the world s total land area wang et al 1999 wei et al 2017 furthermore the role of anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid in carbonate weathering should not be ignored in the global carbon cycle especially in the area of the use of a large amount of fertilizer the discharge of sewage and the increase of acid rain with the development of agriculture urbanization and industrialization in karst areas however in the current global carbon cycle model the geochemical processes of sulfuric acid and or nitric acid involved in carbonate weathering and their carbon sink flux reduction effect still have not drawn enough attention liu et al 2010 martin 2017 thus the estimate of carbon fluxes from carbonate weathering may have large uncertainties due to the fact that anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid can have variable contributions to carbonate weathering in regional and global carbon budgets therefore accurate estimates of carbon sink flux from carbonate weathering should consider the impact of anthropogenic sulfuric acid and or nitric acid on carbonate weathering and the associated effect of carbon sink flux reduction 5 conclusions karst groundwater sampled from the typical karst catchment during the dry season in guohua southwestern china is characterized by abundant ca2 mg2 and hco3 indicating that the hydrochemistry is dominantly controlled by weathering of carbonate anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids in addition to carbonic acid are significantly involved in carbonate weathering in the study catchment the contributions of carbonate weathering by sulfuric and nitric acids to ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater varied from 0 6 to 58 0 with a mean value of 20 9 and from 0 3 to 40 9 with a mean value of 12 2 respectively the corresponding weathering rate of carbonate increased by 20 9 while the karst carbon sink flux decreased by 12 2 therefore sulfuric acid and or nitric acid from anthropogenic activities can reduce the karst carbon sink flux by carbonate weathering and change the global carbon cycle due to the large karst areas worldwide therefore the role of anthropogenic sulfuric and nitric acids in carbonate weathering should not be ignored in the global carbon cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4444,spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties poses severe challenges to the modeling of soil moisture dynamics in agricultural fields for simplicity 1 d water flow models that ignore soil heterogeneity are commonly used to simulate water movement in agricultural fields as soil hydraulic properties are one of the most crucial input data it is particularly desirable to investigate how the simulations of these water flow models compare with experimental observations this study aims to examine the performances of streamtube 1 d and 3 d richards equation based water flow models with experimental observations experiments were conducted at an agricultural plot of 20 m 30 m located in iit kanpur india for 1 year under wheat triticum aestivum l and rice oryza sativa l crop covers the site was heavily instrumented to monitor soil moisture variation weather conditions root depth and lai further 54 undisturbed soil samples were analyzed to determine the heterogeneity in soil hydraulic parameters the results indicate that the performance of the models varies with land cover atmospheric boundary condition and crop growth stages besides the difference between model estimates varies with soil moisture wetness and a maximum relative error of 13 was observed under wetting conditions the streamtube model showed the best performance under wheat crop cover for all boundary conditions and growth stages as it considers spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties and irrigation application at each subplot the numerical 1d model was the best predictor under rice crop cover further the results suggest that an increase in model complexity does not lead to an improvement in water simulation and accurate representation of soil hydraulic properties plays a more important role keywords soil moisture numerical simulation model comparison land cover boundary condition 1 introduction reliable crop growth monitoring and yield are critical for the sustainable development of agriculture in the past few decades for large scale crop growth monitoring and yield prediction researchers have mostly relied on agro meteorological model forecasting and the development of simplified relationships between field measurements and remote sensing data based vegetation indexes kang et al 2016 xue and su 2017 van der velde and nissini 2019 however with advances in remote sensing data and computational power now more and more studies are focusing on integrated analysis of weather data remote sensing observations and crop growth model results li et al 2014 the commonly used crop growth models provide detailed estimates of crop states including phenological status leaf area index lai and yield for specific crop types eitzinger et al 2004 ritchie 1998 nevertheless they overly simplify the simulation of water movement in the vadose zone and it is mainly determined using a tipping bucket model ritchie 1998 shelia et al 2018 chen et al 2019 besides root length density is assumed to be linearly distributed and uniform root water uptake distributions are considered eitzinger et al 2004 chen et al 2019 in real field conditions the availablesoil moistureis the main driver for variability in crop yield anwar et al 2003 patil and sheelavantar 2004 and accurate estimates of soil moisture are essential for understanding and predicting crop status and yield to overcome the limitations of existing crop growth models many studies have started focusing on coupling crop growth models with more refined 1 d water flow models mccown et al 1996a 1996b van dam 2000 liang et al 2016 in these water flow models the flow field is derived from the numerical solution of the richards equation while the 1 d water flow models give reliable estimates of soil moisture dynamics its implementation at a large scale is restricted by input data availability the most crucial input data used in these models is the soil hydraulic parameters de maet et al 2015 soil hydraulic parameters exhibit significant spatial variability at large scales and can have a strong influence on flow in unsaturated soils flury et al 1994 fiori and russo 2007 chen et al 2012 however most of the existing studies either ignore the spatial variability in soil hydraulic parameters and consider the flow domain as homogeneous zhu and mohanty 2002 sadeghi et al 2014 or follow two basic strategies to account for spatial variability in soil hydraulic parameters a determine the soil hydraulic parameters at few locations in the study area and take the average dagan and bresler 1983 and b calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters of the water flow model using remote sensing surface soil moisture observations kundu et al 2017 li et al 2018 incorporation of spatial variability of soil hydraulic parameters in numerical models is a challenging task as a result it is necessary to compare simulations of soil moisture obtained from the 1 d richards equation based flow models that consider soil heterogeneity in a simplified manner with observed values in real cropped fields further there is a need to explore whether some common approaches used for modeling water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated soils can be applied in cropped fields to get a reliable prediction of soil moisture towards this aim in the present study three water flow models that easily incorporate soil heterogeneity were selected and the simulation results of these models were compared with experimental observations in a cropped field in the first model the 3 d soil field was approximated as a 1 d soil field and the 1 d richards equation with root water uptake term was used to simulate water movement to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties the average of soil hydraulic properties estimated at different locations near the soil surface layer was considered the one dimensional subsurface flow model provides faster run times and is generally versatile and less prone to numerical instability in simulating extreme conditions such as flow into very dry soil and has been popularly used for modeling water movement in agricultural fields bresler and dagan 1988 hills et al 1989 tocci et al 1997 downer and ogden 2004 shen and phanikumar 2010 bresler et al 1979 examined how well actual soil moisture and salt distribution data compared with modeling results in a complex but realistic cropped field when uncertainty in the hydraulic parameters due to spatial variability and the random variation of the soil measured values are considered they observed that proper choice of the mathematical model to give an adequate description of the physical crop soil field system at hand accuracy and stability of the numerical technique and accuracy and precision in estimating the soil and plant parameters and the ability to deal with their spatial variability are the main factors that control the performance of models wierenga et al 1991 compared soil moisture estimates of simple richards equation based one dimensional deterministic numerical models with field observation they found that the simple models satisfactorily simulated the overall movement of the wetting front however the models poorly estimated the point values of soil moisture due to the spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties the second flow model solves the 3 d richards equation the spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties is incorporated in a similar manner as the first model though this model is computationally intensive it allows lateral movement of water fluxes and may represent water movement in 3 d cropped fields more realistically compared to the 1 d model for example vrugt et al 2001 compared the performance of 1 d and 2 d numerical models with the results of the 3 d analysis they observed that the spatial variation in flux density below the rooting zone decreased when reducing multidimensional root water uptake to fewer dimensions and major differences occurred between one dimensional and multidimensional models when the spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties was considered this loss of information upturns the value of 3 d numerical models hopp et al 2015 compared soil moisture simulations of hydrus 3d that solves the 3d richards equation with two other quasi 3d flow approximation models based on the 1d vertical richards equation at hillslope scale considering domain slope hillslope size event size and initial soil moisture conditions they found that the performance of simpler models is conditional and in most cases they provide reasonable approximations of the 3 d model the third model is based on the streamtube approach the streamtube approach assumes the 3 d soil field as a collection of independent pipes with vertical flow only thiele 1994 ojha et al 2014 the soil hydraulic parameters are different for each streamtube vertical heterogeneity can also be considered the essence of this method lies in its fast and accurate numerical solutions in highly heterogeneous soils while retaining the details of the underlying physical models observed in one dimensional solutions thiele 1994 it is extensively used for flow and solute transport modeling in heterogeneous unsaturated soils bresler and dagan 1983 dagan and bresler 1983 moore et al 1990 kumar et al 2020 for upscaling of flow and transport properties zhu and mohanty 2002 2003 dagan and bresler 1983 bresler and dagan 1983 ojha et al 2014 ojha and govindaraju 2015 and for determining effective soil hydraulic properties ahuja et al 2010 zhu and mohanty 2002 2003 ojha et al 2017 more specifically the numerical models and experiments are selected and designed to address the following research questions a can the incorporation of average soil hydraulic properties measured near the soil surface layer give reliable estimates of root zone soil moisture b can streamtube based model or 3 d model provide better estimates than the 1 d flow model and c does the model performance vary with changes in land cover boundary condition and at different stages of crop growth it is to be noted that the first question inherently also implies that whether estimates of effective hydraulic properties obtained from calibration exercise of remote sensing based surface soil moisture observations when used as input in numerical models can lead to reliable estimates of root zone soil moisture the overall goal of this study is to examine the performance of the streamtube approach 1d and 3d numerical models to simulate soil moisture movement in wheat triticum aestivum l and rice oryza sativa l cropped fields more specifically it intends to probe the effects of changes in land cover boundary condition and crop growth on the performance of models 2 methodology the following approach will be followed to achieve the objective of this study 1 a finite difference model for solving 1 d and 3 d richards equation will be developed 2 a root water uptake model will be coupled to the models 3 the numerical models and the soil hydraulic parameters collected from the experimental agricultural plot will be integrated to create three different numerical schemes streamtube approach 1 d and 3 d models for heterogeneous soils 4 the flow field will be simulated using the three numerical schemes 5 the mean field scale soil moisture obtained from the three numerical schemes will be compared with the experimental observations and 6 the performance of the models will be examined under different crop cover boundary condition and crop growth stages the details of the developed numerical models and field experiments are provided in the subsections to follow 2 1 field experiments field experiments were conducted in an experimental agricultural plot 20 m 30 m located at the indian institute of technology kanpur 26 5168 n 80 2314 e altitude 126 m above mean sea level in the upper gangetic plains of uttar pradesh india from august 2018 march 2019 fig 1 the experiments were done under wheat and rice crop covers for two successive seasons the plot size is representative of the scattered farm holdings of low income farmers in the region the mean annual precipitation in kanpur is 801 5 mm the mean annual temperature is 32 2 c and the warmest and coolest months are may and january with a mean temperature of 41 3 and 8 5 c respectively panwar et al 2019 a weather station was installed in the plot temperature and relative humidity were recorded at two different heights i e 2 and 3 m above the ground surface global solar radiation wind speed and wind direction barometric pressure rainfall intensity soil heat flux and evaporation from isi class a evaporation pan were also measured the study area was divided into 24 subplots of 11 m2 area each soil moisture sensors were installed in the sub plots however continuous soil moisture data were collected at 18 of the sub plots due to the malfunctioning of sensors on the others as a result the analysis in this study is based on data collected for 18 subplots the plot is plain and there is no microtopography three soil samples collected at 10 15 cm depth and random locations in the field revealed that the soil in the field is silty loam with a mean 20 90 69 80 and 9 30 of sand silt and clay textures respectively the soil was plowed up to 15 cm depth for both crops during kharif season august 2018 november 2018 30 days old dupont pioneer rice hybrid phb 71 seedlings were transplanted in the 24 subplots with a spacing of 25 cm the rice paddy was always maintained at 5 cm depth ponded water k7903 halna wheat variety was grown with 18 cm row spacing for the period december 2018 march 2019 arrangements were made for the application of irrigation water irrigation water was applied in each subplot and measured with a water meter the wheat crop was irrigated five times with varying quantities during the crop growing season the irrigation water amount applied for the rice and wheat crop was decided based on the rice and wheat growing tradition of the area in consultation with the nearby farmers fertilizers were uniformly applied at each plot at appropriate time intervals and pesticides were used whenever required 2 1 1 soil hydraulic parameters undisturbed soil samples were collected at the center of subplots at 10 20 and 50 cm depths after rice was transplanted in the field to determine soil hydraulic parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured using a falling head permeability test gravimetric soil moisture content Î¸ was determined from the oven drying method and suction head Ïˆ was obtained using wp4c dew point potential meter manufactured by meter group inc pullman wa usa the Î¸ Ïˆ data were used as input in the van genuchten model and saturated volumetric soil moisture content Î¸ s and the model parameters Î± and n were obtained for all the soil samples by swrc fit seki 2007 the readers are referred to faisal 2019 for a detailed explanation about soil hydraulic data collection on the site fig 2 shows the subplot wise distribution of soil hydraulic parameters at three depths the spatial variability in soil hydraulic parameters is evident from the figure it is to be noted that soil hydraulic parameters in agricultural fields can exhibit spatial and temporal variability therefore the soil hydraulic properties were again measured at 10 cm depth at few locations after harvesting the wheat however not much difference was observed in the values 2 1 2 soil moisture observations volumetric soil moisture content was measured using capacitance based sm100 and smec300 soil moisture sensors manufactured by spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa adla et al 2020 investigated the accuracy and precision performance of smec300 and sm100 soil moisture sensors in laboratory conditions it was found that these low cost capacitive sensors with soil specific calibration were more accurate than manufacturer specifications less than 2 volumetric soil moisture content on average and can match the performance of the delta t thetaprobe ml3 which was considered as the standard sensor in their study calibrated sensors were installed at 10 25 50 and 80 cm depths and watchdog 1000 series micro station manufactured by spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa was used to record the data at a 15 minute time interval 2 1 3 evaporation and transpiration computation climate data required for computing evapotranspiration et were collected from the automatic weather station aws installed at the plot the 15 minute interval weather data was used to obtain daily et for both crops using the fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 method the partition equation zhang et al 2004 shankar et al 2012 was used to split et into evaporation and transpiration components eqs 1 and 2 leaf area index lai of the crops which is used for et partitioning were collected on the same plot using lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer manufactured by li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska usa the frequency with which lai data was collected varied with crop growth stage it was weekly at the initial and late season stages and it was twice per week at crop development and maturity stages the daily values were computed by linear interpolation and are shown in fig 3 a and b 1 e j e t c j exp Î´ la i j 2 t j e t c j e j where e t c j e j and t j are crop evapotranspiration soil evaporation and plant transpiration on the j th day respectively Î´ is a dimensionless canopy extinction

and rainfall was measured by tipping bucket rain gauge manufactured by virtual hydromet haridwar india installed in the field the temporal distribution of evaporation transpiration irrigation and rainfall is shown in fig 4 2 2 numerical setup the richards equation was used to describe the water movement in the unsaturated zone it is a combination of the darcy buckingham flow equation and the mass conservation equation and is a highly nonlinear partial differential equation that requires a numerical solution richards 1931 hopp et al 2015 the 3 d mixed form of the richards equation for a homogeneous and anisotropic porous media is 3 Î¸ Ïˆ t x k x Ïˆ Ïˆ x y k y Ïˆ Ïˆ y z k z Ïˆ Ïˆ z 1 s where Î¸ Ïˆ is the moisture content l 3 l 3 k x Ïˆ k y Ïˆ and k z Ïˆ are unsaturated hydraulic conductivities l t 1 in the x y and z directions respectively Ïˆ is the soil water suction head l and s is the root water uptake term l 3 l 3 t 1 a root water uptake model was coupled to the richards equation to simulate soil moisture dynamics in cropped agricultural fields in this study the ojha and rai 1996 nonlinear root water uptake model was employed as this model has been parameterized for the crops in the indo gangetic plain the root water uptake term is expressed as 4 s Ïˆ z t j z r max Ï‡ 1 Ïˆ Ïˆ w Ïˆ fc Ïˆ w 1 z z r max Ï‡ f o r Ïˆ Ïˆ amc where t j is the potential extraction rate on the j th day z is the depth from the soil surface z rj is root depth on the j th day Ï‡ is the nonlinear parameter which is 3 4 and 1 62 for rice and wheat crops respectively shankar et al 2012 devatha et al 2016 z rmax is maximum rooting depth Ïˆ w is suction head at wilting point Ïˆ fc is suction head at field capacity and Ïˆ amc is suction head at available moisture content we measured the rooting depth under both crop covers on the same experimental plot since it is assumed that root depth increases steadily during the growing season and thereafter remains constant prasad 1988 the daily root depths for wheat crop cover were obtained by simple linear interpolation between the seedling emergence and the maximum root depth and for the rice crop it was measured at different days during the growing stage and the values between those days were computed by linear interpolation fig 3c and d detailed information about the experiments is available in yetbarek and ojha 2020 2 2 1 soil hydraulic property models the van genuchten 1980 model was used to describe the unsaturated soil properties in eq 1 at a local scale the characteristic equations used to relate soil moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with pressure head are given below 5 Î¸ Ïˆ Î¸ r Î¸ s Î¸ r 1 Î± Ïˆ n m 6 k Ïˆ k s 1 Î± Ïˆ n 1 1 Î± Ïˆ n m 1 Î± Ïˆ n m 2 2 where Î¸ s and Î¸ r are the saturated and residual volumetric soil moisture content respectively k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity Î± and n are an empirical pore size distribution and shape defining parameters and m 1 1 n the mixed forms of 1 d and 3 d richards equations were solved using dogan s 1999 approach a block centered finite differences method was used and a backward euler approximation coupled with the modified picard iteration scheme and taylor series expansion was used to discretize the time derivative of the moisture content the mean conductance between adjacent cells was calculated by arithmetic averaging the simulations were run for 100 days which is fixed considering the number of days taken for cultivating both wheat and rice crops to increase the time efficiency the time stepping was dynamically controlled based on the effort required to converge the mean time step was 0 001 day and the minimum and maximum time steps were 0 0001 and 1 day respectively increasing and decreasing factors that are 40 and 10 respectively were used to get the size of the next time step based on the number of iteration it took in the current time step the numerical scheme is fully mass conserved and numerically stable we validated the developed numerical schemes against standard example problems given in dogan 1999 examples 1 and 5 the mass balance error observed in both standard problems is less than 0 15 2 2 2 models for soil moisture simulation in this study we used three different numerical models to describe soil moisture dynamics in cropped agricultural fields the streamtube approach num 1dst 1 d model num 1d and 3 d model num 3d the models vary in terms of data intake model complexity and computational cost num 1dst is a data intensive model num 1d is a simple and efficient model and num 3d is complex and computationally intensive but can be assumed to be a more realistic model as it considers lateral flow it is expected that a comparison between num 1dst and num 1d models will help us examine the effect of heterogeneous parameterization further comparisons between num 1d and num 3d models will help us understand the effects of model complexity these comparisons will lead to the identification of conditions under which these models can be effectively used fig 5 shows the general configuration of the three models along with the details of the soil hydraulic parameters k s Î± Î¸ s and n used for running the simulation since the sensitivity of soil moisture dynamics to the changes in residual soil moisture content Î¸ r is small lai and ren 2016 a constant value of 0 01 cm3 cm 3 was assumed for all numerical schemes though soil hydraulic parameters were measured at 10 20 and 50 cm depths only the data collected at 10 cm depth was considered for the numerical analysis it is mainly related to the practical applicability of surface soil hydraulic properties for agricultural water management most of the crop yield related studies rely on the calibration of soil moisture content obtained from remote sensing observations as remote sensing techniques can successfully measure near surface moisture content only the effective soil hydraulic properties obtained from these studies is a representation of near surface depths qiu et al 2016 de lannoy et al 2015 moreover it is easy and convenient to measure soil hydraulic properties near the surface rainfall and evapotranspiration were assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the plot in all schemes as the plot size is small and weather data were collected at a point a num 1dst this scheme was implemented to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the streamtube approach considering the variability in soil hydraulic parameters and irrigation water application at each subplot the one dimensional richards equation coupled with the root water uptake model was implemented the scheme only considers horizontal variability in soil hydraulic parameters no vertical variation in soil hydraulic parameters was considered it was also assumed that there was no lateral flow the flow domain has a 2 m depth with a grid size of 0 01 m b num 1d the governing equation describing vertical soil water movement in variably saturated soils in this model is the one dimensional richards equation the mean values of soil hydraulic parameters and irrigation water applications from 18 subplots were used as an input this scheme was implemented to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths similar to num 1dst it has a 2 m depth flow domain with a 0 01 m grid size c num 3d in this scheme the 3 d richards equation was solved the 3 d flow field was implemented to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the mean values of soil hydraulic parameters and irrigation water applications from 18 subplots it has a dimension of 20 20 2 m3 and a grid size of 0 2 0 2 and 0 01 m along the x y and z directions respectively 2 2 3 initial and boundary conditions data used for the initial and boundary conditions were obtained from the same agricultural plot mentioned above model calibration was performed to get the initial conditions in the field we measured moisture content at four depths and the values at intermediate depths were not available therefore it is necessary to fix a spin up time to identify the time to reach equilibrium and to use the obtained model output as an initial condition seck et al 2015 hu et al 2019 bai et al 2020 a maximum of 10 days was required to obtain soil moisture at 10 cm depth with a relative error of less than 1 to minimize the effect of initial conditions simulation results of the first 10 days were removed for data analysis in this study evaporation and irrigation applications were considered as upper boundary conditions and it switches between specified flux and specified head boundary conditions in response to changes in the head at the boundary cell 7 k Ïˆ Ïˆ z 1 q t a t z 0 t 0 the specified head boundary condition corresponds to the maximum possible depth h p 8 Ïˆ z t h p a t z 0 t t p where q is flux due to the addition and loss of water at the soil surface and t p is the time of saturation or ponding h p is 0 075 m and 0 05 m for wheat and rice crop covers respectively it is assumed that any water beyond the maximum ponding depth will be a runoff and will not be considered in the simulation a free gravity drainage boundary condition was assumed at the bottom of the flow domains and no flow conditions were assumed at the vertical planes for the 3 d field 9 Ïˆ z 0 a t z z max t 0 where z max is the bottom of the flow domain and it is 2 m in this study 2 3 analyzing performance of models the coefficient of determination r2 indicates the proportion of variance in the observed soil moisture content that can be statistically explained by the models though it is a handy index using r2 as a sole parameter is insufficient to make meaningful distinctions between models barrett 1974 willmott 1981 therefore other residual error based goodness of fit measures were used to examine the performance of the proposed models along with r2 relative error re root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were selected for the analysis rmse is easy to interpret since it has similar units with observed and simulated values and it tells the actual size of the error produced by the model willmott 1981 nrmse provides a percentage measure of the relative difference between observed and simulated datasets r2 values close to 1 and the rmse and nrmse values close to 0 are expected from the best performing model re r2 rmse and nrmse can be computed as follows 10 re Î¸ m Î¸ o Î¸ o 100 11 r 2 i 1 n Î¸ o i Î¸ o Î¸ m i Î¸ m i 1 n Î¸ o i Î¸ o 2 i 1 n Î¸ m i Î¸

simulated values and n is the number of data points considered for the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of simulated and observed soil moisture simulated soil moisture content obtained from num 1dst num 1d num 3d models were compared with observed mean soil moisture values figs 6 and 7 show the temporal variation of measured and simulated soil moisture content under wheat and rice crops respectively it can be observed that the performance of models varies with boundary conditions land cover depth and crop growth stage under wheat crop cover soil moisture was highly overestimated at surface depth after crop maturity by all the models though the magnitude may vary this may be due to the presence of preferential flows or cracks present at the soil surface in the experimental plot created due to the high dryness in the march and april months the performance of all models was good at 25 cm depth than the surface depth especially after crop maturity however all models underestimated moisture content at 50 and 80 cm depths it is because the soil hydraulic parameters used for simulations were collected at 10 cm depth due to the ponded water the general trend of the observed soil moisture was smooth all models exhibited sensitivity to the changes in boundary conditions at the surface depth and it was negligible at subsurface depths the soil moisture content was underestimated by all the models at 50 and 80 cm depths the difference between model performances was noticeable in rice in contrast to what was observed under wheat crop cover and num 1d performs better than the others figs 7 and 8 generally the dampening effect of depth is visible in both observed and simulated soil moisture contents and the sensitivity for changes in boundary conditions decreases with depth the soil moisture distribution difference between wheat and rice crop covers was mainly controlled by the way of cultivation i e alternate wetting and drying in wheat and paddy in rice more than their rooting system difference and their response to the atmospheric demand as shown in yetbarek et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 the relative error was more prominent at the surface depths and it was relatively small and negative underestimation at deeper depths under both crop covers for example despite slight variation between models there was around 20 overestimation and 10 underestimation at 10 and 80 cm depths respectively during the fourth irrigation fig 8a and g under wheat crop cover the overestimations were higher during irrigation and the following days and underestimations were exhibited in drying soils at the surface depth it is related to the fast response of models for boundary condition changes and the attenuating nature of the field similar trends were perceived under rice crop cover overestimations were observed during high rainfall and it was noticeable at the surface depth and the sensitivity to soil surface boundary condition decreases with depth at deeper depths the underestimation is mainly due to the distinct soil hydraulic properties difference between the near surface and subsurface depths the difference is likely related to the effect of tillage activities at near surface depths xu and mermoud 2001 besides hardpan formation which is a common event below tillage depth in rice fields may create such differences in soil hydraulic properties between near surface and subsurface depths all models perfectly simulated the observed soil moisture till the first irrigation under wheat crop cover at near surface depths further there was variation in response to water application between the models both num 1d and num 3d models showed higher soil moisture on the day of irrigation however in num 1dst a delayed response to irrigation was observed near the soil surface num 1d and num 3d models overestimated soil moisture on the irrigation days and exhibited a fast depletion rate in the days to follow however in the experimental field depletion of soil moisture was at a lower rate leading to underestimation of soil moisture by the numerical models due to higher atmospheric demand and well established rooting system the observed moisture content shows a significant reduction after the crop attained maximum rooting depth however this was not the case for the numerical models while performing field experiments the maximum effect of spatial variability in hydraulic properties was observed under rice crop cover attempts were made to maintain a ponded water depth of 5 cm in all sub plots however a significant variation in the infiltration rate was observed between the sub plots the water level at some subplots exceeded beyond the limited depth during high rainfall and in some subplots the infiltrate rate was so high that they required frequent irrigation to maintain the ponded depth of 5 cm it is to be noted that the observed moisture content was almost seamless to this variability as the mean of all 18 subplots was considered for the analysis as shown in fig 7 3 2 comparison of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for the numerical models fig 9 shows the simulated temporal variation of the mean of lognormally distributed unsaturated hydraulic conductivity by different numerical models under wheat and rice crop covers hydraulic conductivity is significantly influenced by soil heterogeneity garcÃ­a gutiÃ©rrez et al 2018 while we did not have observed data for comparison in this case a comparison amongst the models was done to examine in what way the heterogeneity considered in the models affects the hydraulic conductivity distribution the mean of log normally distributed unsaturated hydraulic conductivity exhibited a general decreasing trend with time till crop maturity under wheat crop due to the growing atmospheric demand though sudden rise and drops can be observed due to irrigation once the maximum root zone depth was achieved the hydraulic conductivity becomes constant and it is a reflection of the soil moisture distribution there is a visible variation in conductivity between models in the first couple of weeks num 1dst exhibited higher conductivity except for a couple of days during and after irrigation in contrast num 3d has lower conductivity when soil moisture is low and it suddenly spikes during irrigation this reveals its higher sensitivity to changes in the upper boundary condition for example a 4 83 change in soil moisture content at the surface depth resulted in a 41 09 higher conductivity during the first irrigation num 1d always lies above num 3d when the moisture content is low and below num 3d during irrigation periods all models showed similar trends at the subsurface depths however the conductivity is significantly lower than the surface depth for example the peak unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for num 3d at the surface depth after the first irrigation was 3 56 times higher than what was observed at 80 cm depth i e the soil water moves about 3 56 times faster at 10 cm than at 80 cm depth yetbarek et al 2020 also numerically showed that conductivity at the surface depth was much higher than at 80 cm depth and it indicates that hydraulic conductivity significantly decreases with increasing soil depth unsaturated hydraulic conductivity under rice crop cover was higher than that observed under wheat crop cover at all the depths and it is related to the ponded water in the former num 3d exhibited higher conductivity num 1d is not much sensitive to water applications compared to num 1dst and num 3d this is likely because num 1dst considers spatial variability of soil properties and irrigation application at each subplot and num 3d considers lateral water movement which may play a significant role in both soil moisture and conductivity distribution num 1dst always exhibited lower values and num 3d showed higher values at subsurface depths 3 3 effect of boundary condition and crop growth stage on model performance to examine how the performances of the models were affected by changes in atmospheric boundary conditions three distinct periods with 11 successive days each under irrigation evaporation and rainfall boundary conditions were selected the model performance under different boundary conditions was analyzed only for wheat crop cover as under rice crop cover it was impossible to get suitable distinct periods for each boundary condition as the rice crop always had ponded water similarly four periods with similar duration at initial crop development mid season and late season stages were selected under both wheat and rice crop covers to investigate the effect of crop growth stages on the model performance 3 3 1 effect of boundary condition the scatterplot of observed and simulated soil moisture content by different models under different boundary conditions is shown in fig 10 the period selected to examine the effects of irrigation boundary conditions comprises the first irrigation the distribution of points around the 1 1 line considerably varies with depth and the difference was small between models as shown in fig 10a d and g all the models overestimated lower moisture and underestimated higher soil moisture values intermediate moisture values were better estimated at near surface depths and all values were underestimated at deeper depths although it is difficult to set a strictly quantified and objective description to examine the model accuracy zhang et al 2007 used the relative error between observed and simulated values at measured points as a major criterion they suggest that the model performance is good if the relative error percentage is less than 10 acceptable if it is 10 20 and poor if it is less than 50 it is observed that the performance of all models was good at 10 and 25 cm depths and they were better at 25 cm depth than at 10 cm it may be due to the high fluctuation at the surface depth and relatively attenuated moisture content at 25 cm depth the predicting capacity of models reduced to an acceptable category at 50 and 80 cm depths it is because the soil hydraulic parameters used were collected at 10 cm depth the rmse for the simulated and observed soil moisture content provides a quantitative measure of the goodness of the fit between the measured and the simulated values jamieson et al 1991 mentioned that a simulation is considered excellent when the nrmse is less than 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 fair if it is between 20 and 30 and poor if it is greater than 30 as shown in table 1 the performance of num 1dst was better than the other models under irrigation boundary conditions the rmse values were 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and the nrmse values were 4 14 6 30 and 6 68 in num 1dst num 1d and num 3d respectively showing an excellent simulation at the surface depth despite the relative error rmse and nrmse values show the good performance of models their r2 is very low at the surface depth for example num 1dst num 1d and num 3d models can explain only 14 12 1 47 and 0 04 of the variability in the observed soil moisture respectively r2 values are very low because the variance within the simulated values is higher than the variance between the simulated and observed values achen 1977 r2 increases with depth and it is related to the sensitivity of models for water application and the dampening of noise with depth similar trends were observed under rainfall boundary conditions as well the changes observed here correspond to the difference in the amount of water applied between the two low and intermediate values were overestimated and higher values were better estimated in the latter at the surface depth since the noise within the simulated values is reduced in the rainfall boundary condition the r2 values obtained were much higher and num 1dst can explain up to 68 01 and 84 27 of the variability in the measured moisture content at the surface and 25 cm depths respectively as shown in fig 10c f and i the variation between values was small at 25 cm depth as a result the relative errors were smaller at 25 cm than at 10 cm in all models the performance of models at deeper depths was poor because the parameters used for simulation are collected at 10 cm depth the models sensitivity to higher irrigation application becomes apparent when examining the effect of evaporation boundary conditions fig 10b e and h num 1dst num 1d and num 3d simulated values can explain 93 43 72 91 and 60 97 of the variability in the observed moisture content at the surface depth soil wetness influences model performance for example lower values were under predicted intermediate values were better predicted and higher values were over predicted at the surface depth all models performed relatively well especially at 10 and 25 cm depths the rmse values range from 0 01 to 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for irrigation and rainfall boundary conditions and less than 0 01 cm3 cm 3 for evaporation boundary conditions at the surface depth these values are small and within the recommended limit of 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for effective irrigation management based on soil moisture sensing iaea 2008 however num 1dst certainly has a better prediction capability when compared to the other two models 3 3 2 effect of vegetation growth suitable periods were selected at each growth stage when the effect of other factors such as irrigation and high rainfall was not significant to specifically investigate the influence of crop growth on the model performance the crop season was divided into four growth stages i initial ii development iii mid season and iv late season stages the duration considered for analysis in the initial stage under wheat crop cover ranges between the third and the fourth weeks after sowing the effect of transpiration was negligible due to limited rooting depth and the role of evaporation is low due to the winter season for the wheat crop as shown in fig 11 a and table 2 all models were able to simulate observed soil moisture at the surface depth r2 was high for all models which ranges between 0 83 and 0 86 and the maximum and average deviations between observed and simulated values were only 0 67 and 0 44 respectively the explaining power of the models decreases with depths however num 1dst num 1d and num 3d models can explain 71 81 67 10 and 60 97 of the variability in observed soil moisture at 80 cm depth it is due to the reduced variability within the simulated values as compared to the upper depths and its lower variability relative to the observed values besides very low rmse values i e less than 0 01 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse values of 0 77 1 13 and 2 04 for num 1dst num 1d and num 3d respectively show an excellent prediction performance of models at the surface depth table 2 under rice crop cover see fig 11e the range of the observed values was very small at the surface depth due to ponding but the variability of the simulated values was high as a result r2 values of all models were small num 1dst underestimated most of the values num 1d predicted much better and num 3d overestimated it may be related to consideration of water application variability at each subplot in num 1dst and possible lateral movement in num 3d simulation as shown in table 3 the rmse values were 0 01 0 01 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse values were 5 04 2 00 and 8 54 in num 1dst num 1d and num 3d respectively shows the models very good performance at the surface depth in the development stage transpiration starts to overrule evaporation and the leaf area index increases significantly under both crop covers as shown in fig 11 under wheat crop cover lower moisture values are better estimated and the performance of models decreases with increasing soil wetness similar to the initial stage num 1dst was a better predictor but the difference between model simulations was small at the surface depth fig 11b the performance of all models was low at 25 cm conversely lower values were overestimated and higher values were better estimated by all models under rice crop cover num 1d overestimated lower values and better estimated higher moisture content and the estimated values variability range was smaller than other models num 1dst and num 3d exhibited comparable performances at the mid season stage the root system was fully developed atmospheric demand was high and the leaf area index was at its peak all models overestimated lower soil moisture values and better estimated higher values under wheat crop cover the scatterplot shows high variability between values as the intermediate values are distinctly overestimated fig 11c as a result the r2 of models was lower than in other growth stages although all models showed similar distribution along the 1 1 line the num 3d performance is lower which explains 42 05 of the variability in the observed soil moisture it may be due to its sensitivity to water applications the nrmse values observed at this stage which ranges from 5 33 to 7 12 for all models revealed that the actual deviation between observed and simulated values is small and the models are performing well all values are overestimated under rice crop cover unlike the previous stages the observed values variability range is high and it increases with time num 1d and num 3d were the good and poor performers respectively the rmse values range from 0 05 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 in all models at the surface depth which is much higher than that observed in the previous growth stages the period selected from the late season stage covers 84 94 days after sowing under wheat crop cover all models performed better at higher values and overestimation increases with decreasing soil wetness at the late season stage no significant variation was observed between the performances of the models the rmse values are between 0 01 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for all models and are relatively high as compared to the preceding growth stages however nrmse values are around 5 50 in all models the soil moisture values are overestimated by all models under rice crop cover and num 1dst and num 3d were the best and the poor performers respectively all models were able to satisfactorily simulate observed soil moisture at the surface depth under wheat crop and their performance decreases with depth at all growth stages num 1dst has a better prediction capability under rice crop cover the range of the observed values was very small at the surface depth due to ponding which resulted in higher rmse values especially in mid and late season stages num 1d outperformed other models in the first three stages and num 1dst excels over others in the last stage 4 conclusions three numerical models num 1dst num 1d and num 3d were developed and compared with soil moisture measurements in a wheat and rice cropped agricultural field with soil heterogeneity the effects of changes in land cover boundary condition and crop growth stage on the performance of models were examined the soil moisture simulated using the numerical models was much reliable at near surface depths when compared to deeper depths indicating the strong influence soil hydraulic properties can have on model simulation the dampening effect of depth was visible in both observed and simulated soil moisture content and the sensitivity for changes in boundary conditions decreases with depth all the models could predict the temporal and spatial distribution of water reasonably well except on heavy rainfall or irrigation days num 1dst provided better performance under all boundary conditions and growth stages under wheat crop cover as it considers the soil hydraulic properties at each subplot under rice crop cover the range of the observed values was very small at the surface depth due to ponding which resulted in higher rmse values especially in mid and late season stages num 1d outperformed other models in the first three stages and num 1dst excels over others in the last stage suggesting that soil wetness influences model performance based on comparisons of the model deviations from the measured data and the resultant statistics the performance of the three numerical models is satisfactory and all of them can be used for irrigation water management in agricultural fields it is noteworthy that the 3 d richards equation based model even though accounts for the lateral flow of water does not improve the soil moisture simulation results when compared to the 1 d richards equation based model this indicates that increasing model complexity does not lead to an improvement in results and the accurate representation of soil hydraulic properties plays a more important role further the streamtube based model apart from being simple definitely has more potential than simple 1 d numerical models for modeling water movement in crops that undergo alternate wetting and drying cycles future studies should focus on coupling streamtube based water flow models with crop growth models in such crops credit authorship contribution statement ephrem yetbarek conceptualization data curation software

4444,spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties poses severe challenges to the modeling of soil moisture dynamics in agricultural fields for simplicity 1 d water flow models that ignore soil heterogeneity are commonly used to simulate water movement in agricultural fields as soil hydraulic properties are one of the most crucial input data it is particularly desirable to investigate how the simulations of these water flow models compare with experimental observations this study aims to examine the performances of streamtube 1 d and 3 d richards equation based water flow models with experimental observations experiments were conducted at an agricultural plot of 20 m 30 m located in iit kanpur india for 1 year under wheat triticum aestivum l and rice oryza sativa l crop covers the site was heavily instrumented to monitor soil moisture variation weather conditions root depth and lai further 54 undisturbed soil samples were analyzed to determine the heterogeneity in soil hydraulic parameters the results indicate that the performance of the models varies with land cover atmospheric boundary condition and crop growth stages besides the difference between model estimates varies with soil moisture wetness and a maximum relative error of 13 was observed under wetting conditions the streamtube model showed the best performance under wheat crop cover for all boundary conditions and growth stages as it considers spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties and irrigation application at each subplot the numerical 1d model was the best predictor under rice crop cover further the results suggest that an increase in model complexity does not lead to an improvement in water simulation and accurate representation of soil hydraulic properties plays a more important role keywords soil moisture numerical simulation model comparison land cover boundary condition 1 introduction reliable crop growth monitoring and yield are critical for the sustainable development of agriculture in the past few decades for large scale crop growth monitoring and yield prediction researchers have mostly relied on agro meteorological model forecasting and the development of simplified relationships between field measurements and remote sensing data based vegetation indexes kang et al 2016 xue and su 2017 van der velde and nissini 2019 however with advances in remote sensing data and computational power now more and more studies are focusing on integrated analysis of weather data remote sensing observations and crop growth model results li et al 2014 the commonly used crop growth models provide detailed estimates of crop states including phenological status leaf area index lai and yield for specific crop types eitzinger et al 2004 ritchie 1998 nevertheless they overly simplify the simulation of water movement in the vadose zone and it is mainly determined using a tipping bucket model ritchie 1998 shelia et al 2018 chen et al 2019 besides root length density is assumed to be linearly distributed and uniform root water uptake distributions are considered eitzinger et al 2004 chen et al 2019 in real field conditions the availablesoil moistureis the main driver for variability in crop yield anwar et al 2003 patil and sheelavantar 2004 and accurate estimates of soil moisture are essential for understanding and predicting crop status and yield to overcome the limitations of existing crop growth models many studies have started focusing on coupling crop growth models with more refined 1 d water flow models mccown et al 1996a 1996b van dam 2000 liang et al 2016 in these water flow models the flow field is derived from the numerical solution of the richards equation while the 1 d water flow models give reliable estimates of soil moisture dynamics its implementation at a large scale is restricted by input data availability the most crucial input data used in these models is the soil hydraulic parameters de maet et al 2015 soil hydraulic parameters exhibit significant spatial variability at large scales and can have a strong influence on flow in unsaturated soils flury et al 1994 fiori and russo 2007 chen et al 2012 however most of the existing studies either ignore the spatial variability in soil hydraulic parameters and consider the flow domain as homogeneous zhu and mohanty 2002 sadeghi et al 2014 or follow two basic strategies to account for spatial variability in soil hydraulic parameters a determine the soil hydraulic parameters at few locations in the study area and take the average dagan and bresler 1983 and b calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters of the water flow model using remote sensing surface soil moisture observations kundu et al 2017 li et al 2018 incorporation of spatial variability of soil hydraulic parameters in numerical models is a challenging task as a result it is necessary to compare simulations of soil moisture obtained from the 1 d richards equation based flow models that consider soil heterogeneity in a simplified manner with observed values in real cropped fields further there is a need to explore whether some common approaches used for modeling water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated soils can be applied in cropped fields to get a reliable prediction of soil moisture towards this aim in the present study three water flow models that easily incorporate soil heterogeneity were selected and the simulation results of these models were compared with experimental observations in a cropped field in the first model the 3 d soil field was approximated as a 1 d soil field and the 1 d richards equation with root water uptake term was used to simulate water movement to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties the average of soil hydraulic properties estimated at different locations near the soil surface layer was considered the one dimensional subsurface flow model provides faster run times and is generally versatile and less prone to numerical instability in simulating extreme conditions such as flow into very dry soil and has been popularly used for modeling water movement in agricultural fields bresler and dagan 1988 hills et al 1989 tocci et al 1997 downer and ogden 2004 shen and phanikumar 2010 bresler et al 1979 examined how well actual soil moisture and salt distribution data compared with modeling results in a complex but realistic cropped field when uncertainty in the hydraulic parameters due to spatial variability and the random variation of the soil measured values are considered they observed that proper choice of the mathematical model to give an adequate description of the physical crop soil field system at hand accuracy and stability of the numerical technique and accuracy and precision in estimating the soil and plant parameters and the ability to deal with their spatial variability are the main factors that control the performance of models wierenga et al 1991 compared soil moisture estimates of simple richards equation based one dimensional deterministic numerical models with field observation they found that the simple models satisfactorily simulated the overall movement of the wetting front however the models poorly estimated the point values of soil moisture due to the spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties the second flow model solves the 3 d richards equation the spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties is incorporated in a similar manner as the first model though this model is computationally intensive it allows lateral movement of water fluxes and may represent water movement in 3 d cropped fields more realistically compared to the 1 d model for example vrugt et al 2001 compared the performance of 1 d and 2 d numerical models with the results of the 3 d analysis they observed that the spatial variation in flux density below the rooting zone decreased when reducing multidimensional root water uptake to fewer dimensions and major differences occurred between one dimensional and multidimensional models when the spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties was considered this loss of information upturns the value of 3 d numerical models hopp et al 2015 compared soil moisture simulations of hydrus 3d that solves the 3d richards equation with two other quasi 3d flow approximation models based on the 1d vertical richards equation at hillslope scale considering domain slope hillslope size event size and initial soil moisture conditions they found that the performance of simpler models is conditional and in most cases they provide reasonable approximations of the 3 d model the third model is based on the streamtube approach the streamtube approach assumes the 3 d soil field as a collection of independent pipes with vertical flow only thiele 1994 ojha et al 2014 the soil hydraulic parameters are different for each streamtube vertical heterogeneity can also be considered the essence of this method lies in its fast and accurate numerical solutions in highly heterogeneous soils while retaining the details of the underlying physical models observed in one dimensional solutions thiele 1994 it is extensively used for flow and solute transport modeling in heterogeneous unsaturated soils bresler and dagan 1983 dagan and bresler 1983 moore et al 1990 kumar et al 2020 for upscaling of flow and transport properties zhu and mohanty 2002 2003 dagan and bresler 1983 bresler and dagan 1983 ojha et al 2014 ojha and govindaraju 2015 and for determining effective soil hydraulic properties ahuja et al 2010 zhu and mohanty 2002 2003 ojha et al 2017 more specifically the numerical models and experiments are selected and designed to address the following research questions a can the incorporation of average soil hydraulic properties measured near the soil surface layer give reliable estimates of root zone soil moisture b can streamtube based model or 3 d model provide better estimates than the 1 d flow model and c does the model performance vary with changes in land cover boundary condition and at different stages of crop growth it is to be noted that the first question inherently also implies that whether estimates of effective hydraulic properties obtained from calibration exercise of remote sensing based surface soil moisture observations when used as input in numerical models can lead to reliable estimates of root zone soil moisture the overall goal of this study is to examine the performance of the streamtube approach 1d and 3d numerical models to simulate soil moisture movement in wheat triticum aestivum l and rice oryza sativa l cropped fields more specifically it intends to probe the effects of changes in land cover boundary condition and crop growth on the

an experimental agricultural plot 20 m 30 m located at the indian institute of technology kanpur 26 5168 n 80 2314 e altitude 126 m above mean sea level in the upper gangetic plains of uttar pradesh india from august 2018 march 2019 fig 1 the experiments were done under wheat and rice crop covers for two successive seasons the plot size is representative of the scattered farm holdings of low income farmers in the region the mean annual precipitation in kanpur is 801 5 mm the mean annual temperature is 32 2 c and the warmest and coolest months are may and january with a mean temperature of 41 3 and 8 5 c respectively panwar et al 2019 a weather station was installed in the plot temperature and relative humidity were recorded at two different heights i e 2 and 3 m above the ground surface global solar radiation wind speed and wind direction barometric pressure rainfall intensity soil heat flux and evaporation from isi class a evaporation pan were also measured the study area was divided into 24 subplots of 11 m2 area each soil moisture sensors were installed in the sub plots however continuous soil moisture data were collected at 18 of the sub plots due to the malfunctioning of sensors on the others as a result the analysis in this study is based on data collected for 18 subplots the plot is plain and there is no microtopography three soil samples collected at 10 15 cm depth and random locations in the field revealed that the soil in the field is silty loam with a mean 20 90 69 80 and 9 30 of sand silt and clay textures respectively the soil was plowed up to 15 cm depth for both crops during kharif season august 2018 november 2018 30 days old dupont pioneer rice hybrid phb 71 seedlings were transplanted in the 24 subplots with a spacing of 25 cm the rice paddy was always maintained at 5 cm depth ponded water k7903 halna wheat variety was grown with 18 cm row spacing for the period december 2018 march 2019 arrangements were made for the application of irrigation water irrigation water was applied in each subplot and measured with a water meter the wheat crop was irrigated five times with varying quantities during the crop growing season the irrigation water amount applied for the rice and wheat crop was decided based on the rice and wheat growing tradition of the area in consultation with the nearby farmers fertilizers were uniformly applied at each plot at appropriate time intervals and pesticides were used whenever required 2 1 1 soil hydraulic parameters undisturbed soil samples were collected at the center of subplots at 10 20 and 50 cm depths after rice was transplanted in the field to determine soil hydraulic parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured using a falling head permeability test gravimetric soil moisture content Î¸ was determined from the oven drying method and suction head Ïˆ was obtained using wp4c dew point potential meter manufactured by meter group inc pullman wa usa the Î¸ Ïˆ data were used as input in the van genuchten model and saturated volumetric soil moisture content Î¸ s and the model parameters Î± and n were obtained for all the soil samples by swrc fit seki 2007 the readers are referred to faisal 2019 for a detailed explanation about soil hydraulic data collection on the site fig 2 shows the subplot wise distribution of soil hydraulic parameters at three depths the spatial variability in soil hydraulic parameters is evident from the figure it is to be noted that soil hydraulic parameters in agricultural fields can exhibit spatial and temporal variability therefore the soil hydraulic properties were again measured at 10 cm depth at few locations after harvesting the wheat however not much difference was observed in the values 2 1 2 soil moisture observations volumetric soil moisture content was measured using capacitance based sm100 and smec300 soil moisture sensors manufactured by spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa adla et al 2020 investigated the accuracy and precision performance of smec300 and sm100 soil moisture sensors in laboratory conditions it was found that these low cost capacitive sensors with soil specific calibration were more accurate than manufacturer specifications less than 2 volumetric soil moisture content on average and can match the performance of the delta t thetaprobe ml3 which was considered as the standard sensor in their study calibrated sensors were installed at 10 25 50 and 80 cm depths and watchdog 1000 series micro station manufactured by spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa was used to record the data at a 15 minute time interval 2 1 3 evaporation and transpiration computation climate data required for computing evapotranspiration et were collected from the automatic weather station aws installed at the plot the 15 minute interval weather data was used to obtain daily et for both crops using the fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 method the partition equation zhang et al 2004 shankar et al 2012 was used to split et into evaporation and transpiration components eqs 1 and 2 leaf area index lai of the crops which is used for et partitioning were collected on the same plot using lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer manufactured by li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska usa the frequency with which lai data was collected varied with crop growth stage it was weekly at the initial and late season stages and it was twice per week at crop development and maturity stages the daily values were computed by linear interpolation and are shown in fig 3 a and b 1 e j e t

and rainfall was measured by tipping bucket rain gauge manufactured by virtual hydromet haridwar india installed in the field the temporal distribution of evaporation transpiration irrigation and rainfall is shown in fig 4 2 2 numerical setup the richards equation was used to describe the water movement in the unsaturated zone it is a combination of the darcy buckingham flow equation and the mass conservation equation and is a highly nonlinear partial differential equation that requires a numerical solution richards 1931 hopp et al 2015 the 3 d mixed form of the richards equation for a homogeneous and anisotropic porous media is 3 Î¸ Ïˆ t x k x Ïˆ Ïˆ x y k y Ïˆ Ïˆ y z k z Ïˆ Ïˆ z 1 s where Î¸ Ïˆ is the moisture content l 3 l 3 k x Ïˆ k y Ïˆ and k z Ïˆ are unsaturated hydraulic conductivities l t 1 in the x y and z directions respectively Ïˆ is the soil water suction head l and s is the root water uptake term l 3 l 3 t 1 a root water uptake model was coupled to the richards equation to simulate soil moisture dynamics in cropped agricultural fields in this study the ojha and rai 1996 nonlinear root water uptake model was employed as this model has been parameterized for the crops in the indo gangetic plain the root water uptake term is expressed as 4 s Ïˆ z t j z r max Ï‡ 1 Ïˆ Ïˆ w Ïˆ fc Ïˆ w 1 z z r max Ï‡ f o r Ïˆ Ïˆ amc where t j is the potential extraction rate on the j th day z is the depth from the soil surface z rj is root depth on the j th day Ï‡ is the nonlinear parameter which is 3 4 and 1 62 for rice and wheat crops respectively shankar et al 2012 devatha et al 2016 z rmax is maximum rooting depth Ïˆ w is suction head at wilting point Ïˆ fc is suction head at field capacity and Ïˆ amc is suction head at available moisture content we measured the rooting depth under both crop covers on the same experimental plot since it is assumed that root depth increases steadily during the growing season and thereafter remains constant prasad 1988 the daily root depths for wheat crop cover were obtained by simple linear interpolation between the seedling emergence and the maximum root depth and for the rice crop it was measured at different days during the growing stage and the values between those days were computed by linear interpolation fig 3c and d detailed information about the experiments is available in yetbarek and ojha 2020 2 2 1 soil hydraulic property models the van genuchten 1980 model was used to describe the unsaturated soil properties in eq 1 at a local scale the characteristic equations used to relate soil moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with pressure head are given below 5 Î¸ Ïˆ Î¸ r Î¸ s Î¸ r 1 Î± Ïˆ n m 6 k Ïˆ k s 1 Î± Ïˆ n 1 1 Î± Ïˆ n m 1 Î± Ïˆ n m 2 2 where Î¸ s and Î¸ r are the saturated and residual volumetric soil moisture content respectively k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity Î± and n are an empirical pore size distribution and shape defining parameters and m 1 1 n the mixed forms of 1 d and 3 d richards equations were solved using dogan s 1999 approach a block centered finite differences method was used and a backward euler approximation coupled with the modified picard iteration scheme and taylor series expansion was used to discretize the time derivative of the moisture content the mean conductance between adjacent cells was calculated by arithmetic averaging the simulations were run for 100 days which is fixed considering the number of days taken for cultivating both wheat and rice crops to increase the time efficiency the time stepping was dynamically controlled based on the effort required to converge the mean time step was 0 001 day and the minimum and maximum time steps were 0 0001 and 1 day respectively increasing and decreasing factors that are 40 and 10 respectively were used to get the size of the next time step based on the number of iteration it took in the current time step the numerical scheme is fully mass conserved and numerically stable we validated the developed numerical schemes against standard example problems given in dogan 1999 examples 1 and 5 the mass balance error observed in both standard problems is less than 0 15 2 2 2 models for soil moisture simulation in this study we used three different numerical models to describe soil moisture dynamics in cropped agricultural fields the streamtube approach num 1dst 1 d model num 1d and 3 d model num 3d the models vary in terms of data intake model complexity and computational cost num 1dst is a data intensive model num 1d is a simple and efficient model and num 3d is complex and computationally intensive but can be assumed to be a more realistic model as it considers lateral flow it is expected that a comparison between num 1dst and num 1d models will help us examine the effect of heterogeneous parameterization further comparisons between num 1d and num 3d models will help us understand the effects of model complexity these comparisons will lead to the identification of conditions under which these models can be effectively used fig 5 shows the general configuration of the three models along with the details of the soil hydraulic parameters k s Î± Î¸ s and n used for running the simulation since the sensitivity of soil moisture dynamics to the changes in residual soil moisture content Î¸ r is small lai and ren 2016 a constant value of 0 01 cm3 cm 3 was assumed for all numerical schemes though soil hydraulic parameters were measured at 10 20 and 50 cm depths only the data collected at 10 cm depth was considered for the numerical analysis it is mainly related to the practical applicability of surface soil hydraulic properties for agricultural water management most of the crop yield related studies rely on the calibration of soil moisture content obtained from remote sensing observations as remote sensing techniques can successfully measure near surface moisture content only the effective soil hydraulic properties obtained from these studies is a representation of near surface depths qiu et al 2016 de lannoy et al 2015 moreover it is easy and convenient to measure soil hydraulic properties near the surface rainfall and evapotranspiration were assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the plot in all schemes as the plot size is small and weather data were collected at a point a num 1dst this scheme was implemented to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the streamtube approach considering the variability in soil hydraulic parameters and irrigation water application at each subplot the one dimensional richards equation coupled with the root water uptake model was implemented the scheme only considers horizontal variability in soil hydraulic parameters no vertical variation in soil hydraulic parameters was considered it was also assumed that there was no lateral flow the flow domain has a 2 m depth with a grid size of 0 01 m b num 1d the governing equation describing vertical soil water movement in variably saturated soils in this model is the one dimensional richards equation the mean values of soil hydraulic parameters and irrigation water applications from 18 subplots were used as an input this scheme was implemented to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths similar to num 1dst it has a 2 m depth flow domain with a 0 01 m grid size c num 3d in this scheme the 3 d richards equation was solved the 3 d flow field was implemented to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the mean values of soil hydraulic parameters and irrigation water applications from 18 subplots it has a dimension of 20 20 2 m3 and a grid size of 0 2 0 2 and 0 01 m along the x y and z directions respectively 2 2 3 initial and boundary conditions data used for the initial and boundary conditions were obtained from the same agricultural plot mentioned above model calibration was performed to get the initial conditions in the field we measured moisture content at four depths and the values at intermediate depths were not available therefore it is necessary to fix a spin up time to identify the time to reach equilibrium and to use the obtained model output as an initial condition seck et al 2015 hu et al 2019 bai et al 2020 a maximum of 10 days was required to obtain soil moisture at 10 cm depth with a relative error of less than 1 to minimize the effect of initial conditions simulation results of the first 10 days were removed for data analysis in this study evaporation and irrigation applications were considered as upper boundary conditions and it switches between specified flux and specified head boundary conditions in response to changes in the head at the boundary cell 7 k Ïˆ Ïˆ z 1 q t a t z 0 t 0 the specified head boundary condition corresponds to the maximum possible depth h p 8 Ïˆ z t h p a t z 0 t t p where q is flux due to the addition and loss of water at the soil surface and t p is the time of saturation or ponding h p is 0 075 m and 0 05 m for wheat and rice crop covers respectively it is assumed that any water beyond the maximum ponding depth will be a runoff and will not be considered in the simulation a free gravity drainage boundary condition was assumed at the bottom of the flow domains and no flow conditions were assumed at the vertical planes for the 3 d field 9 Ïˆ z 0 a t z z max t 0 where z max is the bottom of the flow domain and it is 2 m in this study 2 3 analyzing performance of models the coefficient of determination r2 indicates the proportion of variance in the observed soil moisture content that can be statistically explained by the models though it is a handy index using r2 as a sole parameter is insufficient to make meaningful distinctions between models barrett 1974 willmott 1981 therefore other residual error based goodness of fit measures were used to examine the performance of the proposed models along with r2 relative error re root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were selected for the analysis rmse is easy to interpret since it has similar units with observed and simulated values and it tells the actual size of the error produced by the model willmott 1981 nrmse provides a percentage measure of the relative difference between observed and simulated datasets r2 values close to 1 and the rmse and nrmse values close to 0 are expected from the best performing model re r2 rmse and nrmse can be computed as follows 10 re Î¸ m Î¸ o Î¸ o 100 11 r 2 i 1 n Î¸ o i Î¸ o Î¸ m i Î¸ m i 1 n Î¸ o i Î¸ o 2 i 1 n Î¸ m i Î¸

simulated values and n is the number of data points considered for the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of simulated and observed soil moisture simulated soil moisture content obtained from num 1dst num 1d num 3d models were compared with observed mean soil moisture values figs 6 and 7 show the temporal variation of measured and simulated soil moisture content under wheat and rice crops respectively it can be observed that the performance of models varies with boundary conditions land cover depth and crop growth stage under wheat crop cover soil moisture was highly overestimated at surface depth after crop maturity by all the models though the magnitude may vary this may be due to the presence of preferential flows or cracks present at the soil surface in the experimental plot created due to the high dryness in the march and april months the performance of all models was good at 25 cm depth than the surface depth especially after crop maturity however all models underestimated moisture content at 50 and 80 cm depths it is because the soil hydraulic parameters used for simulations were collected at 10 cm depth due to the ponded water the general trend of the observed soil moisture was smooth all models exhibited sensitivity to the changes in boundary conditions at the surface depth and it was negligible at subsurface depths the soil moisture content was underestimated by all the models at 50 and 80 cm depths the difference between model performances was noticeable in rice in contrast to what was observed under wheat crop cover and num 1d performs better than the others figs 7 and 8 generally the dampening effect of depth is visible in both observed and simulated soil moisture contents and the sensitivity for changes in boundary conditions decreases with depth the soil moisture distribution difference between wheat and rice crop covers was mainly controlled by the way of cultivation i e alternate wetting and drying in wheat and paddy in rice more than their rooting system difference and their response to the atmospheric demand as shown in yetbarek et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 the relative error was more prominent at the surface depths and it was relatively small and negative underestimation at deeper depths under both crop covers for example despite slight variation between models there was around 20 overestimation and 10 underestimation at 10 and 80 cm depths respectively during the fourth irrigation fig 8a and g under wheat crop cover the overestimations were higher during irrigation and the following days and underestimations were exhibited in drying soils at the surface depth it is related to the fast response of models for boundary condition changes and the attenuating nature of the field similar trends were perceived under rice crop cover overestimations were observed during high rainfall and it was noticeable at the surface depth and the sensitivity to soil surface boundary condition decreases with depth at deeper depths the underestimation is mainly due to the distinct soil hydraulic properties difference between the near surface and subsurface depths the difference is likely related to the effect of tillage activities at near surface depths xu and mermoud 2001 besides hardpan formation which is a common event below tillage depth in rice fields may create such differences in soil hydraulic properties between near surface and subsurface depths all models perfectly simulated the observed soil moisture till the first irrigation under wheat crop cover at near surface depths further there was variation in response to water application between the models both num 1d and num 3d models showed higher soil moisture on the day of irrigation however in num 1dst a delayed response to irrigation was observed near the soil surface num 1d and num 3d models overestimated soil moisture on the irrigation days and exhibited a fast depletion rate in the days to follow however in the experimental field depletion of soil moisture was at a lower rate leading to underestimation of soil moisture by the numerical models due to higher atmospheric demand and well established rooting system the observed moisture content shows a significant reduction after the crop attained maximum rooting depth however this was not the case for the numerical models while performing field experiments the maximum effect of spatial variability in hydraulic properties was observed under rice crop cover attempts were made to maintain a ponded water depth of 5 cm in all sub plots however a significant variation in the infiltration rate was observed between the sub plots the water level at some subplots exceeded beyond the limited depth during high rainfall and in some subplots the infiltrate rate was so high that they required frequent irrigation to maintain the ponded depth of 5 cm it is to be noted that the observed moisture content was almost seamless to this variability as the mean of all 18 subplots was considered for the analysis as shown in fig 7 3 2 comparison of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for the numerical models fig 9 shows the simulated temporal variation of the mean of lognormally distributed unsaturated hydraulic conductivity by different numerical models under wheat and rice crop covers hydraulic conductivity is significantly influenced by soil heterogeneity garcÃ­a gutiÃ©rrez et al 2018 while we did not have observed data for comparison in this case a comparison amongst the models was done to examine in what way the heterogeneity considered in the models affects the hydraulic conductivity distribution the mean of log normally distributed unsaturated hydraulic conductivity exhibited a general decreasing trend with time till crop maturity under wheat crop due to the growing atmospheric demand though sudden rise and drops can be observed due to irrigation once the maximum root zone depth was achieved the hydraulic conductivity becomes constant and it is a reflection of the soil moisture distribution there is a visible variation in conductivity between models in the first couple of weeks num 1dst exhibited higher conductivity except for a couple of days during and after irrigation in contrast num 3d has lower conductivity when soil moisture is low and it suddenly spikes during irrigation this reveals its higher sensitivity to changes in the upper boundary condition for example a 4 83 change in soil moisture content at the surface depth resulted in a 41 09 higher conductivity during the first irrigation num 1d always lies above num 3d when the moisture content is low and below num 3d during irrigation periods all models showed similar trends at the subsurface depths however the conductivity is significantly lower than the surface depth for example the peak unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for num 3d at the surface depth after the first irrigation was 3 56 times higher than what was observed at 80 cm depth i e the soil water moves about 3 56 times faster at 10 cm than at 80 cm depth yetbarek et al 2020 also numerically showed that conductivity at the surface depth was much higher than at 80 cm depth and it indicates that hydraulic conductivity significantly decreases with increasing soil depth unsaturated hydraulic conductivity under rice crop cover was higher than that observed under wheat crop cover at all the depths and it is related to the ponded water in the former num 3d exhibited higher conductivity num 1d is not much sensitive to water applications compared to num 1dst and num 3d this is likely because num 1dst considers spatial variability of soil properties and irrigation application at each subplot and num 3d considers lateral water movement which may play a significant role in both soil moisture and conductivity distribution num 1dst always exhibited lower values and num 3d showed higher values at subsurface depths 3 3 effect of boundary condition and crop growth stage on model performance to examine how the performances of the models were affected by changes in atmospheric boundary conditions three distinct periods with 11 successive days each under irrigation evaporation and rainfall boundary conditions were selected the model performance under different boundary conditions was analyzed only for wheat crop cover as under rice crop cover it was impossible to get suitable distinct periods for each boundary condition as the rice crop always had ponded water similarly four periods with similar duration at initial crop development mid season and late season stages were selected under both wheat and rice crop covers to investigate the effect of crop growth stages on the model performance 3 3 1 effect of boundary condition the scatterplot of observed and simulated soil moisture content by different models under different boundary conditions is shown in fig 10 the period selected to examine the effects of irrigation boundary conditions comprises the first irrigation the distribution of points around the 1 1 line considerably varies with depth and the difference was small between models as shown in fig 10a d and g all the models overestimated lower moisture and underestimated higher soil moisture values intermediate moisture values were better estimated at near surface depths and all values were underestimated at deeper depths although it is difficult to set a strictly quantified and objective description to examine the model accuracy zhang et al 2007 used the relative error between observed and simulated values at measured points as a major criterion they suggest that the model performance is good if the relative error percentage is less than 10 acceptable if it is 10 20 and poor if it is less than 50 it is observed that the performance of all models was good at 10 and 25 cm depths and they were better at 25 cm depth than at 10 cm it may be due to the high fluctuation at the surface depth and relatively attenuated moisture content at 25 cm depth the predicting capacity of models reduced to an acceptable category at 50 and 80 cm depths it is because the soil hydraulic parameters used were collected at 10 cm depth the rmse for the simulated and observed soil moisture content provides a quantitative measure of the goodness of the fit between the measured and the simulated values jamieson et al 1991 mentioned that a simulation is considered excellent when the nrmse is less than 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 fair if it is between 20 and 30 and poor if it is greater than 30 as shown in table 1 the performance of num 1dst was better than the other models under irrigation boundary conditions the rmse values were 0 01 0 02 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and the nrmse values were 4 14 6 30 and 6 68 in num 1dst num 1d and num 3d respectively showing an excellent simulation at the surface depth despite the relative error rmse and nrmse values show the good performance of models their r2 is very low at the surface depth for example num 1dst num 1d and num 3d models can explain only 14 12 1 47 and 0 04 of the variability in the observed soil moisture respectively r2 values are very low because the variance within the simulated values is higher than the variance between the simulated and observed values achen 1977 r2 increases with depth and it is related to the sensitivity of models for water application and the dampening of noise with depth similar trends were observed under rainfall boundary conditions as well the changes observed here correspond to the difference in the amount of water applied between the two low and intermediate values were overestimated and higher values were better estimated in the latter at the surface depth since the noise within the simulated values is reduced in the rainfall boundary condition the r2 values obtained were much higher and num 1dst can explain up to 68 01 and 84 27 of the variability in the measured moisture content at the surface and 25 cm depths respectively as shown in fig 10c f and i the variation between values was small at 25 cm depth as a result the relative errors were smaller at 25 cm than at 10 cm in all models the performance of models at deeper depths was poor because the parameters used for simulation are collected at 10 cm depth the models sensitivity to higher irrigation application becomes apparent when examining the effect of evaporation boundary conditions fig 10b e and h num 1dst num 1d and num 3d simulated values can explain 93 43 72 91 and 60 97 of the variability in the observed moisture content at the surface depth soil wetness influences model performance for example lower values were under predicted intermediate values were better predicted and higher values were over predicted at the surface depth all models performed relatively well especially at 10 and 25 cm depths the rmse values range from 0 01 to 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for irrigation and rainfall boundary conditions and less than 0 01 cm3 cm 3 for evaporation boundary conditions at the surface depth these values are small and within the recommended limit of 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for effective irrigation management based on soil moisture sensing iaea 2008 however num 1dst certainly has a better prediction capability when compared to the other two models 3 3 2 effect of vegetation growth suitable periods were selected at each growth stage when the effect of other factors such as irrigation and high rainfall was not significant to specifically investigate the influence of crop growth on the model performance the crop season was divided into four growth stages i initial ii development iii mid season and iv late season stages the duration considered for analysis in the initial stage under wheat crop cover ranges between the third and the fourth weeks after sowing the effect of transpiration was negligible due to limited rooting depth and the role of evaporation is low due to the winter season for the wheat crop as shown in fig 11 a and table 2 all models were able to simulate observed soil moisture at the surface depth r2 was high for all models which ranges between 0 83 and 0 86 and the maximum and average deviations between observed and simulated values were only 0 67 and 0 44 respectively the explaining power of the models decreases with depths however num 1dst num 1d and num 3d models can explain 71 81 67 10 and 60 97 of the variability in observed soil moisture at 80 cm depth it is due to the reduced variability within the simulated values as compared to the upper depths and its lower variability relative to the observed values besides very low rmse values i e less than 0 01 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse values of 0 77 1 13 and 2 04 for num 1dst num 1d and num 3d respectively show an excellent prediction performance of models at the surface depth table 2 under rice crop cover see fig 11e the range of the observed values was very small at the surface depth due to ponding but the variability of the simulated values was high as a result r2 values of all models were small num 1dst underestimated most of the values num 1d predicted much better and num 3d overestimated it may be related to consideration of water application variability at each subplot in num 1dst and possible lateral movement in num 3d simulation as shown in table 3 the rmse values were 0 01 0 01 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse values were 5 04 2 00 and 8 54 in num 1dst num 1d and num 3d respectively shows the models very good performance at the surface depth in the development stage transpiration starts to overrule evaporation and the leaf area index increases significantly under both crop covers as shown in fig 11 under wheat crop cover lower moisture values are better estimated and the performance of models decreases with increasing soil wetness similar to the initial stage num 1dst was a better predictor but the difference between model simulations was small at the surface depth fig 11b the performance of all models was low at 25 cm conversely lower values were overestimated and higher values were better estimated by all models under rice crop cover num 1d overestimated lower values and better estimated higher moisture content and the estimated values variability range was smaller than other models num 1dst and num 3d exhibited comparable performances at the mid season stage the root system was fully developed atmospheric demand was high and the leaf area index was at its peak all models overestimated lower soil moisture values and better estimated higher values under wheat crop cover the scatterplot shows high variability between values as the intermediate values are distinctly overestimated fig 11c as a result the r2 of models was lower than in other growth stages although all models showed similar distribution along the 1 1 line the num 3d performance is lower which explains 42 05 of the variability in the observed soil moisture it may be due to its sensitivity to water applications the nrmse values observed at this stage which ranges from 5 33 to 7 12 for all models revealed that the actual deviation between observed and simulated values is small and the models are performing well all values are overestimated under rice crop cover unlike the previous stages the observed values variability range is high and it increases with time num 1d and num 3d were the good and poor performers respectively the rmse values range from 0 05 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 in all models at the surface depth which is much higher than that observed in the previous growth stages the period selected from the late season stage covers 84 94 days after sowing under wheat crop cover all models performed better at higher values and overestimation increases with decreasing soil wetness at the late season stage no significant variation was observed between the performances of the models the rmse values are between 0 01 and 0 02 cm3 cm 3 for all models and are relatively high as compared to the preceding growth stages however nrmse values are around 5 50 in all models the soil moisture values are overestimated by all models under rice crop cover and num 1dst and num 3d were the best and the poor performers respectively all models were able to satisfactorily simulate observed soil moisture at the surface depth under wheat crop and their performance decreases with depth at all growth stages num 1dst has a better prediction capability under rice crop cover the range of the observed values was very small at the surface depth due to ponding which resulted in higher rmse values especially in mid and late season stages num 1d outperformed other models in the first three stages and num 1dst excels over others in the last stage 4 conclusions three numerical models num 1dst num 1d and num 3d were developed and compared with soil moisture measurements in a wheat and rice cropped agricultural field with soil heterogeneity the effects of changes in land cover boundary condition and crop growth stage on the performance of models were examined the soil moisture simulated using the numerical models was much reliable at near surface depths when compared to deeper depths indicating the strong influence soil hydraulic properties can have on model simulation the dampening effect of depth was visible in both observed and simulated soil moisture content and the sensitivity for changes in boundary conditions decreases with depth all the models could predict the temporal and spatial distribution of water reasonably well except on heavy rainfall or irrigation days num 1dst provided better performance under all boundary conditions and growth stages under wheat crop cover as it considers the soil hydraulic properties at each subplot under rice crop cover the range of the observed values was very small at the surface depth due to ponding which resulted in higher rmse values especially in mid and late season stages num 1d outperformed other models in the first three stages and num 1dst excels over others in the last stage suggesting that soil wetness influences model performance based on comparisons of the model deviations from the measured data and the resultant statistics the performance of the three numerical models is satisfactory and all of them can be used for irrigation water management in agricultural fields it is noteworthy that the 3 d richards equation based model even though accounts for the lateral flow of water does not improve the soil moisture simulation results when compared to the 1 d richards equation based model this indicates that increasing model complexity does not lead to an improvement in results and the accurate representation of soil hydraulic properties plays a more important role further the streamtube based model apart from being simple definitely has more potential than simple 1 d numerical models for modeling water movement in crops that undergo alternate wetting and drying cycles future studies should focus on coupling streamtube based water flow models with crop growth models in such crops credit authorship contribution statement ephrem yetbarek conceptualization data curation software
