9865,field experiment combined with numerical simulation is an efficient approach for evaluation the effects of saline water irrigation on soil water salt movement crop growth and water productivity in this study hydrus model was coupled with epic module to evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and grain yield under subsurface drainage condition two years field experiment data collected in lysimeters of summer maize irrigated with water of two different levels of salinity under different subsurface drain depths was used to calibrate and validate the coupled model the coupled model was then adopted to evaluate the effects of salinity stress on evaporation transpiration and water productivity wp and of long term saline water irrigation on soil salinity and grain yield under subsurface drainage results indicated that simulated values of soil water salt content subsurface drainage amount and concentration grain yield and evapotranspiration et were in good agreement with observed values transpiration and wp were reduced by salinity stress while evaporation was sensitive to drain depth soil salinity evidently increased when irrigation water salinity was higher than 4 0 ds m 1 in each simulated year under drain depth of 80 cm grain yield maintained at around 7600 kg ha 1 when water salinity is 4 4 ds m 1 under drain depth of 80 cm and decreased with higher water salinity across all simulated years there were significant exponential relationships between soil salinity grain yield and irrigation water salinity in the long term simulation thus the appropriate irrigation water salinity should be 4 0 4 4 ds m 1 under subsurface drain depth of 80 cm in the present study the combined application of saline water irrigation and subsurface drainage should be given more attention for long term soil salinity and grain yield management in the future keywords saline water irrigation subsurface drainage soil salinity summer maize yield coupled model 1 introduction saline water irrigation without regulatory measures to control soil water salt content may lead to soil salinization and grain yield reduction in farmland with poor drainage cao et al 2016 doorenbos and kassam 1986 given their role in controlling water table depth and reducing soil salinization threat agricultural drainage systems have been widely utilized in water logging prone and saline alkali areas needelman et al 2007 wen et al 2020 recently several problems such as excessive water loss soil salinization and groundwater pollution caused by low quality irrigation water have frequently been reported for open ditch drainage systems singh 2019a 2019b mao et al 2017 negm et al 2017 compared with open ditch drainage systems a subsurface drainage system has more advantages in controlling soil salinity and improving drainage efficiency under saline water irrigation sloan et al 2016 ghumman et al 2010 therefore the impacts of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and crop productivity under subsurface drainage system has been given more attention the design of subsurface drainage systems by field experimentation was usually considered time consuming and uneconomical tao et al 2017 rijal et al 2012 numerical simulation has been regarded as an efficient approach in the quantitative evaluation of soil water salt dynamics under subsurface drainage system maalim and melesse 2013 muma et al 2017 as a hydrologic model hydrus 2d 3d model has been widely adopted in the study of water and solute transport under drained conditions šimůnek et al 2008 ghazouani et al 2016 compared with other models hydrus model has the advantage of providing flexible boundary conditions and great applicability to variable saturated media which is very convenient for the simulation of soil solute transport under subsurface drainage ebrahimian and noory 2015 filipović et al 2014 further researches have suggested that hydrus is also a practical tool for the evaluation of crop growth response to water and salinity stress when coupled with crop growth models sarmah et al 2005 wang and li 2010 wang et al 2014 with the coupled hydrus wofost model zhou et al 2012 predicted crop production and soil water movement during the spring wheat growing season roy et al 2019 coupled hydrus 2d with dssat to simulate 2 3d movement of water heat and multiple solutes however because of its relatively less input data requirement epic module is often the preferred module for evaluating crop growth xu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 over one hundred different crops have been successfully simulated in a unified approach with epic module williams 1995 han et al 2015 used hydrus epic model to evaluate the effects of groundwater table depth on soil water movement and cotton growth wang et al 2015 estimated the effects of sprinkler irrigation on soil water nitrogen movement and winter wheat yield in north china plain utilizing the same coupled model wang et al 2017 assessed the effects of long term use of saline water on grain yield and salt accumulation in north china plain most of the researches focused on the evaluation of soil water solute transport and crop yield under different irrigation methods wu et al 2019 xian et al 2017 while few of them focused on simulating the impact of salinity stress on crop productivity and long term use of saline water on soil salinity and of crop yield under subsurface drainage system sloan et al 2017 the aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of subsurface drainage in saline water irrigated cropland by field experiment and numerical model the coupled hydrus epic model was calibrated and validated using two year s field experiment data the effects of salinity stress on crop yield evapotranspiration and water productivity were then analyzed with the calibrated model finally the effects of long term use of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and crop yield under subsurface drainage was evaluated by scenario simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment area the field experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of efficient irrigation drainage and agricultural soil water environment in nanjing china 118 60 e 31 86 n in the year of 2016 and 2017 this experiment site is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 15 7 the mean annual precipitation and mean annual evaporation in the past 30 years was 1021 mm and around 2000 mm respectively all together 12 lysimeters with concrete bottom were utilized for crop growth in the experiment site the soil physical properties in the lysimeters including soil particle size percentages soil bulk density and field capacity from 0 to 120 cm are shown in table 1 2 2 experiment design and agronomic measures in this study the specifications of lysimeters were 2 5 m 2 m 3 m length width depth and separated by concrete blocks painted with waterproof material to prevent water seepage the subsurface pipes were embedded in the center of soil profile in each lysimeter before the experiment started the irrigation water was applied by furrow irrigation method with the left and right half furrow designed at soil surface of each lysimeter fig 1 there were two levels of drain depths d1 80 cm and d2 120 cm and two levels of irrigation water salinity gradients s1 0 25 ds m 1 and s2 6 25 ds m 1 in the lysimeter experiment the experiment was split plot designed with three replicates laid out in 12 lysimeters during two growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 summer maize zea mays l was sown in june of 2016 and 2017 with plant rowing and spacing of 40 cm 40 cm in each lysimeter fresh water irrigation amount of 60 mm was applied at sowing and then saline water irrigation was applied after sowing the saline water irrigation amount was divided into supplementary irrigation and leaching irrigation in field experiment the supplementary irrigation water was applied to maintain the soil moisture content in a suitable condition and the leaching irrigation water was applied for salt leaching and subsurface drainage both supplementary irrigation depth and leaching irrigation depth were calculated according to the following equation 1 m 1000 n h θ max θ min where m is the irrigation water depth mm n is the soil porosity in planned wetting layer h is the depth of planned wet soil m which is 0 40 m and 1 20 m for supplementary irrigation and leaching irrigation respectively θ max and θ min are the controlled maximum and minimum soil content respectively according to the calculation results the supplementary irrigation water depth and leaching irrigation water depth were about 40 mm and 120 mm respectively the supplementary irrigation water with total amounts of 160 mm was applied evenly at the 10 62 92 and 100 days after sowing meanwhile the leaching irrigation water with each amounts of 120 mm were applied at tasseling 48 days after sowing and filling 77 days after sowing stages respectively there were all together seven irrigation events with total amounts of 460 mm 60 mm fresh water and 400 mm saline water in each treatment during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the daily air temperature and irrigation amounts during 2016 and 2017 are illustrated in fig 2 in this study ammonium in the equivalent amount of 225 ka ha 1 was applied as base before sowing at a designed rate n p2o5 k2o 28 6 6 moreover urea in the equivalent amount of 300 kg ha 1 was applied at the first irrigation event due to the often occurrence of rainfall during the experiment period a rain shelter was utilized to avoid the impact of heavy rainfall on the experimental results when precipitation occurred 2 3 experiment data collection and monitoring soil samples were obtained from the center of each lysimeter at 20 cm intervals from the soil surface down to a depth of 120 cm the soil sampling interval was 15 days from the summer maize sowing date to harvest date in both 2016 and 2017 additional measurements were also taken before and after each irrigation event gravimetric water content was determined by stoving method observed volumetric water content was then obtained by multiplying the gravimetric water content by soil bulk density electrical conductivity of saturated paste ece was determined from the electrical conductivity of 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 using the equation ece 14 77ec1 5 0 225 feng et al 2017 where ec1 5 was measured with a portable parameter tester sg23 elk ism mettler toledo international inc switzerland subsurface drainage flow was collected in a bucket to determine the amount and concentration of total dissolved salt tds in drainage water when subsurface drainage occurred the tds in this study was also measured with the portable parameter tester mentioned above ten representative plants from each plot were used to determine the yield of maize at the harvest time at the end of the two growing seasons the measurement method of actual evapotranspiration eta and water productivity wp can be found in feng et al 2017 2 4 model description the hydrus model and the crop growth module in epic were coupled in fortran 90 which is based on the microsoft windows system the soil water solute transport and root water absorption process were simulated by hydrus model the output results were then input into the crop growth module of epic to simulate the crop growth process the crop growth data was then fed back into hydrus model to simulate the soil water solute transport and root water absorption in the next data exchange cycle the data exchange time step between hydraulic module and crop growth module was daily 2 4 1 hydrologic module the modified

initial values of soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by the basic soil physical properties according to van genuchten s model van genuchten 1987 the convection dispersion equation cde was used in hydrus model to predict solute transport process the governing equation is given in the following form 5 θ c ρ s t x i θ d i j c x j q i c x i where c is the concentration of soil solution ds m 1 ρ

taking drain depth of 80 cm as example the depth and width of simulated area was determined by 1 20 m and 2 00 m respectively in the simulated area the left and right top furrow in fig 3 were assigned variable head boundary the upper surface of the simulated area was assigned atmospheric boundary the drain pipe in the simulated area was assigned seepage face boundary the bottom side of the simulated area was assigned no flux boundary since there was no water and solute exchange from the concrete bottom side of the lysimeter the remaining left and right sides of the simulated area were both assigned no flux boundary 2 4 2 crop growth module the harvest index was applied to compute crop yield in epic model as followings williams 1995 10 y l d h i b a where yld is the simulated crop

et al 1968 2 5 coupled model calibration and validation the data sets of soil water content subsurface drainage ece and grain yield and evapotranspiration from 2016 and 2017 growing seasons were used to calibrate and validate the coupled model respectively the soil hydraulic parameters such as θ s θ r α n and k s were the main parameters calibrated in the hydrus model the calibrated values of soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters for different soil layers are presented in table 1 the default values of physiological parameters proposed by williams williams 1995 were treated as the initial value in epic model and the calibrated crop parameters are shown in table 2 in the coupled model soil hydraulic parameters in hydrus were calibrated and validated by comparing observed and simulated soil water content subsurface drainage and ece in 2016 and 2017 respectively the observed and simulated values of grain yield and evapotranspiration in 2016 and 2017 were used to calibrate and validate the crop parameters in epic respectively the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the performance of coupled hydrus epic model as follows 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 13 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 14 n s e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of observations o i and pi are observed and simulated values of the i th observation where i 1 to n o and p are the mean observed and simulated values respectively during the model evaluation rmse values close to zero while r2 and nse are close to 1 indicate perfect model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 soil water content soil water contents in the 0 120 cm soil profile for each treatment in 2016 and 2017 crop growing seasons are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the error bars in fig 4 represents the standard errors between observed values for three replicates tests during model calibration period 2016 the soil water contents for different soil layers varied with irrigation events in whole growth period the variations of soil water contents for the upper soil layers were more pronounced than those of deeper soil layers under similar irrigation conditions this could be due to the effects of irrigation and evaporation on upper soil layers being stronger than those for deeper layers in addition for both drain depth of d1 and d2 soil water contents for 80 and 120 cm soil depth were relatively lower than for 0 80 and 0 120 cm soil depth respectively this might be attributed to the soil water at about 80 cm and 120 cm soil layer being effectively excluded resulting in the amount of soil water to the deep layer being reduced meanwhile for the drain depth of 120 cm d2 the variation trends were similar for different soil layers during whole simulation periods in this experiment the deeper drain condition provided more soil layers for water to infiltrate through and enabling water infiltration through the soil layers to be more uniform before the water was removed as shown in fig 5 during validation period 2017 the observed soil water content and simulated data also showed good correlation relationship since both data were distributed near the 1 1 line model accuracy evaluating parameters listed in table 3 also indicated that deviations between observed and simulated values were within an acceptable range for both calibration and validation phases 0 02 cm3 cm 3 rmse 0 03 cm3 cm 3 0 87 nse 0 89 and 0 92 r2 0 94 wang et al 2017 showed the rmse ranged from 0 022 to 0 028 cm3 cm 3 and r2 ranged from 0 56 to 0 60 using the same coupled model the hydrus model had a little underestimated soil water content for the upper soil layers in wang s study resulting in the r2 values in their study ranged from 0 56 to 0 60 wang et al 2017 furthermore the experiments in our study were conducted in condition of shelter from rainfall in lysimeters making the soil moisture more manageable than wang s experiment therefore the prediction accuracy of the model was relatively improved compared with that in wang s study with other coupled models rmse values were in the range of 0 027 0 066 cm3 cm 3 and 0 030 0 054 cm3 cm 3 with root zone water quality model rzwqm model hu et al 2006 and ceres model eitzinger et al 2004 respectively the nse values for soil water modeling were also comparable with similar studies using hydrus coupled model with hydrus epic model wang et al 2015 reported nse of soil water content for 15 100 cm soil layers in the range of 0 71 0 95 and 0 47 0 87 for calibration and validation respectively wang et al 2014 used hydrus chain model to simulate soil water with nse values in the range of 0 971 0 986 therefore the results indicated that the coupled model was capable of accurately simulating soil water content under subsurface drainage system 3 1 2 subsurface drainage the subsurface drainage data sets of 2016 and 2017 were also used for the model calibration and validation respectively as shown in figs 6 and 7 simulated daily drainage values generally represented good match with observed values it should be mentioned that there were also tiny amounts of drainage occurring in supplementary irrigation irrigation amounts of 40 cm in addition to leaching irrigation irrigation amounts of 120 cm in both d1 and d2 treatments the drainage occurred in supplementary irrigation was mainly preferential flow collected from soil crack caused by subsurface pipe installation process for treatments with drain depth of 80 cm d1 seven drainage volume peaks occurred soon after each irrigation event while for treatments d2 there were only three apparent drainage volume peaks which occurred at the 1st 3rd and 5th irrigation events the cumulative simulated drainage amounts for d1 were 75 0 mm and 87 5 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively while for d2 were about 67 0 mm and 73 2 mm respectively table 4 the drainage amounts for d2 were evidently lower than for d1 which was due to the deeper drain condition proving a longer infiltration path for water and leading to more water being stored in the soil profile in d2 in our study the drainage amount for s2 were slightly higher than for s1 this might be because with increasing salt concentration in the soil solution the soil aggregate structure became easier to form and increased the macropore and infiltration characteristic of the soil bi et al 2010 the mean simulated drainage concentrations under s1 were 3 17 g l 1 and 2 53 g l 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively while under s2 were 6 69 g l 1 and 5 93 g l 1 respectively table 4 the drainage concentrations under s2 were significantly higher than the corresponding values under s1 for the same drainage conditions this was also attributed to higher irrigation water salinity increasing the soil macropore and infiltration characteristic leading to more salt ions being leached to deeper soil layers and being discharged in the subsurface drainage the model accuracy evaluating parameters in table 3 suggested that there were strong correlations between observed and simulated drainage amount and drainage concentration in both calibration and validation phases the rmse values were in the range 0 43 0 44 mm 2 61 2 64 mm and 0 30 g l 1 to 0 11 g l 1 for daily drainage cumulative drainage and drainage concentration respectively the corresponding nse values were in the range 0 91 0 94 0 80 0 94 and 0 95 0 96 respectively and the corresponding r2 ranged from 0 95 0 96 0 90 0 91 and 0 92 0 93 respectively recent studies have suggested that hydrus model could evaluate water flow under various drain depths and spaces under different water management practices li et al 2015 ebrahimian and noory 2015 the simulation results of the current study also indicated that the coupled model performed well in modeling subsurface drainage with regard to both drainage amount and drainage water concentration under saline water irrigation 3 1 3 soil salinity the soil salt distribution at the harvest time for different treatments in 2016 growing season are show in fig 8 for drain depth of 80 cm d1 the soil salt distribution were obviously different between s1 and s2 especially in the range of infiltration interface of furrow irrigation for irrigation water salinity of 0 25 ds m 1 s1 soil salt was transported by infiltration flow to deeper soil layer and then drained by the subsurface drainage pipe therefore the soil salt distribution near the furrow was lower than that near subsurface drainage pipe while for irrigation water salinity of 6 25 ds m 1 s2 more soluble salt was brought into the soil profile by irrigation leading the soil salt distribution near the furrow relative higher than other simulated area as showed in fig 8 even under water salnity of 6 25 ds m 1 the soil salt under d1 was still effectively removed for drain depth of 120 cm d2 the soil salt distribution was similar to that for d1 in s1 while for s2 the soil salt can not be drained in time and more salt ion was left in the soil profile during the water infiltration process so the soil salinity in treatment d2s2 was relative higher than in other treatments in general there were remarkable soil salt drainage effects by the subsurface pipe in this study and the soil salt distribution was affected by both irrigation water salinity and subsurface drainage depth similarly the observed and simulated ece values within the root zone for the 2016 growing season were used to calibrate the coupled model as shown in fig 9 the error bars in fig 9 represents the standard errors between observed values for three replicates tests ece values decreased shortly after each irrigation event but the decline ranges under the irrigation amounts of 120 mm were more evident than under other irrigation amounts this phenomenon suggested that larger irrigation amount was effective for soil salt leaching even under high irrigation water salinity furthermore for irrigation water salinity of s2 more soluble salt was brought into the soil profile leading to the ece under s2 to be significantly higher than under s1 for both d1 and d2 treatments under different salinity of irrigation water variation of ece was compared between d1 and d2 treatments similar variation ranges of ece were found in both d1 and d2 treatments and the decline ranges under the irrigation amount of 120 mm were more evident than for other irrigation amounts for irrigation water salinity s1 the decline ranges under the 120 mm irrigation amount were approximated in both d1 and d2 treatments and the mean ece values were 1 91 ds m 1 and 2 05 ds m 1 respectively meanwhile for irrigation water salinity s2 the decline ranges for drain depth d1 were more obvious than for d2 treatment and the mean ece values were 2 79 ds m 1 and 3 25 ds m 1 for d1 and d2 respectively the observed and simulated ece values for 2017 growing season were used to validate the coupled model as shown in fig 10 during validation period the observed soil salinity ece and simulated data also showed good correlation relationship since both data were distributed near the 1 1 line model accuracy evaluating parameters listed in table 3 indicated that deviations between observed and simulated values were within an acceptable range for both calibration and validation periods 0 34 ds m 1 rmse 0 42 ds m 1 0 83 nse 0 85 and 0 87 r2 0 88 with a similar model wang et al 2017 showed the rmse and r2 values for soil salinity ranged from 0 39 g l 1 to 0 61 g l 1 and 0 92 0 93 in calibration and validation period respectively rmse nse and r2 values for soil salinity showed the coupled model was capable of accurately simulating conditions under the subsurface drainage system as reported by xu et al 2013 and ren et al 2016 3 1 4 grain yield and evapotranspiration the crop growth module was evaluated using the simulated and observed grain yields and evapotranspiration et for 2016 and 2017 summer maize yield decreased with increasing water salinity under both d1and d2 drain depths table 5 the yields under s2 decreased by 14 50 and 18 25 in 2016 and 8 13 and 19 33 in 2017 compared with yields under s1 for d1 and d2 treatments respectively it was found that the grain yield reduction degrees were also different between d1 and d2 treatments where the summer maize yield under d1 were significantly higher than under d2 in both growing seasons likewise d1s1 and d2s2 produced the highest and lowest grain yield across all tested treatments in the two growing seasons respectively table 5 owing to the soil salinity within the root zone under d1 treatments being lower than under d2 treatments a more appropriate soil water salt environment was provided for crop growth while taking advantage of saline water irrigation assouline et al 2015 hassanli et al 2016 the et values also decreased with increase in irrigation water salinity in both d1 and d2 treatments table 5 the values under s2 decreased by 8 54 and 3 94 in 2016 and 4 18 and 8 65 in 2017 compared with the corresponding values under s1 for d1 and d2 treatments respectively this result indicated that under the higher irrigation water salinity the soil water storage capacity was reduced and more water infiltrated into deeper soil profile layers and was discharged by the subsurface drainage pipe qian et al 2021 on the contrary the et values under d1 were much lower than those under d2 where the values under d1 were decreased by 6 64 and 11 11 in 2016 and 16 89 and 12 83 in 2017 compared with those under d2 for s1 and s2 treatments respectively since there was less water drained the soil water storage in d2 treatments was higher than in d1 treatments which led to higher values of et in d2 treatments compared to d1 treatments feng et al 2017 therefore the et was also affected by both irrigation water salinity and subsurface drainage depth in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the model evaluation parameters for summer maize yield and et under subsurface drainage are shown in table 3 for grain yield simulation the r2 values between simulated and measured grain yield were 0 97 and 0 92 along with rmse 242 30 kg ha 1 and nse 0 86 for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for et simulation the r2 values were 0 98 and 0 99 while rmse values were lower than 7 97 mm and nse values were higher than 0 86 for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively table 3 the results of the grain yield and et evaluation obtained in this study for summer maize can be compared with those obtained for other crops using the hydrus epic model for grain yield simulation wang et al 2017 reported the rmse values for winter wheat yield were 109 9 kg ha 1 and 188 6 kg ha 1 and the r2 values were 0 93 and 0 80 during the model calibration and validation periods using a different model liang et al 2018 predicted corn yield with rmse values in the range of 289 kg ha 1 to 559 kg ha 1 and nse values in the range of 0 82 0 98 for calibration and validation phases of whcns model for et simulation wang et al 2017 suggested that the rmse values were 14 53 mm and 16 27 mm and the r2 values were 0 87 and 0 96 for hydrus epic model calibration and validation phases respectively based on the soil water subsurface drainage soil salinity grain yield and et simulation results it was concluded that the coupled hydrus epic model was capable of accurate soil water salt and grain yield simulation under subsurface drainage system 3 2 effects of salinity stress on evaporation transpiration and water productivity after calibration and validation the coupled model was adopted to evaluate the effects of salinity stress on evaporation transpiration and water productivity wp in the field experiment irrigation water salinity for s1 and s2 were 0 25 ds m 1 and 6 25 ds m 1 respectively thus the evaporation transpiration and wp for s1 and s2 were regarded as treatments without salinity stress and with salinity stress respectively as shown in table 6 there were little effects of salinity stress on evaporation since the evaporation values with salinity stress were close to the corresponding values without salinity stress nevertheless evaporation values under d2 were around 20 cm higher than the corresponding values under d1 which indicated that the evaporation was more sensitive to drain depth than irrigation water salinity table 6 in addition the evaporation values in the 2017 growing season were higher than the corresponding values in the 2016 growing season this phenomenon could be attributed to the air temperature in 2017 growing season being higher than in 2016 growing season the transpiration values with salinity stress were all lower than without salinity stress for both d1 and d2 treatments during the two growing seasons table 6 these results were similar to the research results reported by wang et al 2017 where the winter wheat et and transpiration values with salinity stresses were 42 5 and 43 2 mm lower than treatments without salinity stresses this result indicated that the transpiration of crops was restrained by salinity stress during the crop growth process montaldo et al 2020 chebbi et al 2018 transpiration accounted for 78 10 and 76 03 for the 80 cm drain depth and 75 87 and 74 85 for the 120 cm drain depth of summer maize et for treatments without salinity stress and with salinity stress in the 2016 growing season respectively similarly the corresponding values were 74 22 and 73 10 for the 80 cm drain depth 75 49 and 73 15 for the 120 cm drain depth of summer maize et in the 2017 growing season respectively a similar result reported by liu et al 2002 indicated that transpiration took up about 70 of winter wheat et in the north china plain the evaporation and transpiration simulation results indicated that the transpiration process being affected by salinity stress was the main factor that changed et during the crop growth seasons aouade et al 2016 graham et al 2016 the water productivity wp ranged from 1 32 kg m 3 1 80 kg m 3 in 2016 and 1 42 kg m 3 1 98 kg m 3 in 2017 where d1s1 and d2s2 obtained the highest and lowest wp values in both growing seasons respectively as shown in table 6 the wp values with salinity stress decreased by 6 52 and 14 90 in 2016 and 4 12 and 11 69 in 2017 compared with the corresponding values without salinity stress in d1 and d2 treatments respectively as discussed above water salinity and drain depth are regarded as the main factors that influenced crop et and yield in the current experiment design and then changed the wp accordingly jiang et al 2012 a previous study reported by feng et al 2017 also indicated that wp was affected by both water salinity and drain depth according to results of variance analysis thus it can be concluded that the performance of treatments with drain depth of 80 cm was better than those with 120 cm drain depth in maintaining soil water and salt contents at suitable levels and increasing crop yield and water productivity nozari et al 2018 ritzema 2016 3 3 long term soil salinity and grain yield simulation a six year 2014 2019 scenario simulation was performed to evaluate the long term impacts of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and grain yield under subsurface drainage system the initial conditions of the long term simulation were the soil water content and ece before summer maize sowing in 2014 the lands were assumed to be uncultivated between maize growing periods in two successive years and the climatic data throughout 2014 2019 were collected and input to the model in the scenario simulation the drain depth was designed to be 80 cm because of its advantages in controlling soil salinity and increasing crop yield as discussed above there were all together seven irrigation salinity gradients namely 0 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 ds m 1 which were simulated with the calibrated and validated hydrus epic model the historical daily air temperature data of the period 2014 2019 years was used as the climatic condition in the coupled model the irrigation regime and other agronomic measures used during field experiment in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons were adopted in the scenario simulation in addition the soil physical properties and crop parameters were assumed to be constant during the simulated years the simulated soil salinity within the root zone at harvest time for the summer maize throughout 2014 2019 are exhibited in fig 11 in general the ece values increased with increasing irrigation water salinity in each simulated year the lowest and highest ece were 1 92 ds m 1 and 4 74 ds m 1 which were both obtained in 2019 with irrigation water salinity of 0 ds m 1 and 12 ds m 1 respectively as shown in fig 11 ece maintained at around 2 5 ds m 1 ecw of 4 ds m 1 throughout the simulated years for other irrigation water salinity values ece decreased when irrigation water salinity was lower than 4 0 ds m 1 and increased when irrigation water salinity was higher than 4 0 ds m 1 during the simulated years this result indicated that ecw of 4 0 ds m 1 might be the threshold value which affected ece under a drain depth of 80 cm in the current scenario simulation furthermore there were significant positive exponential relationships r2 0 96 between soil salinity and irrigation water salinity in each simulated year as list in table 7 the coefficient b in the exponential function increased with simulated year which indicated that the soil salinity in subsequent years would be more severe under long term saline water irrigation the soil salinity within the root zone was usually considered to increase with increasing salinity of irrigation water wang et al 2015 kang et al 2010 but in the present research the soil salinity was found to decrease for water salinity values 4 0 ds m 1 when drain depth was 80 cm in each simulated year fig 11 thus this result leads to the conclusion that saline water irrigation with subsurface drainage can provide sufficient salt leaching effect under appropriate water salinity bahceci et al 2008 meanwhile the increased range of soil salinity with a subsurface drainage system was relatively lower than for saline water irrigation without drainage treatment feng et al 2017 the results of this study can provide guidance for the long term soil salt management under subsurface drainage the summer maize yield under different irrigation water salinity in the simulated years are shown in fig 12 in each simulated year yield of summer maize decreased obviously with the increase of irrigation water salinity the highest and lowest grain yields were obtained in 2019 with values of 8456 kg ha 1 and 6220 kg ha 1 for irrigation water salinity values of 0 ds m 1 and 12 ds m 1 respectively nevertheless summer maize yield decline was smallest for irrigation water salinity of about 4 4 ds m 1 producing a yield of around 7600 kg ha 1 in all simulated years and an ece value within the root zone of about 2 7 ds m 1 as shown in fig 11 as a moderately salt tolerant crop summer maize growth was affected by salinity stress within the root zone which was caused by saline water irrigation mass and grattan 1999 it can be concluded that irrigation water salinity values of 4 4 ds m 1 were the threshold irrigation water salinity values for sustainable soil salinity and grain yield management in long term saline water irrigation for the 80 cm drain depth under the condition of this study similarly exponential relationships between grain yield and irrigation water salinity were also found in each simulated year as shown in table 7 what sets them apart from the relationships between grain yield and soil salinity was the coefficient d in the exponential function which was negative in all simulated years however the absolute values of coefficient d also increased with simulated year which further indicated that long term high concentration saline water irrigation would aggravate the effects of soil water salt environment on crop growth russo and bakker 1987 therefore an appropriate combination of irrigation water salinity and subsurface drain depth are important factors for future long term soil salinity and grain yield management chang et al 2019 qi et al 2011 4 conclusions the hydrus model was coupled with the crop growth module of epic to evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and summer maize yield under subsurface drainage system two year s data collected from lysimeters with summer maize of soil water salt content subsurface drainage amount and concentration grain yield and et was used to calibrate and validate the coupled model model accuracy evaluating parameters and visual inspection suggested good agreement between observed and simulated values based on scenario simulation with the coupled model the effects of salinity stress on evaporation was not found but transpiration and water productivity decreased with increase in water salinity long term use of saline water irrigation indicated that soil salinity increased with increasing water salinity accompanied with grain yield reduction the optimal water salinity range was 4 4 ds m 1 for a drain depth of 80 cm these conditions could keep the soil salinity state at a low level of 2 5 ds m 1 and maintain summer maize yield around 7600 kg ha 1 also significant exponential relationships between soil salinity grain yield and irrigation water salinity in the long term simulation were found in this study the findings of the present study indicated that combining the coupled model with the field experiment served as a great tool for evaluating long term effects of saline water irrigation on soil water salt movement crop growth and water

9865,field experiment combined with numerical simulation is an efficient approach for evaluation the effects of saline water irrigation on soil water salt movement crop growth and water productivity in this study hydrus model was coupled with epic module to evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and grain yield under subsurface drainage condition two years field experiment data collected in lysimeters of summer maize irrigated with water of two different levels of salinity under different subsurface drain depths was used to calibrate and validate the coupled model the coupled model was then adopted to evaluate the effects of salinity stress on evaporation transpiration and water productivity wp and of long term saline water irrigation on soil salinity and grain yield under subsurface drainage results indicated that simulated values of soil water salt content subsurface drainage amount and concentration grain yield and evapotranspiration et were in good agreement with observed values transpiration and wp were reduced by salinity stress while evaporation was sensitive to drain depth soil salinity evidently increased when irrigation water salinity was higher than 4 0 ds m 1 in each simulated year under drain depth of 80 cm grain yield maintained at around 7600 kg ha 1 when water salinity is 4 4 ds m 1 under drain depth of 80 cm and decreased with higher water salinity across all simulated years there were significant exponential relationships between soil salinity grain yield and irrigation water salinity in the long term simulation thus the appropriate irrigation water salinity should be 4 0 4 4 ds m 1 under subsurface drain depth of 80 cm in the present study the combined application of saline water irrigation and subsurface drainage should be given more attention for long term soil salinity and grain yield management in the future keywords saline water irrigation subsurface drainage soil salinity summer maize yield coupled model 1 introduction saline water irrigation without regulatory measures to control soil water salt content may lead to soil salinization and grain yield reduction in farmland with poor drainage cao et al 2016 doorenbos and kassam 1986 given their role in controlling water table depth and reducing soil salinization threat agricultural drainage systems have been widely utilized in water logging prone and saline alkali areas needelman et al 2007 wen et al 2020 recently several problems such as excessive water loss soil salinization and groundwater pollution caused by low quality irrigation water have frequently been reported for open ditch drainage systems singh 2019a 2019b mao et al 2017 negm et al 2017 compared with open ditch drainage systems a subsurface drainage system has more advantages in controlling soil salinity and improving drainage efficiency under saline water irrigation sloan et al 2016 ghumman et al 2010 therefore the impacts of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and crop productivity under subsurface drainage system has been given more attention the design of subsurface drainage systems by field experimentation was usually considered time consuming and uneconomical tao et al 2017 rijal et al 2012 numerical simulation has been regarded as an efficient approach in the quantitative evaluation of soil water salt dynamics under subsurface drainage system maalim and melesse 2013 muma et al 2017 as a hydrologic model hydrus 2d 3d model has been widely adopted in the study of water and solute transport under drained conditions šimůnek et al 2008 ghazouani et al 2016 compared with other models hydrus model has the advantage of providing flexible boundary conditions and great applicability to variable saturated media which is very convenient for the simulation of soil solute transport under subsurface drainage ebrahimian and noory 2015 filipović et al 2014 further researches have suggested that hydrus is also a practical tool for the evaluation of crop growth response to water and salinity stress when coupled with crop growth models sarmah et al 2005 wang and li 2010 wang et al 2014 with the coupled hydrus wofost model zhou et al 2012 predicted crop production and soil water movement during the spring wheat growing season roy et al 2019 coupled hydrus 2d with dssat to simulate 2 3d movement of water heat and multiple solutes however because of its relatively less input data requirement epic module is often the preferred module for evaluating crop growth xu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 over one hundred different crops have been successfully simulated in a unified approach with epic module williams 1995 han et al 2015 used hydrus epic model to evaluate the effects of groundwater table depth on soil water movement and cotton growth wang et al 2015 estimated the effects of sprinkler irrigation on soil water nitrogen movement and winter wheat yield in north china plain utilizing the same coupled model wang et al 2017 assessed the effects of long term use of saline water on grain yield and salt accumulation in north china plain most of the researches focused on the evaluation of soil water solute transport and crop yield under different irrigation methods wu et al 2019 xian et al 2017 while few of them focused on simulating the impact of salinity stress on crop productivity and long term use of saline water on soil salinity and of crop yield under subsurface drainage system sloan et al 2017 the aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of subsurface drainage in saline water irrigated cropland by field experiment and numerical model the coupled hydrus epic model was calibrated and validated using two year s field experiment data the effects of salinity stress on crop yield evapotranspiration and water productivity were then analyzed with the calibrated model finally the effects of long term use of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and crop yield under subsurface drainage was evaluated by scenario simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment area the field experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of efficient irrigation drainage and agricultural soil water environment in nanjing china 118 60 e 31 86 n in the year of 2016 and 2017 this experiment site is dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 15 7 the mean annual precipitation and mean annual evaporation in the past 30 years was 1021 mm and around 2000 mm respectively all together 12 lysimeters with concrete bottom were utilized for crop growth in the experiment site the soil physical properties in the lysimeters including soil particle size percentages soil bulk density and field capacity from 0 to 120 cm are shown in table 1 2 2 experiment design and agronomic measures in this study the specifications of lysimeters were 2 5 m 2 m 3 m length width depth and separated by concrete blocks painted with waterproof material to prevent water seepage the subsurface pipes were embedded in the center of soil profile in each lysimeter before the experiment started the irrigation water was applied by furrow irrigation method with the left and right half furrow designed at soil surface of each lysimeter fig 1 there were two levels of drain depths d1 80 cm and d2 120 cm and two levels of irrigation water salinity gradients s1 0 25 ds m 1 and s2 6 25 ds m 1 in the lysimeter experiment the experiment was split plot designed with three replicates laid out in 12 lysimeters during two growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 summer maize zea mays l was sown in june of 2016 and 2017 with plant rowing and spacing of 40 cm 40 cm in each lysimeter fresh water irrigation amount of 60 mm was applied at sowing and then saline water irrigation was applied after sowing the saline water irrigation amount was divided into supplementary irrigation and leaching irrigation in field experiment the supplementary irrigation water was applied to maintain the soil moisture content in a suitable condition and the leaching irrigation water was applied for salt leaching and subsurface drainage both supplementary irrigation depth and leaching irrigation depth were calculated according to the following equation 1 m 1000 n h θ max θ min where m is the irrigation water depth mm n is the soil porosity in planned wetting layer h is the depth of planned wet soil m which is 0 40 m and 1 20 m for supplementary irrigation and leaching irrigation respectively θ max and θ min are the controlled maximum and minimum soil content respectively according to the calculation results the supplementary irrigation water depth and leaching irrigation water depth were about 40 mm and 120 mm respectively the supplementary irrigation water with total amounts of 160 mm was applied evenly at the 10 62 92 and 100 days after sowing meanwhile the leaching irrigation water with each amounts of 120 mm were applied at tasseling 48 days after sowing and filling 77 days after sowing stages respectively there were all together seven irrigation events with total amounts of 460 mm 60 mm fresh water and 400 mm saline water in each treatment during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the daily air temperature and irrigation amounts during 2016 and 2017 are illustrated in fig 2 in this study ammonium in the equivalent amount of 225 ka ha 1 was applied as base before sowing at a designed rate n p2o5 k2o 28 6 6 moreover urea in the equivalent amount of 300 kg ha 1 was applied at the first irrigation event due to the often occurrence of rainfall during the experiment period a rain shelter was utilized to avoid the impact of heavy rainfall on the experimental results when precipitation occurred 2 3 experiment data collection and monitoring soil samples were obtained from the center of each lysimeter at 20 cm intervals from the soil surface down to a depth of 120 cm the soil sampling interval was 15 days from the summer maize sowing date to harvest date in both 2016 and 2017 additional measurements were also taken before and after each irrigation event gravimetric water content was determined by stoving method observed volumetric water content was then obtained by multiplying the gravimetric water content by soil bulk density electrical conductivity of saturated paste ece was determined from the electrical conductivity of 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 using the equation ece 14 77ec1 5 0 225 feng et al 2017 where ec1 5 was measured with a portable parameter tester sg23 elk ism mettler toledo international inc switzerland subsurface drainage flow was collected in a bucket to determine the amount and concentration of total dissolved salt tds in drainage water when subsurface drainage occurred the tds in this study was also measured with the portable parameter tester mentioned above ten representative plants from each plot were used to determine the yield of maize at the harvest time at the end of the two growing seasons the measurement method of actual evapotranspiration eta and water productivity wp can be found in feng et al 2017 2 4 model description the hydrus model and the crop growth module in epic were coupled in fortran 90 which is based on the microsoft windows system the soil water solute transport and root water absorption process were simulated by hydrus model the output results were then input into the crop growth module of epic to simulate the crop growth process the crop growth data was then fed back into hydrus model to simulate the soil water solute transport and root water absorption in the next data exchange cycle the data exchange time step between hydraulic module and crop growth module was daily 2 4 1 hydrologic module the modified

initial values of soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by the basic soil physical properties according to van genuchten s model van genuchten 1987 the convection dispersion equation cde was used in hydrus model to predict solute transport process the governing equation is given in the following form 5 θ c ρ s t x i θ d i j c x j q i c x i where c is the concentration of soil solution ds m 1 ρ

taking drain depth of 80 cm as example the depth and width of simulated area was determined by 1 20 m and 2 00 m respectively in the simulated area the left and right top furrow in fig 3 were assigned variable head boundary the upper surface of the simulated area was assigned atmospheric boundary the drain pipe in the simulated area was assigned seepage face boundary the bottom side of the simulated area was assigned no flux boundary since there was no water and solute exchange from the concrete bottom side of the lysimeter the remaining left and right sides of the simulated area were both assigned no flux boundary 2 4 2 crop growth module the harvest index was applied to compute crop yield in epic model as followings williams 1995 10 y l d h i b a where yld is the simulated crop

et al 1968 2 5 coupled model calibration and validation the data sets of soil water content subsurface drainage ece and grain yield and evapotranspiration from 2016 and 2017 growing seasons were used to calibrate and validate the coupled model respectively the soil hydraulic parameters such as θ s θ r α n and k s were the main parameters calibrated in the hydrus model the calibrated values of soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters for different soil layers are presented in table 1 the default values of physiological parameters proposed by williams williams 1995 were treated as the initial value in epic model and the calibrated crop parameters are shown in table 2 in the coupled model soil hydraulic parameters in hydrus were calibrated and validated by comparing observed and simulated soil water content subsurface drainage and ece in 2016 and 2017 respectively the observed and simulated values of grain yield and evapotranspiration in 2016 and 2017 were used to calibrate and validate the crop parameters in epic respectively the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the performance of coupled hydrus epic model as follows 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 13 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 14 n s e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of observations o i and pi are observed and simulated values of the i th observation where i 1 to n o and p are the mean observed and simulated values respectively during the model evaluation rmse values close to zero while r2 and nse are close to 1 indicate perfect model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 soil water content soil water contents in the 0 120 cm soil profile for each treatment in 2016 and 2017 crop growing seasons are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the error bars in fig 4 represents the standard errors between observed values for three replicates tests during model calibration period 2016 the soil water contents for different soil layers varied with irrigation events in whole growth period the variations of soil water contents for the upper soil layers were more pronounced than those of deeper soil layers under similar irrigation conditions this could be due to the effects of irrigation and evaporation on upper soil layers being stronger than those for deeper layers in addition for both drain depth of d1 and d2 soil water contents for 80 and 120 cm soil depth were relatively lower than for 0 80 and 0 120 cm soil depth respectively this might be attributed to the soil water at about 80 cm and 120 cm soil layer being effectively excluded resulting in the amount of soil water to the deep layer being reduced meanwhile for the drain depth of 120 cm d2 the variation trends were similar for different soil layers during whole simulation periods in this experiment the deeper drain condition provided more soil layers for water to infiltrate through and enabling water infiltration through the soil layers to be more uniform before the water was removed as shown in fig 5 during validation period 2017 the observed soil water content and simulated data also showed good correlation relationship since both data were distributed near the 1 1 line model accuracy evaluating parameters listed in table 3 also indicated that deviations between observed and simulated values were within an acceptable range for both calibration and validation phases 0 02 cm3 cm 3 rmse 0 03 cm3 cm 3 0 87 nse 0 89 and 0 92 r2 0 94 wang et al 2017 showed the rmse ranged from 0 022 to 0 028 cm3 cm 3 and r2 ranged from 0 56 to 0 60 using the same coupled model the hydrus model had a little underestimated soil water content for the upper soil layers in wang s study resulting in the r2 values in their study ranged from 0 56 to 0 60 wang et al 2017 furthermore the experiments in our study were conducted in condition of shelter from rainfall in lysimeters making the soil moisture more manageable than wang s experiment therefore the prediction accuracy of the model was relatively improved compared with that in wang s study with other coupled models rmse values were in the range of 0 027 0 066 cm3 cm 3 and 0 030 0 054 cm3 cm 3 with root zone water quality model rzwqm model hu et al 2006 and ceres model eitzinger et al 2004 respectively the nse values for soil water modeling were also comparable with similar studies using hydrus coupled model with hydrus epic model wang et al 2015 reported nse of soil water content for 15 100 cm soil layers in the range of 0 71 0 95 and 0 47 0 87 for calibration and validation respectively wang et al 2014 used hydrus chain model to simulate soil water with nse values in the range of 0 971 0 986 therefore the results indicated that the coupled model was capable of accurately simulating soil water content under subsurface drainage system 3 1 2 subsurface drainage the subsurface drainage data sets of 2016 and 2017 were also used for the model calibration and validation respectively as shown in figs 6 and 7 simulated daily drainage values generally represented good match with observed values it should be mentioned that there were also tiny amounts of drainage occurring in supplementary irrigation irrigation amounts of 40 cm in addition to leaching irrigation irrigation amounts of 120 cm in both d1 and d2 treatments the drainage occurred in supplementary irrigation was mainly preferential flow collected from soil crack caused by subsurface pipe installation process for treatments with drain depth of 80 cm d1 seven drainage volume peaks occurred soon after each irrigation event while for treatments d2 there were only three apparent drainage volume peaks which occurred at the 1st 3rd and 5th irrigation events the cumulative simulated drainage amounts for d1 were 75 0 mm and 87 5 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively while for d2 were about 67 0 mm and 73 2 mm respectively table 4 the drainage amounts for d2 were evidently lower than for d1 which was due to the deeper drain condition proving a longer infiltration path for water and leading to more water being stored in the soil profile in d2 in our study the drainage amount for s2 were slightly higher than for s1 this might be because with increasing salt concentration in the soil solution the soil aggregate structure became easier to form and increased the macropore and infiltration characteristic of the soil bi et al 2010 the mean simulated drainage concentrations under s1 were 3 17 g l 1 and 2 53 g l 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively while under s2 were 6 69 g l 1 and 5 93 g l 1 respectively table 4 the drainage concentrations under s2 were significantly higher than the corresponding values under s1 for the same drainage conditions this was also attributed to higher irrigation water salinity increasing the soil macropore and infiltration characteristic leading to more salt ions being leached to deeper soil layers and being discharged in the subsurface drainage the model accuracy evaluating parameters in table 3 suggested that there were strong correlations between observed and simulated drainage amount and drainage concentration in both calibration and validation phases the rmse values were in the range 0 43 0 44 mm 2 61 2 64 mm and 0 30 g l 1 to 0 11 g l 1 for daily drainage cumulative drainage and drainage concentration respectively the corresponding nse values were in the range 0 91 0 94 0 80 0 94 and 0 95 0 96 respectively and the corresponding r2 ranged from 0 95 0 96 0 90 0 91 and 0 92 0 93 respectively recent studies have suggested that hydrus model could evaluate water flow under various drain depths and spaces under different water management practices li et al 2015 ebrahimian and noory 2015 the simulation results of the current study also indicated that the coupled model performed well in modeling subsurface drainage with regard to both drainage amount and drainage water concentration under saline water irrigation 3 1 3 soil salinity the soil salt distribution at the harvest time for different treatments in 2016 growing season are show in fig 8 for drain depth of 80 cm d1 the soil salt distribution were obviously different between s1 and s2 especially in the range of infiltration interface of furrow irrigation for irrigation water salinity of 0 25 ds m 1 s1 soil salt was transported by infiltration flow to deeper soil layer and then drained by the subsurface drainage pipe therefore the soil salt distribution near the furrow was lower than that near subsurface drainage pipe while for irrigation water salinity of 6 25 ds m 1 s2 more soluble salt was brought into the soil profile by irrigation leading the soil salt distribution near the furrow relative higher than other simulated area as showed in fig 8 even under water salnity of 6 25 ds m 1 the soil salt under d1 was still effectively removed for drain depth of 120 cm d2 the soil salt distribution was similar to that for d1 in s1 while for s2 the soil salt can not be drained in time and more salt ion was left in the soil profile during the water infiltration process so the soil salinity in treatment d2s2 was relative higher than in other treatments in general there were remarkable soil salt drainage effects by the subsurface pipe in this study and the soil salt distribution was affected by both irrigation water salinity and subsurface drainage depth similarly the observed and simulated ece values within the root zone for the 2016 growing season were used to calibrate the coupled model as shown in fig 9 the error bars in fig 9 represents the standard errors between observed values for three replicates tests ece values decreased shortly after each irrigation event but the decline ranges under the irrigation amounts of 120 mm were more evident than under other irrigation amounts this phenomenon suggested that larger irrigation amount was effective for soil salt leaching even under high irrigation water salinity furthermore for irrigation water salinity of s2 more soluble salt was brought into the soil profile leading to the ece under s2 to be significantly higher than under s1 for both d1 and d2 treatments under different salinity of irrigation water variation of ece was compared between d1 and d2 treatments similar variation ranges of ece were found in both d1 and d2 treatments and the decline ranges under the irrigation amount of 120 mm were more evident than for other irrigation amounts for irrigation water salinity s1 the decline ranges under the 120 mm irrigation amount were approximated in both d1 and d2 treatments and the mean ece values were 1 91 ds m 1 and 2 05 ds m 1 respectively meanwhile for irrigation water salinity s2 the decline ranges for drain depth d1 were more obvious than for d2 treatment and the mean ece values were 2 79 ds m 1 and 3 25 ds m 1 for d1 and d2 respectively the observed and simulated ece values for 2017 growing season were used to validate the coupled model as shown in fig 10 during validation period the observed soil salinity ece and simulated data also showed good correlation relationship since both data were distributed near the 1 1 line model accuracy evaluating parameters listed in table 3 indicated that deviations between observed and simulated values were within an acceptable range for both calibration and validation periods 0 34 ds m 1 rmse 0 42 ds m 1 0 83 nse 0 85 and 0 87 r2 0 88 with a similar model wang et al 2017 showed the rmse and r2 values for soil salinity ranged from 0 39 g l 1 to 0 61 g l 1 and 0 92 0 93 in calibration and validation period respectively rmse nse and r2 values for soil salinity showed the coupled model was capable of accurately simulating conditions under the subsurface drainage system as reported by xu et al 2013 and ren et al 2016 3 1 4 grain yield and evapotranspiration the crop growth module was evaluated using the simulated and observed grain yields and evapotranspiration et for 2016 and 2017 summer maize yield decreased with increasing water salinity under both d1and d2 drain depths table 5 the yields under s2 decreased by 14 50 and 18 25 in 2016 and 8 13 and 19 33 in 2017 compared with yields under s1 for d1 and d2 treatments respectively it was found that the grain yield reduction degrees were also different between d1 and d2 treatments where the summer maize yield under d1 were significantly higher than under d2 in both growing seasons likewise d1s1 and d2s2 produced the highest and lowest grain yield across all tested treatments in the two growing seasons respectively table 5 owing to the soil salinity within the root zone under d1 treatments being lower than under d2 treatments a more appropriate soil water salt environment was provided for crop growth while taking advantage of saline water irrigation assouline et al 2015 hassanli et al 2016 the et values also decreased with increase in irrigation water salinity in both d1 and d2 treatments table 5 the values under s2 decreased by 8 54 and 3 94 in 2016 and 4 18 and 8 65 in 2017 compared with the corresponding values under s1 for d1 and d2 treatments respectively this result indicated that under the higher irrigation water salinity the soil water storage capacity was reduced and more water infiltrated into deeper soil profile layers and was discharged by the subsurface drainage pipe qian et al 2021 on the contrary the et values under d1 were much lower than those under d2 where the values under d1 were decreased by 6 64 and 11 11 in 2016 and 16 89 and 12 83 in 2017 compared with those under d2 for s1 and s2 treatments respectively since there was less water drained the soil water storage in d2 treatments was higher than in d1 treatments which led to higher values of et in d2 treatments compared to d1 treatments feng et al 2017 therefore the et was also affected by both irrigation water salinity and subsurface drainage depth in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the model evaluation parameters for summer maize yield and et under subsurface drainage are shown in table 3 for grain yield simulation the r2 values between simulated and measured grain yield were 0 97 and 0 92 along with rmse 242 30 kg ha 1 and nse 0 86 for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for et simulation the r2 values were 0 98 and 0 99 while rmse values were lower than 7 97 mm and nse values were higher than 0 86 for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively table 3 the results of the grain yield and et evaluation obtained in this study for summer maize can be compared with those obtained for other crops using the hydrus epic model for grain yield simulation wang et al 2017 reported the rmse values for winter wheat yield were 109 9 kg ha 1 and 188 6 kg ha 1 and the r2 values were 0 93 and 0 80 during the model calibration and validation periods using a different model liang et al 2018 predicted corn yield with rmse values in the range of 289 kg ha 1 to 559 kg ha 1 and nse values in the range of 0 82 0 98 for calibration and validation phases of whcns model for et simulation wang et al 2017 suggested that the rmse values were 14 53 mm and 16 27 mm and the r2 values were 0 87 and 0 96 for hydrus epic model calibration and validation phases respectively based on the soil water subsurface drainage soil salinity grain yield and et simulation results it was concluded that the coupled hydrus epic model was capable of accurate soil water salt and grain yield simulation under subsurface drainage system 3 2 effects of salinity stress on evaporation transpiration and water productivity after calibration and validation the coupled model was adopted to evaluate the effects of salinity stress on evaporation transpiration and water productivity wp in the field experiment irrigation water salinity for s1 and s2 were 0 25 ds m 1 and 6 25 ds m 1 respectively thus the evaporation transpiration and wp for s1 and s2 were regarded as treatments without salinity stress and with salinity stress respectively as shown in table 6 there were little effects of salinity stress on evaporation since the evaporation values with salinity stress were close to the corresponding values without salinity stress nevertheless evaporation values under d2 were around 20 cm higher than the corresponding values under d1 which indicated that the evaporation was more sensitive to drain depth than irrigation water salinity table 6 in addition the evaporation values in the 2017 growing season were higher than the corresponding values in the 2016 growing season this phenomenon could be attributed to the air temperature in 2017 growing season being higher than in 2016 growing season the transpiration values with salinity stress were all lower than without salinity stress for both d1 and d2 treatments during the two growing seasons table 6 these results were similar to the research results reported by wang et al 2017 where the winter wheat et and transpiration values with salinity stresses were 42 5 and 43 2 mm lower than treatments without salinity stresses this result indicated that the transpiration of crops was restrained by salinity stress during the crop growth process montaldo et al 2020 chebbi et al 2018 transpiration accounted for 78 10 and 76 03 for the 80 cm drain depth and 75 87 and 74 85 for the 120 cm drain depth of summer maize et for treatments without salinity stress and with salinity stress in the 2016 growing season respectively similarly the corresponding values were 74 22 and 73 10 for the 80 cm drain depth 75 49 and 73 15 for the 120 cm drain depth of summer maize et in the 2017 growing season respectively a similar result reported by liu et al 2002 indicated that transpiration took up about 70 of winter wheat et in the north china plain the evaporation and transpiration simulation results indicated that the transpiration process being affected by salinity stress was the main factor that changed et during the crop growth seasons aouade et al 2016 graham et al 2016 the water productivity wp ranged from 1 32 kg m 3 1 80 kg m 3 in 2016 and 1 42 kg m 3 1 98 kg m 3 in 2017 where d1s1 and d2s2 obtained the highest and lowest wp values in both growing seasons respectively as shown in table 6 the wp values with salinity stress decreased by 6 52 and 14 90 in 2016 and 4 12 and 11 69 in 2017 compared with the corresponding values without salinity stress in d1 and d2 treatments respectively as discussed above water salinity and drain depth are regarded as the main factors that influenced crop et and yield in the current experiment design and then changed the wp accordingly jiang et al 2012 a previous study reported by feng et al 2017 also indicated that wp was affected by both water salinity and drain depth according to results of variance analysis thus it can be concluded that the performance of treatments with drain depth of 80 cm was better than those with 120 cm drain depth in maintaining soil water and salt contents at suitable levels and increasing crop yield and water productivity nozari et al 2018 ritzema 2016 3 3 long term soil salinity and grain yield simulation a six year 2014 2019 scenario simulation was performed to evaluate the long term impacts of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and grain yield under subsurface drainage system the initial conditions of the long term simulation were the soil water content and ece before summer maize sowing in 2014 the lands were assumed to be uncultivated between maize growing periods in two successive years and the climatic data throughout 2014 2019 were collected and input to the model in the scenario simulation the drain depth was designed to be 80 cm because of its advantages in controlling soil salinity and increasing crop yield as discussed above there were all together seven irrigation salinity gradients namely 0 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 ds m 1 which were simulated with the calibrated and validated hydrus epic model the historical daily air temperature data of the period 2014 2019 years was used as the climatic condition in the coupled model the irrigation regime and other agronomic measures used during field experiment in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons were adopted in the scenario simulation in addition the soil physical properties and crop parameters were assumed to be constant during the simulated years the simulated soil salinity within the root zone at harvest time for the summer maize throughout 2014 2019 are exhibited in fig 11 in general the ece values increased with increasing irrigation water salinity in each simulated year the lowest and highest ece were 1 92 ds m 1 and 4 74 ds m 1 which were both obtained in 2019 with irrigation water salinity of 0 ds m 1 and 12 ds m 1 respectively as shown in fig 11 ece maintained at around 2 5 ds m 1 ecw of 4 ds m 1 throughout the simulated years for other irrigation water salinity values ece decreased when irrigation water salinity was lower than 4 0 ds m 1 and increased when irrigation water salinity was higher than 4 0 ds m 1 during the simulated years this result indicated that ecw of 4 0 ds m 1 might be the threshold value which affected ece under a drain depth of 80 cm in the current scenario simulation furthermore there were significant positive exponential relationships r2 0 96 between soil salinity and irrigation water salinity in each simulated year as list in table 7 the coefficient b in the exponential function increased with simulated year which indicated that the soil salinity in subsequent years would be more severe under long term saline water irrigation the soil salinity within the root zone was usually considered to increase with increasing salinity of irrigation water wang et al 2015 kang et al 2010 but in the present research the soil salinity was found to decrease for water salinity values 4 0 ds m 1 when drain depth was 80 cm in each simulated year fig 11 thus this result leads to the conclusion that saline water irrigation with subsurface drainage can provide sufficient salt leaching effect under appropriate water salinity bahceci et al 2008 meanwhile the increased range of soil salinity with a subsurface drainage system was relatively lower than for saline water irrigation without drainage treatment feng et al 2017 the results of this study can provide guidance for the long term soil salt management under subsurface drainage the summer maize yield under different irrigation water salinity in the simulated years are shown in fig 12 in each simulated year yield of summer maize decreased obviously with the increase of irrigation water salinity the highest and lowest grain yields were obtained in 2019 with values of 8456 kg ha 1 and 6220 kg ha 1 for irrigation water salinity values of 0 ds m 1 and 12 ds m 1 respectively nevertheless summer maize yield decline was smallest for irrigation water salinity of about 4 4 ds m 1 producing a yield of around 7600 kg ha 1 in all simulated years and an ece value within the root zone of about 2 7 ds m 1 as shown in fig 11 as a moderately salt tolerant crop summer maize growth was affected by salinity stress within the root zone which was caused by saline water irrigation mass and grattan 1999 it can be concluded that irrigation water salinity values of 4 4 ds m 1 were the threshold irrigation water salinity values for sustainable soil salinity and grain yield management in long term saline water irrigation for the 80 cm drain depth under the condition of this study similarly exponential relationships between grain yield and irrigation water salinity were also found in each simulated year as shown in table 7 what sets them apart from the relationships between grain yield and soil salinity was the coefficient d in the exponential function which was negative in all simulated years however the absolute values of coefficient d also increased with simulated year which further indicated that long term high concentration saline water irrigation would aggravate the effects of soil water salt environment on crop growth russo and bakker 1987 therefore an appropriate combination of irrigation water salinity and subsurface drain depth are important factors for future long term soil salinity and grain yield management chang et al 2019 qi et al 2011 4 conclusions the hydrus model was coupled with the crop growth module of epic to evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on soil salinity and summer maize yield under subsurface drainage system two year s data collected from lysimeters with summer maize of soil water salt content subsurface drainage amount and concentration grain yield and et was used to calibrate and validate the coupled model model accuracy evaluating parameters and visual inspection suggested good agreement between observed and simulated values based on scenario simulation with the coupled model the effects of salinity stress on evaporation was not found but transpiration and water productivity decreased with increase in water salinity long term use of saline water irrigation indicated that soil salinity increased with increasing water salinity accompanied with grain yield reduction the optimal water salinity range was 4 4 ds m 1 for a drain depth of 80 cm these conditions could keep the soil salinity state at a low level of 2 5 ds m 1 and maintain summer maize yield around 7600 kg ha 1 also significant exponential relationships between soil salinity grain yield and irrigation water salinity in the long term simulation were found in this study the findings of the present study indicated that combining the coupled model with the field experiment served as a great tool for evaluating long term effects of saline water irrigation on soil water salt movement crop growth and water

9866,identifying the factors controlling spatiotemporally varied soil moisture sm is fundamental for water resources management but the combined effects of multiple factors across multiple timescales have been rarely considered the objective of this study is to identify the factor s individually or simultaneously controlling sm in china s loess plateau a region with arid climate experiencing substantial vegetation change because of a revegetation project implemented in 1999 with sm product derived from global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 0a we investigated large scale sm dynamics for surface soil 0 10 cm and root zone 10 250 cm for 1982 2015 and considered environmental factors at the regional scale e g precipitation pcp mean temperature tmp potential evapotranspiration pet normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land use types elevation slope gradient clay fraction and reference bulk density and at the global scale e g el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao spatially the mean sm in both surface and deep layers decreases with a gradient from the southeast to the northwest temporally sm tends to decrease in the southeast while increases in the northwest implying a pattern of wet gets drier dry gets wetter individually pet and enso are the most important regional and global factors controlling sm respectively simultaneously pet pcp and ndvi have combined effects while the global factors exhibit no combined effects the regional and global factors both influence sm at a scale of 8 16 months across the whole study period in addition the effects of regional factors exhibit at the scale of 32 64 months but tend to disappear after 1999 the global factors have smaller impacts than regional factors but they tend to indirectly influence sm through perturbing regional climate the identified factors highlight the complicated changes and controlling factors of sm which provides important information for land use management and water resources management the employed methods are effective in identifying the combined effects of multiple factors and can be extrapolated to other regions keywords multiple wavelet coherence analysis china s loess plateau vegetation change regional environmental factors global atmospheric circulation 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable controlling mass transfer and energy exchange in the ecohydrological processes legates et al 2011 and is essential for plant growth and development of ecoenvironment bowen 2015 wang et al 2018 however sm is spatially and temporally variable and subsequently exerts nonlinear effects on a variety of processes related to soil water balance nutrient cycles climate change and crop production dari et al 2019 scott and biederman 2019 as such investigation of the magnitude and distribution of sm is fundamental for understanding the processes and patterns of hydrological and ecological systems accurate estimation of sm at various spatial and temporal scales is basic for the above studies seneviratne et al 2010 point scale in situ sm measurements help interpret the processes at the monitoring sites but it cannot investigate the spatial variability of sm on regional or even larger scales wu et al 2020 although developing a monitoring network can solve the above issue to some extent it still exists large uncertainties as such it is very important to obtain large scale continuous monitoring data peterson et al 2019 the satellite products and reanalysis data from hydrological models can provide these data such as global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 and european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5 era5 de rosnay et al 2013 with critical evaluation they perform well in analyzing large scale variability of sm related hydrological and ecological processes sm is influenced by multiple environmental factors at the regional and global scale huang and shao 2019 wu et al 2020 the regional environmental factors include soil topography coverage climate and human activities vereecken et al 2014 while the global environmental factors include north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao and el niño southern oscillation enso zhao et al 2020 although the controlling factors of sm have been widely discussed the combined effects of multiple factors across multiple timescales have not been fully discussed biswas and si 2011 x li et al 2019 the wavelet based methods are superior to illustrating the variability of sm and environmental factors across multiple timescales which provides effective methods for this analysis hu and si 2016 yang et al 2021 analyzing sm dynamics and controlling factors is important for regions with changing environment china s loess plateau clp with arid to subhumid climates is well known for the severest soil erosion in the world zhu et al 2018 the large scale grain for green project implemented in 1999 have effectively controlled soil loss feng et al 2017 but the tree plantation has been reported to aggravate water scarcity and lead to soil desiccation hermoso et al 2021 holl and brancalion 2020 under such background it is necessary to understand sm dynamics and controlling factors with point scale sampling previous studies have investigated the variability in sm for a large spatial domain with one sampling campaign at many points or for interannual variability by consistent monitoring at a few points fang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however the long term temporal variability of sm at large spatial scale can hardly be investigated using point scale sampling in addition the combined effects of multiple factors have not been considered the overall objective of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm and its controlling factors across clp from 1982 to 2015 with the gleam sm product we first analyzed the monotonic trend and abrupt change in sm and environmental factors then investigated the controlling factors of sm by partial correlation analysis bivariate and multiple wavelet coherency in particular the environmental factor s individually or simultaneously controlling sm were identified at varying time scales our results will help understand the hydrological processes in soils and further provide information for the management of water resources and vegetation in the regions with complicated natural conditions and intensive anthropogenic activities 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study regions clp 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e covers an area of 640 000 km2 fig 1a the mean annual precipitation and temperature range 100 800 mm and 3 6 14 3 c respectively with continental monsoon climate 55 78 of annual precipitation falls from june to september clp is usually divided into three climate zones according to mean annual precipitation i e arid semiarid and subhumid regions with mean annual precipitation of 250 250 500 and 500 mm respectively huang et al 2015 with the grain for green project implemented in 1999 the land use cover has significantly changed since then fig 1g and the vegetation conditions are quite different between two sub periods i e 1982 1999 and 2000 2015 li et al 2017 in such a large region the environmental factors including topographical and soil factors vary greatly in space the elevations spatially vary with a range of 11 5216 m high in the northwest and low in the southeast fig 1c the areas with an elevation of 800 m 800 1200 m 1200 1600 m 1600 2000 m 2000 2500 m and 2500 m account for 10 28 37 13 7 and 6 of the total area respectively the slopes range from 0 to 83 fig 1d 15 and 25 were used as critical slopes to return farmland in the revegetation project and the areas with slopes of 15 15 25 and 25 account for 67 21 and 12 of the total area respectively accordingly most regions have elevations of 800 1600 m and slopes of 15 the clay fraction and reference bulk density of soils have obvious regional differences with ranges of 0 56 and 0 1 74 kg dm 3 respectively but high in the southeast and low in the northwest fig 1e f the regions with clay fraction of 18 18 32 and 32 account for 33 33 66 62 and 1 5 of the total area for topsoil subsoil respectively the regions with reference bulk density of 1 47 1 47 1 74 and 1 74 kg dm 3 account for 54 69 35 19 and 11 12 of the total area for topsoil subsoil respectively accordingly most regions have reference bulk densities of 1 47 kg dm 3 and clay fractions of 18 32 2 2 datasets to clarify the sm dynamics and controlling factors the collected datasets include sm regional and global environmental factors we collected daily monthly and yearly sm from the gleam for 1982 2015 then we considered regional environmental factors include climate vegetation topography and soil specifically we obtained precipitation pcp mean temperature tmp potential evapotranspiration pet ndvi land use types elevation slope clay fraction and reference bulk density considering the large scale atmospheric circulation over the study area we selected four global environmental factors including nao ao pdo and enso 2 2 1 soil moisture the sm of surface smsurf 0 10 cm and root zone smroot 10 250 cm were retrieved from the gleam with a spatial resolution of 0 25 derived from different satellite images further the reliability of sm data has been validated by in situ sm in the clp ye et al 2019 see supplementary material text s1 and fig s1 2 2 2 environmental factors for regional environmental factors the daily pcp and tmp were collected from 80 weather stations for 1982 2015 fig 1b from china meteorological administration the corresponding pet was calculated by the hargreaves equation hargreaves 1994 the ndvi data with a temporal resolution of 15 days and a spatial resolution of 1 12 were obtained from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies group three land use maps were obtained to interpret the spatial variation in land use including map of 1986 generated from landsat4 tm images and maps of 2000 and 2010 generated from landsat5 tm images the soil data from the harmonious world soil database constructed in vienna the clay fraction and reference bulk density of topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm will be used to analyze the effects of soil properties on sm the global digital elevation model with a resolution of 30 m data were used to calculate the topographic factors including elevation and slope gradient then four factors of enso pdo nao and ao were selected to represent the global environmental factors all the above standardized indices from the earth system research laboratory 2 3 methods to investigate the monotonic trend linear regression was conducted for each pixel point to obtain the change rate and significance of sm and environmental factors including pet ndvi pcp and tmp we determined the years occurring abrupt change for sm and environmental factors by the pettitt analysis pettitt 1979 the above tests were conducted at the significance level of p 0 05 to identify the factors influencing sm we conducted a two step correlation analysis we first carried out correlation analysis to show the overall importance of each factor and then conducted bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence analysis to identify the individual or multiple factors s dominating sm across multiple timescales torrence and compo 1998 the detailed procedure for this analysis can be found in yang et al 2021 both bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence were assessed by the mean coherence coefficient wtc mwc and the percent area of significant coherence pasc hu and si 2016 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variability of sm from 1982 to 2015 the mean annual sm in both surface soil and root zone increased with an obvious gradient from the northwest to the southeast fig s2 sm was higher in surface soil compared to the root zone with an average of 0 24 0 05 and 0 22 0 05 m3 m 3 respectively the mean annual sm fluctuated with detected abrupt changes during 1982 2015 fig 2a b for the whole plateau smsurf had no mutation while smroot had a significant abrupt change in 1998 for regions with different climates smsurf smroot had a significant abrupt change in 1990 1990 1989 1998 and 1996 1996 in arid semiarid and subhumid regions respectively fig 2a b as sm in most regions abruptly changed in the later 1990 s which are very close to 1999 when the large scale revegetation project was launched it may suggest the impacts of vegetation change it is thus reasonable to use 1999 as a critical point to separate the whole study period into two subperiods we further presented the spatial patterns of monotonic trends in sm fig 3 overall the soil in the arid and semiarid regions was getting wetter while it became drier in the subhumid region the percentages of pixels with negative trends increased from 65 during 1982 1999 to 85 during 2000 2015 the drying rates in the subhumid region were respectively 1 14 10 3 and 1 25 10 3 m3 m 3 yr 1 in the surface soil and root zone p 0 05 fig 3 table s1 and the drying rates during 1982 1999 were greater than those during 2000 2015 table s1 but for the wetting rates the arid region had greater values during 1982 1999 while the semiarid region had greater values during 2000 2015 the results may suggest the dominant factors influencing sm vary with the combined effects of climate and vegetation for the effects of vegetation sm under cropland and forestland were compared sm in both surface soil and root zone under forestland was decreasing during 2000 2015 0 25 0 23 0 04 m3 m 3 relative to 1982 1999 0 26 0 24 0 05 m3 m 3 while those under cropland remained unchanged 0 25 0 23 0 05 m3m 3 fig s3 over the whole study period 1982 2015 the drying rates were 0 28 10 3 0 64 10 3 and 0 40 10 3 0 69 10 3 m3 m 3 yr 1 in the surface soil root zone p 0 05 under cropland and forestland respectively fig 4 table s1 the percentages of pixels with negative trends of smroot under forestland 48 were larger than those under cropland 17 during 2000 2015 fig 4 3 2 variability of environmental factors the mean annual values of regional environmental factors exhibited similar spatial patterns with an increasing gradient from the arid to subhumid areas fig s4 the mean annual ndvi significantly increased during 1982 2015 especially from 2000 to 2015 fig 2d while pcp tmp and pet had more fluctuant interannual variations fig 2 the pettitt test showed that pet ndvi pcp and tmp had a significant abrupt change in 1993 1996 1990 1996 and 2005 2001 in clp and different climate zones respectively fig 2 the regional environmental factors tended to increase during 1982 2015 accounting for 60 100 99 and 90 of the whole plateau for pcp tmp pet and ndvi respectively fig 5 table s1 for the subperiods the change trend may be different from the whole study period in specific pcp tended to decrease during 1982 1999 with average rates of 9 72 1 11 and 12 54 2 00 mm year 1 p 0 05 in arid and semiarid regions while pet tended to decrease during 2000 2015 with average rates of 2 89 1 74 and 3 64 0 19 mm year 1 p 0 05 in semiarid and subhumid regions table s1 the vegetation coverage ndvi overall increased significantly fig 5 table s1 however the areas of different land use types had varying change trends table 1 in general the areas of deep rooted plants in forestland increased by 2 31 103 km2 while those of shallow rooted plants in cropland and grassland decreased by 3 65 and 0 37 103 km2 during 1986 2010 respectively further the increase in deep rooted plants occurred in the whole plateau and different climate zones the areas of cropland increased in arid region but decreased in semiarid and subhumid regions while the areas of grassland had change trend opposite to cropland table 1 the global environmental factors exhibit different phases with varying durations fig 6 nao and ao have similar variability in phases fig 6a b which corresponds with tmp changes fig 2f pdo has the longest phase interval for 5 10 years which exhibits positive and negative phases before and after 1999 respectively fig 6c enso has similar variability in phases with pdo while changes more frequently than pdo fig 6d further the phase change of pdo and enso correspond with pcp changes fig 2e 3 3 correlation between sm and environmental factors connecting the spatial patterns of sm with those of soil and topographic factors the regions with higher sm had higher clay contents fig 1e smaller reference bulk density fig 1f lower elevation fig 1c and greater slope gradient fig 1d but the correlation analysis suggested that sm had insignificant relationships with soil properties or topographical factors table 2 meanwhile the partial correlation coefficients between sm and regional climate and vegetation factors varied with periods and climate zones fig 7 for global atmospheric factors the effects of pdo and enso were significantly higher than nao and ao table 2 further enso had a significant positive correlation with sm but pdo was only significantly positively correlated with smroot table 2 the significant correlation between regional environmental factors and sm p 0 05 during 1982 2015 was mainly distributed in semiarid and subhumid regions fig 7a1 b1 c1 and d1 specifically the regions with significant smsurf ndvi correlation were larger than those for smroot ndvi during 1982 2015 fig 7d1 suggesting that smsurf was more sensitive to ndvi than smroot further the area percentages with significant positive partial correlation coefficients between sm and regional environmental factors were 1 13 for sm pcp 1 27 for sm pet and 1 13 for sm ndvi while that with negative correlation was 5 34 for sm tmp p 0 1 table s2 3 4 wavelet coherence between sm and environmental factors the relationship between single or multi factors s on sm across multiple timescales was further investigated based on bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence table 3 fig 8 the values of wavelet coherence and pasc all suggested the dominant effects of regional environmental factors on sm rather than global environmental factors table 3 specifically wtc mwc2 and mwc3 of regional environmental factors were 0 80 0 86 0 92 0 94 and 0 97 while the values of global environmental factors were 0 78 0 83 0 91 0 94 and 0 97 0 98 respectively table 3 however it should be noted that not each added factor explain more variations in sm since the pasc values did not significantly increase for each case the dominant single and combined regional environmental factor s influencing sm were pet wtc 0 86 pasc 33 34 pet pcp mwc2 0 93 pasc 39 pet ndvi mwc2 0 93 0 94 pasc 39 and pet pcp ndvi mwc3 0 97 pasc 49 pet was correlated to sm positively at the scale of 8 16 months almost all 1982 2015 32 64 months 1982 2008 and 64 128 months 1982 2005 fig 8b1 2 compared with the single factor the pet ndvi with sm and pet pcp with smsurf added a new period of 128 months for 1982 2005 fig 8c1 2 and 1990 2005 respectively further pet pcp ndvi added a period of 32 64 months for smroot 2007 2015 fig 8d2 the corresponding global environmental factors were enso wtc 0 82 0 83 pasc 24 25 which had a continuous period of 128 months and an intermittent period of 12 months 1982 2015 respectively fig 8a1 2 4 discussion 4 1 role of vegetation in soil moisture variability because of the revegetation project implemented in 1999 clp has been experiencing land use changes with overall tendency of increasing forestland but decreasing cropland and grassland 1986 2010 fig 1g table 1 the land use changes have potential to exert strong but variable influence on hydrology since different land use types have contrasting effects on sm variability zhang et al 2020 specifically compared with the shallow rooted plants in cropland or grassland those deep rooted plants in forestland transpire more sm in deep soils h j li et al 2019 and result in more water loss from rainfall interception zhang et al 2021 however the runoff and deep percolation is usually smaller in forestland relative to cropland and grassland b li et al 2019 the above vegetation change appears to have great impacts on the spatial and temporal patterns of sm spatially sm is lower in the subhumid regions with forestland areas larger than other climate zones in clp figs s2 and 3 however the negative relationship between sm and forestland area is not detected in the arid and semiarid zones where forestland has increased table 1 the variable hydrological effects of forestland may suggest different dominant factors of sm for different climate zones the subhumid region has more water inputs from precipitation but decreasing sm which suggests the dominance of forestland on sm feng et al 2016 mendham et al 2011 the more severe drought in the arid and semiarid regions restricts vegetation growth to reduce the effects of forestland on sm but highlights the dominance of climate on sm b b li et al 2021 b li et al 2021 the above results highlight the simultaneous effects of multiple factors on sm under different climate zones which emphasizes the difficulty in water resources management temporally sm is gradually decreasing with increasing forestland table 1 fig 3 the difference of sm between 1982 1999 and 2000 2015 suggested that the revegetation project has led to larger areas with decreasing sm fig s2 the dynamic changes in sm concurrent with the progressive revegetation may show the accumulative effect of forest plantations the deep rooted plants in forestland are developing their root system gradually with increasing stand ages and subsequently chronically depleting sm because of strong water uptake huang et al 2021 kou et al 2016 previous studies have detected the significant positive correlation between sm deficit and stand ages of deep rooted plants b li et al 2019 h li et al 2021 as such the selection of appropriate plant species for the revegetation project have been paid great attention cao et al 2018 gutierrez lopez et al 2021 but is still a big issue to be solved 4 2 how does sm respond to climate change the global atmospheric circulation can affect regional water cycle allen and ingram 2002 sun et al 2020 in this study the regional environmental factors outperform global factors in influencing sm tables 2 and 3 the wavelet analysis of global and regional factors table 4 showed that enso had the greatest impacts on regional environment huang et al 2013 yang et al 2021 in consequence enso can indirectly influence sm by perturbing local climate and vegetation for regional environmental factors pet ndvi pcp and tmp had significant upward trend which may combine to lead to the downward trends in sm during 1982 2015 p 0 05 fig 2 the increased pet ndvi and tmp suggest higher potential for evapotranspiration since they overall have positive relationship with evapotranspiration which may lead to decreased sm condon et al 2020 feng et al 2020 however the increased pcp may further complicate the change in sm depending on the differences between water inputs from pcp and water outputs from evapotranspiration in this study the correlation analysis showed that sm is mostly related to pet figs 7 and 8 tables s2 and 3 which may highlight the dominance of water outputs on sm ge et al 2020 isabelle et al 2020 with increasing pcp the sm deficit from even larger water outputs suggest more attention should be paid on the sustainability of vegetation and water resources on clp 4 3 implications to sustainable water management comparing with 1982 1999 the increase in forestland during 2000 2015 tended to lead to a decrease in sm and the spatial extent of decrease in smroot was larger than that of smsurf under forestland fig 4 the changes in sm under forestland were quite different from those under cropland which highlights the hydrological effects of deep rooted plants wang et al 2021 as the decrease in sm can further perturb the whole water cycle it is important to consider the hydrological effects of ecological restoration in such a region with limited water resources holl and brancalion 2020 liu et al 2020 how and where should the afforestation be conducted in the future it is a very important scientific question which should be largely discussed strassburg et al 2020 in addition the spatiotemporal variability of sm is related to that of regional and global climate matyas and sun 2014 for example the global scale atmospheric pattern tended to indirectly influence sm table 4 while the regional climate is influencing sm by perturbing et fig 8 table 3 therefore the trend in climate change should be considered to formulate the strategy of ecological restoration 5 conclusions with changing climate and vegetation it is crucial to identify the factor s individually or simultaneously controlling sm in the loess plateau for water resources management we thus employed satellite sm data and multiple wavelet coherence analysis for this issue with warmer and wetter climate as well as significant surface greening in the past several decades the sm tended to decrease in the southeast while increase in the northwest the spatially varied sm change highlight the variable dominant factors for sm further pet and enso are the individual regional and global factors dominating sm respectively pet pcp and ndvi have combined effects while the global factors exhibit no combined effects for the effects of environmental factors on sm either for individual or multiple factors the water loss enhanced by the increased deep rooted plants appeared to be responsible for the regions with sm deficit further the interactions between sm and regional or global environmental factors vary with temporal scales the above analysis gives detailed information for sm variability and the

9866,identifying the factors controlling spatiotemporally varied soil moisture sm is fundamental for water resources management but the combined effects of multiple factors across multiple timescales have been rarely considered the objective of this study is to identify the factor s individually or simultaneously controlling sm in china s loess plateau a region with arid climate experiencing substantial vegetation change because of a revegetation project implemented in 1999 with sm product derived from global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 0a we investigated large scale sm dynamics for surface soil 0 10 cm and root zone 10 250 cm for 1982 2015 and considered environmental factors at the regional scale e g precipitation pcp mean temperature tmp potential evapotranspiration pet normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land use types elevation slope gradient clay fraction and reference bulk density and at the global scale e g el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao spatially the mean sm in both surface and deep layers decreases with a gradient from the southeast to the northwest temporally sm tends to decrease in the southeast while increases in the northwest implying a pattern of wet gets drier dry gets wetter individually pet and enso are the most important regional and global factors controlling sm respectively simultaneously pet pcp and ndvi have combined effects while the global factors exhibit no combined effects the regional and global factors both influence sm at a scale of 8 16 months across the whole study period in addition the effects of regional factors exhibit at the scale of 32 64 months but tend to disappear after 1999 the global factors have smaller impacts than regional factors but they tend to indirectly influence sm through perturbing regional climate the identified factors highlight the complicated changes and controlling factors of sm which provides important information for land use management and water resources management the employed methods are effective in identifying the combined effects of multiple factors and can be extrapolated to other regions keywords multiple wavelet coherence analysis china s loess plateau vegetation change regional environmental factors global atmospheric circulation 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable controlling mass transfer and energy exchange in the ecohydrological processes legates et al 2011 and is essential for plant growth and development of ecoenvironment bowen 2015 wang et al 2018 however sm is spatially and temporally variable and subsequently exerts nonlinear effects on a variety of processes related to soil water balance nutrient cycles climate change and crop production dari et al 2019 scott and biederman 2019 as such investigation of the magnitude and distribution of sm is fundamental for understanding the processes and patterns of hydrological and ecological systems accurate estimation of sm at various spatial and temporal scales is basic for the above studies seneviratne et al 2010 point scale in situ sm measurements help interpret the processes at the monitoring sites but it cannot investigate the spatial variability of sm on regional or even larger scales wu et al 2020 although developing a monitoring network can solve the above issue to some extent it still exists large uncertainties as such it is very important to obtain large scale continuous monitoring data peterson et al 2019 the satellite products and reanalysis data from hydrological models can provide these data such as global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 and european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5 era5 de rosnay et al 2013 with critical evaluation they perform well in analyzing large scale variability of sm related hydrological and ecological processes sm is influenced by multiple environmental factors at the regional and global scale huang and shao 2019 wu et al 2020 the regional environmental factors include soil topography coverage climate and human activities vereecken et al 2014 while the global environmental factors include north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao and el niño southern oscillation enso zhao et al 2020 although the controlling factors of sm have been widely discussed the combined effects of multiple factors across multiple timescales have not been fully discussed biswas and si 2011 x li et al 2019 the wavelet based methods are superior to illustrating the variability of sm and environmental factors across multiple timescales which provides effective methods for this analysis hu and si 2016 yang et al 2021 analyzing sm dynamics and controlling factors is important for regions with changing environment china s loess plateau clp with arid to subhumid climates is well known for the severest soil erosion in the world zhu et al 2018 the large scale grain for green project implemented in 1999 have effectively controlled soil loss feng et al 2017 but the tree plantation has been reported to aggravate water scarcity and lead to soil desiccation hermoso et al 2021 holl and brancalion 2020 under such background it is necessary to understand sm dynamics and controlling factors with point scale sampling previous studies have investigated the variability in sm for a large spatial domain with one sampling campaign at many points or for interannual variability by consistent monitoring at a few points fang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however the long term temporal variability of sm at large spatial scale can hardly be investigated using point scale sampling in addition the combined effects of multiple factors have not been considered the overall objective of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm and its controlling factors across clp from 1982 to 2015 with the gleam sm product we first analyzed the monotonic trend and abrupt change in sm and environmental factors then investigated the controlling factors of sm by partial correlation analysis bivariate and multiple wavelet coherency in particular the environmental factor s individually or simultaneously controlling sm were identified at varying time scales our results will help understand the hydrological processes in soils and further provide information for the management of water resources and vegetation in the regions with complicated natural conditions and intensive anthropogenic activities 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study regions clp 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e covers an area of 640 000 km2 fig 1a the mean annual precipitation and temperature range 100 800 mm and 3 6 14 3 c respectively with continental monsoon climate 55 78 of annual precipitation falls from june to september clp is usually divided into three climate zones according to mean annual precipitation i e arid semiarid and subhumid regions with mean annual precipitation of 250 250 500 and 500 mm respectively huang et al 2015 with the grain for green project implemented in 1999 the land use cover has significantly changed since then fig 1g and the vegetation conditions are quite different between two sub periods i e 1982 1999 and 2000 2015 li et al 2017 in such a large region the environmental factors including topographical and soil factors vary greatly in space the elevations spatially vary with a range of 11 5216 m high in the northwest and low in the southeast fig 1c the areas with an elevation of 800 m 800 1200 m 1200 1600 m 1600 2000 m 2000 2500 m and 2500 m account for 10 28 37 13 7 and 6 of the total area respectively the slopes range from 0 to 83 fig 1d 15 and 25 were used as critical slopes to return farmland in the revegetation project and the areas with slopes of 15 15 25 and 25 account for 67 21 and 12 of the total area respectively accordingly most regions have elevations of 800 1600 m and slopes of 15 the clay fraction and reference bulk density of soils have obvious regional differences with ranges of 0 56 and 0 1 74 kg dm 3 respectively but high in the southeast and low in the northwest fig 1e f the regions with clay fraction of 18 18 32 and 32 account for 33 33 66 62 and 1 5 of the total area for topsoil subsoil respectively the regions with reference bulk density of 1 47 1 47 1 74 and 1 74 kg dm 3 account for 54 69 35 19 and 11 12 of the total area for topsoil subsoil respectively accordingly most regions have reference bulk densities of 1 47 kg dm 3 and clay fractions of 18 32 2 2 datasets to clarify the sm dynamics and controlling factors the collected datasets include sm regional and global environmental factors we collected daily monthly and yearly sm from the gleam for 1982 2015 then we considered regional environmental factors include climate vegetation topography and soil specifically we obtained precipitation pcp mean temperature tmp potential evapotranspiration pet ndvi land use types elevation slope clay fraction and reference bulk density considering the large scale atmospheric circulation over the study area we selected four global environmental factors including nao ao pdo and enso 2 2 1 soil moisture the sm of surface smsurf 0 10 cm and root zone smroot 10 250 cm were retrieved from the gleam with a spatial resolution of 0 25 derived from different satellite images further the reliability of sm data has been validated by in situ sm in the clp ye et al 2019 see supplementary material text s1 and fig s1 2 2 2 environmental factors for regional environmental factors the daily pcp and tmp were collected from 80 weather stations for 1982 2015 fig 1b from china meteorological administration the corresponding pet was calculated by the hargreaves equation hargreaves 1994 the ndvi data with a temporal resolution of 15 days and a spatial resolution of 1 12 were obtained from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies group three land use maps were obtained to interpret the spatial variation in land use including map of 1986 generated from landsat4 tm images and maps of 2000 and 2010 generated from landsat5 tm images the soil data from the harmonious world soil database constructed in vienna the clay fraction and reference bulk density of topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm will be used to analyze the effects of soil properties on sm the global digital elevation model with a resolution of 30 m data were used to calculate the topographic factors including elevation and slope gradient then four factors of enso pdo nao and ao were selected to represent the global environmental factors all the above standardized indices from the earth system research laboratory 2 3 methods to investigate the monotonic trend linear regression was conducted for each pixel point to obtain the change rate and significance of sm and environmental factors including pet ndvi pcp and tmp we determined the years occurring abrupt change for sm and environmental factors by the pettitt analysis pettitt 1979 the above tests were conducted at the significance level of p 0 05 to identify the factors influencing sm we conducted a two step correlation analysis we first carried out correlation analysis to show the overall importance of each factor and then conducted bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence analysis to identify the individual or multiple factors s dominating sm across multiple timescales torrence and compo 1998 the detailed procedure for this analysis can be found in yang et al 2021 both bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence were assessed by the mean coherence coefficient wtc mwc and the percent area of significant coherence pasc hu and si 2016 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variability of sm from 1982 to 2015 the mean annual sm in both surface soil and root zone increased with an obvious gradient from the northwest to the southeast fig s2 sm was higher in surface soil compared to the root zone with an average of 0 24 0 05 and 0 22 0 05 m3 m 3 respectively the mean annual sm fluctuated with detected abrupt changes during 1982 2015 fig 2a b for the whole plateau smsurf had no mutation while smroot had a significant abrupt change in 1998 for regions with different climates smsurf smroot had a significant abrupt change in 1990 1990 1989 1998 and 1996 1996 in arid semiarid and subhumid regions respectively fig 2a b as sm in most regions abruptly changed in the later 1990 s which are very close to 1999 when the large scale revegetation project was launched it may suggest the impacts of vegetation change it is thus reasonable to use 1999 as a critical point to separate the whole study period into two subperiods we further presented the spatial patterns of monotonic trends in sm fig 3 overall the soil in the arid and semiarid regions was getting wetter while it became drier in the subhumid region the percentages of pixels with negative trends increased from 65 during 1982 1999 to 85 during 2000 2015 the drying rates in the subhumid region were respectively 1 14 10 3 and 1 25 10 3 m3 m 3 yr 1 in the surface soil and root zone p 0 05 fig 3 table s1 and the drying rates during 1982 1999 were greater than those during 2000 2015 table s1 but for the wetting rates the arid region had greater values during 1982 1999 while the semiarid region had greater values during 2000 2015 the results may suggest the dominant factors influencing sm vary with the combined effects of climate and vegetation for the effects of vegetation sm under cropland and forestland were compared sm in both surface soil and root zone under forestland was decreasing during 2000 2015 0 25 0 23 0 04 m3 m 3 relative to 1982 1999 0 26 0 24 0 05 m3 m 3 while those under cropland remained unchanged 0 25 0 23 0 05 m3m 3 fig s3 over the whole study period 1982 2015 the drying rates were 0 28 10 3 0 64 10 3 and 0 40 10 3 0 69 10 3 m3 m 3 yr 1 in the surface soil root zone p 0 05 under cropland and forestland respectively fig 4 table s1 the percentages of pixels with negative trends of smroot under forestland 48 were larger than those under cropland 17 during 2000 2015 fig 4 3 2 variability of environmental factors the mean annual values of regional environmental factors exhibited similar spatial patterns with an increasing gradient from the arid to subhumid areas fig s4 the mean annual ndvi significantly increased during 1982 2015 especially from 2000 to 2015 fig 2d while pcp tmp and pet had more fluctuant interannual variations fig 2 the pettitt test showed that pet ndvi pcp and tmp had a significant abrupt change in 1993 1996 1990 1996 and 2005 2001 in clp and different climate zones respectively fig 2 the regional environmental factors tended to increase during 1982 2015 accounting for 60 100 99 and 90 of the whole plateau for pcp tmp pet and ndvi respectively fig 5 table s1 for the subperiods the change trend may be different from the whole study period in specific pcp tended to decrease during 1982 1999 with average rates of 9 72 1 11 and 12 54 2 00 mm year 1 p 0 05 in arid and semiarid regions while pet tended to decrease during 2000 2015 with average rates of 2 89 1 74 and 3 64 0 19 mm year 1 p 0 05 in semiarid and subhumid regions table s1 the vegetation coverage ndvi overall increased significantly fig 5 table s1 however the areas of different land use types had varying change trends table 1 in general the areas of deep rooted plants in forestland increased by 2 31 103 km2 while those of shallow rooted plants in cropland and grassland decreased by 3 65 and 0 37 103 km2 during 1986 2010 respectively further the increase in deep rooted plants occurred in the whole plateau and different climate zones the areas of cropland increased in arid region but decreased in semiarid and subhumid regions while the areas of grassland had change trend opposite to cropland table 1 the global environmental factors exhibit different phases with varying durations fig 6 nao and ao have similar variability in phases fig 6a b which corresponds with tmp changes fig 2f pdo has the longest phase interval for 5 10 years which exhibits positive and negative phases before and after 1999 respectively fig 6c enso has similar variability in phases with pdo while changes more frequently than pdo fig 6d further the phase change of pdo and enso correspond with pcp changes fig 2e 3 3 correlation between sm and environmental factors connecting the spatial patterns of sm with those of soil and topographic factors the regions with higher sm had higher clay contents fig 1e smaller reference bulk density fig 1f lower elevation fig 1c and greater slope gradient fig 1d but the correlation analysis suggested that sm had insignificant relationships with soil properties or topographical factors table 2 meanwhile the partial correlation coefficients between sm and regional climate and vegetation factors varied with periods and climate zones fig 7 for global atmospheric factors the effects of pdo and enso were significantly higher than nao and ao table 2 further enso had a significant positive correlation with sm but pdo was only significantly positively correlated with smroot table 2 the significant correlation between regional environmental factors and sm p 0 05 during 1982 2015 was mainly distributed in semiarid and subhumid regions fig 7a1 b1 c1 and d1 specifically the regions with significant smsurf ndvi correlation were larger than those for smroot ndvi during 1982 2015 fig 7d1 suggesting that smsurf was more sensitive to ndvi than smroot further the area percentages with significant positive partial correlation coefficients between sm and regional environmental factors were 1 13 for sm pcp 1 27 for sm pet and 1 13 for sm ndvi while that with negative correlation was 5 34 for sm tmp p 0 1 table s2 3 4 wavelet coherence between sm and environmental factors the relationship between single or multi factors s on sm across multiple timescales was further investigated based on bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence table 3 fig 8 the values of wavelet coherence and pasc all suggested the dominant effects of regional environmental factors on sm rather than global environmental factors table 3 specifically wtc mwc2 and mwc3 of regional environmental factors were 0 80 0 86 0 92 0 94 and 0 97 while the values of global environmental factors were 0 78 0 83 0 91 0 94 and 0 97 0 98 respectively table 3 however it should be noted that not each added factor explain more variations in sm since the pasc values did not significantly increase for each case the dominant single and combined regional environmental factor s influencing sm were pet wtc 0 86 pasc 33 34 pet pcp mwc2 0 93 pasc 39 pet ndvi mwc2 0 93 0 94 pasc 39 and pet pcp ndvi mwc3 0 97 pasc 49 pet was correlated to sm positively at the scale of 8 16 months almost all 1982 2015 32 64 months 1982 2008 and 64 128 months 1982 2005 fig 8b1 2 compared with the single factor the pet ndvi with sm and pet pcp with smsurf added a new period of 128 months for 1982 2005 fig 8c1 2 and 1990 2005 respectively further pet pcp ndvi added a period of 32 64 months for smroot 2007 2015 fig 8d2 the corresponding global environmental factors were enso wtc 0 82 0 83 pasc 24 25 which had a continuous period of 128 months and an intermittent period of 12 months 1982 2015 respectively fig 8a1 2 4 discussion 4 1 role of vegetation in soil moisture variability because of the revegetation project implemented in 1999 clp has been experiencing land use changes with overall

9867,to explain the impact of agricultural policy on the relationship between water supply and demand in the irrigation district the cointegration theory with structural breaks is introduced in this study the results show that the structural breaks caused by the agricultural policy on the relationship between water supply and demand occur in 1981 and 1989 moreover water supply and demand have the long run cointegration equilibrium and short run dynamic changes with or without structural breaks error correction models with or without structural breaks are established but three error correction models with structural breaks present higher simulation accuracy than the error correction model without structural breaks especially for the model 3 it has the largest goodness of fit of about 0 91 and its relative error less than 5 occupies for 46 51 there are still some limitations in this study if groundwater and other factors are taken into consideration in the calculation of irrigation water and the changes of the crop coefficient k c value in different periods are considered in the calculation of crop water requirement the results will be more accurate keywords cointegration relationship error correction model water supply and demand structural breaks irrigation district 1 introduction precipitation p irrigation water ir and crop water requirement et c represent water supply and demand in the irrigation district and they are also the main influencing factors on the water safety affected by meteorological hydrological crop planting structure agricultural management conditions etc precipitation irrigation water and et c are three uncertain variables with some relations in order to improve irrigation activities and agricultural development scholars have studied the influencing mechanism between precipitation irrigation water and et c chung 2013 assefa et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017c chiraz et al 2014 as the global warming the hydrological cycle process strengthens which results in the higher frequency and intensity of extreme events such as high temperature and drought global climate changes not only change the total amount and temporal spatial distribution of water resources but also increase the evapotranspiration of the farmland which maybe further aggravate the contradiction of agricultural water supply and demand in practice irrigation water is mainly determined by precipitation and et c precipitation irrigation water and et c will have great changes with the modern changing environment for recent years the changing characteristics and relations between them have been researched with statistical method jiang et al 2018a surendran et al 2015 woznicki et al 2015 zhang et al 2014b or mathematical modeling jiang et al 2019 mo et al 2004 zhang et al 2014a zhao et al 2015 however the previously studies had assumed that the hydrologic time series are stationary which may not be the case for the better explain the relations of hydrological variables the cointegration theory in econometric is introduced in the hydrology and water resources field to overcome this shortcoming song et al 2008 zaman et al 2011 jiang et al 2018b granda et al 2008 musolesi et al 2011 because cointegration theory combines the model s short run fluctuations in the traditional time series method with the model s long run equilibrium relationship in econometric which provides an effective theoretical method for non stationary time series analysis cointegration theory is suitable to analyze the long run relationship between variables and a non stationary vector process can be used to find the common change trend of variables through cointegration method although many variables show the strong non stationarity over time a group of random variables may change and interact with each other in similar ways that is the same long term trend this is the thought of cointegration theory now some valuable achievements have been achieved with the cointegration theory they focus on the long run equilibrium relations between the economy development and water resources zhang et al 2017a fan et al 2017 ghavidelfar et al 2016 furthermore the rapid economic growth triggers the relevant policies reform such as food land water management etc it has great effect on the planting structure land use management level of the irrigation district thus with the comprehensive impact of irrigated environment and climate changes the long run equilibrium relationship between water supply and demand in the irrigated district may have the structural break especially for irrigation water and et c the cointegration relationship before structural change only reflects the original long run stability relationship but the cointegration relationship after structure change can correctly describe the behavior of water supply and demand in the irrigation district or the shock generated by the relevant irrigation policies or extreme events until now more researches on the cointegration with structural change consider economic trade singh 2015 lee et al 2007 cook 2005 bartz and kelly 2008 national income and society consumption solarin et al 2014 yang et al 2002 bai et al 2010 ranjbar et al 2014 energy consumption and gdp shahbaz et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b charfeddine et al 2016 water and economy vicente 2014 etc while water supply and demand in the irrigation district with structural changes caused by policies is insufficient and more efforts remain to be done actually influenced by many factors precipitation irrigation water and et c present random characteristics and their time series show non stationary in general however from hydrological and water resources mechanism there is still a certain relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c the variation characteristics of the three variables are canceled each other out in the cointegration process for the long term and their linear combination tend to stable and can be expressed by the cointegration equation meanwhile because precipitation irrigation water and et c are affected by many factors especially by the intervention of sensitive factors such as economic policy or political system reform that the variables may have some structural breaks in time series therefore if structural breaks are not considered the original relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c can t be revealed clearly so it is simple to think their relations are poor cannot accurately reflect the real relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c just for this the study of this paper is more meaningful and also by considering the structural break the actual relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c is revealed reasonable the aim of this paper is that with the cointegration theory the cointegration relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c without the structural break is analyzed then considering the shock of the related policies reform the short run dynamic changes and long run equilibrium relationships between these three variables with the structural break are involved finally the simulated results of error correction model ecm based on the cointegration theory with or without the structural break is all compared with the actual values however there are still some limitations in this paper and some influencing factors have not been taken into consideration for example when determining et c did not consider that the crop coefficients in different periods of crops were constantly changing but fixed the k c value according to local conditions groundwater was not involved in the calculation of irrigation water and the structural break of irrigation water was not considered however they have less influence on the results but if other factors are taken into consideration the results will be closer to the reality and more accurate 2 methodology 2 1 cointegration theory the cointegration theory tiba 2019 wang et al 2018 characterizes the equilibrium or smooth relationship between two or more time series for each time series it may be non stationary the moments of these series such as mean variance and covariance vary with time but the linear combination of these time series may have properties that do not change with time engle and granger 1987 indicate that the linear combination of two or more non stationary time series may be stationary if the linear combination is stationary these non stationary with unit root time series are considered to have a cointegration relationship the definition of cointegration is given below the components of the k dimensional vector y y 1 y 2 y n are called d b order cointegration which is recorded as y ci d b if satisfied 1 suppose each component y t of y obeys y t i d thus y i d if the sequence y t becomes a stationary sequence by d times difference and this sequence is non stationary when it is d 1 times difference so the sequence y t is called d order integer sequence which is recorded as y t i d in particular if the sequence y t itself is stationary then it is a zero order integer sequence is denoted as y t i 0 2 the presence of a vector β β 1 β 2 β n t makes β t y i d b of which y y 1 y 2 y n and d b 0 so y is integrated of d b i e y t ci d b β is the integrated vector the cointegration relationship of three variables are tested according to engle and granger 1987 as that step 1 firstly establish the cointegration regression of the sequences suppose the stationary of x t y t and z t representing the formula separately y 1 y 2 and y 3 are tested by the augmented dickey fuller adf test method dickey and fuller 1979 then with the ordinary least squares ols method the static regression of x t y t z t and their residual are achieved as 1 z t c α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where c is the constant term α 1 α 2 examines the long run equilibrium relationships between z t and x t y t respectively u t is the residual step 2 secondly the adf test of the residual sequence if the residual sequence is stationary it indicates that there is a cointegration relationship between z t and x t y t moreover if the cointegration relationship exists the residual u t obtained in the first step is added to the ecm as the non equilibrium error term in this way the corresponding ecm zivot and wang 2006 can be established then since the time series is rarely at the equilibrium point the actual observed relationship is only a short term or non equilibrium relationship of time series assuming a 1 1 order distributed lag model as follows 2 z t β 0 γ 1 x t γ 2 x t 1 γ 3 y t γ 4 y t 1 λ z t 1 ε t t 1 2 t the first order difference expression obtained by the eq 2 shift term transformation is 3 δ z t γ 1 δ x t γ 3 δ y t λ 1 z t 1 β 0 1 λ γ 1 γ 2 1 λ x t 1 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ y t 1 ε t then use ec m t 1 replace z t 1 β 0 1 λ γ 1 γ 2 1 λ x t 1 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ y t 1 use φ replace λ 1 form the eq 3 we can know c β 0 1 λ α 1 γ 1 γ 2 1 λ α 2 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ u t 1 z t 1 β 0 1 λ γ 1 γ 2 1 λ x t 1 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ y t 1 thus the ols method is used to estimate the parameters of δ z t δ x t δ y t and ec m t 1 and eq 4 is obtained 4 δ z t γ 1 δ x t γ 3 δ y t φ ec m t 1 ε t eq 4 is the ecm ecm is an important expression of the cointegration relationship with ecm the long run equilibrium and short run dynamic relationships can be described where ec m t 1 is the error correction term and it explains the deviation from the long run equilibrium relationship of the z t 1 when it appears the short run fluctuations φ is the error correction coefficient it includes the extent to which the current value of the variable is affected by past values and means the adjusting speed to the balance because λ 1 φ λ 1 thus we can know that φ 0 which means it is usually negative γ 1 γ 3 represent the short run dynamic fluctuation of δ x t δ y t respectively ε t is the white noise process 2 2 cointegration with structural breaks 2 2 1 structural break test in the case of unknown structural breaks banerjee et al 1992 presented that the structural break can be test by adf statistics which is obtained using the recursive method rolling regression method and sequential regression method zhang 2007 also proposed that with these three methods the autocorrelation of the time series can be basically eliminated when the lagging order p 1 in adf test 2 2 1 1 recursive test selecting the first subsample space usually 1 4 of the original sample space and then expand the subsample year by year for each subsample the adf test with intercept and trend are performed the test expression is 5 δ y t c β t α y t 1 γ δ y t 1 ε t where δ y t y t y t 1 δ y t 1 y t 1 y t 2 β α and γ are the coefficient respectively c is the constant ε t is the white noise process from the time sequence of the adf value the minimum adf value is selected to compare with the corresponding critical value and if it is less than the critical value there is a structural break 2 2 1 2 rolling test rolling test process is the same as recursive test the difference is that the subsample space is not intended to enlarge but keep the subsample space not to change subsample is generally 1 3 of the original sample space then adf test with intercept and trend is done for each subsample and the structural break is eventually determined by comparison with the critical value 2 2 1 3 sequential test using a dummy variable to denote the unknown structural break date the possible structural break is tested sequentially comparing the minimum adf value form the test results with the critical value if the unit root null hypothesis is rejected it is a process with a structural break the test model is given by 6 δ y t c β t α y t 1 γ δ y t 1 ρ d t ε t where δ y t y t y t 1 δ y t 1 y t 1 y t 2 d t is the dummy variable β α γ and ρ are the coefficient respectively c is the constant ε t is the white noise process considering two cases d t is defined as case 1 level shift d t 0 t k 1 t k case 2 trend shift d t 0 t k t k t k where k 0 15 t 0 85 t is integer and denotes the structural break to be examined t is the sample size 2 2 2 cointegration models with structural breaks the time series studied in this paper conform to the parametric structural breaks that are influential in institutional changes due to economic structure or policy campos et al 1996 yang et al 2002 therefore parametric structural breaks are introduced the parameter variation cointegration can be divided into three cases further 1 there is only the level shift in the cointegration relationship 2 the level shift and trend item shift occur simultaneously in the cointegration relationship 3 the level shift regressors shift and trend item shift all occur in the cointegration relationship assumption that three time series z t i 1 y t i 1 and x t i 1 the static cointegration regression model is 7 z t c α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where α 1 α 2 denote the long run equilibrium relationship of z t and x t z t and y t respectively c is the constant u t i 0 is the residual the following formulas notes are the same meaning however the cointegration relationship maybe actually changed due to the structural break assuming that the unknown structural break is induced by y t in order to distinguish the time series before and after the structural break the dummy variable d t is defined as 8 d t 0 t t τ 1 t t τ where τ 0 1 t is the sample size thus when break points or range of structure are determined three kinds of parameter variation cointegration should be considered respectively three cointegration models with structural breaks are considered as following model 1 the level shift 9 z t c 1 d t c 2 α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where c 1 represents the constant item before the level shift c 2 is the coefficient of intercept α 1 and α 2 represent the slope coefficient of x t and y t respectively model 2 the level shift and trend item 10 z t c 1 d t c 2 β t α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where β is the linear trend coefficient model 3 regime shifts the level shift regressors shift and trend item 11 z t c 1 d t c 2 β t α 1 x t α 2 y t d t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t when multiple structural breaks exist it is necessary to add the new dummy variables and substitute them into three cointegration models considering the level shift the level shift and trend item the level shift regressors shift and trend item respectively 3 results 3 1 data series 3 1 1 research area the research area of this paper is luhun irrigation district luhun irrigation district is between 112⁰5 113 5 east longitude and 34⁰10 34⁰45 north latitude which is located in the western of henan province of china and belongs to the continental monsoon climate the luhun irrigation area spans the yellow river and huaihe river basins wheat corn and cotton are planted in the irrigation district as the larger irrigation districts in henan province in china the luhun irrigation district covers zhengzhou city pingdingshan city and luoyang city and the designed irrigation area of the irrigation district is 89 670 hm2 the total population of the irrigation area is 1882 800 and the agricultural population is 1 568 200 the effective irrigation area is 42 940 hm2 and the actual irrigation area is about 22 667 hm2 corn and wheat are the main crops in the irrigation area and the proportion is 62 51 for corn 70 for wheat and other food crops was 7 49 actually the plant structure in luhun irrigation district is mainly influenced by the economic and agricultural policies just as the description in section 3 3 2 the household contract responsibility system in the early 1980s the grain purchase order in 1985 and the rural land contract policy in 1989 etc have exerted great impact on the plant structure thus the crop water requirement changes and the irrigation water in the luhun irrigation district is from the luhun reservoir which is on the upper reaches of the yi river the second tributary of the yellow river it represents the artificial water supply it is prone to the meteorological drought because of its higher evaporation and lower precipitation 3 1 2 data sources the data series of water supply and demand include precipitation irrigation water and et c from 1970 to 2013 in the luhun irrigation district et c determines the amount of irrigation water the annual irrigation water data series from 1970 to 2013 in the study are obtained from the luhun irrigation district irrigation administration and daily weather data of meteorology including average relative humidity maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine hours precipitation average wind speed etc from january 1 1970 to december 31 2013 are mainly from the meteorological observation stations of the three cities of zhengzhou city luoyang city and pingdingshan city covered by the irrigation area which can be found on china science data sharing service network in the study the crop water requirement was calculated using the crop coefficient method in the luhun irrigation district the basic formula is 12 e t c k c e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 in luhun irrigation district was calculated according to the actual situation of local parameters using the 1998 fao recommended penman monteith formula the penman monteith formula is 13 e t 0 e t rad e t areo 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d e t areo is the aerodynamic term in the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d e t rad is the radiation term in the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d t is the air average temperature c δ is the tangent slope of the saturated vapor pressure temperature relationship curve at t kp c g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d γ is thermometer constant kp c e a is the actual vapor pressure of air kp e s is the air saturated water vapor pressure kp u 2 is the wind speed 2 m above the ground m s the parameter values in penman monteith formula are selected for meteorological observation data analysis k c is the crop coefficient determined and determined by crop water requirement and possible evaporation different crops must have different k c but in this study k c is determined by the actual planting structure in the luhun irrigation and the relevant published studies and references zhang et al 2017c plant structure refers to the proportion of crop planting area different local planting structures and different k c were used for analysis and calculation finally k c is determined as 0 77 by synthesis in order to reduce the extreme value non normal distribution and heteroscedasticity of the data series the natural logarithms for precipitation lnp irrigation water lnir and et c lnet c are used to build the model using natural logarithms to process data does not change the cointegration relationship among variables but also enables better visualization of data and makes the presentation of data closer to our desired assumptions the figs 1 4 are the original data series of precipitation et c irrigation water and irrigation water per unit area uir from 1970 to 2013 in the luhun irrigation district zhang et al 2014a 2017c zhao et al 2015 3 2 cointegration relationship between water supply and demand without structural breaks 3 2 1 stationarity test prior to cointegration analysis the stability of time series should be tested with unit root test method adf test is the most common method of unit root test adf test method is used in the paper to test the stability of the natural logarithm of precipitation irrigation water and et c as shown in table 1 table 1 reports that for the original series of precipitation et c and irrigation water from 1970 to 2013 the p values at significance at 1 5 and 10 level are all larger than 0 05 but after the first difference the p values at significance at 1 5 and 10 level are less than 0 05 which means they are stationary of order 1 that is lnp i 1 lne t c i 1 and lnir i 1 3 2 2 cointegration analysis using ols method the regression formula of precipitation et c and irrigation water time series from 1970 to 2013 can be written as following lnir 1 440084 0 510339 lnp 0 799904 lne t c u t 14 4 455477 0 149183 0 614799 r 2 0 302502 d w 1 711701 the data in brackets are the standard deviation of the corresponding coefficient the following formulas notes are the same meaning and the d w durbin waston test is currently the most commonly used method for testing the existence of first order sequence correlations for random error terms when the d w value is significantly close to 0 it is positively correlated close to 4 it is negatively correlated and close to 2 there is no sequence correlation the eviews software directly gives the d w value in the output regression analysis result and uses the d w value as the regular test statistic the stationarity of the residual sequence is a prerequisite for the existence of the cointegration relationship and the residual graph fig 5 is just used to characterize verify the stationarity of the residual with residual graph it is found that lnir residuals are within the range of the fitted value without the extremely high or low value and take zero as the center and are basically symmetrical this shows that in the whole fitting range the residuals satisfy a constant and uniform diffusion distribution and the fitting values of the model are evenly scattered around the points to be fitted thus it is preliminarily judged that the residual sequence is stationary and the model is reasonable then the residual of the regression formula is test with the adf unit root test as table 2 it can be seen from table 2 the p values at significance of 1 5 and 10 level are less than 0 05 so the residual of the static regression formula is stationary precipitation et c and irrigation water time series are cointegrated means the static regression formula is a cointegration formula thus the ecm of precipitation et c and irrigation water can be established according the ecm establishment described above the ecm of precipitation et c and irrigation water is given by 15 δ l n i r 0 848063 e c m 1 0 527133 δ l n p 1 135436 δ l n e t c 0 162762 0 125185 0 624039 r 2 0 704918 d w 1 959264 the ecm expounds that the coefficient of e c m 1 is 0 848063 it means the deviation of the irrigation water from the long run balance will be adjusted about 84 80 at the next time the short run dynamic coefficient of precipitation and et c are 0 799904 and 1 135436 respectively this shows that the short run dynamic change of precipitation has the positive effect on irrigation water whereas the short run dynamic change of et c has the negative effect on it moreover it is obvious that the influence of et c on irrigation water is larger the fit of goodness of ecm is 0 704918 that means the model is more explanatory than cointegration eq 14 3 3 cointegration relationship between water supply and demand with structural breaks 3 3 1 unit roots test with structural breaks because the crop water requirement is more severely affected by economic policies or political systems thus it is in line with the requirements of the structural break detection method in the economic field so we consider it as a time series for detecting structural breaks we don t consider the structure breaks of irrigation water because for irrigation districts the amount of irrigation water as a dependent variable is more concerned the recursive test rolling test and sequential test method are used to check the structural breaks of et c to eliminate autocorrelation actual sample size t 42 1972 2013 when the test value is less than the critical value the null hypothesis is accepted and the structural break point is considered to be the point at which the minimum value is selected in the sequence of adf values according to banerjee and lumsdaine 1992 we can get the critical values at the significance level of 10 of the recursive test rolling test sequential test mean sift and sequential test trend sift methods in the luhun irrigation district by the interpolation method respectively 4 03 4 75 4 55 and 4 23 3 3 1 1 recursive test the first subsample is selected for 1972 1982 and then enlarges it year by year until 2013 the adf test with intercept and trend is carried out for each subsample the test expression is 16 δ lne t c c β t α lne t c t 1 γ δ e t c t 1 ε t the recursive test result is as fig 6 3 3 1 2 rolling test selecting 1972 1985 1973 1986 2000 2013 as the subsample and then to test the unit root by the adf test with intercept and trend the rolling test result is as fig 7 3 3 1 3 sequential test the sample size t 42 with the dummy variable d t to denote the unknown structural break date sequentially from 1976 to 2008 the test model is given by 17 δ lne t c c β t α lne t c t 1 γ δ e t c t 1 ρ d t ε t the sequential test results of case 1 and case 2 are as figs 8 and 9 as can be seen from fig 8 there is a structural break point in the position of the critical value the adf value of this break point just exceeds the critical value of 10 of the significant level this break point should be studied meanwhile in fig 9 there is a significant structural break point in the end we chose 1981 and 1989 as structural break points of change in crop water requirements thus the results of three unit roots tests with structural breaks are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the structural interval in et c time series is from 1980 to 1992 and its structural breaks are in 1981 and 1989 3 3 2 structural breaks analysis since china implemented the reform and opening up policy in 1978 the state has carried out unprecedented reforms on the purchase policy and planting structure of grain grain policy is an important tool for realizing national food macro management a correct grain policy can promote the development of the country s economy and social stability and realize the interests of the broad masses of the people in rural areas especially the household contract responsibility system implemented in 1982 fully arouses the farmers enthusiasm for grain production the household contract responsibility system was an important reform implemented in the rural areas of mainland china in the early 1980s in 1980 the central government issued several issues concerning further strengthening and improving the agricultural production responsibility system which for the first time clearly affirmed the new form of production responsibility system represented by the farmer masses in the form of a document after 1980 the central committee of the communist party of china began to support and promote the household contract responsibility system with the main form of contracted output to households in 1983 the state council promulgated the trial regulations on several issues concerning the implementation of multi channel operation after completing the grain and oil purchase tasks since 1984 various types of food trade centers have been established throughout the country and traditional rice markets and food banks have been restored in 1985 the national grain purchase changed to the contract order in 1986 the land administration law of the people s republic of china was adopted which made the household contract responsibility system more clearly and greatly stimulated farmers enthusiasm for grain production in 1987 the three linkages policy of grain ordering with affordable fertilizers cheap diesel and advance purchase deposits was implemented to adjust grain prices from 1988 1989 the grain price was liberalized and gradually became marketed in henan province from 1978 to 1984 the policy of unified purchase and marketing of grain was implemented from 1985 1992 the policy of grain contract purchase and state purchase was implemented since 1989 the henan provincial government has seriously implemented the rural land contract policy and actively deepened the reform of the grain circulation system in accordance with the grain production idea stable areas higher yield improve grain the agricultural advanced technology was vigorously promoted and the planting structure was constantly optimized from 1991 1992 the state continued to carry out pilot work to liberalize food prices and liberalize operations national and local government policy guidance on land systems food acquisition methods and food prices may all contribute to changes in crop acreage planting structure and production enthusiasm in irrigation districts changes in these factors have directly led to major changes in crop water requirements in irrigation districts so the above historical reasons and empirical evidences agree that the time range of crop water demand breaks is 1980 1992 and we can think that the structural breaks in 1981 and 1989 are reasonable 3 3 3 cointegration models with structural breaks the dummy variables d 1 t and d 2 t are induced by 18 d 1 t 0 t

are 0 508270 0 516754 0 560920 respectively which are larger than that of the cointegration models without the dummy variable 0 302502 however compared with the cointegration model without the dummy variable the goodness of fit of the model 1 and model 2 is not obviously it expounds that the model 3 is more feasible to the cointegration relations of water supply and demand in the luhun irrigation district from the model 3 it can be pointed that before the structural break the coefficient on precipitation is 0 697862 and on et c is 1 83231 that is a 0 697862 of irrigation water can be decrease by 1 decline in precipitation whereas a 1 83231 of irrigation water can be increase by 1 increase in et c so the impact of precipitation and et c on irrigation water are completely opposite et c has a larger positive effect while precipitation has a less negative effect however after the reform and opening up in 1978 the national domestic and international situation is gradually stability and the nation focus on the development of economic and technological progress in particular the state and local government policy guidance on land system grain purchasing and grain price has greatly improved the enthusiasm of farmers especially the household contract responsibility system implemented in the early 1980s and since 1989 the henan provincial government has actively deepened the reform of the grain circulation system moreover famers have a deeper understanding of crop planting because of the promotion of agricultural knowledge which improves the crop planting structure adjustment thus the coefficient on et c change from 1 83231 to 1 956798 in 1981 1989 after 1989 the coefficient on et c change from 1 956798 to 0 943996 this means that the optimization of planting structure and policy adjustment of crop irrigation have a tendency to save water after 1989 3 3 4 error correction models with structural breaks with the adf unit root test method the residuals of three cointegration models are given by tables 4 6 it can be seen that the residuals of three cointegration models are all stationary so their ecms can be established as follows 26 δ l n i r 0 956211 e c m 1 0 003390 0

model and ecm with structural breaks the long run equilibrium relationship between precipitation et c and irrigation water are presented moreover the coefficient on ecm 1 is negative confirms the converse correction mechanism of ecm if this coefficient is significant the error correction term in the past will have a great impact on the current change of the variable from the formulas 26 28 the coefficients on ecm 1 of three ecms are all significant which shows that considering the structural break the adjusting speed to the long run balance has been improved typically the coefficient on ecm 1 in model 3 is 0 985688 which expresses that the deviation of the irrigation water from the long run balance will be adjusted about 98 57 at the next time the coefficients on the first difference of variables clarify the short run dynamic changes of model the short run results exhibited in the formulas 26 28 report precipitation has a negative impact on irrigation water while et c has the positive and significant impact the fitting coefficient r 2 of three ecms are 0 800932 0 861506 0 910761 respectively so compared with that of the ecm without structural breaks r 2 0 704918 the ecm with structural breaks has a higher fitting accuracy so the ecm with the structural break can describe the long run equilibrium relationship and short run dynamic changes of variables more accurately fig 10 is comparison the observed value and the simulated values of three ecms model 1 model 2 model 3 and fig 11 and table 7 present the relative errors of three ecms with structural breaks and one ecm without structural breaks model 0 in general model 1 model 2 and model 3 has the better simulation accuracy than model 0 but the model 3 is highest for the relative errors of three ecms with structural breaks the years with the relative error less than 15 account for about 75 while the year with the relative error less than 20 are about 85 in particular for model 3 it occupies 98 even for the relative error less than 5 the model 3 attends to 46 51 and the r 2 of model 3 is the largest therefore model 3 improves greatly compared with other models especially model 0 moreover if the limitations and other influencing factors of this paper are fully considered and the corresponding results of the models will be more accurate 4 discussion 4 1 structural breaks induced by the policies the method of structural breaks is used to detect et c affected by economic policies we construct the cointegration equation and error correction model between ir p and et c to reveal the long term trend and short term dynamic change of the luhun irrigation district more accurately et c is also affected greatly by the planting structure the state and local government policy guidance on land system grain purchase and the price will have a great impact on crop planting area planting structure and production enthusiasm which will lead to the great changes of water demand in irrigation district also the policy has influence on irrigation water but this influence is not enough and irrigation water as a dependent variable is more concerned finally it was determined that the cointegration relationship between ir p and et c has structural breaks in 1981 and 1989 crop water requirement is influenced by economic development food policy and political system etc therefore with the structural break test and the economic and agricultural policy on its impact it is reasonable to think that there were structural breaks in 1981 and 1989 in the water supply and demand system in addition with the development of agriculture agricultural planting structure and land use mode will continue to change and there will be new or more structural breaks in the water supply and demand system thus according to economic and agricultural policies in the future these new structural breaks can be found by structural break test method and new cointegration models should be constructed to determine more accurate relationships between water supply and demand so as to make a reasonable prediction of irrigation water requirement in the irrigation district after the structural breaks are determined cointegration models and error correction models with structural breaks are established the ecms with structural breaks have higher goodness of fit especially the model 3 model 3 has the highest simulation accuracy for the relative errors of three ecms with structural breaks model 3 performed best the main reason is that model 3 not only considers the impact of random factors such as policy or institutional changes on variables but also makes full use of information such as the horizontal value of variables and the difference sequence of variables and adds the residual of regression equation into the model as an unbalanced error term to establish the corresponding error correction model thus it s more accurate and simulate better than the other models 4 2 limitations and future studies there are some limitations in this study firstly water supply and demand system in the irrigation district is a complex system irrigation water is determined by many factors such as soil moisture seepage irrigation measures management level etc so it is not just decided by these two variables precipitation and et c secondly groundwater is another source of irrigation but it is not considered in the calculation and analysis of irrigation water and the k c value is a fixed value when calculating et c but in practice it should vary in the whole growing period of the crop finally only the et c time series considered the structural changes caused by policy changes but for precipitation and irrigation water time series it cannot be involved indeed precipitation and irrigation water are water input representing water supply item and et c is water output representing water demand item although the human activities have an impact on water supply and demand in the irrigation district in fact they have only an impact on et c and irrigation water and have little effect on precipitation however these limitations do not have profound effect on the reasonability of this study anyway precipitation et c and irrigation water are three fundamental factors representing water supply and demand and other factors such as soil moisture are only process items affecting water supply and demand so according to the hydrological cycle principle the results are reasonable although groundwater is involved in irrigation it accounts for only a small proportion and luhun reservoir is the main source of irrigation water therefore the irrigation water in this paper is relatively accurate in addition the k c value generally changes little in the growing period of the crop and the fixed k c value has little influence on et c finally from the view of water balance principle of the whole irrigation district the irrigation water is made up for the lack of natural water supply and demand it is therefore both primary and reasonable to consider only the effects of policy changes on water demand generally this study has grasped the main contradiction of water supply and demand and its results are reasonable and reliable of course if these limitations are considered or improved the studied results will be more accurate and reliable this may be the effort in the next work but anyway this study reveals the long run equilibrium relationship and the short run dynamic change of precipitation et c and irrigation water in the irrigation district considering the structural break caused by the agricultural policies and the fit of the cointegration equation and the error correction model considering structural breaks is greater than that without considering structural breaks this presents a new approach and technology to know the relation between water supply and demand in the irrigation district 5 conclusions in this study the cointegration relationships between water supply and demand in the irrigation district with or without the structural break are analyzed the results show that 1 using recursive test rolling test and sequential test method the structural breaks of et c affected by environment policy and planting structure were detected in 1981 and 1989 the cointegration relationship between precipitation et c and irrigation water has structural breaks in the corresponding years indicating that the policy on agriculture exerted by the state and local government have great influence on the water supply and demand in the irrigation district 2 furthermore the short run analysis amongst precipitation et c and irrigation water find that the et c has a positive and significant impact on irrigation water while precipitation has a negative impact meanwhile et c is mainly determined by the planting structure in the irrigation district so it is suggested that regarding the agricultural development polices the planting structure adjustment policy need to be paid more attention 3 the existence of long run equilibrium cointegration relationships between precipitation et c and irrigation water with or without the structural break however both the cointegration model with the structural break and the ecm with the structural break have the improved goodness of fit especially the regime shift model 3 similarly the simulation values of three ecms with the structural break illustrates that they also have high simulation accuracy the relative error less than 5 of the regime shift model 3 is 46 51 so it may be used to predict irrigation water according to this long run equilibrium cointegration relationship between precipitation et c and irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research is

9867,to explain the impact of agricultural policy on the relationship between water supply and demand in the irrigation district the cointegration theory with structural breaks is introduced in this study the results show that the structural breaks caused by the agricultural policy on the relationship between water supply and demand occur in 1981 and 1989 moreover water supply and demand have the long run cointegration equilibrium and short run dynamic changes with or without structural breaks error correction models with or without structural breaks are established but three error correction models with structural breaks present higher simulation accuracy than the error correction model without structural breaks especially for the model 3 it has the largest goodness of fit of about 0 91 and its relative error less than 5 occupies for 46 51 there are still some limitations in this study if groundwater and other factors are taken into consideration in the calculation of irrigation water and the changes of the crop coefficient k c value in different periods are considered in the calculation of crop water requirement the results will be more accurate keywords cointegration relationship error correction model water supply and demand structural breaks irrigation district 1 introduction precipitation p irrigation water ir and crop water requirement et c represent water supply and demand in the irrigation district and they are also the main influencing factors on the water safety affected by meteorological hydrological crop planting structure agricultural management conditions etc precipitation irrigation water and et c are three uncertain variables with some relations in order to improve irrigation activities and agricultural development scholars have studied the influencing mechanism between precipitation irrigation water and et c chung 2013 assefa et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017c chiraz et al 2014 as the global warming the hydrological cycle process strengthens which results in the higher frequency and intensity of extreme events such as high temperature and drought global climate changes not only change the total amount and temporal spatial distribution of water resources but also increase the evapotranspiration of the farmland which maybe further aggravate the contradiction of agricultural water supply and demand in practice irrigation water is mainly determined by precipitation and et c precipitation irrigation water and et c will have great changes with the modern changing environment for recent years the changing characteristics and relations between them have been researched with statistical method jiang et al 2018a surendran et al 2015 woznicki et al 2015 zhang et al 2014b or mathematical modeling jiang et al 2019 mo et al 2004 zhang et al 2014a zhao et al 2015 however the previously studies had assumed that the hydrologic time series are stationary which may not be the case for the better explain the relations of hydrological variables the cointegration theory in econometric is introduced in the hydrology and water resources field to overcome this shortcoming song et al 2008 zaman et al 2011 jiang et al 2018b granda et al 2008 musolesi et al 2011 because cointegration theory combines the model s short run fluctuations in the traditional time series method with the model s long run equilibrium relationship in econometric which provides an effective theoretical method for non stationary time series analysis cointegration theory is suitable to analyze the long run relationship between variables and a non stationary vector process can be used to find the common change trend of variables through cointegration method although many variables show the strong non stationarity over time a group of random variables may change and interact with each other in similar ways that is the same long term trend this is the thought of cointegration theory now some valuable achievements have been achieved with the cointegration theory they focus on the long run equilibrium relations between the economy development and water resources zhang et al 2017a fan et al 2017 ghavidelfar et al 2016 furthermore the rapid economic growth triggers the relevant policies reform such as food land water management etc it has great effect on the planting structure land use management level of the irrigation district thus with the comprehensive impact of irrigated environment and climate changes the long run equilibrium relationship between water supply and demand in the irrigated district may have the structural break especially for irrigation water and et c the cointegration relationship before structural change only reflects the original long run stability relationship but the cointegration relationship after structure change can correctly describe the behavior of water supply and demand in the irrigation district or the shock generated by the relevant irrigation policies or extreme events until now more researches on the cointegration with structural change consider economic trade singh 2015 lee et al 2007 cook 2005 bartz and kelly 2008 national income and society consumption solarin et al 2014 yang et al 2002 bai et al 2010 ranjbar et al 2014 energy consumption and gdp shahbaz et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b charfeddine et al 2016 water and economy vicente 2014 etc while water supply and demand in the irrigation district with structural changes caused by policies is insufficient and more efforts remain to be done actually influenced by many factors precipitation irrigation water and et c present random characteristics and their time series show non stationary in general however from hydrological and water resources mechanism there is still a certain relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c the variation characteristics of the three variables are canceled each other out in the cointegration process for the long term and their linear combination tend to stable and can be expressed by the cointegration equation meanwhile because precipitation irrigation water and et c are affected by many factors especially by the intervention of sensitive factors such as economic policy or political system reform that the variables may have some structural breaks in time series therefore if structural breaks are not considered the original relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c can t be revealed clearly so it is simple to think their relations are poor cannot accurately reflect the real relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c just for this the study of this paper is more meaningful and also by considering the structural break the actual relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c is revealed reasonable the aim of this paper is that with the cointegration theory the cointegration relationship between precipitation irrigation water and et c without the structural break is analyzed then considering the shock of the related policies reform the short run dynamic changes and long run equilibrium relationships between these three variables with the structural break are involved finally the simulated results of error correction model ecm based on the cointegration theory with or without the structural break is all compared with the actual values however there are still some limitations in this paper and some influencing factors have not been taken into consideration for example when determining et c did not consider that the crop coefficients in different periods of crops were constantly changing but fixed the k c value according to local conditions groundwater was not involved in the calculation of irrigation water and the structural break of irrigation water was not considered however they have less influence on the results but if other factors are taken into consideration the results will be closer to the reality and more accurate 2 methodology 2 1 cointegration theory the cointegration theory tiba 2019 wang et al 2018 characterizes the equilibrium or smooth relationship between two or more time series for each time series it may be non stationary the moments of these series such as mean variance and covariance vary with time but the linear combination of these time series may have properties that do not change with time engle and granger 1987 indicate that the linear combination of two or more non stationary time series may be stationary if the linear combination is stationary these non stationary with unit root time series are considered to have a cointegration relationship the definition of cointegration is given below the components of the k dimensional vector y y 1 y 2 y n are called d b order cointegration which is recorded as y ci d b if satisfied 1 suppose each component y t of y obeys y t i d thus y i d if the sequence y t becomes a stationary sequence by d times difference and this sequence is non stationary when it is d 1 times difference so the sequence y t is called d order integer sequence which is recorded as y t i d in particular if the sequence y t itself is stationary then it is a zero order integer sequence is denoted as y t i 0 2 the presence of a vector β β 1 β 2 β n t makes β t y i d b of which y y 1 y 2 y n and d b 0 so y is integrated of d b i e y t ci d b β is the integrated vector the cointegration relationship of three variables are tested according to engle and granger 1987 as that step 1 firstly establish the cointegration regression of the sequences suppose the stationary of x t y t and z t representing the formula separately y 1 y 2 and y 3 are tested by the augmented dickey fuller adf test method dickey and fuller 1979 then with the ordinary least squares ols method the static regression of x t y t z t and their residual are achieved as 1 z t c α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where c is the constant term α 1 α 2 examines the long run equilibrium relationships between z t and x t y t respectively u t is the residual step 2 secondly the adf test of the residual sequence if the residual sequence is stationary it indicates that there is a cointegration relationship between z t and x t y t moreover if the cointegration relationship exists the residual u t obtained in the first step is added to the ecm as the non equilibrium error term in this way the corresponding ecm zivot and wang 2006 can be established then since the time series is rarely at the equilibrium point the actual observed relationship is only a short term or non equilibrium relationship of time series assuming a 1 1 order distributed lag model as follows 2 z t β 0 γ 1 x t γ 2 x t 1 γ 3 y t γ 4 y t 1 λ z t 1 ε t t 1 2 t the first order difference expression obtained by the eq 2 shift term transformation is 3 δ z t γ 1 δ x t γ 3 δ y t λ 1 z t 1 β 0 1 λ γ 1 γ 2 1 λ x t 1 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ y t 1 ε t then use ec m t 1 replace z t 1 β 0 1 λ γ 1 γ 2 1 λ x t 1 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ y t 1 use φ replace λ 1 form the eq 3 we can know c β 0 1 λ α 1 γ 1 γ 2 1 λ α 2 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ u t 1 z t 1 β 0 1 λ γ 1 γ 2 1 λ x t 1 γ 3 γ 4 1 λ y t 1 thus the ols method is used to estimate the parameters of δ z t δ x t δ y t and ec m t 1 and eq 4 is obtained 4 δ z t γ 1 δ x t γ 3 δ y t φ ec m t 1 ε t eq 4 is the ecm ecm is an important expression of the cointegration relationship with ecm the long run equilibrium and short run dynamic relationships can be described where ec m t 1 is the error correction term and it explains the deviation from the long run equilibrium relationship of the z t 1 when it appears the short run fluctuations φ is the error correction coefficient it includes the extent to which the current value of the variable is affected by past values and means the adjusting speed to the balance because λ 1 φ λ 1 thus we can know that φ 0 which means it is usually negative γ 1 γ 3 represent the short run dynamic fluctuation of δ x t δ y t respectively ε t is the white noise process 2 2 cointegration with structural breaks 2 2 1 structural break test in the case of unknown structural breaks banerjee et al 1992 presented that the structural break can be test by adf statistics which is obtained using the recursive method rolling regression method and sequential regression method zhang 2007 also proposed that with these three methods the autocorrelation of the time series can be basically eliminated when the lagging order p 1 in adf test 2 2 1 1 recursive test selecting the first subsample space usually 1 4 of the original sample space and then expand the subsample year by year for each subsample the adf test with intercept and trend are performed the test expression is 5 δ y t c β t α y t 1 γ δ y t 1 ε t where δ y t y t y t 1 δ y t 1 y t 1 y t 2 β α and γ are the coefficient respectively c is the constant ε t is the white noise process from the time sequence of the adf value the minimum adf value is selected to compare with the corresponding critical value and if it is less than the critical value there is a structural break 2 2 1 2 rolling test rolling test process is the same as recursive test the difference is that the subsample space is not intended to enlarge but keep the subsample space not to change subsample is generally 1 3 of the original sample space then adf test with intercept and trend is done for each subsample and the structural break is eventually determined by comparison with the critical value 2 2 1 3 sequential test using a dummy variable to denote the unknown structural break date the possible structural break is tested sequentially comparing the minimum adf value form the test results with the critical value if the unit root null hypothesis is rejected it is a process with a structural break the test model is given by 6 δ y t c β t α y t 1 γ δ y t 1 ρ d t ε t where δ y t y t y t 1 δ y t 1 y t 1 y t 2 d t is the dummy variable β α γ and ρ are the coefficient respectively c is the constant ε t is the white noise process considering two cases d t is defined as case 1 level shift d t 0 t k 1 t k case 2 trend shift d t 0 t k t k t k where k 0 15 t 0 85 t is integer and denotes the structural break to be examined t is the sample size 2 2 2 cointegration models with structural breaks the time series studied in this paper conform to the parametric structural breaks that are influential in institutional changes due to economic structure or policy campos et al 1996 yang et al 2002 therefore parametric structural breaks are introduced the parameter variation cointegration can be divided into three cases further 1 there is only the level shift in the cointegration relationship 2 the level shift and trend item shift occur simultaneously in the cointegration relationship 3 the level shift regressors shift and trend item shift all occur in the cointegration relationship assumption that three time series z t i 1 y t i 1 and x t i 1 the static cointegration regression model is 7 z t c α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where α 1 α 2 denote the long run equilibrium relationship of z t and x t z t and y t respectively c is the constant u t i 0 is the residual the following formulas notes are the same meaning however the cointegration relationship maybe actually changed due to the structural break assuming that the unknown structural break is induced by y t in order to distinguish the time series before and after the structural break the dummy variable d t is defined as 8 d t 0 t t τ 1 t t τ where τ 0 1 t is the sample size thus when break points or range of structure are determined three kinds of parameter variation cointegration should be considered respectively three cointegration models with structural breaks are considered as following model 1 the level shift 9 z t c 1 d t c 2 α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where c 1 represents the constant item before the level shift c 2 is the coefficient of intercept α 1 and α 2 represent the slope coefficient of x t and y t respectively model 2 the level shift and trend item 10 z t c 1 d t c 2 β t α 1 x t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t where β is the linear trend coefficient model 3 regime shifts the level shift regressors shift and trend item 11 z t c 1 d t c 2 β t α 1 x t α 2 y t d t α 2 y t u t t 1 2 t when multiple structural breaks exist it is necessary to add the new dummy variables and substitute them into three cointegration models considering the level shift the level shift and trend item the level shift regressors shift and trend item respectively 3 results 3 1 data series 3 1 1 research area the research area of this paper is luhun irrigation district luhun irrigation district is between 112⁰5 113 5 east longitude and 34⁰10 34⁰45 north latitude which is located in the western of henan province of china and belongs to the continental monsoon climate the luhun irrigation area spans the yellow river and huaihe river basins wheat corn and cotton are planted in the irrigation district as the larger irrigation districts in henan province in china the luhun irrigation district covers zhengzhou city pingdingshan city and luoyang city and the designed irrigation area of the irrigation district is 89 670 hm2 the total population of the irrigation area is 1882 800 and the agricultural population is 1 568 200 the effective irrigation area is 42 940 hm2 and the actual irrigation area is about 22 667 hm2 corn and wheat are the main crops in the irrigation area and the proportion is 62 51 for corn 70 for wheat and other food crops was 7 49 actually the plant structure in luhun irrigation district is mainly influenced by the economic and agricultural policies just as the description in section 3 3 2 the household contract responsibility system in the early 1980s the grain purchase order in 1985 and the rural land contract policy in 1989 etc have exerted great impact on the plant structure thus the crop water requirement changes and the irrigation water in the luhun irrigation district is from the luhun reservoir which is on the upper reaches of the yi river the second tributary of the yellow river it represents the artificial water supply it is prone to the meteorological drought because of its higher evaporation and lower precipitation 3 1 2 data sources the data series of water supply and demand include precipitation irrigation water and et c from 1970 to 2013 in the luhun irrigation district et c determines the amount of irrigation water the annual irrigation water data series from 1970 to 2013 in the study are obtained from the luhun irrigation district irrigation administration and daily weather data of meteorology including average relative humidity maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine hours precipitation average wind speed etc from january 1 1970 to december 31 2013 are mainly from the meteorological observation stations of the three cities of zhengzhou city luoyang city and pingdingshan city covered by the irrigation area which can be found on china science data sharing service network in the study the crop water requirement was calculated using the crop coefficient method in the luhun irrigation district the basic formula is 12 e t c k c e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 in luhun irrigation district was calculated according to the actual situation of local parameters using the 1998 fao recommended penman monteith formula the penman monteith formula is 13 e t 0 e t rad e t areo 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d e t areo is the

the saturated vapor pressure temperature relationship curve at t kp c g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d γ is thermometer constant kp c e a is the actual vapor pressure

data analysis k c is the crop coefficient determined and determined by crop water requirement and possible evaporation different crops must have different k c but in this study k c is determined by the actual planting structure in the luhun irrigation and the relevant published studies and references zhang et al 2017c plant structure refers to the proportion of crop planting area different local planting structures and different k c were used for analysis and calculation finally k c is determined as 0 77 by synthesis in order to reduce the extreme value non normal distribution and heteroscedasticity of the data series the natural logarithms for precipitation lnp irrigation water lnir and et c lnet c are used to build the model using natural logarithms to process data does not change the cointegration relationship among variables but also enables better visualization of data and makes the presentation of data closer to our desired assumptions the figs 1 4 are the original data series of precipitation et c irrigation water and irrigation water per unit area uir from 1970 to 2013 in the luhun irrigation district zhang et al 2014a 2017c zhao et al 2015 3 2 cointegration relationship between water supply and demand without structural breaks 3 2 1 stationarity test prior to cointegration analysis the stability of time series should be tested with unit root test method adf test is the most common method of unit root test adf test method is used in the paper to test the stability of the natural logarithm of precipitation irrigation water and et c as shown in table 1 table 1 reports that for the original series of precipitation et c and irrigation water from 1970 to 2013 the p values at significance at 1 5 and 10 level are all larger than 0 05 but after the first difference the p values at significance at 1 5 and 10 level are less than 0 05 which means they are stationary of order 1 that is lnp i 1 lne t c i 1 and lnir i 1 3 2 2 cointegration analysis using ols method the regression formula of precipitation et c and irrigation water time series from 1970 to 2013 can be written as following lnir 1 440084 0 510339 lnp 0 799904 lne t c u t 14 4 455477 0 149183 0 614799 r 2 0 302502 d w 1 711701 the data in brackets are the standard deviation of the corresponding coefficient the following formulas notes are the same meaning and the d w durbin waston test is currently the most commonly used method for testing the existence of first order sequence correlations for random error terms when the d w value is significantly close to 0 it is positively correlated close to 4 it is negatively correlated and close to 2 there is no sequence correlation the eviews software directly gives the d w value in the output regression analysis result and uses the d w value as the regular test statistic the stationarity of the residual sequence is a prerequisite for the existence of the cointegration relationship and the residual graph fig 5 is just used to characterize verify the stationarity of the residual with residual graph it is found that lnir residuals are within the range of the fitted value without the extremely high or low value and take zero as the center and are basically symmetrical this shows that in the whole fitting range the residuals satisfy a constant and uniform diffusion distribution and the fitting values of the model are evenly scattered around the points to be fitted thus it is preliminarily judged that the residual sequence is stationary and the model is reasonable then the residual of the regression formula is test with the adf unit root test as table 2 it can be seen from table 2 the p values at significance of 1 5 and 10 level are less than 0 05 so the residual of the static regression formula is stationary precipitation et c and irrigation water time series are cointegrated means the static regression formula is a cointegration formula thus the ecm of precipitation et c and irrigation water can be established according the ecm establishment described above the ecm of precipitation et c and irrigation water is given by 15 δ l n i r 0 848063 e c m 1 0 527133 δ l n p 1 135436 δ l n e t c 0 162762 0 125185 0 624039 r 2 0 704918 d w 1 959264 the ecm expounds that the coefficient of e c m 1 is 0 848063 it means the deviation of the irrigation water from the long run balance will be adjusted about 84 80 at the next time the short run dynamic coefficient of precipitation and et c are 0 799904 and 1 135436 respectively this shows that the short run dynamic change of precipitation has the positive effect on irrigation water whereas the short run dynamic change of et c has the negative effect on it moreover it is obvious that the influence of et c on irrigation water is larger the fit of goodness of ecm is 0 704918 that means the model is more explanatory than cointegration eq 14 3 3 cointegration relationship between water supply and demand with structural breaks 3 3 1 unit roots test with structural breaks because the crop water requirement is more severely affected by economic policies or political systems thus it is in line with the requirements of the structural break detection method in the economic field so we consider it as a time series for detecting structural breaks we don t consider the structure breaks of irrigation water because for irrigation districts the amount of irrigation water as a dependent variable is more concerned the recursive test rolling test and sequential test method are used to check the structural breaks of et c to eliminate autocorrelation actual sample size t 42 1972 2013 when the test value is less than the critical value the null hypothesis is accepted and the structural break point is considered to be the point at which the minimum value is selected in the sequence of adf values according to banerjee and lumsdaine 1992 we can get the critical values at the significance level of 10 of the recursive test rolling test sequential test mean sift and sequential test trend sift methods in the luhun irrigation district by the interpolation method respectively 4 03 4 75 4 55 and 4 23 3 3 1 1 recursive test the first subsample is selected for 1972 1982 and then enlarges it year by year until 2013 the adf test with intercept and trend is carried out for each subsample the test expression is 16 δ lne t c c β t α lne t c t 1 γ δ e t c t 1 ε t the recursive test result is as fig 6 3 3 1 2 rolling test selecting 1972 1985 1973 1986 2000 2013 as the subsample and then to test the unit root by the adf test with intercept and trend the rolling test result is as fig 7 3 3 1 3 sequential test the sample size t 42 with the dummy variable d t to denote the unknown structural break date sequentially from 1976 to 2008 the test model is given by 17 δ lne t c c β t α lne t c t 1 γ δ e t c t 1 ρ d t ε t the sequential test results of case 1 and case 2 are as figs 8 and 9 as can be seen from fig 8 there is a structural break point in the position of the critical value the adf value of this break point just exceeds the critical value of 10 of the significant level this break point should be studied meanwhile in fig 9 there is a significant structural break point in the end we chose 1981 and 1989 as structural break points of change in crop water requirements thus the results of three unit roots tests with structural breaks are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the structural interval in et c time series is from 1980 to 1992 and its structural breaks are in 1981 and 1989 3 3 2 structural breaks analysis since china implemented the reform and opening up policy in 1978 the state has carried out unprecedented reforms on the purchase policy and planting structure of grain grain policy is an important tool for realizing national food macro management a correct grain policy can promote the development of the country s economy and social stability and realize the interests of the broad masses of the people in rural areas especially the household contract responsibility system implemented in 1982 fully arouses the farmers enthusiasm for grain production the household contract responsibility system was an important reform implemented in the rural areas of mainland china in the early 1980s in 1980 the central government issued several issues concerning further strengthening and improving the agricultural production responsibility system which for the first time clearly affirmed the new form of production responsibility system represented by the farmer masses in the form of a document after 1980 the central committee of the communist party of china began to support and promote the household contract responsibility system with the main form of contracted output to households in 1983 the state council promulgated the trial regulations on several issues concerning the implementation of multi channel operation after completing the grain and oil purchase tasks since 1984 various types of food trade centers have been established throughout the country and traditional rice markets and food banks have been restored in 1985 the national grain purchase changed to the contract order in 1986 the land administration law of the people s republic of china was adopted which made the household contract responsibility system more clearly and greatly stimulated farmers enthusiasm for grain production in 1987 the three linkages policy of grain ordering with affordable fertilizers cheap diesel and advance purchase deposits was implemented to adjust grain prices from 1988 1989 the grain price was liberalized and gradually became marketed in henan province from 1978 to 1984 the policy of unified purchase and marketing of grain was implemented from 1985 1992 the policy of grain contract purchase and state purchase was implemented since 1989 the henan provincial government has seriously implemented the rural land contract policy and actively deepened the reform of the grain circulation system in accordance with the grain production idea stable areas higher yield improve grain the agricultural advanced technology was vigorously promoted and the planting structure was constantly optimized from 1991 1992 the state continued to carry out pilot work to liberalize food prices and liberalize operations national and local government policy guidance on land systems food acquisition methods and food prices may all contribute to changes in crop acreage planting structure and production enthusiasm in irrigation districts changes in these factors have directly led to major changes in crop water requirements in irrigation districts so the above historical reasons and empirical evidences agree that the time range of crop water demand breaks is 1980 1992 and we can think that the structural breaks in 1981 and 1989 are reasonable 3 3 3 cointegration models with structural breaks the dummy variables d 1 t and d 2 t are induced by 18 d 1 t 0 t 1981 1 t 1981 19 d 2 t 0 t 1989 t 1989 t 1989 thus three cointegration models with structural breaks are tested 20 lnir c 1 d 1 t c 2 d 2 t c 3 α 1 lnp α 2 lne t c u t 21 lnir c 1 d 1 t c 2 d 2 t c 3

are 0 508270 0 516754 0 560920 respectively which are larger than that of the cointegration models without the dummy variable 0 302502 however compared with the cointegration model without the dummy variable the goodness of fit of the model 1 and model 2 is not obviously it expounds that the model 3 is more feasible to the cointegration relations of water supply and demand in the luhun irrigation district from the model 3 it can be pointed that before the structural break the coefficient on precipitation is 0 697862 and on et c is 1 83231 that is a 0 697862 of irrigation water can be decrease by 1 decline in precipitation whereas a 1 83231 of irrigation water can be increase by 1 increase in et c so the impact of precipitation and et c on irrigation water are completely opposite et c has a larger positive effect while precipitation has a less negative effect however after the reform and opening up in 1978 the national domestic and international situation is gradually stability and the nation focus on the development of economic and technological progress in particular the state and local government policy guidance on land system grain purchasing and grain price has greatly improved the enthusiasm of farmers especially the household contract responsibility system implemented in the early 1980s and since 1989 the henan provincial government has actively deepened the reform of the grain circulation system moreover famers have a deeper understanding of crop planting because of the promotion of agricultural knowledge which improves the crop planting structure adjustment thus the coefficient on et c change from 1 83231 to 1 956798 in 1981 1989 after 1989 the coefficient on et c change from 1 956798 to 0 943996 this means that the optimization of planting structure and policy adjustment of crop irrigation have a tendency to save water after 1989 3 3 4 error correction models with structural breaks with the adf unit root test method the residuals of three cointegration models are given by tables 4 6 it can be seen that the residuals of three cointegration models are all stationary so their ecms can be established as follows 26 δ l n i r 0 956211 e c m 1 0 003390 0

model and ecm with structural breaks the long run equilibrium relationship between precipitation et c and irrigation water are presented moreover the coefficient on ecm 1 is negative confirms the converse correction mechanism of ecm if this coefficient is significant the error correction term in the past will have a great impact on the current change of the variable from the formulas 26 28 the coefficients on ecm 1 of three ecms are all significant which shows that considering the structural break the adjusting speed to the long run balance has been improved typically the coefficient on ecm 1 in model 3 is 0 985688 which expresses that the deviation of the irrigation water from the long run balance will be adjusted about 98 57 at the next time the coefficients on the first difference of variables clarify the short run dynamic changes of model the short run results exhibited in the formulas 26 28 report precipitation has a negative impact on irrigation water while et c has the positive and significant impact the fitting coefficient r 2 of three ecms are 0 800932 0 861506 0 910761 respectively so compared with that of the ecm without structural breaks r 2 0 704918 the ecm with structural breaks has a higher fitting accuracy so the ecm with the structural break can describe the long run equilibrium relationship and short run dynamic changes of variables more accurately fig 10 is comparison the observed value and the simulated values of three ecms model 1 model 2 model 3 and fig 11 and table 7 present the relative errors of three ecms with structural breaks and one ecm without structural breaks model 0 in general model 1 model 2 and model 3 has the better simulation accuracy than model 0 but the model 3 is highest for the relative errors of three ecms with structural breaks the years with the relative error less than 15 account for about 75 while the year with the relative error less than 20 are about 85 in particular for model 3 it occupies 98 even for the relative error less than 5 the model 3 attends to 46 51 and the r 2 of model 3 is the largest therefore model 3 improves greatly compared with other models especially model 0 moreover if the limitations and other influencing factors of this paper are fully considered and the corresponding results of the models will be more accurate 4 discussion 4 1 structural breaks induced by the policies the method of structural breaks is used to detect et c affected by economic policies we construct the cointegration equation and error correction model between ir p and et c to reveal the long term trend and short term dynamic change of the luhun irrigation district more accurately et c is also affected greatly by the planting structure the state and local government policy guidance on land system grain purchase and the price will have a great impact on crop planting area planting structure and production enthusiasm which will lead to the great changes of water demand in irrigation district also the policy has influence on irrigation water but this influence is not enough and irrigation water as a dependent variable is more concerned finally it was determined that the cointegration relationship between ir p and et c has structural breaks in 1981 and 1989 crop water requirement is influenced by economic development food policy and political system etc therefore with the structural break test and the economic and agricultural policy on its impact it is reasonable to think that there were structural breaks in 1981 and 1989 in the water supply and demand system in addition with the development of agriculture agricultural planting structure and land use mode will continue to change and there will be new or more structural breaks in the water supply and demand system thus according to economic and agricultural policies in the future these new structural breaks can be found by structural break test method and new cointegration models should be constructed to determine more accurate relationships between water supply and demand so as to make a reasonable prediction of irrigation water requirement in the irrigation district after the structural breaks are determined cointegration models and error correction models with structural breaks are established the ecms with structural breaks have higher goodness of fit especially the model 3 model 3 has the highest simulation accuracy for the relative errors of three ecms with structural breaks model 3 performed best the main reason is that model 3 not only considers the impact of random factors such as policy or institutional changes on variables but also makes full use of information such as the horizontal value of variables and the difference sequence of variables and adds the residual of regression equation into the model as an unbalanced error term to establish the corresponding error correction model thus it s more accurate and simulate better than the other models 4 2 limitations and future studies there are some limitations in this study firstly water supply and demand system in the irrigation district is a complex system irrigation water is determined by many factors such as soil moisture seepage irrigation measures management level etc so it is not just decided by these two variables precipitation and et c secondly groundwater is another source of irrigation but it is not considered in the calculation and analysis of irrigation water and the k c value is a fixed value when calculating et c but in practice it should vary in the whole growing period of the crop finally only the et c time series considered the structural changes caused by policy changes but for precipitation and irrigation water time series it cannot be involved indeed precipitation and irrigation water are water input representing water supply item and et c is water output representing water demand item although the human activities have an impact on water supply and demand in the irrigation district in fact they have only an impact on et c and irrigation water and have little effect on precipitation however these limitations do not have profound effect on the reasonability of this study anyway precipitation et c and irrigation water are three fundamental factors representing water supply and demand and other factors such as soil moisture are only process items affecting water supply and demand so according to the hydrological cycle principle the results are reasonable although groundwater is involved in irrigation it accounts for only a small proportion and luhun reservoir is the main source of irrigation water therefore the irrigation water in this paper is relatively accurate in addition the k c value generally changes little in the growing period of the crop and the fixed k c value has little influence on et c finally from the view of water balance principle of the whole irrigation district the irrigation water is made up for the lack of natural water supply and demand it is therefore both primary and reasonable to consider only the effects of policy changes on water demand generally this study has grasped the main contradiction of water supply and demand and its results are reasonable and reliable of course if these limitations are considered or improved the studied results will be more accurate and reliable this may be the effort in the next work but anyway this study reveals the long run equilibrium relationship and the short run dynamic change of precipitation et c and irrigation water in the irrigation district considering the structural break caused by the agricultural policies and the fit of the cointegration equation and the error correction model considering structural breaks is greater than that without considering structural breaks this presents a new approach and technology to know the relation between water supply and demand in the irrigation district 5 conclusions in this study the cointegration relationships between water supply and demand in the irrigation district with or without the structural break are analyzed the results show that 1 using recursive test rolling test and sequential test method the structural breaks of et c affected by environment policy and planting structure were detected in 1981 and 1989 the cointegration relationship between precipitation et c and irrigation water has structural breaks in the corresponding years indicating that the policy on agriculture exerted by the state and local government have great influence on the water supply and demand in the irrigation district 2 furthermore the short run analysis amongst precipitation et c and irrigation water find that the et c has a positive and significant impact on irrigation water while precipitation has a negative impact meanwhile et c is mainly determined by the planting structure in the irrigation district so it is suggested that regarding the agricultural development polices the planting structure adjustment policy need to be paid more attention 3 the existence of long run equilibrium cointegration relationships between precipitation et c and irrigation water with or without the structural break however both the cointegration model with the structural break and the ecm with the structural break have the improved goodness of fit especially the regime shift model 3 similarly the simulation values of three ecms with the structural break illustrates that they also have high simulation accuracy the relative error less than 5 of the regime shift model 3 is 46 51 so it may be used to predict irrigation water according to this long run equilibrium cointegration relationship between precipitation et c and irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research is

important determinants of growth and wp of crops in this study the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was used to model the changes in growth parameters stomatal properties and wp of lettuce

ppfd and co2 concentration 400 800 1200 and 1600 ppm the results showed that growth parameters such as fresh weight dry weight and leaf area improved by increasing the ppfd and co2 concentration from

balance water resources and demand greenhouses are developed to promote production quality crop yield and irrigation water management van straten et al 2010 environmental factors such as co2 concentration temperature humidity and light properties affect plant growth and its water requirement brentrup et al 2001 light is the important source of energy for photosynthesis which directly or indirectly influence crop growth fukuda et al 2008 ahmed et al 2020 light intensity directly affects plant photosynthesis and productivity lin et al 2013 carvalho et al 2016 pan et al 2019 ghorbanzadeh et al 2020 kalaitzoglou et al 2021 there are some adaptations in plants to absorb the amount of light these adaptations can be imposed on plants by morphological modifications alemu and roro 2020 many problems in plants such as stem and leaf elongations can be deducted in low light intensities ghorbanzadeh et al 2020 in contrast high light intensities might result in a reduction in leaf area to decrease energy absorption matos et al 2009 pan et al 2019 nowadays there is a high tendency to produce crops in the controlled environment such as greenhouses and plant factories equipped with artificial lighting using light emitting diodes leds it has been shown than different spectra of leds have different effects on plant growth photosynthesis and development hosseini et al 2019 ma et al 2021 seif et al 2021 among them more focus has been made on the red and blue parts of the visible spectrum due to the absorption spectral range of photosynthetic pigment or their impact on the stomatal reactions hosseini et al 2019 aalifar et al 2020 seif et al 2021 co2 concentration is another factor that impacts plant photosynthesis and growth zhao et al 2018 which also attracted lots of attention for its implication in the controlled plant production environments esmaili et al 2021 it is also one of the direct inputs for crop photosynthesis co2 enrichment makes some physiological changes particularly in gas exchange responses of plants ainsworth et al 2007 damatta et al 2010 tausz et al 2013 li quan et al 2016 these physiological changes primarily affect water requirements and water productivity wp of the plants both light intensity and co2 concentration can affect plant transpiration by altering stomatal morphology rozema et al 1999 light intensity and co2 concentration cause changes in stomata development and morphology and as the consequence transpiration in plants franks and beerling 2009 therefore it can be expected that the control of environmental conditions can affect wp there is limited information about the wp and growth parameters of lettuce in the controlled growth environment under various scenarios of light intensity and co2 concentration determining the relationships between wp and environmental conditions can be an essential step in achieving sustainable water irrigation by considering the effect of determinant factors on plant growth parameters machine learning algorithms have been introduced into plant science to model multivariate plant growth problems requiring extensive field experiments akgun and erkan 2016 it is desirable to develop an artificial intelligence based model to predict plant growth response and wp towards environmental conditions among artificial intelligence methods adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis has become a popular method among researchers recently many studies have been carried out on the applications of anfis in agriculture such as the prediction of optimal groundwater exploitation milan et al 2021 hydraulic head interpolation kurtulus and flipo 2012 crop yield naderloo et al 2012 and daily pan evaporation shiri et al 2011 due to the limitations in collecting precise data and the remarkable number of input variables in agricultural production systems employing machine learning based models improves our understanding of the trends of plant response due to various parameters asefpour vakilian 2020 the prediction of plant production and wp is a crucial issue in controlled growth environments such as greenhouses and wp is a complex nonlinear phenomenon that depends on several variables such as growth parameters and evapotranspiration furthermore there is still a significant gap in predicting plant growth parameters under various environmental conditions using reliable data driven models such as machine learning techniques therefore this study aimed a to investigate the effects of various light intensities and co2 concentrations on growth stomatal morphology and wp of lettuce in a controlled environment b to model the plant response to the changes in light intensity and co2 concentration using anfis as a robust machine learning algorithm 2 materials and methods 2 1 the setup of the experiment the study was performed on lettuce lactuca sativa cv partavousi in the environment controlled growth chambers the growth chambers consisted of steel jambs covered with asbestos fire proofing material there were 12 pots in each growth chamber the size of plastic pots was 15 cm in diameter and 20 cm in depth containing sandy loam soil 53 sand 41 2 silt and 5 clay this soil was used for filling the plastic pots which were placed in sixteen 1 m 1 m 1 m growth chambers it has been shown that when light intensities exceed from 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd impose stress on lettuce plants fu et al 2012 therefore in this study four different levels of light intensities consisting 75 150 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd as well as four levels of co2 concentration including 400 800 1200 and 1600 ppm were applied in the growth chambers the led panels 24 w iran grow light co iran were installed in the growth chambers to provide various light intensities as well as to omit heat production by the light sources the absorbance spectrum range of plant chlorophyll pigments is mainly in the range of 400 700 nm with peaks at 600 685 nm spectral range of red light spectrum and 415 500 nm spectral range of blue light spectrum kalaji et al 2017 therefore red and blue leds were used to have the highest impact on photosynthesis and growth of plants the light dark cycles in the growth chambers was set to 12 h light and 12 h darkness in total 16 treatments and 192 pots were selected in this study the conventional growth condition with light intensity and co2 concentration of 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 400 ppm was selected as the control to apply co2 concentrations in the growth chambers a co2 gas capsule was used and a solenoid valve and a timer was installed on the gas capsule to control the release of gas from the capsule co2 concentration was measured by a co2 sensor bz30 trotec germany with 2 s intervals following co2 gas injection into the growth chambers temperature and relative air humidity were 25 20 2 c and 60 5 in all the growth chambers respectively for irrigation the amount of irrigation water was measured based on the difference in the weight of the pots in two sequential time of irrigation evapotranspiration rates were determined using the water balance method yarami et al 2011 evett et al 2012 the pots were used as a micro lysimeter 2 2 determination of growth properties the plant leaves were detached after 40 days of cultivation and their fresh weights were measured the plant s leaves were scanned with a scanner g4010 scanjet hp and their surface area was calculated using the digimizer software version 4 1 1 0 then they were dried at 72 c for 72 h in an

morphology evapotranspiration and wp due to the light intensity and co2 concentration as the model inputs models 1 9 furthermore another model model 10 was defined to predict wp as an essential parameter by having plant growth properties instead of light intensity and co2 concentration according to the table anfis had an acceptable performance in predicting the model outputs based on the 5 fold cross validation the leaf area and stomatal width as output variables were predicted with better performance r 2 0 99 rmse 0 09 10 2 than other variables among models 1 9 stomatal pore length was predicted with the lowest performance r 2 0 97 rmse 0 74 10 2 which was still acceptable in practical applications the evaluation criteria for the test data of model 10 r 2 0 85 rmse 2 91 10 2 were a

85 is acceptable in practical agricultural applications naderloo et al 2012 optimized parameters of the gaussian membership function in the anfis model for models 1 9 are shown in table 2 while these values for model 10 are brought in table 3 as stated before three membership functions i e low moderate and high are considered for each input variable either increasing the number of membership functions for example to five i e very low low moderate high and very high or using membership functions that require more than two parameters to be defined e g triangular type can increase the complexity of the optimization process of anfis remarkably and there will be the probability of not converging to a minimum error amanabadi et al 2019 table 1 reveals that the number and type of the membership functions are selected correctly in this study 3 2 higher light intensities and co2 concentrations improved plant growth in lettuce according to fig 2 a plant fresh weight increased by increasing the ppfd from 75 to 300 µmol m 2 s 1 and co2 concentration up to 1200 ppm and after that fresh weight decreased the maximum predicted fresh weight was observed at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1200 ppm co2 table 4 the lowest predicted fresh weight 74 lower than the control was observed at 75 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 400 ppm co2 concentration also this treatment exerted the minimum dry weight 79 lower than that of the control fig 2 b shows that there was a considerable increase in dry weight by increasing the light intensity and co2 concentration it had a peak at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1200 ppm co2 and then decreased which is related to the internal response mechanism of lettuce to light intensity and co2 concentration the growth and morphology of lettuce were considerably affected by light intensity and co2 concentration at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd the predicted leaf area increased when the plants were exposed to higher co2 concentrations 1200 and 1600 ppm fig 2c the predicted results indicated that the leaf area reached a peak at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1600 ppm co2 3 3 stomatal properties response to light intensity and co2 concentration the predicted results showed that the stomata expanded at 1600 ppm co2 concentration had a smaller length than the control treatment as a result the smallest length of stomata was observed in plants grown at the highest light intensity and co2 fig 2d which was significantly lower than the stomatal length of plants exposed to other light intensities or co2 concentrations table 4 the stomatal length did not change remarkably at light intensities from 75 to 150 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd while decreased at 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd fig 2d the stomatal width and pore width had a minimum size when the plants were grown at high light intensities and co2 concentrations figs 2e and 2f although at 400 and 800 ppm co2 pore aperture increased by increasing light intensities table 4 it decreased at higher co2 concentrations i e 1200 and 1600 ppm fig 2f 3 4 elevation in both light intensity and co2 concentration rose the rate of evapotranspiration fig 2 h depicts that more evapotranspiration occurred by increasing light intensity and co2 concentration evapotranspiration is a complex processes between soil plant and atmosphere aytek 2008 the rate of evapotranspiration changed in 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd by increasing the co2 concentration the highest increase in the predicted evapotranspiration by anfis compared to the control 54 belonged to the treatment with the highest ppfd 600 µmol m 2 s 1 and co2 concentration 1600 ppm table 4 3 5 the predicted wp values increased by increasing light intensity and co2 concentration based on prediction results for the wp it was affected by light intensity and co2 concentration remarkably the predicted results showed that the wp improved by increasing light intensity moreover the effect of co2 on wp was more than that of the light intensity at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd the predicted wp in plants grown under 1200 ppm co2 concentration was 3 8 g l 1 fig 2i table 5 shows the observed and predicted values of the wp obtained from model 10 including various growth parameters as the inputs of the anfis model instead of light intensity and co2 concentration the negligible error percentages between the two columns show the acceptable performance of the anfis model in the prediction of the wp also the percentage of changes deviation between real observed and predicted values has been shown in table 5 that there is a little difference among them 4 discussion the prediction of wp is a challenging task in agricultural water management since the environmental data are sometimes missing using the anfis a model including all the studied growth stomatal morphological aspects and evapotranspiration variables were developed in this study to predict the wp the gaussian membership functions have exerted efficient results to construct an anfis model to predict unknown variables in agricultural problems asefpour vakilian and massah 2018 anfis is a reliable prediction method especially in crop production problems in this study adjustments in the anfis structure included the type and number of membership functions the input variables the high values of r 2 and rmse obtained from the models table 1 revealed that anfis as a reliable machine learning algorithm for agricultural data could predict the growth properties evapotranspiration and wp of crops under controlled environment with a minimal error the predicted results showed that by increasing both light intensity and co2 concentration fresh weight and leaf area increased until they reached their maximum value at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1200 ppm then decreased figs 2a and 2c this is related to the rate of photosynthesis and the lettuce s response to light intensity indeed plant s response to light intensity is not always same and depends to other environmental cues and plant phenological stages hoittenschwiler and korner 1996 ghorbanzadeh et al 2020 also the prediction results of the leaf area approved that increasing the co2 concentration from 400 ppm to 1200 ppm increased the rate of photosynthesis at all light intensities table 4 except for the 1600 ppm fig 2c previous studies have shown that plant increase their leaf area and weight when they expose to high non stressful light intensity givnish et al 2004 moghare abed and naderi 2020 as a result the leaf area is wider at higher light intensities that can be accepted through plant anatomy it has been proved that photosynthesis does not necessarily induce by increase in the light intensity and co2 concentration ho 1977 caporn 1989 sage et al 1989 photosynthesis can be slow down by high or low light intensity fu et al 2012 when co2 concentration is not enough high for lettuce plant esmaili et al 2020 the rate of photosynthesis does not increase by more light intensity when it reaches a certain levels called the light saturation point additional co2 concentrations increase the light intensity required to obtain the light saturation point thus increasing the rate of photosynthesis pan et al 2019 also additional lighting enhances the efficiency of co2 and increases photosynthesis rate and plant growth poudel and dunn 2017 and therefore they have a correlation fig 2 a shows the impact of changes in both light intensity and co2 concentration on lettuce production using anfis the figure indicates that an increase in the light intensity resulted in an increase in the fresh weight furthermore by increasing the co2 concentration the fresh weight increased up to a threshold and then decreased which can be due to failure to perform photosynthesis pan et al 2019 some key points should be considered by the anfis model to find the best and most useful light intensity and co2 concentration one of the most important keys is stomata stomata are the main determinant plant structure that control photosynthesis and transpiration the two main gas exchange processes determining the plant s wue the sensitivity of stomata varies with light intensity and co2 concentration james 1985 vahdati et al 2017 esmaili et al 2020 the predicted stomatal properties by anfis indicated that stomatal pore length and stomatal pore width decreased under high co2 concentrations and light intensity figs 2f and g stomatal development also appears to be related to light intensity and co2 lee et al 2007 it has been shown that stomata morphological parameters alter by change in light intensities thomas et al 2004 which is in agreement with the finding of present study fig 2g shows an increase in stomatal pore width by increasing light intensity at lower co2 concentrations however the predicted values decreased under higher light intensities and co2 concentrations fig 2g stomatal conductance elevate by when stomata pore width increases lee et al 2007 as a result of higher light intensity till a threshold level or low vapor pressure deficit aliniaeifard and van meeteren 2013 2014 aliniaeifard et al 2014 while low light intensity can lead to decrease in stomatal pore aperture and consequently decreases photosynthesis rate due to shortage of internal leaf co2 concentration lawson et al 2010 on the other hand although it has been reported that co2 concentration increases both wp and photosynthesis it decreases evapotranspiration baker et al 2008 in this study evapotranspiration values were constant at low light intensities even after exposure to high co2 concentrations table 4 in this situation higher co2 concentrations induced the stomata to close and therefore the rate of transpiration decreased however by increasing light intensity especially at 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 the co2 concentration was not very effective and the evapotranspiration rate increased fig 2h there is a balance between co2 concentration in the inside of the stomatal cavity and the co2 concentration outside this cavity by increasing co2 concentration at higher light intensities co2 balance in the stomatal cavity cannot alter under these changes and excessive co2 cannot be used through the photosynthesis process consequently the evapotranspiration rate rises due to an increase in plant metabolism pazzagli et al 2016 it is essential to measure evapotranspiration for water resources management in agriculture tabari et al 2012 since it affects water status in the plants predicted evapotranspiration under different treatments helps water requirement management in plants anfis combines the linguistic representation of a fuzzy system with the learning ability of artificial neural networks therefore they can be trained to perform an input output mapping similar to an artificial neural network but with the additional benefit of being able to provide the set of rules on which the model is based this gives further insight into the process being modeled like the prediction of wp in agricultural water management sayed et al 2003 in the present study the maximum predicted wp was obtained at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd under 1200 ppm co2 concentration where the stomatal pore was minimum it seems that due to improved photosynthetic performance and increased growth the predicted wp of plants under 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd was better than that of the plants exposed to lower light intensities increasing co2 concentration makes an increase in the co2 assimilation rate and reduces the amount of transpiration leading to an increase in wp value woodward et al 2001 the findings of this study provide basic guidance to agricultural engineers for selecting the best light intensity and co2 concentration during lettuce production using the prediction data obtained by machine learning algorithms such as anfis the modeling results in this study showed that the best light intensity and co2 concentration for lettuce production are 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1200 ppm 5 conclusion this study aimed to develop a simple and practical approach to model plant growth parameters and wp due to different light intensities and co2 concentrations the proposed anfis prediction model showed that this model provides reliable wp values with r 2 more than 0 99 and 0 85 using environmental and plant growth parameters respectively the proposed model does not only represent a new application of fuzzy logic for wp prediction in controlled environments but it can also be implemented as a simple method by agricultural engineers to optimize the plant growth conditions according to the prediction results the anfis model can be selected as one of the most suitable models in agricultural water management declaration of competing interest the authors

9868,the accurate estimation of water productivity wp and plant production becomes imperative in planning and managing irrigation practices light intensity and co2 concentration are among the most important determinants of growth and wp of crops in this study the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was used to model the changes in growth parameters stomatal properties and wp of lettuce due to various scenarios of light intensity and co2 concentration the lettuce plants were exposed to four levels of light intensity 75 150 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd and co2 concentration 400 800 1200 and 1600 ppm the results showed that growth parameters such as fresh weight dry weight and leaf area improved by increasing the ppfd and co2 concentration from 75 to 300 µmol m 2 s 1 and 400 1200 ppm respectively maximum fresh weight was recorded at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1600 ppm co2 concentration while the highest dry weight was obtained at 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1600 ppm co2 concentration stomatal pore width and length decreased by increasing ppfd and co2 concentration moreover evapotranspiration increased when plants were exposed to higher ppfds and co2 concentrations anfis predicted all growth parameters stomatal properties and wp with acceptable performance r2 0 99 rmse 0 8 10 2 the findings provide agricultural engineers with an artificial intelligence based model to predict the wp and production of lettuce by having the light intensity and co2 concentration keywords artificial intelligence crop performance environmental cues photosynthetic photon flux density 1 introduction water resources have been negatively affected by excessive demand for high quality water by industry and agriculture reina sanchez et al 2005 to balance water resources and demand greenhouses are developed to promote production quality crop yield and irrigation water management van straten et al 2010 environmental factors such as co2 concentration temperature humidity and light properties affect plant growth and its water requirement brentrup et al 2001 light is the important source of energy for photosynthesis which directly or indirectly influence crop growth fukuda et al 2008 ahmed et al 2020 light intensity directly affects plant photosynthesis and productivity lin et al 2013 carvalho et al 2016 pan et al 2019 ghorbanzadeh et al 2020 kalaitzoglou et al 2021 there are some adaptations in plants to absorb the amount of light these adaptations can be imposed on plants by morphological modifications alemu and roro 2020 many problems in plants such as stem and leaf elongations can be deducted in low light intensities ghorbanzadeh et al 2020 in contrast high light intensities might result in a reduction in leaf area to decrease energy absorption matos et al 2009 pan et al 2019 nowadays there is a high tendency to produce crops in the controlled environment such as greenhouses and plant factories equipped with artificial lighting using light emitting diodes leds it has been shown than different spectra of leds have different effects on plant growth photosynthesis and development hosseini et al 2019 ma et al 2021 seif et al 2021 among them more focus has been made on the red and blue parts of the visible spectrum due to the absorption spectral range of photosynthetic pigment or their impact on the stomatal reactions hosseini et al 2019 aalifar et al 2020 seif et al 2021 co2 concentration is another factor that impacts plant photosynthesis and growth zhao et al 2018 which also attracted lots of attention for its implication in the controlled plant production environments esmaili et al 2021 it is also one of the direct inputs for crop photosynthesis co2 enrichment makes some physiological changes particularly in gas exchange responses of plants ainsworth et al 2007 damatta et al 2010 tausz et al 2013 li quan et al 2016 these physiological changes primarily affect water requirements and water productivity wp of the plants both light intensity and co2 concentration can affect plant transpiration by altering stomatal morphology rozema et al 1999 light intensity and co2 concentration cause changes in stomata development and morphology and as the consequence transpiration in plants franks and beerling 2009 therefore it can be expected that the control of environmental conditions can affect wp there is limited information about the wp and growth parameters of lettuce in the controlled growth environment under various scenarios of light intensity and co2 concentration determining the relationships between wp and environmental conditions can be an essential step in achieving sustainable water irrigation by considering the effect of determinant factors on plant growth parameters machine learning algorithms have been introduced into plant science to model multivariate plant growth problems requiring extensive field experiments akgun and erkan 2016 it is desirable to develop an artificial intelligence based model to predict plant growth response and wp towards environmental conditions among artificial intelligence methods adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis has become a popular method among researchers recently many studies have been carried out on the applications of anfis in agriculture such as the prediction of optimal groundwater exploitation milan et al 2021 hydraulic head interpolation kurtulus and flipo 2012 crop yield naderloo et al 2012 and daily pan evaporation shiri et al 2011 due to the limitations in collecting precise data and the remarkable number of input variables in agricultural production systems employing machine learning based models improves our understanding of the trends of plant response due to various parameters asefpour vakilian 2020 the prediction of plant production and wp is a crucial issue in controlled growth environments such as greenhouses and wp is a complex nonlinear phenomenon that depends on several variables such as growth parameters and evapotranspiration furthermore there is still a significant gap in predicting plant growth parameters under various environmental conditions using reliable data driven models such as machine learning techniques therefore this study aimed a to investigate the effects of various light intensities and co2 concentrations on growth stomatal morphology and wp of lettuce in a controlled environment b to model the plant response to the changes in light intensity and co2 concentration using anfis as a robust machine learning algorithm 2 materials and methods 2 1 the setup of the experiment the study was performed on lettuce lactuca sativa cv partavousi in the environment controlled growth chambers the growth chambers consisted of steel jambs covered with asbestos fire proofing material there were 12 pots in each growth chamber the size of plastic pots was 15 cm in diameter and 20 cm in depth containing sandy loam soil 53 sand 41 2 silt and 5 clay this soil was used for filling the plastic pots which were placed in sixteen 1 m 1 m 1 m growth chambers it has been shown that when light intensities exceed from 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd impose stress on lettuce plants fu et al 2012 therefore in this study four different levels of light intensities consisting 75 150 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd as well as four levels of co2 concentration including 400 800 1200 and 1600 ppm were applied in the growth chambers the led panels 24 w iran grow light co iran were installed in the growth chambers to provide various light intensities as well as to omit heat production by the light sources the absorbance spectrum range of plant chlorophyll pigments is mainly in the range of 400 700 nm with peaks at 600 685 nm spectral range of red light spectrum and 415 500 nm spectral range of blue light spectrum kalaji et al 2017 therefore red and blue leds were used to have the highest impact on photosynthesis and growth of plants the light dark cycles in the growth chambers was set to 12 h light and 12 h darkness in total 16 treatments and 192 pots were selected in this study the conventional growth condition with light intensity and co2 concentration of 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 400 ppm was selected as the control to apply co2 concentrations in the growth chambers a co2 gas capsule was used and a solenoid valve and a timer was installed on the gas capsule to control the release of gas from the capsule co2 concentration was measured by a co2 sensor bz30 trotec germany with 2 s intervals following co2 gas injection into the growth chambers temperature and relative air humidity were 25 20 2 c and 60 5 in all the growth chambers respectively for irrigation the amount of irrigation water was measured based on the difference in the weight of the pots in two sequential time of irrigation evapotranspiration rates were determined using the water balance method yarami et al 2011 evett et al 2012 the pots were used as a micro lysimeter 2 2 determination of growth properties the plant leaves were detached after 40 days of cultivation and their fresh weights were measured the plant s leaves were scanned with a scanner g4010 scanjet hp and their surface area was calculated using the digimizer software version 4 1 1 0 then they were dried at 72 c for 72 h in an

concentration 1600 ppm table 4 3 5 the predicted wp values increased by increasing light intensity and co2 concentration based on prediction results for the wp it was affected by light intensity and co2 concentration remarkably the predicted results showed that the wp improved by increasing light intensity moreover the effect of co2 on wp was more than that of the light intensity at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd the predicted wp in plants grown under 1200 ppm co2 concentration was 3 8 g l 1 fig 2i table 5 shows the observed and predicted values of the wp obtained from model 10 including various growth parameters as the inputs of the anfis model instead of light intensity and co2 concentration the negligible error percentages between the two columns show the acceptable performance of the anfis model in the prediction of the wp also the percentage of changes deviation between real observed and predicted values has been shown in table 5 that there is a little difference among them 4 discussion the prediction of wp is a challenging task in agricultural water management since the environmental data are sometimes missing using the anfis a model including all the studied growth stomatal morphological aspects and evapotranspiration variables were developed in this study to predict the wp the gaussian membership functions have exerted efficient results to construct an anfis model to predict unknown variables in agricultural problems asefpour vakilian and massah 2018 anfis is a reliable prediction method especially in crop production problems in this study adjustments in the anfis structure included the type and number of membership functions the input variables the high values of r 2 and rmse obtained from the models table 1 revealed that anfis as a reliable machine learning algorithm for agricultural data could predict the growth properties evapotranspiration and wp of crops under controlled environment with a minimal error the predicted results showed that by increasing both light intensity and co2 concentration fresh weight and leaf area increased until they reached their maximum value at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1200 ppm then decreased figs 2a and 2c this is related to the rate of photosynthesis and the lettuce s response to light intensity indeed plant s response to light intensity is not always same and depends to other environmental cues and plant phenological stages hoittenschwiler and korner 1996 ghorbanzadeh et al 2020 also the prediction results of the leaf area approved that increasing the co2 concentration from 400 ppm to 1200 ppm increased the rate of photosynthesis at all light intensities table 4 except for the 1600 ppm fig 2c previous studies have shown that plant increase their leaf area and weight when they expose to high non stressful light intensity givnish et al 2004 moghare abed and naderi 2020 as a result the leaf area is wider at higher light intensities that can be accepted through plant anatomy it has been proved that photosynthesis does not necessarily induce by increase in the light intensity and co2 concentration ho 1977 caporn 1989 sage et al 1989 photosynthesis can be slow down by high or low light intensity fu et al 2012 when co2 concentration is not enough high for lettuce plant esmaili et al 2020 the rate of photosynthesis does not increase by more light intensity when it reaches a certain levels called the light saturation point additional co2 concentrations increase the light intensity required to obtain the light saturation point thus increasing the rate of photosynthesis pan et al 2019 also additional lighting enhances the efficiency of co2 and increases photosynthesis rate and plant growth poudel and dunn 2017 and therefore they have a correlation fig 2 a shows the impact of changes in both light intensity and co2 concentration on lettuce production using anfis the figure indicates that an increase in the light intensity resulted in an increase in the fresh weight furthermore by increasing the co2 concentration the fresh weight increased up to a threshold and then decreased which can be due to failure to perform photosynthesis pan et al 2019 some key points should be considered by the anfis model to find the best and most useful light intensity and co2 concentration one of the most important keys is stomata stomata are the main determinant plant structure that control photosynthesis and transpiration the two main gas exchange processes determining the plant s wue the sensitivity of stomata varies with light intensity and co2 concentration james 1985 vahdati et al 2017 esmaili et al 2020 the predicted stomatal properties by anfis indicated that stomatal pore length and stomatal pore width decreased under high co2 concentrations and light intensity figs 2f and g stomatal development also appears to be related to light intensity and co2 lee et al 2007 it has been shown that stomata morphological parameters alter by change in light intensities thomas et al 2004 which is in agreement with the finding of present study fig 2g shows an increase in stomatal pore width by increasing light intensity at lower co2 concentrations however the predicted values decreased under higher light intensities and co2 concentrations fig 2g stomatal conductance elevate by when stomata pore width increases lee et al 2007 as a result of higher light intensity till a threshold level or low vapor pressure deficit aliniaeifard and van meeteren 2013 2014 aliniaeifard et al 2014 while low light intensity can lead to decrease in stomatal pore aperture and consequently decreases photosynthesis rate due to shortage of internal leaf co2 concentration lawson et al 2010 on the other hand although it has been reported that co2 concentration increases both wp and photosynthesis it decreases evapotranspiration baker et al 2008 in this study evapotranspiration values were constant at low light intensities even after exposure to high co2 concentrations table 4 in this situation higher co2 concentrations induced the stomata to close and therefore the rate of transpiration decreased however by increasing light intensity especially at 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 the co2 concentration was not very effective and the evapotranspiration rate increased fig 2h there is a balance between co2 concentration in the inside of the stomatal cavity and the co2 concentration outside this cavity by increasing co2 concentration at higher light intensities co2 balance in the stomatal cavity cannot alter under these changes and excessive co2 cannot be used through the photosynthesis process consequently the evapotranspiration rate rises due to an increase in plant metabolism pazzagli et al 2016 it is essential to measure evapotranspiration for water resources management in agriculture tabari et al 2012 since it affects water status in the plants predicted evapotranspiration under different treatments helps water requirement management in plants anfis combines the linguistic representation of a fuzzy system with the learning ability of artificial neural networks therefore they can be trained to perform an input output mapping similar to an artificial neural network but with the additional benefit of being able to provide the set of rules on which the model is based this gives further insight into the process being modeled like the prediction of wp in agricultural water management sayed et al 2003 in the present study the maximum predicted wp was obtained at 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd under 1200 ppm co2 concentration where the stomatal pore was minimum it seems that due to improved photosynthetic performance and increased growth the predicted wp of plants under 300 and 600 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd was better than that of the plants exposed to lower light intensities increasing co2 concentration makes an increase in the co2 assimilation rate and reduces the amount of transpiration leading to an increase in wp value woodward et al 2001 the findings of this study provide basic guidance to agricultural engineers for selecting the best light intensity and co2 concentration during lettuce production using the prediction data obtained by machine learning algorithms such as anfis the modeling results in this study showed that the best light intensity and co2 concentration for lettuce production are 300 µmol m 2 s 1 ppfd and 1200 ppm 5 conclusion this study aimed to develop a simple and practical approach to model plant growth parameters and wp due to different light intensities and co2 concentrations the proposed anfis prediction model showed that this model provides reliable wp values with r 2 more than 0 99 and 0 85 using environmental and plant growth parameters respectively the proposed model does not only represent a new application of fuzzy logic for wp prediction in controlled environments but it can also be implemented as a simple method by agricultural engineers to optimize the plant growth conditions according to the prediction results the anfis model can be selected as one of the most suitable models in agricultural water management declaration of competing interest the authors

9869,process based hydrological models are often the most accurate and comprehensive tools available for answering hydrological questions however the resources needed to parameterize and calibrate them can be problematic for small organizations with limited resources or for management questions where emerging problems require rapid investigation to address this need this study calculates a simplified monthly water balance using gridded remote sensing actual evapotranspiration eta data and prism precipitation data for 223 355 agricultural parcels in wisconsin totaling 2 966 250 ha of agricultural land agricultural management features such as crop rotation and irrigation as well as physical features such as soil drainage and hillslope gradient were compared to identify differences in monthly water budgets results showed that wisconsin was energy limited in most years such that additional precipitation was more likely to suppress eta significant differences were identified with dairy and pasture rotations having the highest annual eta and the potato vegetable rotation having the lowest annual eta rates growing season length was identified as a likely predictor of annual eta surprisingly results also showed that there were no appreciable differences in eta between rainfed cropland and irrigated cropland lastly results indicated that across all rotations the months most susceptible to infiltration and runoff were april may october and december this research demonstrates that cropland management plays a significant role in mitigating or accentuating potential infiltration and runoff relative to variability in precipitation in mesic areas without accommodating hydrological variability in mesic energy limited areas water or nutrient conservation policy strategies designed to target average weather conditions may be regularly under protective or over restrictive keywords precipitation evapotranspiration crop rotations agricultural water budgets remote sensing runoff and infiltration 1 introduction in many agricultural settings managing water is often a direct function of managing land bossio et al 2010 consequently managing regional groundwater quality and quantity requires an understanding of how regional land management practices affect water budgets at landscape and regional scales many process based hydrological models are available that do this accurately and effectively such as modflow swb swat arcswat etc feinstein et al 2012 usda ars and texas aandm 2018 westenbroek et al 2018 however these models often require extensive training parameterization and calibration making them difficult to share or deploy quickly to new locations and management questions johnston and smakhtin 2014 this can be particularly problematic for small organizations with limited resources or for management questions where emerging problems require rapid investigation barnett et al 2012 a critical need in these situations are fast and easily calculable analytical solutions that can be used for data exploration and initial scoping that often precedes the development of more advanced numerical models haitjema 2006 typically the most accurate precipitation and evapotranspiration data are acquired using ground based in situ equipment such as rain gauges eddy covariance towers and lysimeters stoy et al 2019 however as the scale of analysis increases the heterogeneity of climate and soils also increase such that localized point based observations become less reliable tanner 1967 to fill the need for larger scale data remote sensing based water monitoring climate and weather datasets have become increasingly available at a range of temporal and spatial scales huang et al 2019 among these are gridded precipitation datasets as well as remote sensing products that estimate actual evapotranspiration eta based on combinations of remote sensing data and land based meteorological observations taken together these publicly available near real time data could potentially be used to quickly calculate simplified water budgets at landscape and regional scales while the accuracy and limitations of the precipitation datasets are well established the utility and accuracy of the eta datasets are less certain this is especially the case in cool mesic environments where differences evapotranspiration rates due to landcover may not be particularly large the first objective of this paper is to determine if remote sensing eta datasets accurately record observed evapotranspiration on agricultural lands in the upper midwestern united states the second objective of this study is to determine if remote sensing observations can identify differences in eta rates due to landscape features and agricultural practices finally this study will assess how gridded precipitation and eta data can be used to quickly calculate the water available for runoff and infiltration 2 methods and results 2 1 study area wisconsin is in the great lakes region of the upper midwest united states and has a humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa annual precipitation is around 900 mm year 1 and typically exceeds annual potential evapotranspiration the growing season is concentrated in june july and august although suitable growing conditions for some crops especially grasses and alfalfa can exist from late march through early november this growing season has lengthened in recent years due to climate change kucharik et al 2010 wisconsin has a relatively flat topographical range 175 585 m above sea level defined largely by depositional processes occurring at the end of the last glacial period relatedly much of the state s soil composition was determined by glaciation processes with coarse sandy soils in areas of outwash and fine grained silty soils located in former glacial lakebeds bockheim and hartemink 2017 extensive areas of hummocky glacial till were deposited in the northern part of the state which are mostly unsuitable for agriculture and currently highly forested an exception to the glacially dictated landscape is the southwestern quarter of the state known as the driftless area that escaped recent glaciation here agriculturally productive yet highly erodible loess soils are dominant bockheim and hartemink 2017 agriculture is the dominant land cover in much of wisconsin and totals over 40 of the total land area it is known as the dairy state for its position as the nation s top cheese producer and raw milk production second only to california bussler et al 2018 it is the tenth most productive state in terms of corn grain first in corn silage production and fourteenth in soybean production in addition wisconsin is also ranked third in the nation for potato production and ranks first for processed vegetable production bussler et al 2018 this intensive agricultural production can potentially have adverse impacts on water quality and quantity and numerous studies have shown adverse impacts of runoff and erosion carpenter et al 2018 luczaj and masarik 2015 motew et al 2017 qiu et al 2017 a majority of agricultural land in wisconsin is rainfed such that irrigation is only common in areas where coarse soils with low available water capacities are unable to hold water supplied by heavy rainfall events nocco et al 2020 in these areas streamflow impacts associated with withdrawals for agricultural irrigation have been demonstrated bradbury et al 2017 weeks et al 1965 along with the potential for nitrate contamination of groundwater due to inefficient use of irrigation water and fertilizer tanner and sinclair 1983 2 2 evapotranspiration model selection methods among recently developed eta datasets two of most validated and readily accessible are the simplified surface energy balance ssebop model available from the united states geological survey usgs and mod16a2 modis terra net evapotranspiration available through the national aeronautics and space administration nasa both rely on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis situated on nasa s aqua and terra satellites the ssebop product uses a model assimilated dataset in conjunction with modis thermal images to calculate eta as the residual of the difference between the net radiation to the surface and losses due to the sensible heat flux senay et al 2011 this relatively straightforward calculation has proven to be accurate and effective senay et al 2013 singh and senay 2016 velpuri et al 2013 the second eta product evaluated in this study is the mod16a2 v006 eta algorithm mu et al 2011 compared to the much simpler ssebop model mod16 calculates eta from a complex process model based on the penman monteith equation using daily modis albedo leaf area index land cover and enhanced vegetation index evi in conjunction with nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological dataset as inputs the ssebop product is available as an 8 day composite dataset produced at 1000 m pixel resolution and covers the continental united states conus the mod16 dataset is available as a global 8 day composite dataset produced at 500 m pixel resolution although both have been successfully validated at different scales and in different locations liaqat and choi 2017 velpuri et al 2013 neither have been validated specifically for agricultural lands in the upper midwest ssebop 8 day datasets were obtained directly from usgs staff for the years 2002 2018 the 8 day mod16 datasets were downloaded for the modis sinusoidal tile v4h11 covering wisconsin for 2002 2018 these two eta datasets were then compared against cropland eddy covariance tower observations available through the ameriflux amf data portal amf observations used in this analysis were those that fell in the modis v4h11 tile covering wisconsin and were designated as cropland although none of the amf were within wisconsin s boundary they represent a similar climate and latitude as the study area data for the kellogg marshall sites were obtained directly from the michigan state university staff as they were not available on the amf site at the time only amf sites observations covering more than 75 of the year for two or more years of observations were included this resulted in 13 amf sites with 63 total years of observations between them thirty minute latent heat flux watt m 2 observations were screened for outliers gap filled summed as daily values and converted to et mm day 1 daily values were then aggregated to an 8 day value matching the time step of the mod16 and ssebop datasets the coordinates of each amf site were then used to extract the 8 day values from both eta raster datasets mod16 and ssebop observations were compared against the amf data for each 8 day period for each site a coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rsme and mean absolute error mae were calculated to determine how closely each model s estimated eta value approximated the observed amf data for each site and each year the remote sensing eta model that most closely predicted the amf results on average was then chosen for use in the remainder of this study 2 3 evapotranspiration model selection results overall eta data extracted from mod16 and ssebop both reasonably estimated eta measured at corresponding amf sites for the same time periods on average across all sites and years mod16 overpredicted annual amf eta by 9 ssebop underpredicted annual amf eta by 8 considering that eddy covariance towers typically underestimate actual evapotranspiration by 10 25 due energy balance closure issues glenn et al 2007 mod16 is likely closer to actual evapotranspiration for this area when comparing 8 day eta remote sensing observations to amf observations both mod16 and ssebop performed well again yet mod16 had a higher coefficient of determination r2 lower root mean square error rmse and lower mean absolute error mae than ssebop for each of the thirteen sites temporal coverage across the 17 years was heterogeneous with several years only having data available for one or two sites amf data was available for seven years for five or more sites with a max of seven sites in 2006 and 2011 across this time period the mae between 8 day eta remote sensing and amf observations ranged from 2 73 mm to 4 65 mm for mod16 and 4 64 8 35 mm for ssebop mean daily differences across all years and sites between mod16 and amf were 0 1 mm day 1 ranging from 0 6 0 4 mm day 1 for ssebop mean differences were 0 2 mm day 1 ranging from 0 6 0 7 mm day 1 notably the kellogg marshall sites had the largest mean residuals for both mod16 and ssebop which may be due to the energy balance closure underestimation at this site being higher than the other sites abraha et al 2015 overall both remote sensing models tended to overpredict eta during the peak growing season with the last week of july averaging an overprediction of 0 9 mm day for both mod16 tended to underpredict eta for most sites in spring averaging 0 26 mm day less than amf observation from april 7 to may 10 ssebop tended to underpredict eta across most sites through all of spring averaging 0 6 mm less than amf observations from march 6 through june 10 ssebop also underpredicted eta in october by 0 5 mm per day from october 8 to october 31 satellite eta performance for mod16 and ssebop models are similar to those found in other studies for this area ji et al 2019 singh and senay 2016 velpuri et al 2013 although both models performed reasonably well at all sites mod16 was chosen for the remainder of this analysis because it more accurately predicted evapotranspiration across all agricultural sites than ssebop in addition the mod16 model was preferred because of its finer 500 m grid 2 4 agricultural water budget methods precipitation ppt data was obtained from the oregon state university prism climate group monthly gridded ppt dataset from 2002 through the end of 2018 prism climate group oregon state university 2019 this 4 km gridded dataset is derived from a combination of radar and ground based ppt observations although prism monthly ppt data has a coarse temporal and spatial resolution prism estimates in the great lakes region were found to be accurate within an average 2 3 mm of annual measured rainfall behnke et al 2016 the mod16 eta dataset was then disaggregated from 8 day windows to one day windows by dividing each by eight and reaggregated to months to match the prism data monthly time step lastly a value for potential infiltration and runoff pir was calculated as the residual of ppt and eta such that ppt et a pir a result of this calculation is that a positive value indicates a surplus of water relative to eta and a negative value indicates a deficit properties or parcels used for agricultural purposes are taxed at a lower rate than residential recreational or forest land in wisconsin and typically contain only actively farmed lands agricultural parcels were chosen as the unit of analysis in this study because this limits the likelihood that remote sensing data would be observing eta from residential or forested lands agricultural properties were identified by selecting parcels the wisconsin v4 tax parcel dataset wisconsin department of administration 2018 that intersected with agricultural landcover in the wiscland2 dataset wisconsin department of natural resources 2018 and with cultivated lands identified by the cropland data layer cdl available from united states department of agriculture usda nass 2019 the amount of agricultural land in each parcel was calculated and parcels with fewer than 2 agricultural ha were excluded totaling 80 840 ha in addition 32 726 parcels totaling 227 138 ha within 1 km of open water or urban land were excluded to avoid edge effects where mod16 does not supply eta data lastly the tax parcel dataset did not contain information for agricultural parcels in kenosha county in southeast wisconsin resulting in an exclusion of approximately 42 492 agricultural ha usda nass 2018 ultimately the sample used in this analysis was 223 355 agricultural parcels totaling 2 9 million agricultural ha usda survey data for 2018 reported approximately 3 4 million agricultural crop ha usda nass 2018 which compares favorably with the sample size in this analysis after accounting for 0 36 million ha of excluded parcels and known incongruities between the cdl and usda survey lark et al 2017 information regarding planted crops and crop rotations was derived by extracting the majority crop within each parcel for each year 2004 2018 from the cdl annual crop values for each parcel were summarized as a crop rotation across all years in the study using a process developed by wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr staff in conjunction with county conservation staff and local farmers merriman et al 2019 this process assigns one of four potential rotations based on annual crop plantings to each parcel dairy cash grain potato vegetable and pasture hay fig 1 corn soybean and potato growing season lengths were calculated from usda nass survey data for each year with the growing season beginning the first week that 50 of the statewide crop was planted and ending with the first week that 50 of the statewide crop was harvested alfalfa season length was calculated as the number of days between the last day in spring with a low temperature 4 c and the first day in fall with a low temperature 4 c recorded at national weather service station in wausau wi near the geographic center of the state allen et al 1998 everson et al 1978 growing season length is not available in usda nass nor is it readily calculable as a summary value for other grains and vegetables since there is a large variety in crop types and growing practices that may involve short or split cropping periods in summer e g snap beans green peas sweet corn or growing seasons that span winter e g winter wheat and rye irrigated parcels were identified first by selecting those with a registered irrigation high capacity well or surface water withdrawal located within their boundary these locations were derived from the water withdrawal dataset available on request from wdnr property boundaries were identified by aggregating all contiguous tax parcels with the same owner name as the registered irrigation source each parcel on a contiguous property that contained a single irrigation source was then denoted as being irrigated the resulting properties were then compared to national irrigated land dataset estimated from a semi automatic training approach using landsat data xie et al 2019 inconsistencies with this dataset were manually reviewed and reconciled as necessary using aerial and satellite imagery to identify signature features such as center pivot irrigation equipment or travelling gun irrigation lines several physical features of each parcel were derived from available datasets first the parcel boundaries were used to extract the majority drainage class within each parcel from the usda gssurgo dataset for wisconsin usda nrcs 2019 drainage class is a qualitative description derived from features of the soil type that ranges through seven drainage categories from very poorly drained to excessively drained it can be important to eta because it determines how much water will infiltrate vs runoff and how much water can be stored in the soil and remain available to plants for summary statistics drainage classes were coded from 3 for excessively drained to 3 for very poorly drained with moderately well drained equal to zero additionally the 30 m digital elevation model for wisconsin was used to calculate hillslope gradient and the mean gradient for each parcel was extracted hillslope gradient can be important to eta because it also affects how water partitions between infiltration and runoff ultimately each parcel in the dataset was attributed with monthly values for eta ppt and pir annual values for the crop planted and growing season length and summary attributes for crop rotation irrigated vs rainfed drainage class and hillslope gradient the cropland data layer was first available in wisconsin in 2004 which limited this analysis to the years 2004 2018 several tests were conducted to identify relationships between the dependent variables of annual eta and pir and the remaining independent variables first the effect of annual ppt on annual eta was tested across all years and for each year with ordinary least squares ols regression in addition a t test was conducted to determine if eta or pir were significantly different between irrigated and rainfed parcels and if irrigation changed the relationship between ppt and eta analysis of variance anova t test and ols regression were used as appropriate to determine if there were differences in annual eta and pir based on crop rotation hillslope gradient drainage class latitude longitude and growing season length spatial autocorrelation for eta and pir observations were measured using moran s i ord and getis 1992 the effects of spatial autocorrelation were assessed by creating four models using an integrated nested laplace approximation inla huang et al 2017 the first two models evaluated the effects of rotation on eta and pir the second set of models evaluated the effects of rotation and spatial autocorrelation represented by stochastic partial differential equation spde based on a grid of the underlying parcel centroids bakka et al 2018 the deviance information criteron dic for each pair of models were compared to determine if variability observed in eta and pir were better explained by rotation or by the spatial autocorrelation last monthly eta and pir were calculated for each rotation to identify temporal patterns within the year 2 5 agricultural water budget results values extracted from prism ppt data indicated that between 2004 and 2018 agricultural lands in wisconsin received an average of 903 mm year 1 ranging from a low of 710 mm in 2005 to 1107 mm in 2018 over the same time period mod16 eta had a mean of 659 mm year 1 and varied to a much smaller degree from 630 mm in 2008 to 696 mm in 2016 the mean water potentially available for infiltration and runoff pir calculated as the residual of ppt and eta was 245 mm year 1 ranging from a low annual sum of 56 mm in 2005 to a high of 442 mm in 2018 the effect of ppt on eta was tested and indicated a weak positive relationship β 0 004 r2 0 01 f 1 3195 014 37 380 p 0 001 with an additional 1 mm of ppt yielding an additional 0 004 mm of eta this was tested for each year with regression coefficients ranging from β 0 13 to β 0 38 with all p values less than 0 001 fig 2 along with considerable temporal variability ppt varied spatially across the state following documented trends with greater ppt in the southwestern part of the wisconsin and less ppt in the northeast walz and hahn 2010 the difference in annual ppt between the wettest and driest agricultural parcel in wisconsin averaged 670 mm across all years ranging from 445 mm in 2012 to 925 mm in 2007 the spatial differences were also evident in eta with a mean difference of 424 mm year 1 between maximum eta and minimum across all years ranging from 313 mm in 2014 to 560 mm in 2012 the variability in eta and ppt carried through to the residual pir term with a mean difference between maximum and minimum of 848 mm year 1 ranging from 653 mm in 2005 to 1085 mm in 2007 fig 3 linear regression was used to measure the impact of ppt and eta variability on pir variability in the pir term was primarily a function of variability in ppt with a nearly one to one relationship between them β 0 961 r2 0 88 f 1 3195 014 2 323 107 p 0 001 comparatively eta had a much weaker but still statistically significant relationship with the pir term β 0 700 r2 0 060 f 1 3195 014 2 037 105 p 0 001 ppt eta and pir also varied considerably on a monthly basis while eta was low in winter months at a mean of 5 mm month 1 it increased through the spring peaking at 137 mm month 1 in july before decreasing through fall to winter ppt was much more variable across the years but consistently low in winter for instance every month from may through september was the wettest month for the year at least once between 2004 and 2018 june was the most frequently the wettest month averaging 125 mm month 1 pir was also variable through the year due to variable ppt but is was notably negative during july in all years except 2010 the summer droughts of 2005 and 2012 were also evident with 3 4 consecutive months of negative pir mean statewide pir was highest in april october and december at 46 mm month 1 on average pir was positive in all months except july and august lastly of the 180 months in the study ppt exceeded eta 137 times or 76 of the time crop plantings were extracted from annual cdls and each parcel was assigned a crop rotation differences in features among all rotations were tested with anova and only those that were statistically different p 0 001 are mentioned the most common rotation was cash grain comprising 49 7 of the agricultural acreage table 1 defined by field corn and soy cash grain parcels tend to be located mostly on well drained soils with moderate hillslope gradients of 2 1 only 6 0 of cash grain parcels were irrigated cash grain parcels tended to be concentrated in the south central part of the state and consequently averaged more ppt than other rotations with a mean of 917 mm year 1 mean annual eta was lower than average at 648 mm year 1 the lower than average eta and higher than average ppt led to above average pir at 243 mm year 1 dairy rotations were the second most common among all agricultural parcels at 41 3 of the acreage defined by alfalfa and grass hay plantings along with corn and soy dairy parcels tended to be located mostly on well drained soils with moderate hillslope gradients of 2 4 only 2 9 of dairy parcels were irrigated they tended to be located more in the north and east parts of the state and consequently received less than average ppt at 888 mm year 1 dairy rotations had higher than average eta at 673 mm year 1 which yielded a lower than average pir at 215 mm year 1 compared to dairy and cash grain rotation the pasture hay rotation comprised a relatively small amount of the agricultural acreage in the state at 5 9 pasture hay rotations tended to be located in the hillier southwestern part of the state with moderately well drained soils and the steepest albeit still moderate mean hillslope gradient of 3 0 ppt for pasture hay rotations was near average at 899 mm year 1 eta was the highest among all rotations at 674 mm year 1 while pir was similar to dairy rotations at 224 mm year 1 the potato vegetable rotation comprised only 2 9 of the agricultural acreage in wisconsin potato vegetable parcels tended to be concentrated in the central part of the state known as the central sands wisconsin department of natural resources 2013 and in a relatively a small area in the northeast known for seed potato production table 1 among all rotations the potato vegetable rotation tended to be located on the most well drained soils with 38 5 located on excessively or somewhat excessively drained soils and another 26 0 located on well drained soils potato vegetable parcels were also the flattest with an average hillslope gradient of 0 06 a large majority of potato vegetable parcels 88 4 were irrigated at 880 mm year 1 ppt on potato vegetable rotations was the lowest of all rotations eta on potato vegetable rotations was also the lowest of all rotations at an average of 601 mm year 1 pir was above average at 278 mm year 1 differences in annual eta between rotations f 3 3195 012 87 629 p 0 001 and pir f 3 3195 012 29 321 p 0 001 were tested with anova and were highly significant for both spatial autocorrelation was calculated with moran s i and was statistically significant for both eta i 0 45 z 401 4 p 0 001 and pir i 0 48 z 4271 5 p 0 001 however spatial autocorrelation did not affect the significance of the effect of rotation on eta and pir when the effects of rotation were estimated alone using inla models the dic were 4092 for eta rotation and 4512 for pir rotation when spatial autocorrelation was included in the form of an spde matrix as an additional explanatory variable to each inla model the predictive capacity of each model decreased with the dic increasing to 4161 for eta rotation spde and 4511 for pir rotation spde we therefore conclude that the spatial autocorrelation alone was not significantly influencing the observed differences in eta and pir due to rotations hillslope gradient tended to increase both eta and pir with every of additional percent gradient yielding 5 3 mm year 1 of additional eta β 5

excessively drained soils averaging 644 mm year 1 of eta well drained to somewhat poorly drained soils averaging 661 mm year 1 of eta and poorly to very poorly drained soils averaging 657 mm year 1 of eta whether or not a parcel was irrigated had a sizeable and statistically significant effect on eta with irrigated lands averaging 622 mm of eta year 1 and rainfed lands averaging 661 mm of eta year 1 t 315 2 df 243500 p 0 001 conversely pir was higher on irrigated lands at 243 mm year 1 compared to rainfed lands at 217 mm year 1 t 81 15 df 243500 p 0 001 the effect of irrigation was isolated from other potentially confounding variables by taking two subsamples of the data one sample included corn grown on somewhat excessively drained soils and the other included soybean grown on somewhat what excessively drained soils these subsamples were chosen because they were the only crop and drainage classes that had sufficient sample sizes in both irrigated and rainfed categories for corn grown on somewhat excessively drained soil irrigated lands averaged 623 mm of eta year 1 whereas rainfed lands averaged 654 mm of eta year 1 t 55 31 df 29 561 p 0 001 for soybean grown on somewhat excessively drained soil irrigated lands averaged 618 mm of eta year 1 whereas rainfed lands averaged 648 mm of eta year 1 t 31 33 df 7542 p 0 001 the effect of irrigation on the relationship between ppt and eta was also tested by comparing annual regression coefficients eta β ppt for irrigated and rainfed parcels the mean regression coefficient for rainfed parcels was β 0 023 ranging from a low of 0 15 in 2015 to a high of β 0 39 in 2012 the mean regression coefficient was similar for irrigated parcels at 0 027 but only ranged from a low of β 0 13 in 2017 to a high of β 0 12 in 2015 in all but three years the regression coefficients were within 0 1 of each other however ppt had a much stronger positive impact on rainfed eta in the drought years of 2005 and 2012 indicating that irrigation was being used to avoid water limitation observed on non irrigated parcels the last variable tested against annual eta was growing season length for alfalfa corn soybean and potato crops for which statewide data were available from usda nass alfalfa had the longest average growing season at 209 6 days year 1 sd 14 7 n 15 years corn had the second longest average at 171 7 days year 1 sd 9 1 n 15 years third was soybean at 146 1 days year 1 sd 9 5 n 15 years and potato had the shortest average growing season at 135 3 days year 1 sd 7 2 n 6 years the effect of growing season length on eta was tested with ols regression across these four crops and was found to add 0 45 mm of eta year 1 for every additional day of growing season added β 0 45 r2 0 03 f 1 2498 158 8092 p 0 001 this relationship was tested in individual years with the coefficient varying from β 0 21 to β 0 72 and was significant with p 0 001 in each year fig 4 mean monthly eta and pir were calculated across all years for all parcels and compared between rotations fig 5 for all rotations the mean monthly eta varied from 4 8 mm month 1 in january to 121 5 mm month 1 in july with low solar energy there was little difference observed between rotations from january through february and october through december eta for the dairy and pasture rotations increased from 44 mm month 1 in april to 72 mm month 1 and 74 mm month 1 respectively in may by comparison cash grain and potato vegetable rotations increased from 32 and 30 mm month 1 in april to 67 and 63 mm month 1 in may cash grain eta lagged behind dairy and pasture hay rotations persistently through june but nearly matched dairy and pasture hay eta in july and remained within 5 mm per month through the rest of the year comparatively potato vegetable rotation eta was lower than other rotations throughout the entire growing season with the most pronounced differences in eta in august when eta was 18 7 mm month 1 less than dairy rotation eta pir varied little between rotations from january through april and october through december with all rotations within 6 mm month 1 of each other the three months with the highest pir for all rotations were april october and december with 44 49 mm month 1 of pir for comparison all rotations had a negative mean pir in july and august pir was highest on potato vegetable rotations through the growing season except in june when it was highest on cash grain rotations fig 5 3 discussion 3 1 evapotranspiration in wisconsin was energy limited in most years both energy and water are needed to facilitate eta as long as energy is available and does not approach stress levels for each abiotic component of evaporative demand e g air temperature solar radiation wind speed additional water will yield additional eta however when the amount of water available exceeds the energy available to evaporate it additional water will have no effect on eta or may even suppress eta by decreasing the vapor pressure deficit and or cooling the land surface hobbins et al 2004 huntington and billmire 2014 when the ratio of ppt eta is less than 1 the system is defined as water limited when ppt eta is greater than 1 the system is defined as energy limited donohue et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2012 in water limited systems the variability in ppt or irrigation so strongly dictates eta that the effect of other meteorological variables e g wind speed or vapor pressure deficit and physical variables e g vegetative type or soil drainage can be dramatically diminished mcvicar et al 2012 however when the system is energy limited these meteorological and physical variables become more important drivers of eta on an annual basis wisconsin was energy limited in every year between 2004 and 2018 wisconsin was also energy limited statewide on a monthly basis for all months except july and august when it was regularly water limited however it should be noted that the statewide averages do not reflect the spatial heterogeneity that was present in many years at any given time it was common for some parts of the state to be water limited and energy limited in other parts the coefficients from regressing ppt on eta provide a rough metric to estimate the degree of water limitation such that when the coefficients are positive and large it indicates the system is water limited and that additional ppt will likely lead to addition eta nagler et al 2007 as the system becomes energy limited the coefficients will approach zero or become negative coefficients were negative for eight of the fifteen years from 2004 to 2018 and positive for seven years suggesting that additional ppt was more likely to suppress rather than increase eta on wisconsin agricultural lands although this approach does not incorporate the numerous other important variables and relationships that facilitate or suppress eta the results were useful in identifying drought years and wetter years 3 2 crop rotations had significantly different evapotranspiration rates dairy and pasture hay crop rotations were assigned to parcels covered by perennial grass hay or pasture in a high percentage of the years because these crops begin growing as soon as soil temperature warms sufficiently in march or early april and can grow until november these rotations have a longer window in which transpiration can occur consequently by the time annually planted crops such as corn soybean or vegetables are just emerging from bare fields in the first week of june growers are already harvesting their first cutting of hay or alfalfa or grazing livestock on the pasture even though the absolute values of eta are still relatively low due to limited solar energy the quick start of perennial crops in spring was evident in the data the eta for cash grain rotations eventually overcame the later start and daily eta rates eventually equaled those for dairy and pasture hay rotations by july potato vegetable rotations had the lowest eta of the rotations examined in part due to the later start and shorter season horticultural practices are also much more varied in the potato vegetable rotation than in the others for instance season lengths for potato varieties vary from 75 to 135 days all of which are considerably shorter than perennial crops corn or soy in addition growers regularly desiccate potato vines several weeks before harvest to improve tuber quality skin set and maturity for many varieties this means that plants are often killed in august when daily eta rates are still near peak levels for other rotations typically potatoes are only planted every 2 5 years in rotations to minimize pest and pathogen populations with other vegetable or row crops often planted in the intervening years a common choice is to plant double cropped green peas and snap beans with green peas planted in spring and harvested at the end of june and snap beans planted in early july and harvested in september this horticultural practice results in a several week period of bare soils with limited transpiration nocco et al 2018 during july when eta is at peak for other crops lastly many of the other crops used in potato vegetable rotation have short seasons such as sweet corn while field corn and soybean are regularly planted in potato vegetable rotations the inclusion of short season vegetable crops in this rotation significantly reduces eta 3 3 minimal differences in evapotranspiration between irrigated and rainfed cropland one result of this study was that eta on irrigated agriculture in wisconsin was 39 mm year 1 lower on average than rainfed agriculture while this difference is relatively small considering potential uncertainty associated with the remotely sensed et estimation the observation that evapotranspiration from irrigated agriculture was not significantly higher than rainfed runs counter to the commonly held assumption that irrigation increases eta overall some of this reduced eta is because irrigation is more common on potato vegetable rotations which are more frequently planted on coarser soils both of which are associated with reduced eta in addition many center pivot or irrigation systems have dry corners leaving 15 20 of lands unirrigated usda natural resources conservation service 2016 however when crop rotation and soils were normalized by comparing only irrigated and rainfed corn and soybean on somewhat excessively drained soils the irrigated eta was still 30 mm year 1 less than rainfed because wisconsin is typically energy limited other meteorological variables and landscape features may be playing a larger role in determining eta than in other water limited areas where irrigation is more common for instance one driver of this reduced eta may be the reduced diurnal temperature range decreased vapor pressure deficit and reference evapotranspiration observed on irrigated lands in wisconsin nocco et al 2019 this phenomenon appears to reduce evaporative demand by keeping the upper soil surface moister darker in color and cooler because wisconsin eta is energy limited any reduction in evaporative demand would lead to less actual water loss from irrigated systems regardless of their efficiency this finding does not affect streamflow depletion that may be caused by withdrawals bradbury et al 2017 but does suggest that impacts to overall water quantity from withdrawals may be more nuanced and challenging to manage in an energy limited environment further research regarding agricultural eta at multiple scales in energy limited systems could benefit this understanding 3 4 timing of infiltration and runoff potential highlights water quality vulnerabilities the water quality related impacts of agriculture in wisconsin are most associated with phosphorus and sediment pollution due to runoff luczaj and masarik 2015 qiu et al 2017 nitrate and pesticide groundwater contamination related to agriculture bradford et al 2018 green et al 2018 stelzer et al 2017 and bacterial groundwater contamination related to manure application on shallow karst bedrock erb et al 2015 in each case the adverse impact is caused by excess water transporting pollutants when running off the land surface or infiltrating to groundwater two strategies to mitigate these impacts could be 1 increasing eta through cover cropping or other agricultural practices to reduce potential infiltration and runoff and 2 minimizing pollutant applications at time when the most surplus water is typically available across all rotations the months most susceptible to infiltration and runoff were april may october and december while potential changes to agricultural practices may be constrained by the demands of planting in april may and harvest in october the significant decrease in pir during november before increasing again in december may highlight a time period in which the agricultural practices can be undertaken with decreased risk to water quality or when cover crop planting might have the most benefit this work also highlights several examples of rotation specific vulnerabilities first cash grain rotations have substantially higher pir in may and june 20 mm 1 than dairy and pasture hay rotations this vulnerability is associated with low eta and high ppt suggesting that nutrients or pesticides applied at this time may be more vulnerable to loss pollutant availability could potentially be decreased by changing the timing of nutrient application or use of slow release fertilizers that limit nutrient availability across the early part of the season of course these opportunities will be constrained by the agronomic and phenological demands of specific crops last potato vegetable rotations have significantly higher pir across most of the growing season compared to other rotations since most potato rotations are irrigated this may present an opportunity to utilize irrigation technology to more precisely apply nutrients and pesticides e g variable rate or speed applications in a manner that minimizes the potential of infiltration loss protecting both groundwater quality and limiting loss of valuable agricultural inputs while much of the work in precision irrigation has focused on water quantity related issues this may be an opportunity for research to develop approaches and technologies that promote groundwater quality through precision irrigation 4 conclusion this study has shown that remote sensing eta datasets closely match observations made by ground based eddy covariance towers second this study has shown a simplified water budget calculation using readily available datasets can be used to identify differences in agricultural practices at a regional and landscape scale finally it has shown that the relationship between agricultural management and eta may be more nuanced in mesic energy limited environments such as wisconsin this simplified water budget calculation has several potential applications first it could potentially be useful in planning or promoting practices that minimize the impact of agriculture on water quality and water quantity for instance encouraging more perennial or long season crops in areas with fine soils and steeper hills could minimize runoff and soil erosion simply by transpiring more precipitation back to the atmosphere conversely encouraging planting of short season crops could promote more infiltration in areas where water quantity is a concern while the absolute differences between rotations are not exceptionally large in absolute terms at 70 mm year 1 this difference represents 10 of total annual eta in the study region when extrapolated to a landscape scale these differences among rotations can have sizeable effects on total water availability in addition this approach could be used to identify times of the year when rainfall is most likely so that planting could be done to optimize rainfall and reduce irrigation demand by targeting conservation practices toward the specific spatial and temporal vulnerabilities associated with different cropping systems undesired impacts related to agriculture can potentially be reduced the simplified water budget calculation evaluated in this study has proven useful but further refinements and additions to this approach could significantly increase its applicability first finer grained and more detailed of analysis of crop planting and harvest times using spatially explicit meteorological or remotely sensed season lengths could substantially improve understanding of how season length affects overall crop water budgets in different areas this could yield insights to the hydrological impacts of crop planting times and potentially help explain differences observed in this study between irrigated and rainfed crops in addition better understanding of growing season timing could help identify periods when crops most need nutrients and water so that irrigation and precipitation can be optimized against crop nutrient demand second where monitoring data is available discharge calculations could be used to close the water budget equation not only could this be used to validate the precipitation and eta data but could be used to identify water theft or unreported stream withdrawals simons and kruisheer 2019

9869,process based hydrological models are often the most accurate and comprehensive tools available for answering hydrological questions however the resources needed to parameterize and calibrate them can be problematic for small organizations with limited resources or for management questions where emerging problems require rapid investigation to address this need this study calculates a simplified monthly water balance using gridded remote sensing actual evapotranspiration eta data and prism precipitation data for 223 355 agricultural parcels in wisconsin totaling 2 966 250 ha of agricultural land agricultural management features such as crop rotation and irrigation as well as physical features such as soil drainage and hillslope gradient were compared to identify differences in monthly water budgets results showed that wisconsin was energy limited in most years such that additional precipitation was more likely to suppress eta significant differences were identified with dairy and pasture rotations having the highest annual eta and the potato vegetable rotation having the lowest annual eta rates growing season length was identified as a likely predictor of annual eta surprisingly results also showed that there were no appreciable differences in eta between rainfed cropland and irrigated cropland lastly results indicated that across all rotations the months most susceptible to infiltration and runoff were april may october and december this research demonstrates that cropland management plays a significant role in mitigating or accentuating potential infiltration and runoff relative to variability in precipitation in mesic areas without accommodating hydrological variability in mesic energy limited areas water or nutrient conservation policy strategies designed to target average weather conditions may be regularly under protective or over restrictive keywords precipitation evapotranspiration crop rotations agricultural water budgets remote sensing runoff and infiltration 1 introduction in many agricultural settings managing water is often a direct function of managing land bossio et al 2010 consequently managing regional groundwater quality and quantity requires an understanding of how regional land management practices affect water budgets at landscape and regional scales many process based hydrological models are available that do this accurately and effectively such as modflow swb swat arcswat etc feinstein et al 2012 usda ars and texas aandm 2018 westenbroek et al 2018 however these models often require extensive training parameterization and calibration making them difficult to share or deploy quickly to new locations and management questions johnston and smakhtin 2014 this can be particularly problematic for small organizations with limited resources or for management questions where emerging problems require rapid investigation barnett et al 2012 a critical need in these situations are fast and easily calculable analytical solutions that can be used for data exploration and initial scoping that often precedes the development of more advanced numerical models haitjema 2006 typically the most accurate precipitation and evapotranspiration data are acquired using ground based in situ equipment such as rain gauges eddy covariance towers and lysimeters stoy et al 2019 however as the scale of analysis increases the heterogeneity of climate and soils also increase such that localized point based observations become less reliable tanner 1967 to fill the need for larger scale data remote sensing based water monitoring climate and weather datasets have become increasingly available at a range of temporal and spatial scales huang et al 2019 among these are gridded precipitation datasets as well as remote sensing products that estimate actual evapotranspiration eta based on combinations of remote sensing data and land based meteorological observations taken together these publicly available near real time data could potentially be used to quickly calculate simplified water budgets at landscape and regional scales while the accuracy and limitations of the precipitation datasets are well established the utility and accuracy of the eta datasets are less certain this is especially the case in cool mesic environments where differences evapotranspiration rates due to landcover may not be particularly large the first objective of this paper is to determine if remote sensing eta datasets accurately record observed evapotranspiration on agricultural lands in the upper midwestern united states the second objective of this study is to determine if remote sensing observations can identify differences in eta rates due to landscape features and agricultural practices finally this study will assess how gridded precipitation and eta data can be used to quickly calculate the water available for runoff and infiltration 2 methods and results 2 1 study area wisconsin is in the great lakes region of the upper midwest united states and has a humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa annual precipitation is around 900 mm year 1 and typically exceeds annual potential evapotranspiration the growing season is concentrated in june july and august although suitable growing conditions for some crops especially grasses and alfalfa can exist from late march through early november this growing season has lengthened in recent years due to climate change kucharik et al 2010 wisconsin has a relatively flat topographical range 175 585 m above sea level defined largely by depositional processes occurring at the end of the last glacial period relatedly much of the state s soil composition was determined by glaciation processes with coarse sandy soils in areas of outwash and fine grained silty soils located in former glacial lakebeds bockheim and hartemink 2017 extensive areas of hummocky glacial till were deposited in the northern part of the state which are mostly unsuitable for agriculture and currently highly forested an exception to the glacially dictated landscape is the southwestern quarter of the state known as the driftless area that escaped recent glaciation here agriculturally productive yet highly erodible loess soils are dominant bockheim and hartemink 2017 agriculture is the dominant land cover in much of wisconsin and totals over 40 of the total land area it is known as the dairy state for its position as the nation s top cheese producer and raw milk production second only to california bussler et al 2018 it is the tenth most productive state in terms of corn grain first in corn silage production and fourteenth in soybean production in addition wisconsin is also ranked third in the nation for potato production and ranks first for processed vegetable production bussler et al 2018 this intensive agricultural production can potentially have adverse impacts on water quality and quantity and numerous studies have shown adverse impacts of runoff and erosion carpenter et al 2018 luczaj and masarik 2015 motew et al 2017 qiu et al 2017 a majority of agricultural land in wisconsin is rainfed such that irrigation is only common in areas where coarse soils with low available water capacities are unable to hold water supplied by heavy rainfall events nocco et al 2020 in these areas streamflow impacts associated with withdrawals for agricultural irrigation have been demonstrated bradbury et al 2017 weeks et al 1965 along with the potential for nitrate contamination of groundwater due to inefficient use of irrigation water and fertilizer tanner and sinclair 1983 2 2 evapotranspiration model selection methods among recently developed eta datasets two of most validated and readily accessible are the simplified surface energy balance ssebop model available from the united states geological survey usgs and mod16a2 modis terra net evapotranspiration available through the national aeronautics and space administration nasa both rely on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis situated on nasa s aqua and terra satellites the ssebop product uses a model assimilated dataset in conjunction with modis thermal images to calculate eta as the residual of the difference between the net radiation to the surface and losses due to the sensible heat flux senay et al 2011 this relatively straightforward calculation has proven to be accurate and effective senay et al 2013 singh and senay 2016 velpuri et al 2013 the second eta product evaluated in this study is the mod16a2 v006 eta algorithm mu et al 2011 compared to the much simpler ssebop model mod16 calculates eta from a complex process model based on the penman monteith equation using daily modis albedo leaf area index land cover and enhanced vegetation index evi in conjunction with nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological dataset as inputs the ssebop product is available as an 8 day composite dataset produced at 1000 m pixel resolution and covers the continental united states conus the mod16 dataset is available as a global 8 day composite dataset produced at 500 m pixel resolution although both have been successfully validated at different scales and in different locations liaqat and choi 2017 velpuri et al 2013 neither have been validated specifically for agricultural lands in the upper midwest ssebop 8 day datasets were obtained directly from usgs staff for the years 2002 2018 the 8 day mod16 datasets were downloaded for the modis sinusoidal tile v4h11 covering wisconsin for 2002 2018 these two eta datasets were then compared against cropland eddy covariance tower observations available through the ameriflux amf data portal amf observations used in this analysis were those that fell in the modis v4h11 tile covering wisconsin and were designated as cropland although none of the amf were within wisconsin s boundary they represent a similar climate and latitude as the study area data for the kellogg marshall sites were obtained directly from the michigan state university staff as they were not available on the amf site at the time only amf sites observations covering more than 75 of the year for two or more years of observations were included this resulted in 13 amf sites with 63 total years of observations between them thirty minute latent heat flux watt m 2 observations were screened for outliers gap filled summed as daily values and converted to et mm day 1 daily values were then aggregated to an 8 day value matching the time step of the mod16 and ssebop datasets the coordinates of each amf site were then used to extract the 8 day values from both eta raster datasets mod16 and ssebop observations were compared against the amf data for each 8 day period for each site a coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rsme and mean absolute error mae were calculated to determine how closely each model s estimated eta value approximated the observed amf data for each site and each year the remote sensing eta model that most closely predicted the amf results on average was then chosen for use in the remainder of this study 2 3 evapotranspiration model selection results overall eta data extracted from mod16 and ssebop both reasonably estimated eta measured at corresponding amf sites for the same time periods on average across all sites and years mod16 overpredicted annual amf eta by 9 ssebop underpredicted annual amf eta by 8 considering that eddy covariance towers typically underestimate actual evapotranspiration by 10 25 due energy balance closure issues glenn et al 2007 mod16 is likely closer to actual evapotranspiration for this area when comparing 8 day eta remote sensing observations to amf observations both mod16 and ssebop performed well again yet mod16 had a higher coefficient of determination r2 lower root mean square error rmse and lower mean absolute error mae than ssebop for each of the thirteen sites temporal coverage across the 17 years was heterogeneous with several years only having data available for one or two sites amf data was available for seven years for five or more sites with a max of seven sites in 2006 and 2011 across this time period the mae between 8 day eta remote sensing and amf observations ranged from 2 73 mm to 4 65 mm for mod16 and 4 64 8 35 mm for ssebop mean daily differences across all years and sites between mod16 and amf were 0 1 mm day 1 ranging from 0 6 0 4 mm day 1 for ssebop mean differences were 0 2 mm day 1 ranging from 0 6 0 7 mm day 1 notably the kellogg marshall sites had the largest mean residuals for both mod16 and ssebop which may be due to the energy balance closure underestimation at this site being higher than the other sites abraha et al 2015 overall both remote sensing models tended to overpredict eta during the peak growing season with the last week of july averaging an overprediction of 0 9 mm day for both mod16 tended to underpredict eta for most sites in spring averaging 0 26 mm day less than amf observation from april 7 to may 10 ssebop tended to underpredict eta across most sites through all of spring averaging 0 6 mm less than amf observations from march 6 through june 10 ssebop also underpredicted eta in october by 0 5 mm per day from october 8 to october 31 satellite eta performance for mod16 and ssebop models are similar to those found in other studies for this area ji et al 2019 singh and senay 2016 velpuri et al 2013 although both models performed reasonably well at all sites mod16 was chosen for the remainder of this analysis because it more accurately predicted evapotranspiration across all agricultural sites than ssebop in addition the mod16 model was preferred because of its finer 500 m grid 2 4 agricultural water budget methods precipitation ppt data was obtained from the oregon state university prism climate group monthly gridded ppt dataset from 2002 through the end of 2018 prism climate group oregon state university 2019 this 4 km gridded dataset is derived from a combination of radar and ground based ppt observations although prism monthly ppt data has a coarse temporal and spatial resolution prism estimates in the great lakes region were found to be accurate within an average 2 3 mm of annual measured rainfall behnke et al 2016 the mod16 eta dataset was then disaggregated from 8 day windows to one day windows by dividing each by eight and reaggregated to months to match the prism data monthly time step lastly a value for potential infiltration and runoff pir was calculated as the residual of ppt and eta such that ppt et a pir a result of this calculation is that a positive value indicates a surplus of water relative to eta and a negative value indicates a deficit properties or parcels used for agricultural purposes are taxed at a lower rate than residential recreational or forest land in wisconsin and typically contain only actively farmed lands agricultural parcels were chosen as the unit of analysis in this study because this limits the likelihood that remote sensing data would be observing eta from residential or forested lands agricultural properties were identified by selecting parcels the wisconsin v4 tax parcel dataset wisconsin department of administration 2018 that intersected with agricultural landcover in the wiscland2 dataset wisconsin department of natural resources 2018 and with cultivated lands identified by the cropland data layer cdl available from united states department of agriculture usda nass 2019 the amount of agricultural land in each parcel was calculated and parcels with fewer than 2 agricultural ha were excluded totaling 80 840 ha in addition 32 726 parcels totaling 227 138 ha within 1 km of open water or urban land were excluded to avoid edge effects where mod16 does not supply eta data lastly the tax parcel dataset did not contain information for agricultural parcels in kenosha county in southeast wisconsin resulting in an exclusion of approximately 42 492 agricultural ha usda nass 2018 ultimately the sample used in this analysis was 223 355 agricultural parcels totaling 2 9 million agricultural ha usda survey data for 2018 reported approximately 3 4 million agricultural crop ha usda nass 2018 which compares favorably with the sample size in this analysis after accounting for 0 36 million ha of excluded parcels and known incongruities between the cdl and usda survey lark et al 2017 information regarding planted crops and crop rotations was derived by extracting the majority crop within each parcel for each year 2004 2018 from the cdl annual crop values for each parcel were summarized as a crop rotation across all years in the study using a process developed by wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr staff in conjunction with county conservation staff and local farmers merriman et al 2019 this process assigns one of four potential rotations based on annual crop plantings to each parcel dairy cash grain potato vegetable and pasture hay fig 1 corn soybean and potato growing season lengths were calculated from usda nass survey data for each year with the growing season beginning the first week that 50 of the statewide crop was planted and ending with the first week that 50 of the statewide crop was harvested alfalfa season length was calculated as the number of days between the last day in spring with a low temperature 4 c and the first day in fall with a low temperature 4 c recorded at national weather service station in wausau wi near the geographic center of the state allen et al 1998 everson et al 1978 growing season length is not available in usda nass nor is it readily calculable as a summary value for other grains and vegetables since there is a large variety in crop types and growing practices that may involve short or split cropping periods in summer e g snap beans green peas sweet corn or growing seasons that span winter e g winter wheat and rye irrigated parcels were identified first by selecting those with a registered irrigation high capacity well or surface water withdrawal located within their boundary these locations were derived from the water withdrawal dataset available on request from wdnr property boundaries were identified by aggregating all contiguous tax parcels with the same owner name as the registered irrigation source each parcel on a contiguous property that contained a single irrigation source was then denoted as being irrigated the resulting properties were then compared to national irrigated land dataset estimated from a semi automatic training approach using landsat data xie et al 2019 inconsistencies with this dataset were manually reviewed and reconciled as necessary using aerial and satellite imagery to identify signature features such as center pivot irrigation equipment or travelling gun irrigation lines several physical features of each parcel were derived from available datasets first the parcel boundaries were used to extract the majority drainage class within each parcel from the usda gssurgo dataset for wisconsin usda nrcs 2019 drainage class is a qualitative description derived from features of the soil type that ranges through seven drainage categories from very poorly drained to excessively drained it can be important to eta because it determines how much water will infiltrate vs runoff and how much water can be stored in the soil and remain available to plants for summary statistics drainage classes were coded from 3 for excessively drained to 3 for very poorly drained with moderately well drained equal to zero additionally the 30 m digital elevation model for wisconsin was used to calculate hillslope gradient and the mean gradient for each parcel was extracted hillslope gradient can be important to eta because it also affects how water partitions between infiltration and runoff ultimately each parcel in the dataset was attributed with monthly values for eta ppt and pir annual values for the crop planted and growing season length and summary attributes for crop rotation irrigated vs rainfed drainage class and hillslope gradient the cropland data layer was first available in wisconsin in 2004 which limited this analysis to the years 2004 2018 several tests were conducted to identify relationships between the dependent variables of annual eta and pir and the remaining independent variables first the effect of annual ppt on annual eta was tested across all years and for each year with ordinary least squares ols regression in addition a t test was conducted to determine if eta or pir were significantly different between irrigated and rainfed parcels and if irrigation changed the relationship between ppt and eta analysis of variance anova t test and ols regression were used as appropriate to determine if there were differences in annual eta and pir based on crop rotation hillslope gradient drainage class latitude longitude and growing season length spatial autocorrelation for eta and pir observations were measured using moran s i ord and getis 1992 the effects of spatial autocorrelation were assessed by creating four models using an integrated nested laplace approximation inla huang et al 2017 the first two models evaluated the effects of rotation on eta and pir the second set of models evaluated the effects of rotation and spatial autocorrelation represented by stochastic partial differential equation spde based on a grid of the underlying parcel centroids bakka et al 2018 the deviance information criteron dic for each pair of models were compared to determine if variability observed in eta and pir were better explained by rotation or by the spatial autocorrelation last monthly eta and pir were calculated for each rotation to identify temporal patterns within the year 2 5 agricultural water budget results values extracted from prism ppt data indicated that between 2004 and 2018 agricultural lands in wisconsin received an average of 903 mm year 1 ranging from a low of 710 mm in 2005 to 1107 mm in 2018 over the same time period mod16 eta had a mean of 659 mm year 1 and varied to a much smaller degree from 630 mm in 2008 to 696 mm in 2016 the mean water potentially available for infiltration and runoff pir calculated as the residual of ppt and eta was 245 mm year 1 ranging from a low annual sum of 56 mm in 2005 to a high of 442 mm in 2018 the effect of ppt on eta was tested and indicated a weak positive relationship β 0 004 r2 0 01 f 1 3195 014 37 380 p 0 001 with an additional 1 mm of ppt yielding an additional 0 004 mm of eta this was tested for each year with regression coefficients ranging from β 0 13 to β 0 38 with all p values less than 0 001 fig 2 along with considerable temporal variability ppt varied spatially across the state following documented trends with greater ppt in the southwestern part of the wisconsin and less ppt in the northeast walz and hahn 2010 the difference in annual ppt between the wettest and driest agricultural parcel in wisconsin averaged 670 mm across all years ranging from 445 mm in 2012 to 925 mm in 2007 the spatial differences were also evident in eta with a mean difference of 424 mm year 1 between maximum eta and minimum across all years ranging from 313 mm in 2014 to 560 mm in 2012 the variability in eta and ppt carried through to the residual pir term with a mean difference between maximum and minimum of 848 mm year 1 ranging from 653 mm in 2005 to 1085 mm in 2007 fig 3 linear regression was used to measure the impact of ppt and eta variability on pir variability in the pir term was primarily a function of variability in ppt with a nearly one to one relationship between them β 0 961 r2 0 88 f 1 3195 014 2 323 107 p 0 001 comparatively eta had a much weaker but still statistically significant relationship with the pir term β 0 700 r2 0 060 f 1 3195 014 2 037 105 p 0 001 ppt eta and pir also varied considerably on a monthly basis while eta was low in winter months at a mean of 5 mm month 1 it increased through the spring peaking at 137 mm month 1 in july before decreasing through fall to winter ppt was much more variable across the years but consistently low in winter for instance every month from may through september was the wettest month for the year at least once between 2004 and 2018 june was the most frequently the wettest month averaging 125 mm month 1 pir was also variable through the year due to variable ppt but is was notably negative during july in all years except 2010 the summer droughts of 2005 and 2012 were also evident with 3 4 consecutive months of negative pir mean statewide pir was highest in april october and december at 46 mm month 1 on average pir was positive in all months except july and august lastly of the 180 months in the study ppt exceeded eta 137 times or 76 of the time crop plantings were extracted from annual cdls and each parcel was assigned a crop rotation differences in features among all rotations were tested with anova and only those that were statistically different p 0 001 are mentioned the most common rotation was cash grain comprising 49 7 of the agricultural acreage table 1 defined by field corn and soy cash grain parcels tend to be located mostly on well drained soils with moderate hillslope gradients of 2 1 only 6 0 of cash grain parcels were irrigated cash grain parcels tended to be concentrated in the south central part of the state and consequently averaged more ppt than other rotations with a mean of 917 mm year 1 mean annual eta was lower than average at 648 mm year 1 the lower than average eta and higher than average ppt led to above average pir at 243 mm year 1 dairy rotations were the second most common among all agricultural parcels at 41 3 of the acreage defined by alfalfa and grass hay plantings along with corn and soy dairy parcels tended to be located mostly on well drained soils with moderate hillslope gradients of 2 4 only 2 9 of dairy parcels were irrigated they tended to be located more in the north and east parts of the state and consequently received less than average ppt at 888 mm year 1 dairy rotations had higher than average eta at 673 mm year 1 which yielded a lower than average pir at 215 mm year 1 compared to dairy and cash grain rotation the pasture hay rotation comprised a relatively small amount of the agricultural acreage in the state at 5 9 pasture hay rotations tended to be located in the hillier southwestern part of the state with moderately well drained soils and the steepest albeit still moderate mean hillslope gradient of 3 0 ppt for pasture hay rotations was near average at 899 mm year 1 eta was the highest among all rotations at 674 mm year 1 while pir was similar to dairy rotations at 224 mm year 1 the potato vegetable rotation comprised only 2 9 of the agricultural acreage in wisconsin potato vegetable parcels tended to be concentrated in the central part of the state known as the central sands wisconsin department of natural resources 2013 and in a relatively a small area in the northeast known for seed potato production table 1 among all rotations the potato vegetable rotation tended to be located on the most well drained soils with 38 5 located on excessively or somewhat excessively drained soils and another 26 0 located on well drained soils potato vegetable parcels were also the flattest with an average hillslope gradient of 0 06 a large majority of potato vegetable parcels 88 4 were irrigated at 880 mm year 1 ppt on potato vegetable rotations was the lowest of all rotations eta on potato vegetable rotations was also the lowest of all rotations at an average of 601 mm year 1 pir was above average at 278 mm year 1 differences in annual eta between rotations f 3 3195 012 87 629 p 0 001 and pir f 3 3195 012 29 321 p 0 001 were tested with anova and were highly significant for both spatial autocorrelation was calculated with moran s i and was statistically significant for both eta i 0 45 z 401 4 p 0 001 and pir i 0 48 z 4271 5 p 0 001 however spatial autocorrelation did not affect the significance of the effect of rotation on eta and pir when the effects of rotation were estimated alone using inla models the dic were 4092 for eta rotation and 4512 for pir rotation when spatial autocorrelation was included in the form of an spde matrix as an additional explanatory variable to each inla model the predictive capacity of each model decreased with the dic increasing to 4161 for eta rotation spde and 4511 for pir rotation spde we therefore conclude that the spatial autocorrelation alone was not significantly influencing the observed differences in eta and pir due to rotations hillslope gradient tended to increase both eta and pir with every of additional percent gradient yielding 5 3 mm year 1 of additional eta β 5 30 r2 0 03 f 1 3195 014 89 l520 p 0 001 and 6 7 mm year 1 of pir β 6 7 r2 0 01 f 1 3195 014 17 430 p 0 001 drainage class also affected eta f 6 3195 009 79 32 p 0 001 with excessively and somewhat excessively drained soils averaging 644 mm year 1 of eta well drained to somewhat poorly drained soils averaging 661 mm year 1 of eta and poorly to very poorly drained soils averaging 657 mm year 1 of eta whether or not a parcel was irrigated had a sizeable and statistically significant effect on eta with irrigated lands averaging 622 mm of eta year 1 and rainfed lands averaging 661 mm of eta year 1 t 315 2 df 243500 p 0 001 conversely pir was higher on irrigated lands at 243 mm year 1 compared to rainfed lands at 217 mm year 1 t 81 15 df 243500 p 0 001 the effect of irrigation was isolated from other potentially confounding variables by taking two subsamples of the data one sample included corn grown on somewhat excessively drained soils and the other included soybean grown on somewhat what excessively drained soils these subsamples were chosen because they were the only crop and drainage classes that had sufficient sample sizes in both irrigated and rainfed categories for corn grown on somewhat excessively drained soil irrigated lands averaged 623 mm of eta year 1 whereas rainfed lands averaged 654 mm of eta year 1 t 55 31 df 29 561 p 0 001 for soybean grown on somewhat excessively drained soil irrigated lands averaged 618 mm of eta year 1 whereas rainfed lands averaged 648 mm of eta year 1 t 31 33 df 7542 p 0 001 the effect of irrigation on the relationship between ppt and eta was also tested by comparing annual regression coefficients eta β ppt for irrigated and rainfed parcels the mean regression coefficient for rainfed parcels was β 0 023 ranging from a low of 0 15 in 2015 to a high of β 0 39 in 2012 the mean regression coefficient was similar for irrigated parcels at 0 027 but only ranged from a low of β 0 13 in 2017 to a high of β 0 12 in 2015 in all but three years the regression coefficients were within 0 1 of each other however ppt had a much stronger positive impact on rainfed eta in the drought years of 2005 and 2012 indicating that irrigation was being used to avoid water limitation observed on non irrigated parcels the last variable tested against annual eta was growing season length for alfalfa corn soybean and potato crops for which statewide data were available from usda nass alfalfa had the longest average growing season at 209 6 days year 1 sd 14 7 n 15 years corn had the second longest average at 171 7 days year 1 sd 9 1 n 15 years third was soybean at 146 1 days year 1 sd 9 5 n 15 years and potato had the shortest average growing season at 135 3 days year 1 sd 7 2 n 6 years the effect of growing season length on eta was tested with ols regression across these four crops and was found to add 0 45 mm of eta year 1 for every additional day of growing season added β 0 45 r2 0 03 f 1 2498 158 8092 p 0 001 this relationship was tested in individual years with the coefficient varying from β 0 21 to β 0 72 and was significant with p 0 001 in each year fig 4 mean monthly eta and pir were calculated across all years for all parcels and compared between rotations fig 5 for all rotations the mean monthly eta varied from 4 8 mm month 1 in january to 121 5 mm month 1 in july with low solar energy there was little difference observed between rotations from january through february and october through december eta for the dairy and pasture rotations increased from 44 mm month 1 in april to 72 mm month 1 and 74 mm month 1 respectively in may by comparison cash grain and potato vegetable rotations increased from 32 and 30 mm month 1 in april to 67 and 63 mm month 1 in may cash grain eta lagged behind dairy and pasture hay rotations persistently through june but nearly matched dairy and pasture hay eta in july and remained within 5 mm per month through the rest of the year comparatively potato vegetable rotation eta was lower than other rotations throughout the entire growing season with the most pronounced differences in eta in august when eta was 18 7 mm month 1 less than dairy rotation eta pir varied little between rotations from january through april and october through december with all rotations within 6 mm month 1 of each other the three months with the highest pir for all rotations were april october and december with 44 49 mm month 1 of pir for comparison all rotations had a negative mean pir in july and august pir was highest on potato vegetable rotations through the growing season except in june when it was highest on cash grain rotations fig 5 3 discussion 3 1 evapotranspiration in wisconsin was energy limited in most years both energy and water are needed to facilitate eta as long as energy is available and does not approach stress levels for each abiotic component of evaporative demand e g air temperature solar radiation wind speed additional water will yield additional eta however when the amount of water available exceeds the energy available to evaporate it additional water will have no effect on eta or may even suppress eta by decreasing the vapor pressure deficit and or cooling the land surface hobbins et al 2004 huntington and billmire 2014 when the ratio of ppt eta is less than 1 the system is defined as water limited when ppt eta is greater than 1 the system is defined as energy limited donohue et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2012 in water limited systems the variability in ppt or irrigation so strongly dictates eta that the effect of other meteorological variables e g wind speed or vapor pressure deficit and physical variables e g vegetative type or soil drainage can be dramatically diminished mcvicar et al 2012 however when the system is energy limited these meteorological and physical variables become more important drivers of eta on an annual basis wisconsin was energy limited in every year between 2004 and 2018 wisconsin was also energy limited statewide on a monthly basis for all months except july and august when it was regularly water limited however it should be noted that the statewide averages do not reflect the spatial heterogeneity that was present in many years at any given time it was common for some parts of the state to be water limited and energy limited in other parts the coefficients from regressing ppt on eta provide a rough metric to estimate the degree of water limitation such that when the coefficients are positive and large it indicates the system is water limited and that additional ppt will likely lead to addition eta nagler et al 2007 as the system becomes energy limited the coefficients will approach zero or become negative coefficients were negative for eight of the fifteen years from 2004 to 2018 and positive for seven years suggesting that additional ppt was more likely to suppress rather than increase eta on wisconsin agricultural lands although this approach does not incorporate the numerous other important variables and relationships that facilitate or suppress eta the results were useful in identifying drought years and wetter years 3 2 crop rotations had significantly different evapotranspiration rates dairy and pasture hay crop rotations were assigned to parcels covered by perennial grass hay or pasture in a high percentage of the years because these crops begin growing as soon as soil temperature warms sufficiently in march or early april and can grow until november these rotations have a longer window in which transpiration can occur consequently by the time annually planted crops such as corn soybean or vegetables are just emerging from bare fields in the first week of june growers are already harvesting their first cutting of hay or alfalfa or grazing livestock on the pasture even though the absolute values of eta are still relatively low due to limited solar energy the quick start of perennial crops in spring was evident in the data the eta for cash grain rotations eventually overcame the later start and daily eta rates eventually equaled those for dairy and pasture hay rotations by july potato vegetable rotations had the lowest eta of the rotations examined in part due to the later start and shorter season horticultural practices are also much more varied in the potato vegetable rotation than in the others for instance season lengths for potato varieties vary from 75 to 135 days all of which are considerably shorter than perennial crops corn or soy in addition growers regularly desiccate potato vines several weeks before harvest to improve tuber quality skin set and maturity for many varieties this means that plants are often killed in august when daily eta rates are still near peak levels for other rotations typically potatoes are only planted every 2 5 years in rotations to minimize pest and pathogen populations with other vegetable or row crops often planted in the intervening years a common choice is to plant double cropped green peas and snap beans with green peas planted in spring and harvested at the end of june and snap beans planted in early july and harvested in september this horticultural practice results in a several week period of bare soils with limited transpiration nocco et al 2018 during july when eta is at peak for other crops lastly many of the other crops used in potato vegetable rotation have short seasons such as sweet corn while field corn and soybean are regularly planted in potato vegetable rotations the inclusion of short season vegetable crops in this rotation significantly reduces eta 3 3 minimal differences in evapotranspiration between irrigated and rainfed cropland one result of this study was that eta on irrigated agriculture in wisconsin was 39 mm year 1 lower on average than rainfed agriculture while this difference is relatively small considering potential uncertainty associated with the remotely sensed et estimation the observation that evapotranspiration from irrigated agriculture was not significantly higher than rainfed runs counter to the commonly held assumption that irrigation increases eta overall some of this reduced eta is because irrigation is more common on potato vegetable rotations which are more frequently planted on coarser soils both of which are associated with reduced eta in addition many center pivot or irrigation systems have dry corners leaving 15 20 of lands unirrigated usda natural resources conservation service 2016 however when crop rotation and soils were normalized by comparing only irrigated and rainfed corn and soybean on somewhat excessively drained soils the irrigated eta was still 30 mm year 1 less than rainfed because wisconsin is typically energy limited other meteorological variables and landscape features may be playing a larger role in determining eta than in other water limited areas where irrigation is more common for instance one driver of this reduced eta may be the reduced diurnal temperature range decreased vapor pressure deficit and reference evapotranspiration observed on irrigated lands in wisconsin nocco et al 2019 this phenomenon appears to reduce evaporative demand by keeping the upper soil surface moister darker in color and cooler because wisconsin eta is energy limited any reduction in evaporative demand would lead to less actual water loss from irrigated systems regardless of their efficiency this finding does not affect streamflow depletion that may be caused by withdrawals bradbury et al 2017 but does suggest that impacts to overall water quantity from withdrawals may be more nuanced and challenging to manage in an energy limited environment further research regarding agricultural eta at multiple scales in energy limited systems could benefit this understanding 3 4 timing of infiltration and runoff potential highlights water quality vulnerabilities the water quality related impacts of agriculture in wisconsin are most associated with phosphorus and sediment pollution due to runoff luczaj and masarik 2015 qiu et al 2017 nitrate and pesticide groundwater contamination related to agriculture bradford et al 2018 green et al 2018 stelzer et al 2017 and bacterial groundwater contamination related to manure application on shallow karst bedrock erb et al 2015 in each case the adverse impact is caused by excess water transporting pollutants when running off the land surface or infiltrating to groundwater two strategies to mitigate these impacts could be 1 increasing eta through cover cropping or other agricultural practices to reduce potential infiltration and runoff and 2 minimizing pollutant applications at time when the most surplus water is typically available across all rotations the months most susceptible to infiltration and runoff were april may october and december while potential changes to agricultural practices may be constrained by the demands of planting in april may and harvest in october the significant decrease in pir during november before increasing again in december may highlight a time period in which the agricultural practices can be undertaken with decreased risk to water quality or when cover crop planting might have the most benefit this work also highlights several examples of rotation specific vulnerabilities first cash grain rotations have substantially higher pir in may and june 20 mm 1 than dairy and pasture hay rotations this vulnerability is associated with low eta and high ppt suggesting that nutrients or pesticides applied at this time may be more vulnerable to loss pollutant availability could potentially be decreased by changing the timing of nutrient application or use of slow release fertilizers that limit nutrient availability across the early part of the season of course these opportunities will be constrained by the agronomic and phenological demands of specific crops last potato vegetable rotations have significantly higher pir across most of the growing season compared to other rotations since most potato rotations are irrigated this may present an opportunity to utilize irrigation technology to more precisely apply nutrients and pesticides e g variable rate or speed applications in a manner that minimizes the potential of infiltration loss protecting both groundwater quality and limiting loss of valuable agricultural inputs while much of the work in precision irrigation has focused on water quantity related issues this may be an opportunity for research to develop approaches and technologies that promote groundwater quality through precision irrigation 4 conclusion this study has shown that remote sensing eta datasets closely match observations made by ground based eddy covariance towers second this study has shown a simplified water budget calculation using readily available datasets can be used to identify differences in agricultural practices at a regional and landscape scale finally it has shown that the relationship between agricultural management and eta may be more nuanced in mesic energy limited environments such as wisconsin this simplified water budget calculation has several potential applications first it could potentially be useful in planning or promoting practices that minimize the impact of agriculture on water quality and water quantity for instance encouraging more perennial or long season crops in areas with fine soils and steeper hills could minimize runoff and soil erosion simply by transpiring more precipitation back to the atmosphere conversely encouraging planting of short season crops could promote more infiltration in areas where water quantity is a concern while the absolute differences between rotations are not exceptionally large in absolute terms at 70 mm year 1 this difference represents 10 of total annual eta in the study region when extrapolated to a landscape scale these differences among rotations can have sizeable effects on total water availability in addition this approach could be used to identify times of the year when rainfall is most likely so that planting could be done to optimize rainfall and reduce irrigation demand by targeting conservation practices toward the specific spatial and temporal vulnerabilities associated with different cropping systems undesired impacts related to agriculture can potentially be reduced the simplified water budget calculation evaluated in this study has proven useful but further refinements and additions to this approach could significantly increase its applicability first finer grained and more detailed of analysis of crop planting and harvest times using spatially explicit meteorological or remotely sensed season lengths could substantially improve understanding of how season length affects overall crop water budgets in different areas this could yield insights to the hydrological impacts of crop planting times and potentially help explain differences observed in this study between irrigated and rainfed crops in addition better understanding of growing season timing could help identify periods when crops most need nutrients and water so that irrigation and precipitation can be optimized against crop nutrient demand second where monitoring data is available discharge calculations could be used to close the water budget equation not only could this be used to validate the precipitation and eta data but could be used to identify water theft or unreported stream withdrawals simons and kruisheer 2019
