model for hydraulic pressure loss and groundwater level changes is one of the crucial factors in proper modeling and evaluation of land subsidence hazard this paper investigates dynamics of groundwater variations in tehran aquifer by analyzing a comprehensive geological and hydrological data such as alluvium depths hydraulic conductivity piezometric measurements and pumping well information we model the hydraulic heads and evaluate the hydraulic conductivity for validation of the model groundwater level changes resulting from the model are compared with piezometric measurements for the period 2006 2011 the comparison shows a good consistency between the predicted and observed hydraulic head values with the maximum absolute error of less than 7 m and rms error of about 5 m that is about 2 error considering that the hydraulic head values are between 850 and 1250 m this shows the capability and accuracy of the proposed model to simulate and predict the aquifer hydraulic head distribution and its changes the model also indicates high hydraulic conductivity in the northern and central parts of tehran plain which is attributed to the river sedimentation there

tehran aquifer is investigated and hydraulic heads is simulated using gms software to the best of our knowledge none of the previous researches have studied tehran aquifer system completely we study a wide area of 2250 km 2 located between the latitudes 35 10 to 36 00 n and longitudes 50 40 to 51 40 e which belongs to tehran and karaj provinces fig 1 tehran the capital city of iran with the population of more than 12 million started to use its subsurface resources since 1963 tehran municipality with the increase in the population and rapid developments in agriculture and industry exploitation of groundwater has also significantly increased nowadays a considerable part of city depends on groundwater with a major source of water for irrigating green spaces orchards and farms is supplied from the wells made both inside and outside the city area tehran municipality the main goal of this study is to develop a highly detailed numerical model for simulating and predicting groundwater level in tehran aquifer by investigating geological and hydrological data such as alluvium depths hydraulic conductivity piezometric measurements and pumping well information we propose an accurate model to simulate the groundwater level in tehran aquifer the results are compared against the measured ones by calculating variety of different performance metrics 2 groundwater equation the water flow through an aquifer is usually described using differential equations the three dimensional groundwater flow in a porous media for transient state condition is described using the following equation biot 1941 1955 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z s s h t r where k x k y k z are the main components of the hydraulic conductivity tensor to x y z orientation respectively s s represents the specific storage r is the recharge term and t denotes the time in the steady state conditions the right hand side of eq 1 equals zero for simple scenarios eq 1 can be solved using analytical methods chan et al 1978 however it is not feasible to find an analytical solution for complex systems and thus one needs to utilize numerical methods mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 anderson and woessner 1992 in this study finite difference method is used in order to solve groundwater equation and obtain hydraulic head spatial and temporal distribution for tehran aquifer 3 characteristics of tehran aquifer 3 1 geological characteristics tehran is located on the alluvial fans of the southern alborz mountains the fans are settled on the volcanic sedimentary base stones of the mesozoic era khaksar and tavassoli 2002 the alluvial deposit thickness of tehran is about 1100 m and is divided into four parts khaksar and tavassoli 2002 namely as hezardareh formation kahrizak formation tehran alluvium and holocene stage the oldest alluvial formations of tehran region is hezardareh formation which belongs to eocene age it is situated at the western part of jajrud and eastern part of tehran the thickness of alluvial sediments of hezardareh formation is 1000 m hezardareh formation is divided in two parts the first part of hezardareh formation has low porosity high erosion of pebble and strong cementation while the second one has high porosity and low grade of erosion of pebble kahrizak formation is the second horizon in the alluvial deposits of tehran it has a thickness of 10 60 m containing pebble gravel and sand and is middle pleistocene in age the third stage tehran alluvium with 50 m thickness has been formed by stratified gravels of upper pleistocene age in general this formation is composed of heterogeneous grains and because of having frail cement between pebbles it is permeable and with relatively high mechanical resistance tehran alluvium has been the better depository of underground water in the alluvial fan of tehran region with respect to the other parts the fourth part holocene stage with 1 5 m of thickness contains coating pebbles gravel and fine sediments it is composed of separated and highly permeable deposits which its mechanical resistance varies in different part of the region the maximum thickness of alluvial aquifer is estimated about 300 350 m which is composed of the second member of hezardareh and younger formation fig 2 the alluvium depth of tehran aquifer has been determined using the data from geo electrical measurements gsi geological survey of iran 2007 in geo electrical measurements electrical current is applied to the ground and the resultant electric potential is recorded to obtain information about the resistivity structure in the ground parasnis 1972 this method is also applied to identify the under ground aquifers their boundaries depth and thickness as well as the direction and flow velocity of the groundwater fig 3 shows the isopach map of alluvium in tehran aquifer gsi geological survey of iran 2007 it should be mentioned that the average thickness of the alluvium in the study area is 110 m as can be seen in the fig 3 the maximum thickness of alluvium is in the north region with an average of 250 m and the minimum thickness is in the southeast with an average of 60 m the thickness of alluvium generally increases from the south to the north 3 2 hydrogeology characteristics geophysical and geotechnical studies show that tehran aquifer is composed of alluvium type formations consisting of clay silt sand and gravel jahani 2006 in the north of the plain and towards the center and the south of the plain the amount of fine material generally increases fig 4 illustrates the shape of tehran aquifer trwa tehran rigional water authority 1996 figs 5 and 6 show the depth to the groundwater table and groundwater level in the aquifer respectively these maps are derived based on the average groundwater level in 2010 from piezometric observations fig 4 absolute heights of water table are calculated using leveling observations as illustrated in fig 5 the depth of groundwater table reduces to its minimum depth in the southern part of the aquifer and comes near to the surface fig 6 illustrates the general directions of groundwater flow in the area which is from north to south it can also be seen in fig 6 that the hydraulic gradient in the northwest and northeastern parts is large which implies that heavy groundwater discharges occuring in those areas fig 7 shows a 30 year record of monthly groundwater level variations of tehran in the form of groundwater unit hydrograph trwa tehran rigional water authority 2014 it can be seen from the figure that the total decline in the groundwater level from 1993 to 2014 has been reached up to 6 2 m in other words the aquifer has suffered from a continuous decline of 0 31 m year in groundwater level during this period 3 3 insar measurements of tehran plan subsidence satellite radar data has revolutionized subsidence researches the ongoing pattern of land subsidence in tehran is first documented by motagh et al 2008 showing that western tehran plain is affected by a wide subsidence bowl fig 8 illustrates an example of envisat interferogram showing ground subsidence between june and october 2004 recent studies by analyzing two decades of sar data from envisat alos terrasar x and sentinel 1 showed that western tehran plain is subsiding at a rate of 25 cm year haghshenas haghighi and motagh 2019 4 tehran aquifer s groundwater modeling using gms groundwater modeling system gms is a software package which provides strong models such as modflow for simulating different groundwater problems one of the models that gms supports is modflow the first and the main step of the modeling a process is to develop the conceptual model conceptual model contains the shape boundary conditions discharge and recharge sources that helps for a better understanding of the behavior of the model another important step is calibration during the calibration process the input parameters to a groundwater model are modified until the output from the model matches an observed set of data fig 9 illustrates the overall groundwater modeling steps in this study as follows each step will be explained in detail 4 1 conceptual model 4 1 1 boundary conditions it is known that tehran aquifer is unconfined jahani 2006 and therefore it is modeled as one layer aquifer in this study boundaries of the aquifer are shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the groundwater flow situation in the boundaries of tehran aquifer determined based on the water table contour map and groundwater flow directions in fig 6 4 1 2 hydro geologic parameters transmissivity distribution in the area is obtained from pumping tests in 20 boreholes trwa tehran rigional water authority 1996 initial values of hydraulic conductivity k is calculated by k t b where t is transmissivity values and b denotes saturated thickness of aquifer storage coefficient specific yield for tehran aquifer is considered as an average value equals 0 06 trwa tehran rigional water authority 1993 4 1 3 discharge and recharge sources sources of stress in an aquifer are discharge by pumping wells and recharge from precipitation irrigation rivers etc the amounts of recharge and discharge values are provided for the model based on the data from the tehran regional water company trwa tehran rigional water authority 1996 the study area is divided to several parts polygons according to the land use map for each part the daily average recharge value of groundwater is assigned to the model using recharge package assuming that the rate of pumping is constant throughout a month the average monthly flow rates of pumping wells are provided for the model for transient analysis variable monthly recharge rate values are used 4 2 grid frame once the conceptual model is created the grid is constructed in a way that it fits to the conceptual model in this part the number of rows and columns and thus the number of cells for gird are determined to have a proper fit to the model this also affects the running time and accuracy of the model in the presented model the grid is made up of 80 rows and 82 columns among the total 6560 cells 2398 cells are active and 4162 cells are inactive all cells are square in shape with the same size of 1 k m 1 km 4 3 steady state the steady state analysis needs to be performed to obtain the initial values for steady state simulation the hydraulic head data of 2010 are used in addition to hydraulic head data the average values of recharge discharge amounts of 2010 are also defined for the model 4 4 model calibration in this work the hydraulic conductivity is re estimated during the calibration process the hydraulic head data are used as observation which have been obtained from about 100 piezometric wells fig 4 during the calibration the model is adjusted in a way that the difference between the observed hydraulic head and the simulated one for each piezometric well is being reduced to a reasonable value there are different methods for minimizing the error in the calibration process one simple method is trial and error although it is easy to implement but it may not converge to a conceptually reasonable result there are other more sophisticated methods which use different mathematical techniques to minimize the calibration error one of the well known methods is model independent parameter estimation method pest gms 10 3 tutorials 2017 pest calibration can be performed in two ways zonal or pilot point the latter is more accurate gms 10 3 tutorials 2017 in this paper for the calibration of the hydraulic conductivity we use pest with pilot point method it is worth noting that the calibration of model for unsteady state is done for 5 years 2001 2006 4 5 transient state for simulating the groundwater flow in transient state we need to define the variations of parameters in time for the model to do so we use the hydraulic head changes measured between 2001 and 2011 5 results and discussion fig 12 shows the generated 3d model of tehran aquifer which is consistent with the characteristics of tehran aquifer from the measured data as it can be seen in fig 12 the thickness of the model generally increases from the south to the north due to overall increase in the surface topography and the decrease in the bedrock topography 5 1 simulated hydraulic heads to determine the accuracy of the proposed model we estimate the hydraulic head values for the time period of 2006 2011 the estimated values are compared with the observed ones in piezometric wells to evaluate the results we use three commonly used statistical metrics and apply them on all the 102 test points piezometric wells the statistical metrics used in this paper are root mean square error rmse index of agreement d willmott and wicks 1980 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 these metrics are defined as 2 rmse i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 n 3 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 4 d 1 i 1 n y i sim y i obs 2 i 1 n y i sim y i obs y i obs y mean 2 where y i obs is the i th observed value y i sim is the i th simulated value y mean is the mean observed value and n is the number of observations rmse is always non negative and a value closer to zero indicates a more accurate model nse ranges from minus infinity to 1 0 with higher values indicating a more accurate model the index of agreement varies from 0 0 to 1 0 with a value closer to 1 0 indicating a better agreement nash and sutcliffe 1970 to evaluate the accuracy of the model we use the data from all the 102 tests points fig 13 shows 8 test points selected from different parts of the aquifer fig 14 shows the comparison between the estimated values from the model and the observed ones for the test points of fig 13 in fig 14 the observed data are shown by dash lines and the measured ones are shown by solid lines for a better comparison we also show the observed data 7 m error curves by doted lines as it can be seen in the figure for almost all the comparing points there is a very good consistency between the estimated and observed hydraulic heads the maximum error is about 7 m for emamzadeh ghaleh hasan khan well fig 14e considering that the hydraulic head values vary between 850 and 1250 m the overall accuracy of the model is about 98 fig 15 presents the rmse nse and d metrics calculated for the test points of fig 13 similar to figs 14 and 15 shows the overall high accuracy of the model the root mean square error of the results is also calculated for all the 102 piezometric wells and is shown in fig 16 as it can be seen in fig 16 the rms error is less than 5 m which suggests that the simulation error for next period next 5 years will be about 5 m 5 2 estimated hydraulic conductivity one of the advantages of having such model for aquifer is to use it to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer fig 17 shows the estimated hydraulic conductivity of tehran aquifer according to the fig 17 in general hydraulic conductivity is high in the northern and central parts of the study area this is expected because of river sedimentation in those areas in high water flow areas larger gravel sized sediment is settled out first while finer particles including silt and clay can be carried many kilometers further due to the north to south flow direction of the rivers hydraulic conductivity is expected to be higher in the north part of the study area fig 17 shows three main rivers in the study area karaj kan and chitgar rivers trwa tehran rigional water authority 2014 as it can be seen in the figure the highest value of the hydraulic conductivity parameter in the study area is more than 50 m per day which occurs in the north part of the area northern part of karaj river and also in the intersection of chitgar and kan rivers the minimum hydraulic conductivity is about 3 m per day located in the southern part of tehran plain 5 3 anomaly in groundwater level it is worth noting that the groundwater level is raised in some places during the recent years e g see fig 13 this seems to be in contradiction with the fact that during the same period not only the water usage has increased but also the rainfall has decreased the main reason for this phenomenon is the sewage discharge and the use of absorption wells currently there are about three million absorption wells in tehran karamouz et al 2011 another reason is that some piezometers do not indicate the real water level in the main aquifer of tehran this may be due to the presence of a perched water table above the main aquifer the usage water is pumped out from main aquifer while sewage and rainfall recharge the perched aquifers all these factors can contribute to the increase in the groundwater level in some places which decreases the correlation between ground water level decline and subsidence it should be stressed that despite of some local water level rise in perched aquifers the groundwater table in the main aquifer has decreased the success of any modeling study highly depends upon the availability and accuracy of measured data required for a better groundwater flow modeling in tehran more and deeper geological bore holes and piezometers wells are needed to achieve more detailed information about the structure of aquifer identify zones of possible perched aquifers and to obtain accurate representation of the actual hydraulic head conditions in the aquifer 6 conclusion knowledge of groundwater condition is necessary for effective management and protection of water resources it is also important in predicting surface subsidence due to excessive groundwater withdrawal in this work we studied the dynamics of groundwater variations in tehran aquifer and modeled this aquifer as a one layer unconfined aquifer the model is constructed based on the information inferred from the geophysical and hydrological measurements 1 the thickness of alluvium in tehran generally increases from approximately 60 m in the south to approximately 250 m in the north 2 the maximum depth of water level is about 150 m in south of the karaj city and its minimum depth is about 2 m in south of the tehran city 3 the maximum level of groundwater is about 1250 m in northeast of tehran aquifer and its minimum is about 850 m south of it and 4 general direction of groundwater flow in the area is from north to south based on the above characteristics and using gms software we numerically modeled tehran aquifer using this model we estimated the temporal and spatial hydraulic head distributions comparing the estimated hydraulic head values from the model with the observed ones shows a high accuracy with a maximum absolute error of 7 m and rms error of about 5 m these error values are reasonable considering that the overall change in the hydraulic head values is about 400 m from 850 m to 1250 m we also used the model to estimate and the hydraulic conductivity values of the aquifer our analyses shows higher conductivity values for the northern and central parts of the study area which is expected due to having river sedimentation in these parts the proposed model can be used as a base for analyzing time dependent groundwater induced subsidence in tehran the proposed model can also be constrained to achieve more detailed information and analyses about local areas in tehran aquifer these are considered to be the future extensions to this study acknowledgments the authors wish to thank tehran regional water authority for supplying the hydrogeology data and geological survey of iran for supplying geological data

consisting of clay silt sand and gravel jahani 2006 in the north of the plain and towards the center and the south of the plain the amount of fine material generally increases fig 4 illustrates the shape of tehran aquifer trwa tehran rigional water authority 1996 figs 5 and 6 show the depth to the groundwater table and groundwater level in the aquifer respectively these maps are derived based on the average groundwater level in 2010 from piezometric observations fig 4 absolute heights of water table are calculated using leveling observations as illustrated in fig 5 the depth of groundwater table reduces to its minimum depth in the southern part of the aquifer and comes near to the surface fig 6 illustrates the general directions of groundwater flow in the area which is from north to south it can also be seen in fig 6 that the hydraulic gradient in the northwest and northeastern parts is large which implies that heavy groundwater discharges occuring in those areas fig 7 shows a 30 year record of monthly groundwater level variations of tehran in the form of groundwater unit hydrograph trwa tehran rigional water authority 2014 it can be seen from the figure that the total decline in the groundwater level from 1993 to 2014 has been reached up to 6 2 m in other words the aquifer has suffered from a continuous decline of 0 31 m year in groundwater level during this period 3 3 insar measurements of tehran plan subsidence satellite radar data has revolutionized subsidence researches the ongoing pattern of land subsidence in tehran is first documented by motagh et al 2008 showing that western tehran plain is affected by a wide subsidence bowl fig 8 illustrates an example of envisat interferogram showing ground subsidence between june and october 2004 recent studies by analyzing two decades of sar data from envisat alos terrasar x and sentinel 1 showed that western tehran plain is subsiding at a rate of 25 cm year haghshenas haghighi and motagh 2019 4 tehran aquifer s groundwater modeling using gms groundwater modeling system gms is a software package which provides strong models such as modflow for simulating different groundwater problems one of the models that gms supports is modflow the first and the main step of the modeling a process is to develop the conceptual model conceptual model contains the shape boundary conditions discharge and recharge sources that helps for a better understanding of the behavior of the model another important step is calibration during the calibration process the input parameters to a groundwater model are modified until the output from the model matches an observed set of data fig 9 illustrates the overall groundwater modeling steps in this study as follows each step will be explained in detail 4 1 conceptual model 4 1 1 boundary conditions it is known that tehran aquifer is unconfined jahani 2006 and therefore it is modeled as one layer aquifer in this study boundaries of the aquifer are shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the groundwater flow situation in the boundaries of tehran aquifer determined based on the water table contour map and groundwater flow directions in fig 6 4 1 2 hydro geologic parameters transmissivity distribution in the area is obtained from pumping tests in 20 boreholes trwa tehran rigional water authority 1996 initial values of hydraulic conductivity k is calculated by k t b where t is transmissivity values and b denotes saturated thickness of aquifer storage coefficient specific yield for tehran aquifer is considered as an average value equals 0 06 trwa tehran rigional water authority 1993 4 1 3 discharge and recharge sources sources of stress in an aquifer are discharge by pumping wells and recharge from precipitation irrigation rivers etc the amounts of recharge and discharge values are provided for the model based on the data from the tehran regional water company trwa tehran rigional water authority 1996 the study area is divided to several parts polygons according to the land use map for each part the daily average recharge value of groundwater is assigned to the model using recharge package assuming that the rate of pumping is constant throughout a month the average monthly flow rates of pumping wells are provided for the model for transient analysis variable monthly recharge rate values are used 4 2 grid frame once the conceptual model is created the grid is constructed in a way that it fits to the conceptual model in this part the number of rows and columns and thus the number of cells for gird are determined to have a proper fit to the model this also affects the running time and accuracy of the model in the presented model the grid is made up of 80 rows and 82 columns among the total 6560 cells 2398 cells are active and 4162 cells are inactive all cells are square in shape with the same size of 1 k m 1 km 4 3 steady state the steady state analysis needs to be performed to obtain the initial values for steady state simulation the hydraulic head data of 2010 are used in addition to hydraulic head data the average values of recharge discharge amounts of 2010 are also defined for the model 4 4 model calibration in this work the hydraulic conductivity is re estimated during the calibration process the hydraulic head data are used as observation which have been obtained from about 100 piezometric wells fig 4 during the calibration the model is adjusted in a way that the difference between the observed hydraulic head and the simulated one for each piezometric well is being reduced to a reasonable value there are different methods for minimizing the error in the calibration process one simple method is trial and error although it is easy to implement but it may not converge to a conceptually reasonable result there are other more sophisticated methods which use different mathematical techniques to minimize the calibration error one of the well known methods is model independent parameter estimation method pest gms 10 3 tutorials 2017 pest calibration can be performed in two ways zonal or pilot point the latter is more accurate gms 10 3 tutorials 2017 in this paper for the calibration of the hydraulic conductivity we use pest with pilot point method it is worth noting that the calibration of model for unsteady state is done for 5 years 2001 2006 4 5 transient state for simulating the groundwater flow in transient state we need to define the variations of parameters in time for the model to do so we use the hydraulic head changes measured between 2001 and 2011 5 results and discussion fig 12 shows the generated 3d model of tehran aquifer which is consistent with the characteristics of tehran aquifer from the measured data as it can be seen in fig 12 the thickness of the model generally increases from the south to the north due to overall increase in the surface topography and the decrease in the bedrock topography 5 1 simulated hydraulic heads to determine the accuracy of the proposed model we estimate the hydraulic head values for the time period of 2006 2011 the estimated values are compared with the observed ones in piezometric wells to evaluate the results we use three commonly used statistical metrics and apply them on all the 102 test points piezometric wells the statistical metrics used in this paper are root mean square error rmse index of agreement d willmott and wicks 1980 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 these metrics are defined as 2 rmse i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 n 3 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 4 d 1 i 1 n y i sim y i obs 2 i 1 n y i sim y i obs y i obs y mean 2 where y i obs is the i th observed value y i sim is the i th simulated value y mean is the mean observed value and n is the number of observations rmse is always non negative and a value closer to zero indicates a more accurate model nse ranges from minus infinity to 1 0 with higher values indicating a more accurate model the index of agreement varies from 0 0 to 1 0 with a value closer to 1 0 indicating a better agreement nash and sutcliffe 1970 to evaluate the accuracy of the model we use the data from all the 102 tests points fig 13 shows 8 test points selected from different parts of the aquifer fig 14 shows the comparison between the estimated values from the model and the observed ones for the test points of fig 13 in fig 14 the observed data are shown by dash lines and the measured ones are shown by solid lines for a better comparison we also show the observed data 7 m error curves by doted lines as it can be seen in the figure for almost all the comparing points there is a very good consistency between the estimated and observed hydraulic heads the maximum error is about 7 m for emamzadeh ghaleh hasan khan well fig 14e considering that the hydraulic head values vary between 850 and 1250 m the overall accuracy of the model is about 98 fig 15 presents the rmse nse and d metrics calculated for the test points of fig 13 similar to figs 14 and 15 shows the overall high accuracy of the model the root mean square error of the results is also calculated for all the 102 piezometric wells and is shown in fig 16 as it can be seen in fig 16 the rms error is less than 5 m which suggests that the simulation error for next period next 5 years will be about 5 m 5 2 estimated hydraulic conductivity one of the advantages of having such model for aquifer is to use it to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer fig 17 shows the estimated hydraulic conductivity of tehran aquifer according to the fig 17 in general hydraulic conductivity is high in the northern and central parts of the study area this is expected because of river sedimentation in those areas in high water flow areas larger gravel sized sediment is settled out first while finer particles including silt and clay can be carried many kilometers further due to the north to south flow direction of the rivers hydraulic conductivity is expected to be higher in the north part of the study area fig 17 shows three main rivers in the study area karaj kan and chitgar rivers trwa tehran rigional water authority 2014 as it can be seen in the figure the highest value of the hydraulic conductivity parameter in the study area is more than 50 m per day which occurs in the north part of the area northern part of karaj river and also in the intersection of chitgar and kan rivers the minimum hydraulic conductivity is about 3 m per day located in the southern part of tehran plain 5 3 anomaly in groundwater level it is worth noting that the groundwater level is raised in some places during the recent years e g see fig 13 this seems to be in contradiction with the fact that during the same period not only the water usage has increased but also the rainfall has decreased the main reason for this phenomenon is the sewage discharge and the use of absorption wells currently there are about three million absorption wells in tehran karamouz et al 2011 another reason is that some piezometers do not indicate the real water level in the main aquifer of tehran this may be due to the presence of a perched water table above the main aquifer the usage water is pumped out from main aquifer while sewage and rainfall recharge the perched aquifers all these factors can contribute to the increase in the groundwater level in some places which decreases the correlation between ground water level decline and subsidence it should be stressed that despite of some local water level rise in perched aquifers the groundwater table in the main aquifer has decreased the success of any modeling study highly depends upon the availability and accuracy of measured data required for a better groundwater flow modeling in tehran more and deeper geological bore holes and piezometers wells are needed to achieve more detailed information about the structure of aquifer identify zones of possible perched aquifers and to obtain accurate representation of the actual hydraulic head conditions in the aquifer 6 conclusion knowledge of groundwater condition is necessary for effective management and protection of water resources it is also important in predicting surface subsidence due to excessive groundwater withdrawal in this work we studied the dynamics of groundwater variations in tehran aquifer and modeled this aquifer as a one layer unconfined aquifer the model is constructed based on the information inferred from the geophysical and hydrological measurements 1 the thickness of alluvium in tehran generally increases from approximately 60 m in the south to approximately 250 m in the north 2 the maximum depth of water level is about 150 m in south of the karaj city and its minimum depth is about 2 m in south of the tehran city 3 the maximum level of groundwater is about 1250 m in northeast of tehran aquifer and its minimum is about 850 m south of it and 4 general direction of groundwater flow in the area is from north to south based on the above characteristics and using gms software we numerically modeled tehran aquifer using this model we estimated the temporal and spatial hydraulic head distributions comparing the estimated hydraulic head values from the model with the observed ones shows a high accuracy with a maximum absolute error of 7 m and rms error of about 5 m these error values are reasonable considering that the overall change in the hydraulic head values is about 400 m from 850 m to 1250 m we also used the model to estimate and the hydraulic conductivity values of the aquifer our analyses shows higher conductivity values for the northern and central parts of the study area which is expected due to having river sedimentation in these parts the proposed model can be used as a base for analyzing time dependent groundwater induced subsidence in tehran the proposed model can also be constrained to achieve more detailed information and analyses about local areas in tehran aquifer these are considered to be the future extensions to this study acknowledgments the authors wish to thank tehran

12301,effluents and mine waste from artisanal mining in kokoteasua a community in ghana are discharged directly to the environment without prior treatment and have the potential of polluting the soil and water resources that the populace rely on for their daily water need therefore this study has assessed the impact of the artisanal mining activities on the soil and water resources in the community the method employed involved mapping the water supply points in the community and sampling the water supply points and the soil at 20 cm and 40 cm depths to determine their heavy metal levels i e fe pb zn as mn cu and hg the water quality was assessed using the world health organisation who guideline values for drinking water while pollution indices were used to evaluate the levels of soil pollution the results generally indicated that groundwater in the community is potable but unsuitable for drinking in isolated locations due to high levels of as and zn the stream however recorded high levels of mn fe and ph above the acceptable who drinking water guidelines again the study found the soil to be extremely polluted with all the measured heavy metals except hg from contamination factor enrichment factor geo accumulation index and pollution load index assessments thus the artisanal mining needs to be regulated to protect the water resource and soil from further pollution graphical abstract nearness of water supply points to the artisanal mining site in the study community image 1 keywords groundwater artisanal mining heavy metals pollution indices ghana 1 introduction groundwater constitutes about 97 of the available freshwater on earth and forms an important component of the water cycle delluer 1999 it serves as a source of potable water for agriculture industry and domestic use as well as in helping to maintain soil moisture wetlands and stream flows in many parts of the world oladeji et al 2012 qiu 2010 estimated that groundwater constitutes about 70 and 40 of the total water resources used respectively for domestic and irrigation purposes in china nickson et al 2005 also estimated that about one third of global population depend on groundwater as their source of potable water in ghana groundwater serves as the main source of sustainable water supply for the populace living in rural communities and emerging communities in the urban areas duah and xu 2006 groundwater of good quality is very important to these communities because it is their main source of potable water for drinking and domestic purposes commonly anthropogenic activities such as farming indiscriminate waste disposal and mining among others significantly influence groundwater quality either directly or indirectly teaf et al 2006 for instance mining activities generate waste such as waste rock tailings and effluents at the various stages of processing the ore which have the potential to leach through the soil into aquifers and directly pollute groundwater johnson and hallberg 2005 a typical pollution of groundwater from effluents of mine waste is reported by obiadi et al 2016 at a coal mine in the enugu area of nigeria which contaminated surface water and shallow groundwater with high levels of acidity iron and sulphate studies by mallo 2011 also found that effluents from mines usually have very low ph which causes acid mine drainage and ends up in water bodies including groundwater oladipo et al 2014 similarly found evidence of heavy metal contamination of groundwater as a result of illegal mining activities in zamfara state nigeria ghana is known to be one of the major gold producers globally and the mining sector is believed to contribute significantly to the gross foreign earnings of the country artisanal gold mining has been on the increase in the country and it is said to be a major contributor of metals in water resources due to indiscriminate use of mercury hg and other harmful chemicals in the mining activities donkor et al 2006 globally small scale mining is noted to be a major contributor to the pollution of water resources because it makes use of huge volumes of water thereby polluting the water resources cunningham et al 2005 owens et al 2005 most artisanal mining operators have no concession of their own and thus operates illegally therefore their operations are naturally furtive and clandestine thereby operating uncontrollably within the concessions of large scale mining companies or in areas that are prohibited from mining such as around forest reserves water bodies or environmentally sensitive areas appiah 1998 as a result their operations are often not regulated leading to the use of unsafe chemicals in extracting the gold these chemicals are usually discharged uncontrollably into the ecosystem meech et al 1998 and leads to contamination of the environment several methods have been used to analyze the quality of soil and water at places with significant mining activities awadh 2013 used the geo accumulation igeo index to assess soil contamination in such an area by comparing the heavy metal concentrations to their crustal levels and found that the concentrations in the soil were above the crustal levels thus signifying that the soil has been contaminated likuku et al 2013 on the other hand used enrichment factor pollution load index the degree of contamination and geo accumulation index to evaluate heavy metal concentration in the soils again boateng et al 2012 used geo accumulation index pollution load index and contamination factor to assess the geochemical impact on the soil quality of a reclaimed tailings dam in analysing the water quality in such environments the world health organisation who guidelines for assessing suitability of drinking water who 2011 are commonly utilised for instance oladipo et al 2014 analysed the concentration of heavy metals in groundwater at zamfara state nigeria by comparing the measured parameters in the groundwater samples with the who guideline values and water quality standards from the federal environmental protection agency nigeria 1998 similarly abdul rahaman et al 2014 analysed possible groundwater contamination in a mining community in ghana by determining the concentration of heavy metals in the water and comparing them with the who guideline values for drinking water in recent times artisanal mining has been on the rise in kokoteasua a community within the obuasi municipality in ghana unfortunately the waste rock tailings and effluents from the mining activities are directly discharged into the environment and stream in the area these have the potential of polluting the surface water and shallow aquifers that the populace relies on as their main source of water supply and thus pose a serious threat to their health if not curbed therefore this study aims to assess the effect of artisanal mining on the quality of soil and water resources in a typical artisanal community using kokoteasua as a case study 2 methodology 2 1 study area description kokoteasua kts shown in fig 1 is a suburb of obuasi municipality and is located in the southern part of ashanti region of ghana at about 64 km from kumasi the municipality is bounded to the east by the adansi south district west by amansie central district north by the adansi north district and south by upper denkyira district of central region bempah et al 2013 it is precisely located within latitudes 1 39 54 to 1 40 18 w and longitudes 6 12 54 to 6 12 34 n the topography of the area is gently undulating to hilly annual rainfall in the area ranges from 1250 mm to 1750 mm whereas the mean annual temperature is 25 5 c with relative humidity peaking between 75 and 80 boateng et al 2012 the area is underlained by meta sedimentary and meta volcanic rocks of the birimian formation kesse 1985 nude et al 2012 the meta sedimentary rocks occupy the north western half of the area and comprise low grade metamorphosed rocks that are associated with mica rich basin type granitoid kesse 1985 nude et al 2011 the meta volcanic group is separated from the meta sedimentary group by the main obuasi mineralized shear zone and is dominated by basalts intercalated with pyroclastic rocks which are also associated with the hornblende rich belt type granitoid kesse 1985 nude et al 2012 high sulphide type gold mineralization constitutes the gold ore in the area while pyrites and arsenopyrites are the pathfinders osae et al 1995 the mineralization has fe as pd sb cu zn s and au as the key geochemical signatures and are used to classify the ore oberthu et al 1994 gold mineralization in the area is structurally controlled 2 2 mapping and sampling water supply points in the community including boreholes hand dug wells springs and stream were mapped with the aid of a geographic position system gps these supply points were plotted on the topographic map of the area and further used in creating a buffer map to show the number of supply points within 100 m 200 m 300 m and beyond 400 m radius from the active mining area based on government regulation on minimum required distance from active mining to water points the drainage map was also used to determine the flow direction and its linkage to the mineral processing sites where effluents are discharged directly to the stream it as well aided in planning the sampling points for the study shown in fig 1 the samples were taken at the upstream downstream and close to the active mining and processing zones in the study area to evaluate the quality of the water resources and soil around the active mining and processing areas where effluents are directly discharged to the environment the samples upstream were mainly to serve as control points in total fourteen 14 water samples were taken within the study area from fourteen 14 sampling points on two occasions i e in april prior to the rainy season and november after rainy season the sampling points included six 6 from boreholes two 2 from hand dug wells two 2 from springs one 1 from a pit at the artisanal mining site where groundwater is pumped out and three 3 from the stream the water samples were acidified with nitric acid hno3 to keep it in oxidation state and set the ph of both the samples and standards equal the sampling storage and transportation of the water to the laboratory were done following standard protocols apha 1995 to ensure consistency and data quality in addition twenty 20 soil samples were taken from ten 10 different locations at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm with the aid of a hand augur for the study fig 1 these soil samples were put in plastic bags and sent to the laboratory for measurement of their heavy metal concentrations 2 3 laboratory analysis and pollution indices in drinking water quality assessments priority is usually given to parameters which are known to be of concern to human health and potability when present in significant concentrations in the water source ponsadailakshmi et al 2018 therefore heavy metals i e fe pb zn as cu mn and hg in both the water and soil samples were measured in the laboratory using the icp oes analyzer following standard procedures mccomb et al 2014 the icp was first initialized and the plasma allowed to stabilize for 15 min tuning was then done to determine if the icp is in good condition to start analysing samples to achieve this the tuning solution was first analysed and the intensities observed by the instruments were monitored against the expected intensities of the tuning solution the instrument was tuned using a 10 ppb solution which contains li pb tl and y the instrument was calibrated before analysing the samples with a blank and appropriate calibration standard calibration standards of 1 10 50 and 100 ppb were used to calibrate the instrument and only r2 above 0 999 was accepted the calibration was verified with a 10 ppb and 50 ppb standard followed by the analysis of the samples with appropriate internal standard i e sc ge in rh tb lu and ir the measured concentration of the heavy metals in the water samples were compared with the who guideline values for drinking water who 2011 however pollution indices such as the contamination factor cf enrichment factor ef geo accumulation index igeo and pollution load index pli were used to evaluate the metal pollution of the heavy metal concentrations in the soil these indices helped in assessing the presence and intensities of anthropogenic contaminants in the surface soil the contamination factor cf as expressed in equation 1 is the ratio of the measured concentration of an element to the background concentration of that same element and represents the individual impact of each trace metal on the sediments olatunji et al 2009 it was used to evalute the level of contamination of the measured parameters in the soil mathematically the cf is expressed as 1 c f c m c b where cm is the measured concentration of the element and cb is the background concentration of that same element the martin and meybeck classification shown in table 1 a was used to classify the degree of heavy metal contamination of the soil the enrichment factor ef which is also used to evaluate the anthropogenic effect on the soil by computing the difference between metals from anthropogenic source and that of a geogenic source buat menard and chesselet 1979 ismaeel and kusag 2012 was used to evaluate how the soil is enriched with the measured parameters in computing the ef al was used as a reference element to standardize the heavy metal concentration taylor 1964 mathematically ef is computed using the relation in equation 2 2 e f c m c b c m r e f c b r e f where cm is the measured concentration of the element and cb is background concentration of the measured element cmref is the measured concentration of the reference element while cbref is the background concentration of the reference element the buat menard and chesselet 1979 classification shown in table 1b was used to classify the level of enrichment of the soil geo accumulation index igeo as expressed in equation 3 was further used to characterize the heavy metal contamination in sediments by comparing the present concentration with previous times when there were little or no industrial activities it was computed as 3 i g e o log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn is the measured concentration in mg kg 1 of the metal and bn is the geochemical background value of the metal in mg kg 1 due to the conceivable variations in the background values the factor 1 5 was used for small anthropogenic impact on a given metal in the environment muller s classification shown in table 1c was used to classify the pollution of the soil based on the computed igeo values the pollution load index pli was also used in this study to measure the level of contamination of the soil the pli for a single site is the nth root of not less than 5 contamination factors cf as expressed in equation 4 the contamination factors represent the individual impact of each trace metal on the sediments the pli was computed for the soil at 20 cm and 40 cm depths mathematically the pli proposed by tomlinson et al 1980 is given as 4 p l i c f 1 c f 2 c f 3 c f n 1 n where cf contamination factors and n the number of contamination factors and sites respectively pli 1 denotes perfection pli 1 means only baseline levels of pollutants are present and pli 1 indicates deterioration of site quality tomlinson et al 1980 on the other hand table 2 shows the various standard methods used for analysing the physicochemical parameters 3 results and discussions 3 1 groundwater supply points overall six 6 boreholes two 2 hand dug wells two 2 springs a stream and pumped water from the pits were mapped in the study area as shown on fig 2 the water in the community is mainly for drinking and other domestic purposes such as washing and bathing as shown on fig 2 two 2 of the groundwater supply points are located within a 100 m buffer radius from the artisanal mining site whereas five 5 and seven 7 are within the buffer radii of 200 m and 300 m respectively all the groundwater supply points are however within a 400 m radial distance according to government regulations mwrwh 2011 there should be a 100 m minimum buffer distance between a mining activity and a source of drinking water thus the chemicals used in the blasting and processing of the mined ore pose a direct risk to the quality of the four groundwater supply points located within 100 m radius of the mining site 3 2 heavy metal pollution of soil the concentrations of the heavy metals cu pb zn mn as and fe in the soil ranged from 10 1 to 36 mg kg 6 5 42 5 mg kg 16 4 95 8 mg kg 43 0 595 5 mg kg 55 2 1200 mg kg and 6570 9 49 558 1 mg kg respectively and generally decreased with depth these concentrations were similar to values obtained in the obuasi area by previous researchers antwi agyei et al 2009 boateng et al 2012 who investigated the soil up to a depth of 50 cm hg on the other hand was very low below the detectable limit of 0 0001 mg kg in the soil although it is the chemical used by the artisanal miners in extracting gold from the concentrated ore in the area this may be because the hg is scooped for reuse several times by the miners till it is used up before the effluents are discharged to the environment fig 3 a shows the computed igeo values and indicate that based on muller 1969 the soil is extremely polluted with all the analysed heavy metals since all the igeo values were greater than 5 the computed ef fig 3 b also showed that the soil is moderately enriched with mn significantly enriched with cu fe and zn very highly enriched with pb and extremely enriched with as based on the buat menard and chesselet 1979 scheme the high as concentration in the area conform to work done by nude et al 2011 in the obuasi municipality again the as enrichment in soils within 200 m radius is higher as compared to the soils beyond 200 m radius the cf for cu fe mn and zn based on martin and meybeck 1979 classification scheme were low in the soil fig 3 c since they were less than 1 however the soil was moderately and highly contaminated with pb and as respectively the high cf values for as conforms to work done by boateng et al 2012 in obuasi area and is due to its association with the ore mined in the study area thus its contamination of the soil could be due its rapid weathering from exposure of the ore to the environment through the mining activities the as concentration was higher at the depth of 20 cm than the 40 cm depth likewise the cf of the metals were far higher at the depth of 20 cm in comparison to the 40 cm depth the pli values for both depths of investigations for all the heavy metals except as were below 1 and denotes perfection tomlinson et al 1980 however the pli for as in the soil at both the 20 cm and 40 cm depths were above 1 and showed that the soil quality is deteriorated with high levels of as this seems to be in conformity with studies by boateng et al 2012 generally the level of pollution of the soil in the study area decreased with depth as well as away from the active mining site 3 3 water quality table 3 shows the physicochemical parameters measured during the two sampling seasons generally all the measured physicochemical parameters i e temperature true colour salinity total hardness conductivity tds fluoride nitrate chloride sulphate phosphorus and sulphide were all within the acceptable who guideline values for drinking water except ph turbidity total suspended solids tss and alkalinity also there was generally no significant variation in the concentration of the parameters in the november and april periods the ph ranged from 5 6 to 7 6 in november and 5 8 to 6 9 in april with about 47 and 65 respectively of the samples below the lower limit of the permissible guideline values for drinking water who 2011 which indicates that the water in the community is slightly acidic this is consistent with the slightly acidic ph of water in mining communities of the country from similar studies bhattacharya et al 2012 ewusi et al 2017 dorleku et al 2018 and may be due to the release of mine waste and chemicals used in extracting and processing the ore into the environment similarly the turbidity tss and alkalinity values ranged from 0 to 24 mg l 100 470 mg l and 0 25 ntu respectively with about 18 53 and 18 respectively of them above the acceptable who 2011 guideline values for drinking water the turbidity issues were mainly associated with the stream water close to the processing site and extreme downstream of the processing site table 4 shows the concentration of heavy metals in the water samples in both november and april sampling months generally heavy metals of varying concentrations were detected in the various water samples in the study area especially in the hand dug wells and boreholes but they did not vary significantly over the months a comparison of the concentration of the heavy metals as cu pb and zn with the who 2011 guideline values for drinking water showed most of the metals were below detectable limits dl nonetheless they could still be present in the water albeit in very low concentrations since the dl were above the permissible limits for drinking water there were however isolated cases where the levels of as pb and zn were above the guidelines for drinking water who 2011 in locations downstream of the processing site in both sampling months similarly the concentrations of fe and mn in the stream were mostly above the acceptable guidelines for drinking who 2011 and decreased away from the processing site in both november and april this was not surprising since the water pumped directly from the mine pits into the stream during mining contained extremely high levels of fe and mn above the permissible levels for drinking these two metals are common contaminants of groundwater in mining communities of the country bhattacharya et al 2012 dorleku et al 2018 since they are key associations of the gold bearing rocks mined in the country including the study community thus weathering of the rocks facilitated by its exposure to the atmosphere through the mining activities may be releasing the metals to the surface stream like in the soil hg was not detected at all in all the water supply points of the community 4 conclusions the study has evaluated heavy metals in the water resources and soil at kokoteasua community in obuasi where artisanal mining has been on the rise in recent times the results indicate that there are twelve water supply points for the community comprising six boreholes two hand dug wells two springs a stream and a pumped water from the mining pit out of these four are within the 100 m unacceptable minimum buffer radius from a mine to water supply points whereas the rest are all within 400 m radius of the mine site the water quality assessment results indicate that groundwater in the community is generally suitable for drinking in comparison to the who guideline

12301,effluents and mine waste from artisanal mining in kokoteasua a community in ghana are discharged directly to the environment without prior treatment and have the potential of polluting the soil and water resources that the populace rely on for their daily water need therefore this study has assessed the impact of the artisanal mining activities on the soil and water resources in the community the method employed involved mapping the water supply points in the community and sampling the water supply points and the soil at 20 cm and 40 cm depths to determine their heavy metal levels i e fe pb zn as mn cu and hg the water quality was assessed using the world health organisation who guideline values for drinking water while pollution indices were used to evaluate the levels of soil pollution the results generally indicated that groundwater in the community is potable but unsuitable for drinking in isolated locations due to high levels of as and zn the stream however recorded high levels of mn fe and ph above the acceptable who drinking water guidelines again the study found the soil to be extremely polluted with all the measured heavy metals except hg from contamination factor enrichment factor geo accumulation index and pollution load index assessments thus the artisanal mining needs to be regulated to protect the water resource and soil from further pollution graphical abstract nearness of water supply points to the artisanal mining site in the study community image 1 keywords groundwater artisanal mining heavy metals pollution indices ghana 1 introduction groundwater constitutes about 97 of the available freshwater on earth and forms an important component of the water cycle delluer 1999 it serves as a source of potable water for agriculture industry and domestic use as well as in helping to maintain soil moisture wetlands and stream flows in many parts of the world oladeji et al 2012 qiu 2010 estimated that groundwater constitutes about 70 and 40 of the total water resources used respectively for domestic and irrigation purposes in china nickson et al 2005 also estimated that about one third of global population depend on groundwater as their source of potable water in ghana groundwater serves as the main source of sustainable water supply for the populace living in rural communities and emerging communities in the urban areas duah and xu 2006 groundwater of good quality is very important to these communities because it is their main source of potable water for drinking and domestic purposes commonly anthropogenic activities such as farming indiscriminate waste disposal and mining among others significantly influence groundwater quality either directly or indirectly teaf et al 2006 for instance mining activities generate waste such as waste rock tailings and effluents at the various stages of processing the ore which have the potential to leach through the soil into aquifers and directly pollute groundwater johnson and hallberg 2005 a typical pollution of groundwater from effluents of mine waste is reported by obiadi et al 2016 at a coal mine in the enugu area of nigeria which contaminated surface water and shallow groundwater with high levels of acidity iron and sulphate studies by mallo 2011 also found that effluents from mines usually have very low ph which causes acid mine drainage and ends up in water bodies including groundwater oladipo et al 2014 similarly found evidence of heavy metal contamination of groundwater as a result of illegal mining activities in zamfara state nigeria ghana is known to be one of the major gold producers globally and the mining sector is believed to contribute significantly to the gross foreign earnings of the country artisanal gold mining has been on the increase in the country and it is said to be a major contributor of metals in water resources due to indiscriminate use of mercury hg and other harmful chemicals in the mining activities donkor et al 2006 globally small scale mining is noted to be a major contributor to the pollution of water resources because it makes use of huge volumes of water thereby polluting the water resources cunningham et al 2005 owens et al 2005 most artisanal mining operators have no concession of their own and thus operates illegally therefore their operations are naturally furtive and clandestine thereby operating uncontrollably within the concessions of large scale mining companies or in areas that are prohibited from mining such as around forest reserves water bodies or environmentally sensitive areas appiah 1998 as a result their operations are often not regulated leading to the use of unsafe chemicals in extracting the gold these chemicals are usually discharged uncontrollably into the ecosystem meech et al 1998 and leads to contamination of the environment several methods have been used to analyze the quality of soil and water at places with significant mining activities awadh 2013 used the geo accumulation igeo index to assess soil contamination in such an area by comparing the heavy metal concentrations to their crustal levels and found that the concentrations in the soil were above the crustal levels thus signifying that the soil has been contaminated likuku et al 2013 on the other hand used enrichment factor pollution load index the degree of contamination and geo accumulation index to evaluate heavy metal concentration in the soils again boateng et al 2012 used geo accumulation index pollution load index and contamination factor to assess the geochemical impact on the soil quality of a reclaimed tailings dam in analysing the water quality in such environments the world health organisation who guidelines for assessing suitability of drinking water who 2011 are commonly utilised for instance oladipo et al 2014 analysed the concentration of heavy metals in groundwater at zamfara state nigeria by comparing the measured parameters in the groundwater samples with the who guideline values and water quality standards from the federal environmental protection agency nigeria 1998 similarly abdul rahaman et al 2014 analysed possible groundwater contamination in a mining community in ghana by determining the concentration of heavy metals in the water and comparing them with the who guideline values for drinking water in recent times artisanal mining has been on the rise in kokoteasua a community within the obuasi municipality in ghana unfortunately the waste rock tailings and effluents from the mining activities are directly discharged into the environment and stream in the area these have the potential of polluting the surface water and shallow aquifers that the populace relies on as their main source of water supply and thus pose a serious threat to their health if not curbed therefore this study aims to assess the effect of artisanal mining on the quality of soil and water resources in a typical artisanal community using kokoteasua as a case study 2 methodology 2 1 study area description kokoteasua kts shown in fig 1 is a suburb of obuasi municipality and is located in the southern part of ashanti region of ghana at about 64 km from kumasi the municipality is bounded to the east by the adansi south district west by amansie central district north by the adansi north district and south by upper denkyira district of central region bempah et al 2013 it is precisely located within latitudes 1 39 54 to 1 40 18 w and longitudes 6 12 54 to 6 12 34 n the topography of the area is gently undulating to hilly annual rainfall in the area ranges from 1250 mm to 1750 mm whereas the mean annual temperature is 25 5 c with relative humidity peaking between 75 and 80 boateng et al 2012 the area is underlained by meta sedimentary and meta volcanic rocks of the birimian formation kesse 1985 nude et al 2012 the meta sedimentary rocks occupy the north western half of the area and comprise low grade metamorphosed rocks that are associated with mica rich basin type granitoid kesse 1985 nude et al 2011 the meta volcanic group is separated from the meta sedimentary group by the main obuasi mineralized shear zone and is dominated by basalts intercalated with pyroclastic rocks which are also associated with the hornblende rich belt type granitoid kesse 1985 nude et al 2012 high sulphide type gold mineralization constitutes the gold ore in the area while pyrites and arsenopyrites are the pathfinders osae et al 1995 the mineralization has fe as pd sb cu zn s and au as the key geochemical signatures and are used to classify the ore oberthu et al 1994 gold mineralization in the area is structurally controlled 2 2 mapping and sampling water supply points in the community including boreholes hand dug wells springs and stream were mapped with the aid of a geographic position system gps these supply points were plotted on the topographic map of the area and further used in creating a buffer map to show the number of supply points within 100 m 200 m 300 m and beyond 400 m radius from the active mining area based on government regulation on minimum required distance from active mining to water points the drainage map was also used to determine the flow direction and its linkage to the mineral processing sites where effluents are discharged directly to the stream it as well aided in planning the sampling points for the study shown in fig 1 the samples were taken at the upstream downstream and close to the active mining and processing zones in the study area to evaluate the quality of the water resources and soil around the active mining and processing areas where effluents are directly discharged to the environment the samples upstream were mainly to serve as control points in total fourteen 14 water samples were taken within the study area from fourteen 14 sampling points on two occasions i e in april prior to the rainy season and november after rainy season the sampling points included six 6 from boreholes two 2 from hand dug wells two 2 from springs one 1 from a pit at the artisanal mining site where groundwater is pumped out and three 3 from the stream the water samples were acidified with nitric acid hno3 to keep it in oxidation state and set the ph of both the samples and standards equal the sampling storage and transportation of the water to the laboratory were done following standard protocols apha 1995 to ensure consistency and data quality in addition twenty 20 soil samples were taken from ten 10 different locations at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm with the aid of a hand augur for the study fig 1 these soil samples were put in plastic bags and sent to the laboratory for measurement of their heavy metal concentrations 2 3 laboratory analysis and pollution indices in drinking water quality assessments priority is usually given to parameters which are known to be of concern to human health and potability when present in significant concentrations in the water source ponsadailakshmi et al 2018 therefore heavy metals i e fe pb zn as cu mn and hg in both the water and soil samples were measured in the laboratory using the icp oes analyzer following standard procedures mccomb et al 2014 the icp was first initialized and the plasma allowed to stabilize for 15 min tuning was then done to determine if the icp is in good condition to start analysing samples to achieve this the tuning solution was first analysed and the intensities observed by the instruments were monitored against the expected intensities of the tuning solution the instrument was tuned using a 10 ppb solution which contains li pb tl and y the instrument was calibrated before analysing the samples with a blank and appropriate calibration standard calibration standards of 1 10 50 and 100 ppb were used to calibrate the instrument and only r2 above 0 999 was accepted the calibration was verified with a 10 ppb and 50 ppb standard followed by the analysis of the samples with appropriate internal standard i e sc ge in rh tb lu and ir the measured concentration of the heavy metals in the water samples were compared with the who guideline values for drinking water who 2011 however pollution indices such as the contamination factor cf enrichment factor ef geo accumulation index igeo and pollution load index pli were used to evaluate the metal pollution of the heavy metal concentrations in the soil these indices helped in assessing the presence and intensities of anthropogenic contaminants in the surface soil the contamination factor cf as expressed in equation 1 is the ratio of the measured concentration of an element to the background concentration of that same element and represents the individual impact of each trace metal on the sediments olatunji et al 2009 it was used to evalute the level of contamination of the measured parameters in the soil mathematically the cf is expressed as 1 c f c m c b where cm is the measured concentration of the element and cb is the background concentration of that same element the martin and meybeck classification shown in table 1 a was used to classify the degree of heavy metal contamination of the soil the enrichment factor ef which is also used to evaluate the anthropogenic effect on the soil by computing the difference between metals from anthropogenic source and that of a geogenic source buat menard and chesselet 1979 ismaeel and kusag 2012 was used to evaluate how the soil is enriched with the measured parameters in computing the ef al was used as a reference element to standardize the heavy metal concentration taylor 1964 mathematically ef is computed using the relation in equation 2 2 e f c m c b c m r e f c b r e f where cm is the measured concentration of the element and cb is background concentration of the measured element cmref is the measured concentration of the reference element while cbref is the background concentration of the reference element the buat menard and chesselet 1979 classification shown in table 1b was used to classify the level of enrichment of the soil geo accumulation index igeo as expressed in equation 3 was further used to characterize the heavy metal contamination in sediments by comparing the present concentration with previous times when there were little or no industrial activities it was computed as 3 i g e o log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn is the measured concentration in mg kg 1 of the metal and bn is the geochemical background value of the metal in mg kg 1 due to the conceivable variations in the background values the factor 1 5 was used for small anthropogenic impact on a given metal in the environment muller s classification shown in table 1c was used to classify the pollution of the soil based on the computed igeo values the pollution load index pli was also used in this study to measure the level of contamination of the soil the pli for a single site is the nth root of not less than 5 contamination factors cf as expressed in equation 4 the contamination factors represent the individual impact of each trace metal on the sediments the pli was computed for the soil at 20 cm and 40 cm depths mathematically the pli proposed by tomlinson et al 1980 is given as 4 p l i c f 1 c f 2 c f 3 c f n 1 n where cf contamination factors and n the number of contamination factors and sites respectively pli 1 denotes perfection pli 1 means only baseline levels of pollutants are present and pli 1 indicates deterioration of site quality tomlinson et al 1980 on the other hand table 2 shows the various standard methods used for analysing the physicochemical parameters 3 results and discussions 3 1 groundwater supply points overall six 6 boreholes two 2 hand dug wells two 2 springs a stream and pumped water from the pits were mapped in the study area as shown on fig 2 the water in the community is mainly for drinking and other domestic purposes such as washing and bathing as shown on fig 2 two 2 of the groundwater supply points are located within a 100 m buffer radius from the artisanal mining site whereas five 5 and seven 7 are within the buffer radii of 200 m and 300 m respectively all the groundwater supply points are however within a 400 m radial distance according to government regulations mwrwh 2011 there should be a 100 m minimum buffer distance between a mining activity and a source of drinking water thus the chemicals used in the blasting and processing of the mined ore pose a direct risk to the quality of the four groundwater supply points located within 100 m radius of the mining site 3 2 heavy metal pollution of soil the concentrations of the heavy metals cu pb zn mn as and fe in the soil ranged from 10 1 to 36 mg kg 6 5 42 5 mg kg 16 4 95 8 mg kg 43 0 595 5 mg kg 55 2 1200 mg kg and 6570 9 49 558 1 mg kg respectively and generally decreased with depth these concentrations were similar to values obtained in the obuasi area by previous researchers antwi agyei et al 2009 boateng et al 2012 who investigated the soil up to a depth of 50 cm hg on the other hand was very low below the detectable limit of 0 0001 mg kg in the soil although it is the chemical used by the artisanal miners in extracting gold from the concentrated ore in the area this may be because the hg is scooped for reuse several times by the miners till it is used up before the effluents are discharged to the environment fig 3 a shows the computed igeo values and indicate that based on muller 1969 the soil is extremely polluted with all the analysed heavy metals since all the igeo values were greater than 5 the computed ef fig 3 b also showed that the soil is moderately enriched with mn significantly enriched with cu fe and zn very highly enriched with pb and extremely enriched with as based on the buat menard and chesselet 1979 scheme the high as concentration in the area conform to work done by nude et al 2011 in the obuasi municipality again the as enrichment in soils within 200 m radius is higher as compared to the soils beyond 200 m radius the cf for cu fe mn and zn based on martin and meybeck 1979 classification scheme were low in the soil fig 3 c since they were less than 1 however the soil was moderately and highly contaminated with pb and as respectively the high cf values for as conforms to work done by boateng et al 2012 in obuasi area and is due to its association with the ore mined in the study area thus its contamination of the soil could be due its rapid weathering from exposure of the ore to the environment through the mining activities the as concentration was higher at the depth of 20 cm than the 40 cm depth likewise the cf of the metals were far higher at the depth of 20 cm in comparison to the 40 cm depth the pli values for both depths of investigations for all the heavy metals except as were below 1 and denotes perfection tomlinson et al 1980 however the pli for as in the soil at both the 20 cm and 40 cm depths were above 1 and showed that the soil quality is deteriorated with high levels of as this seems to be in conformity with studies by boateng et al 2012 generally the level of pollution of the soil in the study area decreased with depth as well as away from the active mining site 3 3 water quality table 3 shows the physicochemical parameters measured during the two sampling seasons generally all the measured physicochemical parameters i e temperature true colour salinity total hardness conductivity tds fluoride nitrate chloride sulphate phosphorus and sulphide were all within the acceptable who guideline values for drinking water except ph turbidity total suspended solids tss and alkalinity also there was generally no significant variation in the concentration of the parameters in the november and april periods the ph ranged from 5 6 to 7 6 in november and 5 8 to 6 9 in april with about 47 and 65 respectively of the samples below the lower limit of the permissible guideline values for drinking water who 2011 which indicates that the water in the community is slightly acidic this is consistent with the slightly acidic ph of water in mining communities of the country from similar studies bhattacharya et al 2012 ewusi et al 2017 dorleku et al 2018 and may be due to the release of mine waste and chemicals used in extracting and processing the ore into the environment similarly the turbidity tss and alkalinity values ranged from 0 to 24 mg l 100 470 mg l and 0 25 ntu respectively with about 18 53 and 18 respectively of them above the acceptable who 2011 guideline values for drinking water the turbidity issues were mainly associated with the stream water close to the processing site and extreme downstream of the processing site table 4 shows the concentration of heavy metals in the water samples in both november and april sampling months generally heavy metals of varying concentrations were detected in the various water samples in the study area especially in the hand dug wells and boreholes but they did not vary significantly over the months a comparison of the concentration of the heavy metals as cu pb and zn with the who 2011 guideline values for drinking water showed most of the metals were below detectable limits dl nonetheless they could still be present in the water albeit in very low concentrations since the dl were above the permissible limits for drinking water there were however isolated cases where the levels of as pb and zn were above the guidelines for drinking water who 2011 in locations downstream of the processing site in both sampling months similarly the concentrations of fe and mn in the stream were mostly above the acceptable guidelines for drinking who 2011 and decreased away from the processing site in both november and april this was not surprising since the water pumped directly from the mine pits into the stream during mining contained extremely high levels of fe and mn above the permissible levels for drinking these two metals are common contaminants of groundwater in mining communities of the country bhattacharya et al 2012 dorleku et al 2018 since they are key associations of the gold bearing rocks mined in the country including the study community thus weathering of the rocks facilitated by its exposure to the atmosphere through the mining activities may be releasing the metals to the surface stream like in the soil hg was not detected at all in all the water supply points of the community 4 conclusions the study has evaluated heavy metals in the water resources and soil at kokoteasua community in obuasi where artisanal mining has been on the rise in recent times the results indicate that there are twelve water supply points for the community comprising six boreholes two hand dug wells two springs a stream and a pumped water from the mining pit out of these four are within the 100 m unacceptable minimum buffer radius from a mine to water supply points whereas the rest are all within 400 m radius of the mine site the water quality assessment results indicate that groundwater in the community is generally suitable for drinking in comparison to the who guideline values for drinking water except in isolated locations where the levels of as and zn are unsuitable on the other hand the stream in the community is not suitable for drinking due to higher levels of turbidity total suspended solids pb mn and fe above the acceptable drinking water standard similarly the soil in the community is heavily polluted with fe pb zn cu mn and as the levels of the heavy metal pollution however decreases with depth from 0 20 cm to 20 40 cm in the community thus indicating that artisanal mining in the community is polluting the soil and surface stream hence there is the need to regulate it to control the pollution and protect the water resources from further pollution and its associated health implications on the populace acknowledgment the authors thank the

characterization of zeolite x ray diffraction study of zeolite the x ray diffraction characterization was carried out for raw zeolite and after removal of hardness which showed in fig 4 a and b x ray diffraction is a rapid analytical technique primarily used for phase identification of crystalline material and can provide information on unit cell dimensions there are three major peaks were in the natural zeolite the first peak clinoptilolite of the zeolite was found at the region 0 10 2ɵ second peak mordenite at 10 23 2ɵ and third peak sepiolite were observed at 23 29 2ɵ the leftover peaks in the patterns of the natural zeolite may be attributed to the presence of quartz feldspar and cristobalite which shown in fig 4 a this is expected that in sedimentary deposits the formation of zeolites is always associated with the presence of another alkali al silicates and sio2 it can be also easily identified that the intensity was decreased in fig 4 b after treatment it reveals that the peak values decrease after the treatment confirms the sodium present in the zeolite is exchanged with the calcium ca and magnesium mg that are present in the hard water loiola et al 2012 fourier transform infra red analysis the structural information has been obtained from the vibrational frequencies of the natural zeolite lattice observed in the range between 400 and 4000 cm 1 spectra were confirmed for the without ion exchanged raw zeolite and zeolite after ion exchange with water sample fig 5 the most intensive absorption band was observed at 1030 cm 1 and corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of siosi breck 1974 the absorption bands between 800 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 are associated with the stretching vibrations of aloal and 475 cm 1 and 450 are bending vibrations of osio the small peak at 1650 cm 1 is assigned to the bending vibration band of sorbed water the strong wide bands in the range 3375 3750 cm 1 are interrelated with the occurrence of absorbed water molecules

peaks of carbon oxygen double bond in the carbonate ion overall the peaks agree with information available in the literature nazarenko and zarubina 2013 scanning electron micrographs electron microscopy demonstrate various details of the structure of the zeolite and allows a through a study of crystalline forms of micro crystals grown in voids the micrograph analysis for zeolite before and after ion exchange process is shown in fig 6 a and b the micrograph of before treated zeolite fig 6 a shows agglomerations of a crystal having thin fibers and plate shaped the particles size varies from 2 5 to 20 μm this reveals that the zeolite clinoptilolite is a tuff and texture material diale et al 2011 after ion exchange zeolite it can be seen from fig 6 b on the surfaces particles are irregular and having a bar shape the particle size varies from 5 to 15 μm and having high porosity similarly the pattern was observed with rice husk based zeolite for 90 of fluoride removal at initial

temperature for different nacl concentration in a range of 1m 4m the hardness removal efficiency experimental was done at ph 6 stirred time 5 min dose 5 g l temperature 21 c and total hardness 568 mg

concentration from 3m to 4m the total hardness increase from 597 mg l to 612 mg l therefore optimum sodium chloride solution concentration was considered to be 2m this may be due to 2 m sodium chloride solution are effective to alter the chemical structure of zeolite the ion exchange and precipitation mechanism occurred simultaneously in zeolite reaction and depend on concentration of increasing or decreasing due to that 2m of sodium chloride solution is effective to remove maximum calcium and magnesium from hard water wiyantoko and rahmah 2017 effect of activation temperature the activation of zeolite was carried out for 2m sodium chloride solution and 1 mm particles at different 45 c 60 c 90 c and 110 c of temperature range the ion exchange experiment carried out at ph 6 stirred time 5 min dose 5 g l temperature 21 c and total hardness 568 mg l which represented in fig 8 it has been noted that minimum 555 mg l total hardness was decreased at the 60 c activation temperature increase in temperature 90 c and 110 c increases 570 mg l and 580 mg l total hardness removal at low temperature 45 c it was 580 mg l total hardness reduction this is expected that porous structure desiccation of the zeolite at 60 c activation temperatures will increase its hydrophilic water absorption properties additional activation temperature increased the surface area of the zeolite but reduced crystallization time and particle size purbaningtias et al 2017 3 3 optimization of operating parameters optimization of ph ph plays an important character on hardness removal to determine the optimum ph water sample was maintained at three different ph ph 6 5 ph 6 9 and ph 7 4 at constant dose 2 g zeolite stirring time 5 min size 1 mm and initial hardness concentration 658 3 mg l total hardness 220 mg l ca and 26 mg l mg the result presented in fig 9 from the result it can be seen that maximum 165 3 mg l of total hardness 52 4 mg l calcium and 8 2 mg l magnesium were reduced at ph 6 9 further increases or decrease in ph 6 5 or ph 7 4 the ion exchange performance was reduced it was 210 mg l total hardness th 67 3 mg l calcium ca and 10 mg l magnesium mg hardness for ph 6 5 and 171 4 mg l th 48 56 mg l ca and 12 mg l mg for ph 7 4 at low ph values the exchange of hardness causing ions was low because a large amount of proton competes with the hardness ions at the active sites of the zeolite surface similarly the increase of exchange rate when ph of the solution increases is due to the decrease of proton quantity competing with hardness ions in the zeolite surface the surface of zeolite materials becomes negatively charged and this increases the exchange rate of the positively charged hardness causing ions through electrostatic forces of attraction dimirkou and doula 2008 sepehr et al 2013 reported 96 calcium and 93 magnesium removal with modified pumice at ph 6 0 and 10 g l initial concentration optimization of size to determine the optimum size of natural zeolite three different size range of 0 5 mm 01 mm and 1 35 mm particle sizes were employed in the experiment the total hardness concentration 658 mg l calcium 220 mg l and magnesium 26 mg l was consider an initial condition at ph 6 9 optimum dose 2 gram experimental temperature 21 c and stirring time 5 min 50 rpm the result is shown in fig 10 that maximum 160 mg l th 50 mg l ca and 8 mg l mg removal was occurred for 01 mm zeolite particles size at lower size 0 5 mm the removal was 254 2 mg l 90 mg l ca and 07 mg l and 265 mg l th 72 6 mg l ca and 20 mg l mg at higher range 1 35 mm particle size this may be due zeolite surface area is small and not actively participated for cation exchange properly at a lower size wang and nguyen 2018 at a large size they did not dissolve with water and a proper exchange has not occurred hence the optimum size of zeolites have notable role on effectiveness of ion exchange these results agree with removal of heavy metal from petroleum industry wastewater at 0 5 mm size of natural zeolite salman et al 2017 optimization of dose the effect of dose on hardness removal was carried out at three different dose ranges of 10 g l 25 g l and 75 g l at optimum ph 6 9 and optimum particle size 1 mm and temperature 21 c and treatment time 5 min the calcium magnesium and total hardness removal efficiency shown in fig 11 at 50 g l dosing of zeolite was found to be appropriate to reduced maximum 154 7 mg l th 53 5 mg l ca and 5 mg l mg further decrease to 25 g l and 10 g l dosing the total hardness th 160 mg l calcium ca 50 6 mg l and magnesium 8 mg l and 220 1 total hardness calcium 69 7 mg l and magnesium 11 mg l were observed at maximum dosing 75 g l of zeolite the efficiency was not improved in other words th 186 mg l ca 62 06 mg l and mg 7 5 mg l was found increase in ion exchange dose the hardness exchange efficiency increased until at the optimized dose the observed increment in removal with increasing exchanger dosage could be due to an increase in a number of possible exchanger sites and surface area of the zeolite abadzic and ryan 2001 optimization of treatment time the effect of the treatment time was investigated for 3 min 60 min of contact time at optimum condition of ph 6 9 optimum size 1 mm optimum dose 50 g l temperature 21 c th 658 mg l ca 220 mg l and mg26 mg l mg the data obtained was presented in fig 12 from the result it can be seen 130 mg l th 45 1 ca and 4 1 mg ions were reduced at 30 min of treatment time at this point the amount of cation being exchanged by the zeolite was in a state of dynamic equilibrium with the amount of cation from the zeolite further increase in contact time 45 min and 60 min the performance reduced to 155 mg l 54 8 mg l and 4 3 mg l and 162 mg l th 56 55 ca and 4 95 mg respectively this might be due to the occupancy of all sites of the zeolites at lower treatment time 3 min and 5 min 168 mg l th 58 mg l ca and 6 1 mg l and 165 mg l th 57 6 mg l ca and 5 mg l mg removal was observed this might be due to the lack of exchange site available in zeolite prasad et al 2011 in literature raw and synthesized zeolite was used for hardness removal and result has the same opinion as present hardness removal achieved dimova et al 1999 loiola et al 2012 loiola et al observed 95 of calcium removal in 1 min of treatment time optimization of temperature the effect of temperature on ion exchange for cation was investigated as a function of temperature and result is presented in fig 13 the initial condition was optimum ph 6 9 dose 50 g l treatment time 30min particles size 1 mm 658 mg l th 220 mg l ca and 26 mg l mg at range of 18 c 25 c and 30 c temperature it was noted from the result that 25 c temperature is suitable to achieve 125 mg l th 43 4 mg l ca and 3 95 mg l mg reduction at lower experiment temperature 18 c the removal was 144 mg l 50 43 mg l and 4 3 mg l mg and higher temperature 30 c it was 152 mg l th 48 5 mg l ca and 4 7 mg l mg removal was observed increase in ion exchange efficiency with increases in temperature up to 25 c then decreases it may be due to the ion exchange rate decreases from the surface another possible description was that the cations were well hydrated they have to lose part of hydration sheath in order to be absorbed this dehydration process of cation required energy at higher temperatures some accumulation occurs due to the shrinkage of the exchanger and releases some of the exchange ions resulting in increasing the ion concentration in the solution again woinarski et al 2003 ayele et al 2015 3 4 regeneration of zeolite optimization of the molar solution the regeneration of zeolite was carried out with four different 1m 2m 3m and 5m molar sodium chloride solution at 60 c regeneration temperature and 6 h s regeneration time the ion exchange experiment was conducted at optimum condition ph 6 9 size 1 mm dose 50 g l and time 30 min for all 4 m nacl solutions the result represents in fig 14 it can be seen that maximum total hardness reduced from 658 to 139 mg l at all optimum condition further increase in sodium chloride concentration 5m removal efficiency decreased to 145 mg l this may be due to excess occurrence of sodium ion in solution at lower concentration of nacl 1m and 2m solution the reduction was also reduced to 213 mg l and 186 mg l respectively these attributes to lack of sodium ion in a solution that may be not sufficient for calcium ion removal ahmad and mirza 2017 for this reason 3m sodium chloride solution provides suitable ion exchange capacity for maximum hardness removal farkas 2005 optimization of temperature the optimum regeneration temperature was done for four temperature range 45 c 60 c 90 c and 110 c at 3m of sodium chloride solution which shown in fig 15 all optimized parameters ph 6 9 size 1 mm dose 5 g and time 30 min was maintained for hardness removal from the result it can found that maximum 127 mg l total hardness 44 05 mg

which are then linked into a three dimensional crystalline structure of zeolite wells 2012 substitution of si by al defines the negative charge of the zeolite framework which is compensated by alkaline and earth alkaline metal cations cai et al 2015 therefore natural zeolites appear as cation exchangers due to they have a negative charge on the surface margeta et al 2013 zeolites are

characterization of zeolite x ray diffraction study of zeolite the x ray diffraction characterization was carried out for raw zeolite and after removal of hardness which showed in fig 4 a and b x ray diffraction is a rapid analytical technique primarily used for phase identification of crystalline material and can provide information on unit cell dimensions there are three major peaks were in the natural zeolite the first peak clinoptilolite of the zeolite was found at the region 0 10 2ɵ second peak mordenite at 10 23 2ɵ and third peak sepiolite were observed at 23 29 2ɵ the leftover peaks in the patterns of the natural zeolite may be attributed to the presence of quartz feldspar and cristobalite which shown in fig 4 a this is expected that in sedimentary deposits the formation of zeolites is always associated with the presence of another alkali al silicates and sio2 it can be also easily identified that the intensity was decreased in fig 4 b after treatment it reveals that the peak

56 55 ca and 4 95 mg respectively this might be due to the occupancy of all sites of the zeolites at lower treatment time 3 min and 5 min 168 mg l th 58 mg l ca and 6 1 mg l and 165 mg l th 57 6 mg l ca and 5 mg l mg removal was observed this might be due to the lack of exchange site available in zeolite prasad et al 2011 in literature raw and synthesized zeolite was used for hardness removal and result has the same opinion as present hardness removal achieved dimova et al 1999 loiola et al 2012 loiola et al observed 95 of calcium removal in 1 min of treatment time optimization of temperature the effect of temperature on ion exchange for cation was investigated as a function of temperature and result is presented in fig 13 the initial condition was optimum ph 6 9 dose 50 g l treatment time 30min particles size 1 mm 658 mg l th 220 mg l ca and 26 mg l mg at range of 18 c 25 c and 30 c temperature it was noted from the result that 25 c temperature is suitable to achieve 125 mg l th 43 4 mg l ca and 3 95 mg l mg reduction at lower experiment temperature 18 c the removal was 144 mg l 50 43 mg l and 4 3 mg l mg and higher temperature 30 c it was 152 mg l th 48 5 mg l ca and 4 7 mg l mg removal was observed increase in ion exchange efficiency with increases in temperature up to 25 c then decreases it may be due to the ion exchange rate decreases from the surface another possible description was that the cations were well hydrated they have to lose part of hydration sheath in order to be absorbed this dehydration process of cation required energy at higher temperatures some accumulation occurs due to the shrinkage of the exchanger and releases some of the exchange ions resulting in increasing the ion concentration in the solution again woinarski et al 2003 ayele et al 2015 3 4 regeneration of zeolite optimization of the molar solution the regeneration of zeolite was carried out with four different 1m 2m 3m and 5m molar sodium chloride solution at 60 c regeneration temperature and 6 h s regeneration time the ion exchange experiment was conducted at optimum condition ph 6 9 size 1 mm dose 50 g l and time 30 min for all 4 m nacl solutions the result represents in fig 14 it can be seen that maximum total hardness reduced from 658 to 139 mg l at all optimum condition further increase in sodium chloride concentration 5m removal efficiency decreased to 145 mg l this may be due to excess occurrence of sodium ion in solution at lower concentration of nacl 1m and 2m solution the reduction was also reduced to 213 mg l and 186 mg l respectively these attributes to lack of sodium ion in a solution that may be not sufficient for calcium ion removal ahmad and mirza 2017 for this reason 3m sodium chloride solution provides suitable ion exchange capacity for maximum hardness removal farkas 2005 optimization of temperature the optimum regeneration temperature was done for four temperature range 45 c 60 c 90 c and 110 c at 3m of sodium chloride solution which shown in fig 15 all optimized parameters ph 6 9 size 1 mm dose 5 g and time 30 min was maintained for hardness removal from the result it can found that maximum 127 mg l total hardness 44 05 mg l calcium ion and 4 05 mg l magnesium ion removed at 90 c regenerated zeolite at lower temperature 45 c 165 mg l total hardness 57 8 mg l calcium ion and 4 9 mg l magnesium ion and at 110 c 135 mg l total hardness 47 5 mg l calcium ion and 3 9 mg l magnesium hardness was observed this attributes to at 60 c regeneration temperature provides better nutrition redevelop the active site and binding conditions murphy et al 1978 rao and khatoon 2016 4 conclusion it concludes that zeolite is found to be suitable for the reduction of hardness calcium and magnesium ions up to pollution control authority quality standard activation of zeolite was found to good at the 2m solution of sodium chloride and temperature 60 c the total hardness removal was 555 mg l from 658 mg l at optimum conditions sample ph 6 9 zeolite size 1 mm dose 50 g l stirring time 30min and temperature 25 c maximum 43 4 mg l from 220 mg l 80 2 calcium ion 3 95 mg l from 26 mg l 84 8 magnesium ion and 125 mg l from 658 mg l 81 0 total hardness was reduce after treatment zeolite regeneration was carried out at optimum temperature 90 c 3m sodium chloride solution ph 6 9 size 1 mm dose 50 g l and treatment time 30 min total hardness was reduced from 658 mg l to 127 mg l 80 6 calcium ion from 220 mg l to 44 05 mg l 79 9 and magnesium ion 26 mg l to 3 74 mg l 85 6 respectively x ray diffraction peaks indicated stellerite barriete and stellrite at different wave number and reduced after removal the fourier transform infrared analysis confirms the presence of aluminum silicate and hydrogen bond that participated in hardness removal the micrograph study show particles are plate shaped and regularly distributed after treatment it was an irregular structure in the end a zeolite is found to be very relevant for calcium and magnesium ion removal from municipal drinking water supply by an ion exchange technique it can be employ for the large volume of drinking water supply appendix a supplementary

12303,virtual water vw is defined as the water required in the production of goods the objective of the study is to quantify the temporal variation in the virtual water trade in india from the year 2006 2016 through popular food and livestock products water management issues need to consider the vw trade since food production consumes large amount of water the study was carried out using the data of exports and imports of food and livestock products of india as well as their vw consumption through the products considered in the study 496 9 gm3 and 237 2 gm3 of water is traded virtually in the form of exports and imports respectively during the period 2006 to 2016 the maximum export of vw were mainly through rice maize and buffalo meat while the imports were through cashews pulses and wheat rest of the food items contributing negligible amounts this study will enable the water managers of the country to prioritize the export and import of products by considering the vw which will result in sustainable management of groundwater resources in india which is already under threat due to climate change as well as degradation in quality due to geogenic and anthropogenic sources of contamination keywords water trade water use groundwater depletion net variation crops and livestock products 1 introduction virtual water vw is the water consumed for producing agricultural and industrial products this term introduced by allan 1996 got a wide response in the fields of water resource management and food production increase in population in many countries especially in asia necessitates the increase in food production and its corresponding water consumption this is leading to widespread depletion in water resources in several parts of the world gleeson et al 2012 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 several other factors including failure of monsoons deforestation and shrinking of green cover is adding to the problem of groundwater depletion india is not an exception where the irrigation requirements is fulfilled by 80 of groundwater which is leading to falling groundwater levels the depletion of groundwater is evident with country s growth in the recent years due to overuse kannan 2013 bhattacharyya et al 2015 further deterioration in groundwater quality due to natural brindha and elango 2011 nordstrom 2002 and anthropogenic umezawa et al 2009 peters and meybeck 2000 sources has also rendered the water unusable efficient use of water in production could conserve not only vw but also the available water for use the exchange of water intensive extensive products from one region production to another consumption results in vw trade vwt hoekstra and hung 2005 globally the vwt for water poor countries proceeds with the exchange of goods from water abundant countries to water poor countries and vice versa when the water availability decreases less than 1700 m3 per year per capita then the country is regarded as water stressed which is time specific where people do not have access to drinking water or water for domestic use for a specific period falkenmark 1986 if it falls less than 1000 m3 per capita per year the country is classified as water scarce falkenmark 1986 a country producing goods in surplus quantities would export it to other countries and would import the goods that are produced in smaller or negligible quantities in such a scenario the exchange of commodities acts as a source of income for a nation the export import of products would indirectly also involve exchange of vw the exporting country also exchanges water in a virtual form and the importing country thus saves water instead of investing it in food production renault 2002 middle east countries and few african countries that cannot produce food due to water scarcity thus imports food from other countries to meet the water and food demands in order to avoid conflicts over water allan 1992 1997 1998b 2002 such countries export crops that require less water for production and imports food products that its population requires which is normally produced in other countries chapagain 2006 from a global perspective during a period of 10 years from 1996 it is clear that north and south america southern asia and australia were the largest net vw exporters and the largest net vw importers were north africa middle east mexico europe japan and south korea allan 1998a hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 water footprint wf is another term that is closely related to vw while vw is the water required to produce a commodity a country s wf can be defined as the volume of water consumed by the country s population through the produced commodities hoekstra 2003 it is further classified as green water rain fed soil moisture blue water surface water and groundwater bodies and grey water polluted waste and recycled waters the wf contributing to the vw trade include for crops hoekstra and hung 2002 chapagain and hoekstra 2004 hoekstra 2003 hoekstra and chapagain 2007 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 and livestock products chapagain and hoekstra 2003 however wf is not discussed in the present study though the water requirement for crops is usually high the water requirement for producing meat and processed products conusmes 5 20 times more vw per kg than for crop products mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 the water consumed by the animal from the day it is born until its slaughter is tremendously high which includes the water required for producing its feed drinking cleaning and servicing the land where the animal was raised chapagain and hoekstra 2003 likewise crops grown at different climatic settings arid to humid areas has different water requirements and hence the water consumption of animals also vary spatially for different breed varieties in india the surface water availability per capita per year for the years 1991 and 2001 were 2309 m3 and 1902 m3 which are projected to decrease by the years 2025 and 2050 to around 1401 m3 and 1191 m3 respectively mowr 1998 according to fao 2016 food and agricultural organisation through aquastat for the year 2010 it was estimated the total water withdrawal for india was 761 km3 of which 688 km3 91 were used for irrigation and livestock respectively studies by hoekstra and hung 2002 reported that india was a net exporter of vw for the years 1995 1999 another global level study made by chapagain and hoekstra 2004 indicated that india was a net exporter of vw for the period from 1997 to 2001 however kumar and jain 2007 have reported that india was a net importer of vw during the period of 2001 2005 the vw import and export due to major crop products for the period from 1961 to 2010 was reported by goswami and nishad 2015 brindha 2017 indicated that india s net vw export has increased by 28 times from the year 1986 2013 there were significant changes in the agricultural and livestock production as well as the availability of water which was affected due to the tsunami floods and droughts witnessed from the year 2005 it is also essential to see whether there is any change in the trade of vw in the context of widespread depletion in groundwater resources in india as reported by aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 and goldin 2016 hence it is necessary to understand the trend of variation in export and import of vw for india through the trade of crops and livestock products under the changing scenario in availability of water resources further it is essential to understand the changes in vw in the recent past for proper planning development and management of the resources antonelli and sartori 2015 the studies carried out on vw trade based on the total food and livestock products is not sufficient to plan and devise strategies for sustainable development and management of groundwater in india since about 80 of agricultural and farming activities depends only on groundwater further no studies have been done on the temporal variation over a long period on indian vw import and export with respect to specific food and livestock products hence the present study was carried out with the objective of assessing the temporal variation in import and export of vw through popular food products crops and livestock from 2006 to 2016 in india 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the annual variation in vwt in india was made based on the information available in authentic public domains the trade data on import and export of crops and livestock products for india were obtained from sources such as food and agricultural organization fao of united nations directorate general of commerce intelligence and statistics dgcis agricultural and processed food products export development authority apeda 2018 coffee board coffee board 2017 the tea board india tea board of india 2018 the rubber board rubber board of india 2018 and department of food and public distribution dfpd 2018 which are governmental agencies of india the data from these organizations were obtained from their official websites and data were collected from reliable sources for the years from 2006 to 2016 only primary food commodities like major crops and livestock products were considered for the study except for major fruits and flowers thus the food and livestock products that are primarily exported from india which are considered as popular products and is given in table 1 financial year april to march was considered for the study except for tea and coffee for which the data was obtained only for the calendar year the minor difference between the calendar year and financial year by three months may not have major influence on the findings 2 2 calculation of virtual water trade the vw exported or imported was calculated by multiplying the trade volume ton year of a product with the water requirement m3 year to produce that product hoekstra and hung 2002 the quantity of vw export vwe and vw import vwi are calculated using the following equation vwe or vwi traded volume ton year vwc of traded product m 3 ton details on quantum of water required to produce various crops and livestock for india were obtained from chapagain and hoekstra 2004 kumar and jain 2007 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 the country s average climate data was used to calculate the vwc of crops and crop products vwc depends on the water demand for the specific crop or livestock of the exporting country water intensive crops require large amount of water since cultivation in india traditionally rice is grown using water logging method which requires more water than by other cultivation methods the crop water requirement affects the vwc of crops and crop products which could result in overestimates or under estimates kumar and jain 2007 the vwc of an animal at the end of its lifespan is defined as the total volume of water that was used to grow and process its feed to provide its drinking water and to clean its housing etc chapagain and hoekstra 2003 it also depends on various other factors like the breed of an animal the water requirements the climatic conditions where the feed and animal has grown the farming system feed consumption and so on chapagain and hoekstra 2003 the calculation of vwi was carried out based on the vwc given in chapagain and hoekstra 2003 3 results and discussion a country s export and import mainly depends on the products consumed by the country s population whenever there is a demand on a product the need for import or increase in production becomes necessary import and export of any food product also results in trade of water in a virtual form and revenue generation in order to calculate the indian vwe and vwi the data on the quantities traded obtained from various reliable sources are taken into account 3 1 export and import of vw the products that are traded in the form of exports and imports also trade water in a virtual form the water traded can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of the product ton yr with the water that was originally required for the production m3 ton the vw content in the crops and livestock products were calculated accordingly and the total estimate on exports and imports during the years from 2006 to 2016 are given in tables 2 and 3 the annual variation in vw trade for various crops and livestock products from the year 2006 2016 are shown in fig 1 it has been noted that there is a decreasing trend of imports of certain products like tea coffee rice wheat groundnut raw sugar and sheep goat meat whereas the imports have increased for other products like cashews walnut grapes onions pulses maize beverages alcoholic and natural rubber similarly the exports for various products have also increased and decreased from year to year the exports of tea coffee rice pulses cashews walnuts raw sugar grapes and buffalo meat have marginally increased while for other products the exports gradually decreased over the last ten years the total export of vw was 14 7 gm3 and total imports was 1 6 gm3 through tea from the year 2006 2016 in the case of coffee the total vw export was 17 1 gm3 and the total vw import was 4 3 gm3 the vw import through coffee has increased by about 1000 times from the year 2012 whereas export has increased by 100 times from 2012 however the details on imported quantum of coffee which is re exported was not available in the case of rice export and import of vw was 195 6 gm3 and 0 024 gm3 respectively the total export and import of vw for wheat was calculated to be 27 2 gm3 and 15 9 gm3 the export of wheat and rice was decreasing while the import has also decreased since 2011 in the case of pulses chick pea pigeon pea dry beans and green peas the total export and import of vw was 3 79 gm3 and 86 1 gm3 respectively the total export and import of vw through maize was calculated to be 53 2 gm3 and 0 49 gm3 increased exports and imports in pulses were observed since 2011 while maize has shown sudden increase in imports for 2016 and decrease of exports since 2012 the data on walnut and cashew s export and import trend for the following years indicate a slight increase in exports and a constant increase in imports the total vw export and import on cashew was 17 8 gm3 and 114 3 gm3 in the case of walnut it was 0 65 gm3 export and 0 083 gm3 import the total vw export on natural rubber was 0 86 gm3 while its total vw import was 13 3 gm3 the export vw for natural rubber has been decreasing whereas its import is increasing since 2011 the total export and import of vw on onions were estimated to be 5 6 gm3 and 0 03 gm3 similarly for raw sugar the total vw exports were calculated to be 18 03 gm3 with imports in negligible amounts of 0 5 gm3 the vw content on livestock products in the form of meat and its processed products have always been higher than the agricultural products this is because the vw content for an animal is high as explained earlier the water consumption for different animals of different regions vary throughout the world as weather conditions the type of environment where the animal has been raised are to be considered the total vw export and import of sheep goat meat is 2 397 gm3 and 0 029 gm3 respectively the export and import statistics of vw based on sheep goat meat indicates a decreasing trend in imports since 2014 and a gradual increasing trend for the year 2016 india is one of the leading exporters in buffalo meat with total vw export of 105 85 gm3 the import of buffalo meat has been very less compared to other meat products india is mainly an exporter of livestock products than importing them meat export plays a huge role in generating revenue the consumption of meat has tremendously increased due to the advent of western culture and the recent economic growth of the country the meat consumption can also be attributed to different religions culture tradition and urbanization devi et al 2014 slaughter houses introduced by the british east indian company set the base for meat industry in india since then the export of live animals animals for meat and secondary products started with information technology sectors growing and food industry showing great development it had also led to import of various food items that cannot be produced in the country overall the total vw exports through crops and livestock products were calculated to be 496 9 gm3 and the total imports to be 237 2 gm3 for the years 2006 2016 3 2 net import and export of vw in order to assess the net export and import of vw the total exports and imports were first analyzed the difference between the total export import per year gives the total net export import for that year the total export of vw for ten years from 2006 2016 were calculated to be 496 9 gm3 the highest contributors in vw export was through rice with 195 6 gm3 followed by buffalo meat with 105 85 gm3 and then by maize with 53 2 gm3 similarly the import of vw for the years from 2006 2016 was calculated to be 237 2 gm3 from other countries the highest contributor in the import of vw was by cashews importing 114 24 gm3 followed by pulses with 86 12 gm3 and then by wheat with 15 9 gm3 india has exported 496 9 gm3 of vw with an average of 49 69 gm3 year and imported 237 21gm3 of vw with an average of 23 72 gm3 year table 4 from these calculations it is understood that india has become a net exporter of vw with an average of 25 9 gm3 year with respect to crops and livestock products from the years 2006 2016 fig 2 this is also reflected by the depletion in groundwater resources of the country goldin 2016 whereas india was a net importer of vw in the years 2001 2005 with an average net import of 25 93 gm3 year kumar and jain 2007 3 3 causes of net annual variation in export and import of vw the net annual variation in export and import is due to many factors such as water availability which in turn is controlled by climate patterns nature of the land area including the soil parameters evapo transpiration rates etc india being a very diverse country with varied weather patterns throughout is characterized by arid and semi arid regions ercin and hoekstra 2014 the country receives an average rainfall of about 4000 km3 in a year with monsoons contributing nearly 3000 km3 kumar et al 2005 the south west monsoon and north east monsoon brings more rainfall during the months of june to september and october to december spatially there is a wide difference in the pattern of rainfall across the country where certain regions in the north eastern part of the country receives about 3400 mm a and some parts in the west receives only about 400 mm a the source of water through rainfall plays a dominant role in the production of food products failure of monsoons or delayed monsoons and deficit rainfall affects the crop production leading to import of food products from other countries according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2001 india is likely to experience short term higher precipitation intensity and long term dry days shah 2008 reported monsoonal crops would experience greater risks against flood as well as droughts and summer crops would experience high evapotranspiration due to increase in temperatures this necessitates frequent irrigation for better crop yield thus contributing to more vw inputs in the context of climate change it is expected that the export of agricultural and livestock products will lead to trade of much larger amount of vw over exploitation of water for increased production of certain important crops like rice wheat and their exports lead to a maximum trade of vw countries like india that concentrates on self sufficiency in food as a national priority will try to produce more crops to feed the country s ever growing population gupta and deshpande 2004 kumar and singh 2005 water is used in large quantities considering the evapo transpiration rates and the weather patterns for different areas across the country more than the crop actually requires for its growth the crops produced in hot arid to semi arid regions will require more water than the crops grown in regions with moderate climate the net change in annual vw also differs based on the area of production the final production rate export and its import the net export value of a particular crop product increases when it is easily produced in a surplus quantity from the data it may be inferred that rice was exported the most and then followed by other crops like maize wheat pulses sugar cashew coffee etc india is also a leading exporter of livestock products especially buffalo meat but with less quantity of import from abroad 4 conclusion studies on vw trade based on the total food and livestock products is common however in this study temporal variation in vwt of some significant agricultural and livestock products exported from india was brought out from a period from 2006 to 2016 which would be useful to plan and devise strategies for sustainable development and management of groundwater in india since about 80 of agricultural and farming activities depends only on groundwater india has exported on an average of 49 69 gm3 y and imported 23 72 gm3 y of vw thus becoming the net exporter with an average of 25 9 gm3 y for the years 2006 2016 as about 80 of agricultural activity in india depend on groundwater usage depletion of this resource is evident over the recent decades considering increasing trend of population growth food production cannot be reduced in order to conserve water as water consumption and food production are interdependent the high export of certain food products is related to overexploitation of groundwater increase in vwe in future will lead to further decline in groundwater resources in spite of enormous measures taken by various agencies to overcome this problem by aquifer recharge measures it is important that the foods be produced in sufficient quantities according to the needs and in calculative quantities for export through stringent measures to reduce the use of water and produce more production of water efficient crops could bring income and at the same time would make us rely more on imports the agricultural and livestock products that are produced by stringent water efficient methods especially the products such as rice maize buffalo meat etc only may be encouraged for export beef export and production should also be reduced since india is one of the top producers and export of beef and vw in beef production is generally high the vw trade only through food products has been made in this study not just the agricultural industry depends on groundwater but also other industries like chemicals and fertilisers leather products automobiles spare parts mining textile etc however the use of groundwater for agricultural and farming purpose is about 85 and the remaining only is used for industrial and domestic purposes hence the only way out to reduce the export of water in virtual form from india is through the production of food products by water efficient methods water efficient methods include effective irrigation techniques proper irrigation scheduling suitable crop selection according to the land climate conditions soil type and water availability using alternative sources of water for irrigation opting for dry crop practices in places with less availability of water is strongly advised against water consuming crops on the same area judicious mixing and growing of different crops with lower water demand at the national level need to be taken up to reduce the export of vw from india especially under the present scenario of wide scale depletion in groundwater resources and climate change induced rainfall variability erratic monsoons droughts floods increase in population increase in mean atmospheric temperature depletion of groundwater resources will intimidate food and livestock production in this scenario the need to keep up with the demand for export the producers will be forced to increase groundwater exploitation which will threaten the sustainable development goals of the country this study on the temporal variation in vwt will enable the water managers of the country to prioritize the export and import of products by considering the vw which will result in sustainable management of groundwater resources in india which is already under threat due to climate change as well as degradation in quality due to geogenic and anthropogenic sources of contamination acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the department of science and technology new delhi india grant no dst tm wti 2k15 229 g for the research grant

likewise crops grown at different climatic settings arid to humid areas has different water requirements and hence the water consumption of animals also vary spatially for different breed varieties in india the surface water availability per capita per year for the years 1991 and 2001 were 2309 m3 and 1902 m3 which are projected to decrease by the years 2025 and 2050 to around 1401 m3 and 1191 m3 respectively mowr 1998 according to fao 2016 food and agricultural organisation through aquastat for the year 2010 it was estimated the total water withdrawal for india was 761 km3 of which 688 km3 91 were used for irrigation and livestock respectively studies by hoekstra and hung 2002 reported that india was a net exporter of vw for the years 1995 1999 another global level study made by chapagain and hoekstra 2004 indicated that india was a net exporter of vw for the period from 1997 to 2001 however kumar and jain 2007 have reported that india was a net importer of vw during the period of 2001 2005 the vw import and export due to major crop products for the period from 1961 to 2010 was reported by goswami and nishad 2015 brindha 2017 indicated that india s net vw export has increased by 28 times from the year 1986 2013 there were significant changes in the agricultural and livestock production as well as the availability of water which was affected due to the tsunami floods and droughts witnessed from the year 2005 it is also essential to see whether there is any change in the trade of vw in the context of widespread depletion in groundwater resources in india as reported by aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 and goldin 2016 hence it is necessary to understand the trend of variation in export and import of vw for india through the trade of crops and livestock products under the changing scenario in availability of water resources further it is essential to understand the changes in vw in the recent past for proper planning development and management of the resources antonelli and sartori 2015 the studies carried out on vw trade based on the total food and livestock products is not sufficient to plan and devise strategies for sustainable development and management of groundwater in india since about 80 of agricultural and farming activities depends only on groundwater further no studies have been done on the temporal variation over a long period on indian vw import and export with respect to specific food and livestock products hence the present study was carried out with the objective of assessing the temporal variation in import and export of vw through popular food products crops and livestock from 2006 to 2016 in india 2 materials and methods 2 1 data the annual variation in vwt in india was made based on the information available in authentic public domains the trade data on import and export of crops and livestock products for india were obtained from sources such as food and agricultural organization fao of united nations directorate general of commerce intelligence and statistics dgcis agricultural and processed food products export development authority apeda 2018 coffee board coffee board 2017 the tea board india tea board of india 2018 the rubber board rubber board of india 2018 and department of food and public distribution dfpd 2018 which are governmental agencies of india the data from these organizations were obtained from their official websites and data were collected from reliable sources for the years from 2006 to 2016 only primary food commodities like major crops and livestock products were considered for the study except for major fruits and flowers thus the food and livestock products that are primarily exported from india which are considered as popular products and is given in table 1 financial year april to march was considered for the study except for tea and coffee for which the data was obtained only for the calendar year the minor difference between the calendar year and financial year by three months may not have major influence on the findings 2 2 calculation of virtual water trade the vw exported or imported was calculated by multiplying the trade volume ton year of a product with the water requirement m3 year to produce that product hoekstra and hung 2002 the quantity of vw export vwe and vw import vwi are calculated using the following equation vwe or vwi traded volume ton year vwc of traded product m 3 ton details on quantum of water required to produce various crops and livestock for india were obtained from chapagain and hoekstra 2004 kumar and jain 2007 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 the country s average climate data was used to calculate the vwc of crops and crop products vwc depends on the water demand for the specific crop or livestock of the exporting country water intensive crops require large amount of water since cultivation in india traditionally rice is grown using water logging method which requires more water than by other cultivation methods the crop water requirement affects the vwc of crops and crop products which could result in overestimates or under estimates kumar and jain 2007 the vwc of an animal at the end of its lifespan is defined as the total volume of water that was used to grow and process its feed to provide its drinking water and to clean its housing etc chapagain and hoekstra 2003 it also depends on various other factors like the breed of an animal the water requirements the climatic conditions where the feed and animal has grown the farming system feed consumption and so on chapagain and hoekstra 2003 the calculation of vwi was carried out based on the vwc given in chapagain and hoekstra 2003 3 results and discussion a country s export and import mainly depends on the products consumed by the country s population whenever there is a demand on a product the need for import or increase in production becomes necessary import and export of any food product also results in trade of water in a virtual form and revenue generation in order to calculate the indian vwe and vwi the data on the quantities traded obtained from various reliable sources are taken into account 3 1 export and import of vw the products that are traded in the form of exports and imports also trade water in a virtual form the water traded can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of the product ton yr with the water that was originally required for the production m3 ton the vw content in the crops and livestock products were calculated accordingly and the total estimate on exports and imports during the years from 2006 to 2016 are given in tables 2 and 3 the annual variation in vw trade for various crops and livestock products from the year 2006 2016 are shown in fig 1 it has been noted that there is a decreasing trend of imports of certain products like tea coffee rice wheat groundnut raw sugar and sheep goat meat whereas the imports have increased for other products like cashews walnut grapes onions pulses maize beverages alcoholic and natural rubber similarly the exports for various products have also increased and decreased from year to year the exports of tea coffee rice pulses cashews walnuts raw sugar grapes and buffalo meat have marginally increased while for other products the exports gradually decreased over the last ten years the total export of vw was 14 7 gm3 and total imports was 1 6 gm3 through tea from the year 2006 2016 in the case of coffee the total vw export was 17 1 gm3 and the total vw import was 4 3 gm3 the vw import through coffee has increased by about 1000 times from the year 2012 whereas export has increased by 100 times from 2012 however the details on imported quantum of coffee which is re exported was not available in the case of rice export and import of vw was 195 6 gm3 and 0 024 gm3 respectively the total export and import of vw for wheat was calculated to be 27 2 gm3 and 15 9 gm3 the export of wheat and rice was decreasing while the import has also decreased since 2011 in the case of pulses chick pea pigeon pea dry beans and green peas the total export and import of vw was 3 79 gm3 and 86 1 gm3 respectively the total export and import of vw through maize was calculated to be 53 2 gm3 and 0 49 gm3 increased exports and imports in pulses were observed since 2011 while maize has shown sudden increase in imports for 2016 and decrease of exports since 2012 the data on walnut and cashew s export and import trend for the following years indicate a slight increase in exports and a constant increase in imports the total vw export and import on cashew was 17 8 gm3 and 114 3 gm3 in the case of walnut it was 0 65 gm3 export and 0 083 gm3 import the total vw export on natural rubber was 0 86 gm3 while its total vw import was 13 3 gm3 the export vw for natural rubber has been decreasing whereas its import is increasing since 2011 the total export and import of vw on onions were estimated to be 5 6 gm3 and 0 03 gm3 similarly for raw sugar the total vw exports were calculated to be 18 03 gm3 with imports in negligible amounts of 0 5 gm3 the vw content on livestock products in the form of meat and its processed products have always been higher than the agricultural products this is because the vw content for an animal is high as explained earlier the water consumption for different animals of different regions vary throughout the world as weather conditions the type of environment where the animal has been raised are to be considered the total vw export and import of sheep goat meat is 2 397 gm3 and 0 029 gm3 respectively the export and import statistics of vw based on sheep goat meat indicates a decreasing trend in imports since 2014 and a gradual increasing trend for the year 2016 india is one of the leading exporters in buffalo meat with total vw export of 105 85 gm3 the import of buffalo meat has been very less compared to other meat products india is mainly an exporter of livestock products than importing them meat export plays a huge role in generating revenue the consumption of meat has tremendously increased due to the advent of western culture and the recent economic growth of the country the meat consumption can also be attributed to different religions culture tradition and urbanization devi et al 2014 slaughter houses introduced by the british east indian company set the base for meat industry in india since then the export of live animals animals for meat and secondary products started with information technology sectors growing and food industry showing great development it had also led to import of various food items that cannot be produced in the country overall the total vw exports through crops and livestock products were calculated to be 496 9 gm3 and the total imports to be 237 2 gm3 for the years 2006 2016 3 2 net import and export of vw in order to assess the net export and import of vw the total exports and imports were first analyzed the difference between the total export import per year gives the total net export import for that year the total export of vw for ten years from 2006 2016 were calculated to be 496 9 gm3 the highest contributors in vw export was through rice with 195 6 gm3 followed by buffalo meat with 105 85 gm3 and then by maize with 53 2 gm3 similarly the import of vw for the years from 2006 2016 was calculated to be 237 2 gm3 from other countries the highest contributor in the import of vw was by cashews importing 114 24 gm3 followed by pulses with 86 12 gm3 and then by wheat with 15 9 gm3 india has exported 496 9 gm3 of vw with an average of 49 69 gm3 year and imported 237 21gm3 of vw with an average of 23 72 gm3 year table 4 from these calculations it is understood that india has become a net exporter of vw with an average of 25 9 gm3 year with respect to crops and livestock products from the years 2006 2016 fig 2 this is also reflected by the depletion in groundwater resources of the country goldin 2016 whereas india was a net importer of vw in the years 2001 2005 with an average net import of 25 93 gm3 year kumar and jain 2007 3 3 causes of net annual variation in export and import of vw the net annual variation in export and import is due to many factors such as water availability which in turn is controlled by climate patterns nature of the land area including the soil parameters evapo transpiration rates etc india being a very diverse country with varied weather patterns throughout is characterized by arid and semi arid regions ercin and hoekstra 2014 the country receives an average rainfall of about 4000 km3 in a year with monsoons contributing nearly 3000 km3 kumar et al 2005 the south west monsoon and north east monsoon brings more rainfall during the months of june to september and october to december spatially there is a wide difference in the pattern of rainfall across the country where certain regions in the north eastern part of the country receives about 3400 mm a and some parts in the west receives only about 400 mm a the source of water through rainfall plays a dominant role in the production of food products failure of monsoons or delayed monsoons and deficit rainfall affects the crop production leading to import of food products from other countries according to intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2001 india is likely to experience short term higher precipitation intensity and long term dry days shah 2008 reported monsoonal crops would experience greater risks against flood as well as droughts and summer crops would experience high evapotranspiration due to increase in temperatures this necessitates frequent irrigation for better crop yield thus contributing to more vw inputs in the context of climate change it is expected that the export of agricultural and livestock products will lead to trade of much larger amount of vw over exploitation of water for increased production of certain important crops like rice wheat and their exports lead to a maximum trade of vw countries like india that concentrates on self sufficiency in food as a national priority will try to produce more crops to feed the country s ever growing population gupta and deshpande 2004 kumar and singh 2005 water is used in large quantities considering the evapo transpiration rates and the weather patterns for different areas across the country more than the crop actually requires for its growth the crops produced in hot arid to semi arid regions will require more water than the crops grown in regions with moderate climate the net change in annual vw also differs based on the area of production the final production rate export and its import the net export value of a particular crop product increases when it is easily produced in a surplus quantity from the data it may be inferred that rice was exported the most and then followed by other crops like maize wheat pulses sugar cashew coffee etc india is also a leading exporter of livestock products especially buffalo meat but with less quantity of import from abroad 4 conclusion studies on vw trade based on the total food and livestock products is common however in this study temporal variation in vwt of some significant agricultural and livestock products exported from india was brought out from a period from 2006 to 2016 which would be useful to plan and devise strategies for sustainable development and management of groundwater in india since about 80 of agricultural and farming activities depends only on groundwater india has exported on an average of 49 69 gm3 y and imported 23 72 gm3 y of vw thus becoming the net exporter with an average of 25 9 gm3 y for the years 2006 2016 as about 80 of agricultural activity in india depend on groundwater usage depletion of this resource is evident over the recent decades considering increasing trend of population growth food production cannot be reduced in order to conserve water as water consumption and food production are interdependent the high export of certain food products is related to overexploitation of groundwater increase in vwe in future will lead to further decline in groundwater resources in spite of enormous measures taken by various agencies to overcome this problem by aquifer recharge measures it is important that the foods be produced in sufficient quantities according to the needs and in calculative quantities for export through stringent measures to reduce the use of water and produce more production of water efficient crops could bring income and at the same time would make us rely more on imports the agricultural and livestock products that are produced by stringent water efficient methods especially the products such as rice maize buffalo meat etc only may be encouraged for export beef export and production should also be reduced since india is one of the top producers and export of beef and vw in beef production is generally high the vw trade only through food products has been made in this study not just the agricultural industry depends on groundwater but also other industries like chemicals and fertilisers leather products automobiles spare parts mining textile etc however the use of groundwater for agricultural and farming purpose is about 85 and the remaining only is used for industrial and domestic purposes hence the only way out to reduce the export of water in virtual form from india is through the production of food products by water efficient methods water efficient methods include effective irrigation techniques proper irrigation scheduling suitable crop selection according to the land climate conditions soil type and water availability using alternative sources of water for irrigation opting for dry crop practices in places with less availability of water is strongly advised against water consuming crops on the same area judicious mixing and growing of different crops with lower water demand at the national level need to be taken up to reduce the export of vw from india especially under the present scenario of wide scale depletion in groundwater resources and climate change induced rainfall variability erratic monsoons droughts floods increase in population increase in mean atmospheric temperature depletion of groundwater resources will intimidate food and livestock production in this scenario the need to keep up with the demand for export the producers will be forced to increase groundwater exploitation which will threaten the sustainable development goals of the country this study on the temporal variation in vwt will enable the water managers of the country to prioritize the export and import of products by considering the vw which will result in sustainable management of groundwater resources in india which is already under threat due to climate change as well as degradation in quality due to geogenic and anthropogenic sources of

12304,groundwater samples were collected in maheshwaram mandal ranga reddy district telangana state india for two seasons pre monsoon and post monsoon and analyzed for chemical parameters with respect to fluoride the fluoride concentration ranges from 0 31 to 3 03 mg l and 0 28 2 58 mg l during pre monsoon prm and post monsoon pom seasons respectively results showed that water samples were contaminated with presence of fluoride ion high fluoride concentration recorded during prm 62 and pom 38 when compared with world health organization tolerance limit of 1 5 mg l the higher ratio of na ca indicates dissolution of fluoride minerals at higher ph and the hco3 ca ratio indicate the condition favoring to dissolution of fluoride ions hydrogeochemical facies distribution indicates water

hydrogeochemical facies gibb s plot and principal component analysis pca 1 introduction fluoride contamination in drinking water due to natural and anthropogenic activities has been recognized as one of the major problems worldwide imposing a serious threat to human health fluorine has the highest electro negativity and most reactive among all known elements fluoride ion f occurs in natural waters commonly in concentrations less than 1 0 mg l and seldom outside the range from 0 01 to 10 0 mg l the amount of fluoride ion f occurring naturally in groundwater is governed principally by climate composition of the host rock and hydrogeology some anthropogenic activities such as use of phosphatic fertilizers pesticides and sewage and sludge depletion of groundwater table agricultural practices etc have also been indicated to cause an increase in fluoride ion f concentration in groundwater epa 1997 ramanaiah et al 2006 kim and jeong 2005 due to excessive fluoride ion f intake dental and skeletal fluorosis occur besides the muscle fiber degeneration low hemoglobin levels excessive thirst headache skin rashes nervousness and depression etc meenakshi 2006 in natural conditions the concentration of fluoride ion f in water is generally 1 mg l hem 1991 the who 2004 suggests that the highest desirable limit of fluoride ion f is 1 5 mg l in water for drinking purpose in india the bureau of indian standards bis 2003 prescribed the fluoride ion f limits 0 6 1 2 mg l the reported literature on health hazards associated with long term ingestion of f bearing water is summarized

one can plan the strategies to mitigate the health problems the chosen area for this study was undertaken to investigate the quality of underground drinking water of mahashwaram mandal ranga reddy district is marked as one of the prevalent fluoride zones in telangana state india this has prompted the authors to take up the present study to delineated fluoride vulnerable zones and to identify the geochemical process controlling the incidence of fluoride in groundwater 1 1 study area the study area covering about 240 sq km falls in maheshwaram mandal ranga reddy district of telangana state it is located 35 km from hyderabad india on srisailam highway study area lies in between north latitudes 17 02 to 17 14 and east longitudes 78 18 to 78 34 fig 1 a and falls in the survey of india toposheet no e44 m 8 and e44 m 12 the study area receives average annual rainfall of 793 mm during the year 2006 2016 by southwest northeast winter and summer monsoons table 1 and fig 1b the climate of the study area is generally hot average temperature in summer is 40 c in winter is 14 c the most of the study area was irrigated for paddy crops and mango gardens were excessive use of fertilizers were common 1 2 geology the major exposure of the study area is peninsular gneiss and calc gneiss which have been marked for widespread fluoride bearing minerals indicating their accessibility to water by weathering along with leaching process mica content is significantly noted in peninsular gneiss and apatite ca5 po4 3 f cl oh hornblende ca2 mg fe al 5 al si 8 o22 oh 2 or biotite k mg fe 3 alsi3o10 f oh 2 is noted which are the sources of fluoride into the groundwater srinivasamoorthy et al 2008a b 1 3 hydrogeology the rocks in and around mahashwaram area is referred to as granitic rock secondary porosity develops the rocks into aquifers the weathered zone characterized by low hydraulic conductivity in the country rocks extends up to a depth of 25 m whereas the fractured zone occurs up to a depth of 75 m from the ground surface groundwater exists under unconfined conditions in the weathered zone as well as under semi unconfined conditions to confined conditions in the fractured zone groundwater is being exploited through open dug wells that tap the weathered zone and bore wells are used to tap the fractured aquifer the water collected from the study area is from the unconfined aquifer system water table conditions depths of water level vary from 5 to 14 m from the ground surface the direction of groundwater flow follows the topography of the area local groundwater runoff is absent recirculation of groundwater is common when the water is used for irrigation 2 materials and methods in order to assess the groundwater quality forty two groundwater

concentrations are tabulated in table 2 3 1 physico chemical characteristics groundwater is from slightly acidic to alkaline nature with ph varying between 6 70 8 80 and 6 60 8 60 during pre and post monsoon seasons the ec varying from 525 to 3922 μs cm and 425 2910 μs cm in pre and post monsoon seasons higher electrical conductivity indicates enrichment of salts in the groundwater total dissolved salts in the groundwater is between 165 and 2510 mg l and 272 1862 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons high tds is due to the influence of anthropogenic source such as domestic sewage septic tanks and agricultural activities krishna kumar et al 2017 the ca2 values ranges from 18 to 180 mg l and 14 176 mg l and mg2 values varying from 2 0 to 74 mg l and 10 103 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the th values range from 56 to 754 mg l and 76 863 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the hardness of the water is due to the presence of alkaline earths such as calcium and magnesium the na values range from 16 to 189 mg l and 28 276 mg l the na values range from 16 to 189 mg l and 28 276 mg l and k values range from 01 to 10 mg l and 01 08 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the concentration hco3 varies from 55 to 567 mg l and 78 708 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons bicarbonate usually the primary anion in groundwater is derived from the carbon dioxide released by the organic decomposition in the soil todd 1980 the cl range varies from 24 to 344 mg l and 36 687 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the chloride in groundwater may be from diverse sources such as weathering leaching of rocks and soil domestic and municipal effluents sarath prasanth et al 2012 the so4 2 values varied from 16 to 249 mg l and 19 249 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the leachable sulfate presents in fertilizer and other human influences increase the sulfate concentration in groundwater due to breaking of sulfates by decomposition craig and anderson 1979 the no3 values varied from 3 0 to 200 mg l and 4 128 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the high nitrate values are indicating leaching of organic substances from weathered soil the seasonal variations of nitrate were caused due to change in the volume of drainage reaching the water table and not by the change in concentration beck et al 1985 the fluoride concentration varied from 0 31 to 3 03 mg l and 0 28 2 58 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the maximum tolerance limit 1 5 mg l recommended by world health organization who 2011 ingestion of water with fluoride concentration above 1 5 mg l causes fluorosis madhnure et al 2007 due to highly weathered formation and long time pumping for irrigation use are the responsible factors for the leaching of fluoride minerals from their parent rocks further concentration has been brought about due to semi arid climate of the region and long residence time of groundwater in the aquifer wodeyar and sreenivasan 1996 the influence of local lithology and soil aided by other factors like very low freshwater exchange due to the semi arid climate of the regions average daily temperature 30 c and average rainfall of 638 mm is responsible for higher concentration of fluoride in the groundwater of the region higher concentration was noted that due to presence of dominant fluoride bearing minerals like apatite ca5 po4 3 f cl oh hornblende ca2 mg fe al 5 al si 8 o22 oh 2 and biotite k mg fe 3 alsi3o10 f oh 2 which have enhanced the fluoride concentration higher concentration of fluoride was noted in granites due to the easy accessibility of fluoride minerals due to the higher degree of weathered and fractured zones in granites in order to identify possible combinations ratio values of important variables were selected the ratio of hco3 cl during prm and pom were found in the range of 0 46 7 73 and 0 28 9 34 table 3 the average ratio value of 2 37 and 2 53 indicates dominance of carbonate ions from silicate weathering on other hand involves hydrolysis and precipitation of secondary clay minerals whereas values less than one indicate domination of chloride ion in the study area the na cl ratio was observed in the range of 0 09 3 04 and 0 29 3 22 the decrease in ratio indicates modification of sodium carbonate water by dissolution or mixing with sodium chloride whereas increase in chloride may be due to local recharge dhiman and keshari 2006 the ratio value of na cl was observed in the range of 0 20 7 27 and 0 50 10 14 the increase in average 1 50 and 2 09 ratios may be due to lowering calcium activity whereby high sodium activates the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals at higher ph in groundwater system shaji et al 2007 the hco3 ca2 ratio was observed in the range of 1 06 19 10 and 1 00 25 43 with an average of 4 18 and 5 23 which indicate favorable chemical condition for fluoride dissolution saxena and ahmed 2003 attempt on correlation matrix for the chemical parameters as presented in tables 4 a and 4b shows a negative correlation between ph and fluoride water with high f concentration makes the water alkaline when carbonate rocks water are in contact with fluoride bearing minerals alkalinity is related to the carbonate system those probably the influence of fluoride on the alkalinity could be not very important due to the difference in their concentrations fig 2 a and b the ionic radius of fluoride 0 136 nm was same as that of hydroxyl of which can be easily substituted for one another from water at high ph sreedevi et al 2006 gupta et al 2006 a positive correlation with na and hco3 with correlation coefficients of 0 67 and 0 81 in pre and post monsoon seasons fig 3a and b 4 a and b respectively a negative or poor correlation is seen with ca2 0 15 0

hydrogeochemical facies gibb s plot and principal component analysis pca 1 introduction fluoride contamination in drinking water due to natural and anthropogenic activities has been recognized as one of the major problems worldwide imposing a serious threat to human health fluorine has the highest electro negativity and most reactive among all known elements fluoride ion f occurs in natural waters commonly in concentrations less than 1 0 mg l and seldom outside the range from 0 01 to 10 0 mg l the amount of fluoride ion f occurring naturally in groundwater is governed principally by climate composition of the host rock and hydrogeology some anthropogenic activities such as use of phosphatic fertilizers pesticides and sewage and sludge depletion of groundwater table agricultural practices etc have also been indicated to cause an increase in fluoride ion f concentration in groundwater epa 1997 ramanaiah et al 2006 kim and jeong 2005 due to excessive fluoride ion f intake dental and skeletal fluorosis occur besides the muscle fiber degeneration low hemoglobin levels excessive thirst headache skin rashes nervousness and depression etc meenakshi 2006 in natural conditions the concentration of fluoride ion f in water is generally 1 mg l hem 1991 the who 2004 suggests that the highest desirable limit of fluoride ion f is 1 5 mg l in water for drinking purpose in india the bureau of indian standards bis 2003 prescribed the fluoride ion f limits 0 6 1 2 mg l the reported literature on health hazards associated with long term ingestion of f bearing water is summarized handa 1975 sahu and karim 1989 wodeyar and sreenivasan 1996 apambire et al 1997 agrawal et al 1997 chatterjee and mohabey 1998 sumalatha et al 1999 susheela 1999 chakraborti et al 2000 ray et al 2000 kundu et al 2001 madhavan and subramanian 2002 bis 2003 das et al 2003 who 2004 jacks et al 2005 kim and jeong 2005 ravindra and grag 2006 subba rao et al 2012 machender et al 2014 around 200 million people from 25 nations suffer from ill health because of a higher fluoride ion f concentration in drinking water ayoob and gupta 2006 in cold countries such as usa or uk fluoride ion f stricken fetal health problems are reported ayoob and gupta 2006 in mexco 5 million people about 6 of the population are affected by f in groundwater while in kenya and south africa the levels of fluoride ion f exceed 25 mg l grimaldo et al 1997 in india its concentration up to 38 5 mg l is found susheela 1999 the dreaded fluorosis prevalent in some parts of central and western china is a result of drinking of fluoride ion f bearing groundwater in india about 60 million people including 6 million children especially in the states of andhra pradesh assam bihar delhi gujarat karnataka kerala madhya pradesh maharashtra orissa punjab rajasthan talangana tamilnadu and uttar pradesh have no option except to drink fluoride ion f contaminated drinking water madhavan and subramanian 2002 pillai and stanley 2002 das et al 2003 subba rao 2003 2011 sujatha 2003 mor et al 2009 raju et al 2009 many researchers worldwide including india studied the controlling factors of fluoride concentration in groundwater through geological chemical and physical characteristics of aquifers porosity of soil rocks climatic conditions depth of water level and interaction of other chemical element for enhancement of fluoride distribution handa 1975 ramessam and rajagopalan 1985 sahu and karim 1989 jacks et al 1993 2005 wodeyar and sreenivasan 1996 apambire et al 1997 subba rao 2003 2011 subba rao and john devadas 2003 madhnure et al 2007 raju et al 2009 but these factors are not uniform in space and time thus an examination of source of fluoride ion f in groundwater over the country is a prerequisite before one can plan the strategies to mitigate the health problems the chosen area for this study was undertaken to investigate the quality of underground drinking water of mahashwaram mandal ranga reddy district is marked as one of the prevalent fluoride zones in telangana state india this has prompted the authors to take up the present study to delineated fluoride vulnerable zones and to identify the geochemical process controlling the incidence of fluoride in groundwater 1 1 study area the study area covering about 240 sq km falls in maheshwaram mandal ranga reddy district of telangana state it is located 35 km from hyderabad india on srisailam highway study area lies in between north latitudes 17 02 to 17 14 and east longitudes 78 18 to 78 34 fig 1 a and falls in the survey of india toposheet no e44 m 8 and e44 m 12 the study area receives average annual rainfall of 793 mm during the year 2006 2016 by southwest northeast winter and summer monsoons table 1 and fig 1b the climate of the study area is generally hot average temperature in summer is 40 c in winter is 14 c the most of the study area was irrigated for paddy crops and mango gardens were excessive use of fertilizers were common 1 2 geology the major exposure of the study area is peninsular gneiss and calc gneiss which have been marked for widespread fluoride bearing minerals indicating their accessibility to water by weathering along with leaching process mica content is significantly noted in peninsular gneiss and apatite ca5 po4 3 f cl oh hornblende ca2 mg fe al 5 al si 8 o22 oh 2 or biotite k mg fe 3 alsi3o10 f oh 2 is noted which are the sources of fluoride into the groundwater srinivasamoorthy et al 2008a b 1 3 hydrogeology the rocks in and around mahashwaram area is referred to as granitic rock secondary porosity develops the rocks into aquifers the weathered zone characterized by low hydraulic conductivity in the country rocks extends up to a depth of 25 m whereas the fractured zone occurs up to a depth of 75 m from the ground surface groundwater exists under unconfined conditions in the weathered zone as well as under semi unconfined conditions to confined conditions in the fractured zone groundwater is being exploited through open dug wells that tap the weathered zone and bore wells are used to tap the fractured aquifer the water collected from the study area is from the unconfined aquifer system water table conditions depths of water level vary from 5 to 14 m from the ground surface the direction of groundwater flow follows the topography of the area local groundwater runoff is absent recirculation of groundwater is common when the water is used for irrigation 2 materials and methods in order to assess the groundwater quality forty two groundwater samples have been collected in pre cleaned polyethylene containers for pre and post monsoon seasons in 2014 year they were analyzed for ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k carbonate co3 2 bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 and fluoride f for all physico chemical parameter using standard methods apha 1995 the ph was measured with digital ph meter model 802 systronics and electrical conductivity was measured with conductivity meter model 304 systronics total dissolved solids were estimated by calculation method sodium and potassium was measured with flame photometer model systronics 130 the th as caco3 and ca were analyzed volumetrically using standard edta the concentration mg is difference between the th and ca2 co3 2 and hco3 were estimated by titrating with standard hcl using phenolphthalein and methyl orange as acid base indicators the cl was analyzed by titrating with standard agno3 sulphates and nitrates were measured with spectronics 21 model bausch lomb fluoride concentration was measured with orion ion analyzer with fluoride ion selective electrode the units ec is expressed in micro siemens per centimeter μs cm at 25 c while those for the remaining chemical variables except ph are in milligrams per liter mg l 2 1 ionic balance error ionic balance

the acceptable limit 5 1 i b e t c c t c a t c c t c a 100 3 results and discussion the statistical parameters like minimum maximum and mean concentration of physic chemical parameters major ion concentrations are tabulated in table 2 3 1 physico chemical characteristics groundwater is from slightly acidic to alkaline nature with ph varying between 6 70 8 80 and 6 60 8 60 during pre and post monsoon seasons the ec varying from 525 to 3922 μs cm and 425 2910 μs cm in pre and post monsoon seasons higher electrical conductivity indicates enrichment of salts in the groundwater total dissolved salts in the groundwater is between 165 and 2510 mg l and 272 1862 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons high tds is due to the influence of anthropogenic source such as domestic sewage septic tanks and agricultural activities krishna kumar et al 2017 the ca2 values ranges from 18 to 180 mg l and 14 176 mg l and mg2 values varying from 2 0 to 74 mg l and 10 103 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the th values range from 56 to 754 mg l and 76 863 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the hardness of the water is due to the presence of alkaline earths such as calcium and magnesium the na values range from 16 to 189 mg l and 28 276 mg l the na values range from 16 to 189 mg l and 28 276 mg l and k values range from 01 to 10 mg l and 01 08 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the concentration hco3 varies from 55 to 567 mg l and 78 708 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons bicarbonate usually the primary anion in groundwater is derived from the carbon dioxide released by the organic decomposition in the soil todd 1980 the cl range varies from 24 to 344 mg l and 36 687 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the chloride in groundwater may be from diverse sources such as weathering leaching of rocks and soil domestic and municipal effluents sarath prasanth et al 2012 the so4 2 values varied from 16 to 249 mg l and 19 249 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the leachable sulfate presents in fertilizer and other human influences increase the sulfate concentration in groundwater due to breaking of sulfates by decomposition craig and anderson 1979 the no3 values varied from 3 0 to 200 mg l and 4 128 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the high nitrate values are indicating leaching of organic substances from weathered soil the seasonal variations of nitrate were caused due to change in the volume of drainage reaching the water table and not by the change in concentration beck et al 1985 the fluoride concentration varied from 0 31 to 3 03 mg l and 0 28 2 58 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons the maximum tolerance limit 1 5 mg l recommended by world health organization who 2011 ingestion of water with fluoride concentration above 1 5 mg l causes fluorosis madhnure et al 2007 due to highly weathered formation and long time pumping for irrigation use are the responsible factors for the leaching of fluoride minerals from their parent rocks further concentration has been brought about due to semi arid climate of the region and long residence time of groundwater in the aquifer wodeyar and sreenivasan 1996 the influence of local lithology and soil aided by other factors like very low freshwater exchange due to the semi arid climate of the regions average daily temperature 30 c and average rainfall of 638 mm is responsible for higher concentration of fluoride in the groundwater of the region higher concentration was noted that due to presence of dominant fluoride bearing minerals like apatite ca5 po4 3 f cl oh hornblende ca2 mg fe al 5 al si 8 o22 oh 2 and biotite k mg fe 3 alsi3o10 f oh 2 which have enhanced the fluoride concentration higher concentration of fluoride was noted in granites due to the easy accessibility of fluoride minerals due to the higher degree of weathered and fractured zones in granites in order to identify possible combinations ratio values of important variables were selected the ratio of hco3 cl during prm and pom were found in the range of 0 46 7 73 and 0 28 9 34 table 3 the average ratio value of 2 37 and 2 53 indicates dominance of carbonate ions from silicate weathering on other hand involves hydrolysis and precipitation of secondary clay minerals whereas values less than one indicate domination of chloride ion in the study area the na cl ratio was observed in the range of 0 09 3 04 and 0 29 3 22 the decrease in ratio indicates modification of sodium carbonate water by dissolution or mixing with sodium chloride whereas increase in chloride may be due to local recharge dhiman and keshari 2006 the ratio value of na cl was observed in the range of 0 20 7 27 and 0 50 10 14 the increase in average 1 50 and 2 09 ratios may be due to lowering calcium activity whereby high sodium activates the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals at higher ph in groundwater system shaji et al 2007 the hco3 ca2 ratio was observed in the range of 1 06 19 10 and 1 00 25 43 with an average of 4 18 and 5 23 which indicate favorable chemical condition for fluoride dissolution saxena and ahmed 2003 attempt on correlation matrix for the chemical parameters as presented in tables 4 a and 4b shows a negative correlation between ph and fluoride water with high f concentration makes the water alkaline when carbonate rocks water are in contact with fluoride bearing minerals alkalinity is related to the carbonate system those probably the influence of fluoride on the alkalinity could be not very important due to the difference in their concentrations fig 2 a and b the ionic radius of fluoride 0 136 nm was same as that of hydroxyl of which can be easily substituted for one another from water at high ph sreedevi et al 2006 gupta et al 2006 a positive correlation with na and hco3 with correlation coefficients of 0 67 and 0 81 in pre and post monsoon seasons fig 3a and b 4 a and b respectively a negative or poor correlation is seen with ca2 0 15 0

diagram is dominated in pre and post monsoon seasons are naco3 cl and mixed canamghco3 cl water type fig 6 a and b this process indicates that alkalis na k and strong acids cl so4 dominated over the alkaline earth ca mg and weak acids in pre and post monsoon seasons 3 3 gibbs diagram gibbs diagram is widely used to establish the relationship of water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics three distinct fields such as precipitation dominance rock dominance and evaporation dominance areas are shown in the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 ms excel 2007 version is used for the plotting of gibbs diagram the predominant samples fall in the rock dominance and evaporation dominance field of the gibbs diagram in the both pre and post monsoon seasons fig 7 a and b the rock dominance field indicates the interaction between rock chemistry and the chemistry of the percolated waters under the subsurface the evaporation results in increased tds relative to the confined water with relation to high ratios of dominant cations and anions especially sodium ions due to caco3 precipitate caused by the combination of ca2 and hco3 huge quantities of irrigation return flow elevated groundwater level hence increases evaporation and induce salinization 3 4 spatial distribution arc gis 10 1 version used to the spatial distribution maps of the study area the spatial distribution of

during pom higher concentrations of fluoride was found in 38 samples indicating dilution dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals due to infiltration of rainwater in general seasonal fluctuations were noted higher when compared with lithological influence during both the seasons 4 principal component analysis pca the principal component analysis obtained by initial eigen values and percent of the
