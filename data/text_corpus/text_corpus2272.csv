11360,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural soils in the canadian prairie region are generally low and due to dry well aerated soil conditions can be quite variable compared to dryland rainfed crop production irrigated cropping has potential to contribute greater quantities of soil derived nitrous oxide n2o carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 to the atmosphere as producers target higher yields by minimizing soil moisture limitations and applying greater amounts of nitrogen fertilizers however the actual ghg dynamics from irrigated soils in this region are not well understood as there have been few field based studies in the semi arid prairies of western canada the goal of this study was to identify how emissions of soil derived n2o co2 and ch4 are influenced by changes in soil temperature water status and nitrogen rates brought about by irrigated crop management this was achieved through continuous in situ monitoring of soil conditions and chamber based measurements of soil ghg flux the most notable change in soil conditions brought about by irrigation was elevated moisture levels which appeared to influence the flux dynamics of all three agricultural greenhouse gases specifically a reduction in ch4 uptake and periodic increases in co2 and n2o emissions despite the reduced soil moisture limitation annual n2o emissions from the irrigated cropping system were much lower than those calculated using the current canadian national ghg inventory reporting this suggests that annual emissions are limited more by n availability rather than moisture deficits as the current method for emissions accounting assumes consequently our results indicate that emissions from irrigated cropping systems in the semi arid canadian prairies are overestimated by the current inventory approach moreover because irrigated crop production involves more than just the application of water our results demonstrate that a more systems oriented approach to ghg accounting is required to capture the combined effects of water soil crop management on ghg emissions from irrigated cropping systems keywords irrigated cropping dryland cropping nitrous oxide carbon dioxide methane 1 introduction the production of greenhouse gases ghg in soils is largely the result of microbial processes thus a change in crop management that promotes microbial activity can result in elevated levels of ghg emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 irrigated crop management involves water applications to supplement natural precipitation and the application of nutrients especially n at rates greater than those applied in comparable dryland cropping systems thus by altering soil temperature moisture and fertility regimes irrigated crop management creates the potential for greater emissions of soil derived ghgs i e n2o co2 and ch4 trost et al 2013 under dryland conditions in the northern great plains n2o emissions from agricultural cropping typically follows a pattern that is characterized by persistent low magnitude baseline emissions punctuated by episodic high emission events brumme et al 1999 yates et al 2006a 2006b similar results have been reported for other semi arid regions including australia barton et al 2008 and china liu et al 2011 the greatest n2o efflux is usually observed in the spring during snowmelt and corresponding thawing of the soil hao et al 2001 lemke et al 1998 liebig et al 2010 mosier et al 2006 nyborg et al 1997 rochette et al 2008 indeed up to 60 of the total estimated growing season n2o losses may occur during spring thaw events lemke et al 1998 large emissions also are associated with the first precipitation irrigation event s following spring fertilization dusenbury et al 2008 guenzi et al 1994 halvorson and del grosso 2012 liebig et al 2005 the magnitude of precipitation induced emission peaks are largest early in the growing season and diminish throughout the year dobbie et al 1999 jabro et al 2008 sainju et al 2012 giving way to a low level background emissions pattern as crop growth depletes the pool of available n hao et al 2001 indeed the low n2o emissions occurring during the fall season are likely a result of minimal soil n availability low soil temperature and low moisture content dusenbury et al 2008 liebig et al 2005 sainju et al 2012 irrigated crop management increases the potential for n2o emissions through the combination of elevated seasonal soil moisture and high fertilizer n rates contributing to high soil n availability bouwman 1996 ellert and janzen 2008 the methodology used to estimate fertilizer induced n2o emissions fie for the canadian national inventory report cnir considers regional climatic moisture trends using precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pe data to estimate emission factors rochette et al 2008 the method assumes that emissions are limited primarily by moisture deficit and that irrigation removes the stress associated with this deficit i e irrigation p pe therefore estimates of annual emissions from irrigated cropping systems are typically much greater than dryland cropping systems especially in the semi arid prairie region cropping systems exchange large quantities of carbon through photosynthesis and decomposition highly productive irrigated cropping systems fix large quantities of atmospheric co2 in plant biomass that when returned to the system as crop residues create potential for carbon sequestration through soil organic matter som accumulation flynn and smith 2010 follett 2001 smith et al 2008 however realizing this potential depends on the rate of microbial decomposition which as a result of elevated seasonal soil moisture levels may be greater in irrigated systems jabro et al 2008 trost et al 2013 as decomposition activity increases som is lost reducing the pool of stored soil carbon by releasing it to the atmosphere as co2 a saskatchewan study that investigated the effects of long term irrigated crop management on soil properties found that in spite of consistently high residue returns the total organic matter content of irrigated soils did not increase presumably due to rapid organic matter cycling bardak meyers 1996 soils in the semi arid prairies are natural sinks for atmospheric ch4 as a result of oxidation processes facilitated by methanotrophic microbes under aerobic soil conditions fowler et al 2009 liebig et al 2005 however natural rates of soil ch4 consumption are reduced by agricultural conversion of grasslands fowler et al 2009 robertson and grace 2004 as a result agricultural soils can vary from being small sinks to minor sources of atmospheric ch4 with greater uptake occurring under drier soil conditions liebig et al 2010 mosier et al 2006 irrigation is intended to reduce if not eliminate water related crop stress by increasing the plant available water content of the soil and the accompanying increase in seasonal soil moisture may diminish a soils natural capacity for ch4 uptake liu et al 2006 sainju et al 2012 a large irrigable land base substantial freshwater resources and ever increasing demands for food and fiber provide strong impetus for the expansion of irrigated crop production in the canadian prairies at the same time it is important that we improve our understanding of the consequences of converting dryland cropping systems to irrigated production in this region the factors driving ghg emissions from dryland cropping systems in the prairies are relatively well studied lemke et al 2009 however the question remains how are ghg dynamics altered by irrigated cropping conditions in this region to address this question the present study took a systems approach i e we compared irrigated and dryland rainfed production systems taking note of the fact that irrigated cropping systems are generally more intensively managed and that differences in ghg emissions between the two production systems will reflect differences in the combined effect of water nutrient and crop management the specific objectives of the study were to i measure and compare soil greenhouse gas emissions from irrigated and dryland cropping systems typical of prairie canada and ii determine how observed soil ghg fluxes correspond to soil conditions influenced by irrigated crop management i e annual fertilizer application rate and seasonal soil moisture and temperature trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area fig 1 is located in the lake diefenbaker development area saskatchewan s largest irrigated cropping region approximately 75 km south of the city of saskatoon the study was conducted on a field quarter section scale and included two adjacent quarter sections ir12 51 39 34 n 106 56 31 w and ir13 51 39 09 n 106 55 51 w that have been under irrigation since 1979 and a nearby quarter section dl 51 38 41 n 106 57 16 w that has been managed under dryland production since 1907 all three fields were managed by the same cooperator and had been in the same rotations for the past decade soils of the study area are broadly classified as orthic dark brown chernozems typic haplustoll in the u s system kastanozem in the wrb system developed on medium to fine textured moderately calcareous sandy glaciolacustrine deposits having over 15 clay the local topography is very gently undulating with slopes of 0 5 2 a detailed soil survey was conducted in the fall of 2011 to identify comparable areas within each field in which to establish gas sampling transects particle size analyses of the surface 0 30 cm soils were determined using the modified pipette method indorante 1990 bulk densities within and below the tillage layer were measured using a core sampler hao et al 2008 total c and n in the surface 0 30

1998 soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in a 1 2 v v soil water suspension hendershot and lalande 2008 basic soil properties at the three field sites are summarized in table 1 the dl site was planted to a wheat canola cropping sequence while the ir12 and ir13 sites were managed under a wheat dry bean canola sequence with different phases of the rotation present in each year during the 2012 production year both the ir12 and dl sites were in the wheat triticum aestivum l phase while ir13 was in the dry bean phaseolus vulgarus phase table 2 dry bean is typically not grown under dryland conditions thus the ir13 site was not sampled in 2012 likewise during the 2013 production year site ir12 was in the dry bean phase and thus was not sampled during the growing season i e from seeding up to the time of fall fertilizer application however the site was sampled during the pre planting period from snowmelt to seeding in 2013 the ir13 and dl sites were sampled when the fields were cropped to the canola brassica napus phase of their respective sequences fertilizer applications occurred twice during the production year in late fall when the soil temperature was 5 c and at the time of seeding in spring anhydrous ammonia aa was applied in the fall and comprised the bulk of the fertilizer n applied for the 2012 table 3 and 2013 table 4 growing seasons granular fertilizers were applied at seeding to meet the remaining fertility requirements including n p k and s the fall fertilization event marked the beginning of the production year which concluded just prior to fall fertilizer application in the following calendar year all fertilizer applications were determined following a fall soil test and were based on recommended target yields for the irrigated and non irrigated crops irrigation crop development corp icdc 2012 in general soil disturbance during the wheat and canola phases of the crop sequences at both the dryland and irrigated sites was limited to that which occurred during the fall application of aa and during spring seeding operations however additional tillage operations both during the fall prior to the aa application and during the growing season see table 5 for details were involved in the dry bean phase of the irrigated sequence irrigation was applied using center pivot systems with low pressure 138 240 kpa rotating sprinklers r3000 nelson irrigation corporation mounted on drop tubes which placed the sprinklers approximately 1 4 m above the soil surface irrigation scheduling occurred at the discretion of the cooperator using the alberta irrigation management model aimm http agriculture alberta ca acis imcin aimm jsp which estimates irrigation requirements based on calculated crop evapotranspiration and modeled soil water status typical to center pivot irrigation management irrigation volumes generally less than 15 mm application depth per irrigation event were targeted to meet plant water requirements and rarely resulted in saturated soil conditions the sampling sites were instrumented and all measurements initiated as soon as possible after planting in the spring of 2012 monitoring concluded at the end of the 2013 production year due to the timing of project approval fall 2011 and the logistics for site preparation i e inability to install equipment into frozen soil fall 2011 and early spring 2012 ghg fluxes were not measured therefore the 2012 data do not represent a full production cycle the 2013 data however include a complete production year i e from fall fertilizer application in october 2012 through to the next fall fertilizer application in october 2013 greenhouse gas fluxes were measured for all three fields dl ir12 and ir13 from fall fertilizer application in 2012 to just prior to spring seeding in 2013 this time frame allowed for flux comparisons during the expected peak emission period following soil thaw soil conditions and ghg fluxes were not monitored during the winter months soil freeze up to thaw as losses from frozen soils during this period are considered to be minimal in this region malhi et al 2001 2 2 soil derived greenhouse gas measurements soil ghg emissions were measured using rectangular 22 0 cm 45 5 cm 15 0 cm w l h inside dimensions non steady state vented chambers constructed from clear 6 mm thick polymethyl methacrylate pmma chamber bases were installed into the soil to a depth of 5 cm and except during seeding and tillage operations remained in place for the entire year when installed the chambers had a headspace volume of 10 l and covered an area of 1000 cm2 twenty chambers were installed in each field at 6 25 m intervals along a 125 m linear transect supplemental fig s1 in an effort to avoid sampling the same seed rows and furrows along the sampling transect every second chamber was offset from the transect centerline by one meter plants were excluded from the chamber and the crop rows disturbed by chamber installation were replanted along the outside perimeter of the chamber base transects were oriented parallel to the direction of seeding to minimize disruption to normal cropping operations a major challenge associated with chamber based flux measurements is addressing the high spatial and temporal variation associated with soil ghg production to minimize sampling bias associated with diurnal variations in gas fluxes brought about by temperature fluctuations flux measurements were made during a four hour time window i e between 10 00 and 14 00 h on each sampling day sampling one transect took approximately 90 min and to avoid any temporal bias the first site sampled on a given day alternated between the dl and ir sites seasonality and day to day variations were addressed by increasing sampling frequency during periods when fluxes were expected to be greatest and most variable i e the highest sampling frequency 2 3 times per week occurred at the start of the season during spring thaw and following seeding operations sampling frequency then decreased from twice per week to once per week as the growing season progressed and emission intensity decreased and then to once every 2 3 weeks from harvest to soil freeze up in the fall in addition gas fluxes were measured 24 h after each irrigation event and after any significant 6 mm precipitation event during the sampling season in an effort to capture the extremely high spatial variability of gas fluxes especially n2o chambers were constructed with a large footprint 1000 cm2 and twenty points were sampled from each site to determine daily fluxes during each sampling event gas samples were drawn from chamber headspace through a rubber septum in the chamber lid using a 20 ml syringe fitted with a 25 gauge needle and immediately injected into pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vials labco limited uk for storage and transport samples were collected at 15 t15 30 t30 and 45 t45 minutes after lid closure in addition to headspace samples two sets of paired ambient air samples were collected before and after chamber sampling eight samples total to determine baseline gas concentrations i e the average ambient concentration was used to assign t0 and for calculation of the minimum detectable concentration difference mdcd which was used for data quality control as per yates et al 2006a concentrations of n2o co2 and ch4 were determined using gas chromatography bruker 450 gc bruker biosciences corporation usa farrell and elliott 2007 daily fluxes were estimated by fitting linear or exponential regression equations to the concentration vs time data using the hmr model pedersen et al 2010 a modified hutchinson mosier method hutchinson and mosier 1981 implemented as an add on package for r r development core team 2011 fluxes were taken as the slope of the fitted regression at t0 as recommended by hmr unless the concentration differences between t0 and each subsequent time step did not exceed the mdcd yates et al 2006a in cases where subsequent samples did not exceed the mdcd they were not considered significantly different and fluxes were taken as the slope of the linear regression at t0 this method allowed for the calculation and inclusion of statistically non significant fluxes i e below the mdcd common to ch4 fluxes in the dataset to minimize left censoring ens 2012 daily fluxes are reported as the median daily flux of the 20 sampling points cumulative fluxes were calculated using an area under the curve auc analysis of the gas production vs time curves engel et al 2010 to facilitate a comparison between measured emissions and current emission estimates used in the canadian national inventory report cnir n2o emission factors ef and annual emission estimates were calculated using the tier 2 country specific approach described by rochette et al 2008 1 e f eco 0 022 p p e 0 0048 where efeco is the ecodistrict level emission factor and p pe is the ratio of precipitation or precipitation irrigation to potential evapotranspiration during the growing season the methodology assumes that irrigation is applied at rates such that precipitation irrigation water equals potential evapotranspiration i e p pe 1 and using this approach all irrigated regions in canada are assigned a default efeco of 0 017 the methodology further assumes that irrigated land is fertilized at the same rate as the non irrigated land neither assumption is valid for our study consequently site specific efs were calculated for the ir12 efir12 and ir13 efir13 sites using the measured values for precipitation irrigation water applied and pe calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 cumulative emission estimates were then made using the site specific emission factors and actual fertilizer n application rates 2 3 soil measurements in situ soil sensors were used to monitor soil conditions at the dl may 5 2012 to may 9 2014 ir12 may 5 2012 to may 17 2013 and ir13 oct 19 2012 to may 9 2014 sites sensors were connected to campbell scientific dataloggers cr3000 campbell scientific canada programmed to collate and store sensor output data at a 30 min interval in each field cs650 water content reflectometer probes campbell scientific canada were installed at a 10 cm depth at four locations 15 45 80 and 110 m along the gas sampling transects supplemental fig s1 the cs650 sensors were used to measure volumetric soil water content vswc and soil temperature data presented are the averages of the four sampling points ion exchange resin membranes prs probes western ag saskatoon canada were deployed at the dl and ir12 sites over four three week intervals during the latter half of the 2012 growing season to explore system nutrient cycling and provide complementary information for this study 2 4 ancillary data at each site precipitation measurements were made using a tipping bucket rain gauge tr 525 texas electronics inc usa connected to the cr3000 datalogger two gauges were installed in each field at 20 and 85 m along the sampling transect with the average of the two gauges taken as the daily precipitation value during the winter of 2012 a weighing precipitation gauge belfort 3000 belfort instrument baltimore md fitted with an alter shield to enhance catch efficiency during windy conditions was installed at the dl site to more accurately measure precipitation snow and rainfall irrigation quantities were determined by subtracting precipitation measured at the rainfed site dl from the total precipitation i e rainfall irrigation measured at the irrigated site snow surveys were conducted during the late winter period mid january until snowmelt measuring the density and depth of accumulated snowpack to determine available melt water nitrogen fertilizer rate and source and details pertaining to chemical applications were provided by the cooperator crop yields were determined using an electronic crop yield monitor on the combine thresher and verified by the total grain yield harvested and sold by the cooperator crop nutrient and water management information for the 2012 and 2013 production years is summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 5 statistical analysis a preliminary data analysis revealed that daily soil ghg fluxes especially n2o fluxes were characterized by highly skewed distributions therefore the median x and interquartile range iqr the difference between the first and third quartiles presented as q1 and q 3 respectively were used as the summary statistics to describe the daily flux data corre et al 1996 pennock and corre 2001 in addition within site variability was graphically illustrated using boxplots where the lower and upper ends of the box were set equal to q1 and q 3 respectively the band inside the box was set to the median value and the ends of the whiskers were set equal to x 1 5 iqr cumulative flux data growing season and production year followed normal distributions and were described using the mean μ and standard deviation sd extreme outliers values greater than x 3 iqr were excluded from cumulative flux calculations and the data analyzed using a one way anova nitrous oxide and ch4 fluxes for the 2013 snow melt period followed a non normal distribution thus comparisons of these early spring emissions were made using the kruskall wallis test and a pairwise wilcoxon test with bonferroni adjusted p values the correlations between daily soil ghg fluxes soil temperature and soil volumetric water content were assessed using spearman rank correlation analysis and a significance level of 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out in the r environment r development core team 2011 3 results 3 1 climate and soil conditions precipitation during the period from may through august 2012 was greater than the 20 year average i e 309 mm vs 202 mm with the majority received during may 100 mm and june 110 mm during the same period in 2013 cumulative rainfall totaled only 176 mm which was about 13 lower than the 20 year average consequently irrigation was applied more frequently and provided a much greater proportion of the total water received on site 42 vs 14 in 2013 tables 3 and 4 the accumulation of winter precipitation as snowpack and its subsequent melting in early spring provided early season soil moisture snowpack at the field sites was much lower in the winter of 2011 12 totaling 13 27 mm snow water equivalent swe than the winter of 2012 13 81 104 mm swe it was assumed given the close proximity of the three field sites that winter precipitation i e snowfall was uniform over the study area however the resulting snowpack in each of the fields varied considerably as a result of wind redistribution of snow tables 3 and 4 generally in an open prairie setting such as ours the net accumulation of blowing snow depends on i the height of the standing stubble which acts to trap and hold snow in place and ii surface conditions stubble height and aerodynamic roughness in the upwind fields pomeroy and gray 1995 in this study considering that local stubble characteristics were similar between the irrigated and dryland fields the observed differences in snow accumulation can be attributed to differences in the ability of the upwind fields to retain snow high soil moisture near saturated conditions were observed prior to seeding at all sites and in both study years however system specific differences were noted in the limited post thaw period dataset spring 2013 the greater snowpack and higher antecedent fall 2012 soil moisture status at ir12 was reflected in the high soil water content measured during early spring average vswc may 1 to 10 ir12 39 vs dl 33 in fact very wet conditions at ir12 standing water for the week following thaw 23 apr 2013 through 30 apr 2013 made site access difficult likewise the ir13 site had standing water for three days following thaw up to 26 apr 2013 whereas standing water was not present at the dl site at the dryland site in both 2012 and 2013 soil moisture remained high 30 vswc in the month following seeding fig 2 b decreased steadily until mid to late summer and then remained at between 15 and 20 vswc until after the fall harvest conversely at the irrigated sites ir12 and ir13 high soil moisture levels 30 vswc were maintained throughout the peak growing season june and july as a result of the periodic application of irrigation water fig 3 b seasonal trends in soil temperature in the irrigated and dryland cropping systems exhibited only minor differences due to study logistics early season i e thaw to seeding soil temperatures were measured in 2013 only dl site presented in fig 2a ir12 site presented in fig 3a soil temperature increased rapidly following the spring thaw reached sustained daily maxima greater than 15 c within 30 days and maintained warm temperatures with daily maxima 20 c throughout the late summer after which temperatures decreased steadily until freeze up in general mid summer soil temperatures were between 15 and 20 c though notable year to year differences were observed in 2012 snowmelt and soil thaw occurred at the beginning of april while a late april thaw occurred in 2013 applications of fertilizer n differed between years and cropping systems in the 2012 season the wheat crop received 73 kg n ha 1 at the dl site and 110 kg n ha 1 at the ir12 site table 3 in 2013 the n rates for canola were 90 and 146 kg n ha 1 for the dl and ir13 sites respectively table 4 wet conditions early in the 2012 growing season resulted in some disease issues particularly with fusarium head blight which resulted in relatively low wheat yields i e 2 5 and 3 4 mg ha 1 at the dl and ir12 sites respectively not surprisingly therefore post harvest soil sampling revealed that there was more available soil n no3 nh4 remaining in surface 0 15 cm soils at the ir12 site 55 12 kg n ha 1 than at the dl site 22 6 kg n ha 1 conversely canola yields during the 2013 cropping season 2 4 and 3 6 mg ha 1 at the dl and ir13 sites respectively exceeded the 10 year average by 35 40 which likely depleted the plant available n in the soils indeed the post harvest soil tests revealed that the amount of plant available n in surface 0 15 cm soils at the ir13 site 20 3 kg n ha 1 was much lower than that remaining after the 2012 harvest and was comparable to that in soils at the dl site 23 1 kg n ha 1 3 2 nitrous oxide emissions daily n2o emissions demonstrated strong seasonal trends in both the irrigated and dryland cropping systems with the largest emissions occurring during spring thaw and early in the growing season in 2012 daily n2o emissions at both sites were greatest during the period immediately after the completion of seeding operations which included the application of seed placed n fertilizer see figs 2c and 3c at the irrigated site ir12 the largest daily flux x 28 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 12 77 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred two weeks after seeding on june 1st at the dryland site dl the largest daily flux x 5 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 3 7 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 also occurred approximately two weeks after seeding may 30th but with a magnitude that was about one fifth that at the irrigated site as well there was a large n2o emission x 3 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 2 6 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 at the dl site on july 16th following a significant precipitation event during which the field received 28 mm of rain fig 2b and c and the denitrification potential was high conversely in 2012 daily fluxes at both sites were smallest during the latter part of the season small negative fluxes i e an influx of n2o to the soil also were observed on several days though these were always associated with low flux days i e days with a median flux between 0 and 1 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 figs 2c and 3c although the 2012 sampling season did not include a full production year cumulative growing season emissions were calculated to facilitate a comparison between dryland and irrigated wheat production table 6 mean cumulative growing season emissions in 2012 were greater p 0 001 for the irrigated cropping system 540 g n2o n ha 1 than the dryland cropping system 140 g n2o n ha 1 emission factors calculated by modifying the cnir methodology rochette et al 2008 to include site specific data for the dl and ir12 sites for the 2012 cropping season were 0 0054 and 0 0077 respectively using these estimates to calculate annual cumulative n2o losses yielded values of 400 and 840 g n2o n ha 1 for the dl and ir12 sites respectively by way of comparison the cumulative n2o loss from the irrigated site calculated using the default efeco for irrigated regions 0 017 rochette et al 2008 was 1870 g n2o n ha 1 table 6 the 2013 sampling season included measurements for the full crop production year i e from the fall 2012 fertilizer application till just prior to the fall 2013 fertilizer application and in 2013 n2o emissions were greatest immediately following the onset of snowmelt and soil thaw figs 2c and 3c this was most notable in the irrigated cropping system ir13 where the largest daily flux measured during the study x 36 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 14 to 59 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred on april 28th fig 3c as was the case in 2012 the smallest daily fluxes at ir13 x 0 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred late in the season i e 19 oct 2012 10 sep 2013 and 04 oct 2013 at the dl site the largest daily flux x 19 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 8 to 31 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred on may 13th towards the end of the spring thaw period fig 2c low flux days at the dl site x 2 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 were quite common during the late summer and continued to soil freeze up nov 16th variability in the daily n2o flux at the dl site was generally high during the two week period following seeding and spring fertilizer application i e may 17th to 31st for the 2013 production year cumulative emissions from the irrigated canola were 34 greater p 0 025 than those from the dryland canola table 7 likewise cumulative emissions during the spring thaw period i e 25 d april 23rd to may 17th at the irrigated site ir13 were more than double those at the dryland site table 8 and accounted for 38 of the total production year emissions as compared to only 24 at the dryland sites emissions during the 2013 spring thaw also were measured at the ir12 site see supplemental fig s2 and were also substantially greater p 0 001 than those at the dl site table 8 unlike the early season i e spring thaw emissions however cumulative growing season emissions in 2013 141 days may 17th to oct 4th did not differ p 0 95 between the irrigated and dryland canola production systems table 7 emission estimates for the 2013 growing season also were calculated using the site specific data yielding efs for the dl and ir13 sites of 0 0012 and 0 0055 respectively utilizing these factors resulted in cumulative n2o loss estimates of 110 and 800 g n2o n ha 1 for the dl and ir13 sites respectively the emission estimate obtained using the default efeco for irrigated production was 2480 g n2o n ha 1 a further analysis of the data identified strong positive correlations between daily n2o flux and vswc during the growing season i e seeding to post harvest for the dryland site in both years 2012 rs 0 76 p 0 001 2013 rs 0 95 p 0 001 and the irrigated site in 2012 ir12 rs 0 89 p 0 001 at the irrigated site in 2013 however there was only a weak positive correlation between daily n2o flux and vswc ir13 rs 0 44 p 0 049 3 3 carbon dioxide soil derived co2 emissions reflect both root and microbial respiration curtin et al 2000 ellert and janzen 2008 liebig et al 2010 rochette et al 1999 and in general followed a clear seasonal trend figs 2d and 3d that paralleled crop growth that is emissions were lowest prior to seeding increased to maxima during june and july and then decreased steadily through to the onset of soil freeze up in 2012 the magnitude of the co2 fluxes measured at the irrigated ir12 and dryland dl sites were comparable with peak emissions x 40 to 50 kg co2 c ha 1 d 1 occurring during june and july figs 2d and 3d likewise cumulative growing season emissions 115 days 30 may 2012 to 21 september 2012 from the dl site were comparable p 0 56 to those from the ir12 site table 6 during the 2013 production year 351 days 19 oct 2012 to 04 oct 2013 daily co2 emissions were generally greater from the dl site than from the ir13 site figs 2d and 3d likewise cumulative growing season and production year emissions from the dl site were greater p 0 001 than those from the ir13 site table 8 growing season emissions 141 days may 17th to oct 4th from the dl site also were greater p 0 001 under canola in 2013 table 8 than under wheat in 2012 table 6 conversely growing season emissions from the irrigated canola site ir13 were lower p 0 001 than those from the irrigated

dryland dl and irrigated soils ir12 and ir13 were sinks for atmospheric ch4 figs 2e and 3e respectively however ch4 uptake measured at the dryland site was greater than that at the irrigated site in both years particularly during the period from august through october aside from the spring period april and may ch4 uptake from the dryland system exceeded 5 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 for the majority of both cropping seasons with periods in july and august during which uptake exceeded 10 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 in contrast daily ch4 emissions at the irrigated sites typically ranged from 0 to 2 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 throughout the entire season occasionally an efflux of ch4 i e flux 0 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 was measured from individual chambers along the sampling transects however only once 30 may 2012 at the dl site

rs 0 85 ir12 rs 0 60 2013 dl rs 0 92 ir13 rs 0 71 4 discussion seasonal trends in soil temperature in the irrigated and dryland cropping systems exhibited very little difference and the differences that were observed occurred on shorter time scales i e weeks to months and varied from year to year considering that the thermal properties of soil are largely dependent on soil water content i e wetter soil requires more energy to warm than dry soil it is not surprising that soil temperatures were slightly higher e g the mean annual soil temperature at 10 cm was 12 9 c at the dl site vs 12 4 c at the ir12 site and more variable under dryland conditions in both years irrigation events maintained soil moisture levels above 30 vswc until 2 3 weeks prior to swathing to allow the crop to dry and mature for harvest although these high soil moisture conditions can increase the potential for ghg production by increasing microbial respiration denitrification and methanogenesis trost et al 2013 our results suggest that in terms of net ghg emissions the implications were not as severe as expected nitrous oxide is perhaps the most important ghg associated with cropping systems as small quantities can elicit large effects in terms of radiative forcing as has been observed in numerous other studies in the northern great plains under both dryland dusenbury et al 2008 lemke et al 1998 liebig et al 2010 nyborg et al 1997 and irrigated cropping conditions mosier et al 2006 sainju et al 2012 n2o emissions were greatest during snow melt and spring thaw presumably this reflects the fact that fall fertilizer applications in the irrigated and dryland systems made large amounts of soil n potentially available for transformation and loss under the high soil moisture conditions that prevailed during spring thaw hao et al 2001 the fall 2012 spring 2013 comparison of the three study sites dl ir12 and ir13 highlights the range in magnitude of n2o emissions i e spatial variability that can occur under relatively similar site conditions within the same study year the much higher emissions observed at the ir12 site were likely a result of the saturated soil conditions i e high antecedent soil moisture from fall irrigation and spring melt water from the winter snowpack and high soil n levels although the rate of fall applied n fertilizer at the ir12 site 78 kg n ha 1 was the same as or lower than that at the dl and ir13 sites 78 and 140 kg n ha 1 respectively residual soil n levels were substantial 48 kg n ha 1 vs 22 and 55 kg n ha 1 at the dl and ir13 sites respectively resulting in high soil n levels at the ir12 site during spring 2013 in addition crop residue inputs also may have played a role in the elevated emissions measured at ir12 that is crop residues at the ir12 site were incorporated into the soil in the fall but were left on the surface at the dl site this plus the fact that the irrigated wheat yielded about 25 more residue than the dryland wheat would have increased the amount of residue n ca 40 kg n ha 1 added to the soil n pool indeed gregorich et al 2005 found that incorporation of stubble residues in the fall can lead to higher n2o emissions than if the residues are left on soil surface they attributed this to the generation of c and n inputs that could promote and sustain microbial n transformations and could also promote the formation of anoxic microsites in contrast the crop residue at ir13 was from dry bean which yields much less biomass than the wheat and was not incorporated thus the high n2o loss occurring at the ir12 site during the spring period of 2013 table 8 was most likely the result of a confluence of several factors high soil water content and elevated soil nitrogen and carbon levels in turn these factors were strongly influenced by farming practices fall application of irrigation water and n fertilizer and the incorporation of crop residues that were integral to the management system employed at this site after the period of peak n2o emissions during the spring thaw small increases in flux variability and median daily flux were observed at elevated soil moisture levels resulting from rainfall and irrigation events a trend commonly observed at other studies dobbie et al 1999 jabro et al 2008 liu et al 2006 mosier et al 2005 in both cropping systems the daily flux decreased steadily through june and remained low from july onward despite periods of high soil temperature and moisture at the irrigated sites the low magnitude of these late season emissions suggests that n2o production was limited more by n availability than by moisture constraints likewise the low emissions observed at the dl site during the early part of the growing season in 2012 are also likely a result of limited n availability this is supported by data from ion exchange resin membranes prs probes installed at the dl site during the 2012 growing season which indicated that available n supply rates were quite low 111 16 μg n 10 cm2 6 wk 1 compared to those at the ir12 site 371 55 μg n 10 cm2 6 wk 1 conversely the greater n availability at the ir12 site combined with high soil moisture conditions resulted in significantly greater early season emissions fig 3 than were observed at the dl site fig 2 the cnir methodology for estimating annual n2o emissions assumes that a moisture deficit is the predominant factor limiting soil n2o production and emission rochette et al 2008 this in turn suggests that high rates of n2o production would be observed if the moisture limitation was removed results from the present study indicate that when soil moisture limitations were reduced under irrigated conditions n availability appeared to limit cumulative n2o emissions although small peaks in n2o emissions were observed following irrigation events in both study years periods of high soil moisture during the summer months did not elicit a large n2o emission as would be expected if mineral n availability were non limiting considering a calculated soil porosity of 56 the optimal moisture levels for n2o production is expected to occur at around 39 vswc or 70 water filled pore space linn and doran 1984 soil moisture levels up to and exceeding 40 vswc were observed during multiple periods in both study years figs 2b and 3b without large n2o fluxes i e 5 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 again this adds support to our hypothesis that mineral n availability is likely limiting n2o production in the irrigated cropping systems results of the correlation analysis also support these observations the strong correlation between daily n2o fluxes and soil vswc content observed in the dryland system coupled with the greater quantities of available soil n after harvest in 2013 at least suggests that soil n2o production in this system was limited by low soil moisture low potential for denitrification activity in contrast a much weaker correlation was observed in the irrigated cropping system as high vswc conditions from july onward did not stimulate elevated n2o emissions this was likely due to a reduction in soil n availability later in the growing season resulting from crop uptake the proportion of fertilizer n lost as n2o was lower 0 5 vs 0 8 of applied n on the irrigated canola compared to the dryland canola in 2013 the cnir methodology provides an estimate of annual n2o emissions using local climate data i e potential evapotranspiration and precipitation for irrigated cropping conditions this methodology assumes that irrigation removes the moisture limitation i e precipitation irrigation water potential evapotranspiration or p pe 1 resulting in an ef of 0 017 g n2o n g 1 fertilizer n however this is not commonly the case for irrigated cropping systems in the prairies where the combination of irrigation and precipitation rarely match potential evapotranspiration thus the site specific emission estimates calculated for both cropping systems i e using the measured climate variables provided a more reasonable comparison regardless the default cnir emission estimates for the 2012 growing season were much greater than measured emissions i e 3 0 to 3 5 times greater considering the magnitude of spring emissions typical to the region the measured and estimated emissions would likely have been more comparable had the spring 2012 emissions been captured spring emissions were captured during the 2013 production cycle and cumulative annual emissions were greater than the modified cnir estimates using site specific climate data for both sites dl 8 times ir13 1 4 times in contrast the default ef for irrigated cropping systems overestimated emissions by more than 2 fold considering that environmental conditions during the 2013 cropping season were typical of the 20 year normal for the region the current inventory methodology likely underestimates n2o emissions for dryland cropping systems and overestimates n2o emissions for irrigated cropping systems in this region the seasonal trends observed in co2 emissions generally followed crop growth trends with the greatest co2 emissions observed during late june when crop growth was at its maximum carbon dioxide fluxes measured by plant excluded chambers capture the combination of soil microbial respiration and root respiration products and although relative contributions are difficult to separate estimates suggest that up to 50 of soil co2 emissions can be attributed to plant root respiration rochette et al 1999 curtin et al 2000 in addition elevated soil moisture levels appear to stimulate co2 emissions ellert and janzen 2008 jabro et al 2008 sainju et al 2012 trost et al 2013 indeed in a single year irrigated vs dryland comparison in north dakota jabro et al 2008 reported that overall co2 emissions were greater from irrigated treatments due to the elevated soil water content brought about by irrigation activities likewise lee et al 2009 reported that large co2 effluxes generally coincide with periods of soil rewetting and crop growth reflecting a concomitant increase in both autotrophic root and heterotrophic microbial respiration whereas daily variations in co2 efflux tend to mirror short term variations in soil moisture and temperature seasonal inter annual variations reflect the combined influence of climate and cropping system including water and nutrient management over the longer term in the present study we found that cumulative co2 emissions in the irrigated and dryland sites did not differ during the 2012 growing season table 6 whereas cumulative emissions from the irrigated site were lower than those from the dryland site during the 2013 growing season table 7 similar results were observed when considering the full production year in 2013 even though the irrigated site ir13 had consistently greater soil water content these inter annual differences are at least in part a result of differences in the crop sequences i e in the irrigated cropping system canola was preceded by dry bean phaseolus vulgarus whereas in the dryland system canola was preceded by wheat see table 2 which would affect both the quantity and quality of the residue remaining in the field gan et al 2009 in 2012 the wheat crop at both the dl and ir12 sites was seeded into canola stubble and estimates 1 1 estimates based on harvest indices and root shoot ratios obtained from gan et al 2009 together with the measured seed yields of the above and below ground residue inputs at the two sites were 10 77 and 8 58 mg ha 1 respectively suggesting a greater potential for heterotrophic respiration at the dl site at the same time root biomass estimates for the dryland and irrigated wheat were 0 92 and 1 17 mg ha 1 respectively suggesting a greater potential for autotrophic respiration at the ir12 site seasonal emission patterns at the two sites were quite similar with irrigation events having no discernable effect on daily emissions at the ir12 site reflecting the fact that both sites received adequate precipitation during the growing season thus while the relative contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration in the dryland and irrigated cropping systems may have differed the net result was total growing season co2 emissions that did not differ between the two sites in 2013 canola at the dl site was seeded into wheat stubble total residue input ca 6 72 mg ha 1 while at the irrigated ir13 site it was seeded into dry bean stubble total residue input ca 3 01 mg ha 1 dry bean residue decomposes more quickly than wheat residue van donk et al 2008 thus it was not surprising that early season pre seeding co2 emissions from the ir13 site were greater than those from the dryland site despite the differences in residue inputs however growing season emissions from the dl site were much greater than those from the ir13 site root biomass estimates for the 2013 canola crop ranged from 1 82 mg ha 1 at the dl site to 2 05 mg ha 1 at the ir13 site suggesting that differences in autotrophic respiration at the two sites may have been relatively minor and that the much greater cumulative co2 emissions at the dl site were likely related to heterotrophic respiration the capacity for atmospheric ch4 uptake oxidation by soils at the study sites was greatly diminished by irrigation see tables 6 and 7 likely due to a decrease in the diffusion of atmospheric ch4 into the soil coupled with a decrease in methanotrophic activity under elevated soil moisture conditions indeed we observed that in both cropping systems and during both years of the study ch4 uptake was greater during periods of low soil moisture this was supported by a strong negative correlation between ch4 uptake and vswc and is consistent with previous work mosier et al 2006 sainju et al 2012 moreover both the dryland and irrigated soils were net sinks for ch4 which is consistent with the results of ellert and janzen 2008 and sainju et al 2012 for irrigated soils in the semi arid northern great plains that is the soils under irrigated production remained a sink for atmospheric ch4 even though their sink capacity was somewhat lower than that of their dryland counterparts 5 conclusions compared to dryland cropping systems irrigated crop management results in changes to seasonal soil conditions in addition to supplemental water application producers enhance soil fertility with greater rates of fertilizer especially n grow a slightly different suite of crops which includes crops that may not be suitable for rainfed cropping conditions e g potato dry bean and other pulse crops and often adopt a more aggressive tillage regime i e tillage before fall n applications inter row tillage for weed control etc in the present study the most notable changes in soil conditions brought about by irrigation were the elevated soil n levels and soil water content elevated soil moisture had an effect on the flux dynamics of all three agricultural greenhouse gases leading to lower ch4 uptake and periodic increases in co2 and n2o emissions the greater fertilizer rates common to irrigated crop management create potential for high n2o emissions however this potential is often realized in short lived episodic bursts of n2o emission without substantially increasing cumulative n2o emissions from irrigated cropping systems as was observed in the 2013 season aside from the periods immediately following soil thaw and seeding daily n2o emissions were not drastically different between the dryland and irrigated sites despite much greater n fertilization under irrigated management due to removal of the soil moisture limitation n2o emissions dynamics in irrigated cropping systems appear to be limited by n availability rather than soil moisture status underscoring the importance of effective fertility management in irrigated cropping systems our results indicate that the methodology currently used for canadian national inventory overestimates n2o emissions from irrigated cropping systems in the semi arid prairie region moreover our results underscore the importance of taking a systems approach rather than a single

11360,greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural soils in the canadian prairie region are generally low and due to dry well aerated soil conditions can be quite variable compared to dryland rainfed crop production irrigated cropping has potential to contribute greater quantities of soil derived nitrous oxide n2o carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 to the atmosphere as producers target higher yields by minimizing soil moisture limitations and applying greater amounts of nitrogen fertilizers however the actual ghg dynamics from irrigated soils in this region are not well understood as there have been few field based studies in the semi arid prairies of western canada the goal of this study was to identify how emissions of soil derived n2o co2 and ch4 are influenced by changes in soil temperature water status and nitrogen rates brought about by irrigated crop management this was achieved through continuous in situ monitoring of soil conditions and chamber based measurements of soil ghg flux the most notable change in soil conditions brought about by irrigation was elevated moisture levels which appeared to influence the flux dynamics of all three agricultural greenhouse gases specifically a reduction in ch4 uptake and periodic increases in co2 and n2o emissions despite the reduced soil moisture limitation annual n2o emissions from the irrigated cropping system were much lower than those calculated using the current canadian national ghg inventory reporting this suggests that annual emissions are limited more by n availability rather than moisture deficits as the current method for emissions accounting assumes consequently our results indicate that emissions from irrigated cropping systems in the semi arid canadian prairies are overestimated by the current inventory approach moreover because irrigated crop production involves more than just the application of water our results demonstrate that a more systems oriented approach to ghg accounting is required to capture the combined effects of water soil crop management on ghg emissions from irrigated cropping systems keywords irrigated cropping dryland cropping nitrous oxide carbon dioxide methane 1 introduction the production of greenhouse gases ghg in soils is largely the result of microbial processes thus a change in crop management that promotes microbial activity can result in elevated levels of ghg emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 irrigated crop management involves water applications to supplement natural precipitation and the application of nutrients especially n at rates greater than those applied in comparable dryland cropping systems thus by altering soil temperature moisture and fertility regimes irrigated crop management creates the potential for greater emissions of soil derived ghgs i e n2o co2 and ch4 trost et al 2013 under dryland conditions in the northern great plains n2o emissions from agricultural cropping typically follows a pattern that is characterized by persistent low magnitude baseline emissions punctuated by episodic high emission events brumme et al 1999 yates et al 2006a 2006b similar results have been reported for other semi arid regions including australia barton et al 2008 and china liu et al 2011 the greatest n2o efflux is usually observed in the spring during snowmelt and corresponding thawing of the soil hao et al 2001 lemke et al 1998 liebig et al 2010 mosier et al 2006 nyborg et al 1997 rochette et al 2008 indeed up to 60 of the total estimated growing season n2o losses may occur during spring thaw events lemke et al 1998 large emissions also are associated with the first precipitation irrigation event s following spring fertilization dusenbury et al 2008 guenzi et al 1994 halvorson and del grosso 2012 liebig et al 2005 the magnitude of precipitation induced emission peaks are largest early in the growing season and diminish throughout the year dobbie et al 1999 jabro et al 2008 sainju et al 2012 giving way to a low level background emissions pattern as crop growth depletes the pool of available n hao et al 2001 indeed the low n2o emissions occurring during the fall season are likely a result of minimal soil n availability low soil temperature and low moisture content dusenbury et al 2008 liebig et al 2005 sainju et al 2012 irrigated crop management increases the potential for n2o emissions through the combination of elevated seasonal soil moisture and high fertilizer n rates contributing to high soil n availability bouwman 1996 ellert and janzen 2008 the methodology used to estimate fertilizer induced n2o emissions fie for the canadian national inventory report cnir considers regional climatic moisture trends using precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pe data to estimate emission factors rochette et al 2008 the method assumes that emissions are limited primarily by moisture deficit and that irrigation removes the stress associated with this deficit i e irrigation p pe therefore estimates of annual emissions from irrigated cropping systems are typically much greater than dryland cropping systems especially in the semi arid prairie region cropping systems exchange large quantities of carbon through photosynthesis and decomposition highly productive irrigated cropping systems fix large quantities of atmospheric co2 in plant biomass that when returned to the system as crop residues create potential for carbon sequestration through soil organic matter som accumulation flynn and smith 2010 follett 2001 smith et al 2008 however realizing this potential depends on the rate of microbial decomposition which as a result of elevated seasonal soil moisture levels may be greater in irrigated systems jabro et al 2008 trost et al 2013 as decomposition activity increases som is lost reducing the pool of stored soil carbon by releasing it to the atmosphere as co2 a saskatchewan study that investigated the effects of long term irrigated crop management on soil properties found that in spite of consistently high residue returns the total organic matter content of irrigated soils did not increase presumably due to rapid organic matter cycling bardak meyers 1996 soils in the semi arid prairies are natural sinks for atmospheric ch4 as a result of oxidation processes facilitated by methanotrophic microbes under aerobic soil conditions fowler et al 2009 liebig et al 2005 however natural rates of soil ch4 consumption are reduced by agricultural conversion of grasslands fowler et al 2009 robertson and grace 2004 as a result agricultural soils can vary from being small sinks to minor sources of atmospheric ch4 with greater uptake occurring under drier soil conditions liebig et al 2010 mosier et al 2006 irrigation is intended to reduce if not eliminate water related crop stress by increasing the plant available water content of the soil and the accompanying increase in seasonal soil moisture may diminish a soils natural capacity for ch4 uptake liu et al 2006 sainju et al 2012 a large irrigable land base substantial freshwater resources and ever increasing demands for food and fiber provide strong impetus for the expansion of irrigated crop production in the canadian prairies at the same time it is important that we improve our understanding of the consequences of converting dryland cropping systems to irrigated production in this region the factors driving ghg emissions from dryland cropping systems in the prairies are relatively well studied lemke et al 2009 however the question remains how are ghg dynamics altered by irrigated cropping conditions in this region to address this question the present study took a systems approach i e we compared irrigated and dryland rainfed production systems taking note of the fact that irrigated cropping systems are generally more intensively managed and that differences in ghg emissions between the two production systems will reflect differences in the combined effect of water nutrient and crop management the specific objectives of the study were to i measure and compare soil greenhouse gas emissions from irrigated and dryland cropping systems typical of prairie canada and ii determine how observed soil ghg fluxes correspond to soil conditions influenced by irrigated crop management i e annual fertilizer application rate and seasonal soil moisture and temperature trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area fig 1 is located in the lake diefenbaker development area saskatchewan s largest irrigated cropping region approximately 75 km south of the city of saskatoon the study was conducted on a field quarter section scale and included two adjacent quarter sections ir12 51 39 34 n 106 56 31 w and ir13 51 39 09 n

the same cooperator and had been in the same rotations for the past decade soils of the study area are broadly classified as orthic dark brown chernozems typic haplustoll in the u s system kastanozem

1998 soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in a 1 2 v v soil water suspension hendershot and lalande 2008 basic soil properties at the three field sites are summarized in table 1 the dl site was planted to a wheat canola cropping sequence while the ir12 and ir13 sites were managed under a wheat dry bean canola sequence with different phases of the rotation present in each year during the 2012 production year both the ir12 and dl sites were in the wheat triticum aestivum l phase while ir13 was in the dry bean phaseolus vulgarus phase table 2 dry bean is typically not grown under dryland conditions thus the ir13 site was not sampled in 2012 likewise during the 2013 production year site ir12 was in the dry bean phase and thus was not sampled during the growing season i e from seeding up to the time of fall fertilizer application however the site was sampled during the pre planting period from snowmelt to seeding in 2013 the ir13 and dl sites were sampled when the fields were cropped to the canola brassica napus phase of their respective sequences fertilizer applications occurred twice during the production year in late fall when the soil temperature was 5 c and at the time of seeding in spring anhydrous ammonia aa was applied in the fall and comprised the bulk of the fertilizer n applied for the 2012 table 3 and 2013 table 4 growing seasons granular fertilizers were applied at seeding to meet the remaining fertility requirements including n p k and s the fall fertilization event marked the beginning of the production year which concluded just prior to fall fertilizer application in the following calendar year all fertilizer applications were determined following a fall soil test and were based on recommended target yields for the irrigated and non irrigated crops irrigation crop development corp icdc 2012 in general soil disturbance during the wheat and canola phases of the crop sequences at both the dryland and irrigated sites was limited to that which occurred during the fall application of aa and during spring seeding operations however additional tillage operations both during the fall prior to the aa application and during the growing season see table 5 for details were involved in the dry bean phase of the irrigated sequence irrigation was applied using center pivot systems with low pressure 138 240 kpa rotating sprinklers r3000 nelson irrigation corporation mounted on drop tubes which placed the sprinklers approximately 1 4 m above the soil surface irrigation scheduling occurred at the discretion of the cooperator using the alberta irrigation management model aimm http agriculture alberta ca acis imcin aimm jsp which estimates irrigation requirements based on calculated crop evapotranspiration and modeled soil water status typical to center pivot irrigation management irrigation volumes generally less than 15 mm application depth per irrigation event were targeted to meet plant water requirements and rarely resulted in saturated soil conditions the sampling sites were instrumented and all measurements initiated as soon as possible after planting in the spring of 2012 monitoring concluded at the end of the 2013 production year due to the timing of project approval fall 2011 and the logistics for site preparation i e inability to install equipment into frozen soil fall 2011 and early spring 2012 ghg fluxes were not measured therefore the 2012 data do not represent a full production cycle the 2013 data however include a complete production year i e from fall fertilizer application in october 2012 through to the next fall fertilizer application in october 2013 greenhouse gas fluxes were measured for all three fields dl ir12 and ir13 from fall fertilizer application in 2012 to just prior to spring seeding in 2013 this time frame allowed for flux comparisons during the expected peak emission period following soil thaw soil conditions and ghg fluxes were not monitored during the winter months soil freeze up to thaw as losses from frozen soils during this period are considered to be minimal in this region malhi et al 2001 2 2 soil derived greenhouse gas measurements soil ghg emissions were measured using rectangular 22 0 cm 45 5 cm 15 0 cm w l h inside dimensions non steady state vented chambers constructed from clear 6 mm thick polymethyl methacrylate pmma chamber bases were installed into the soil to a depth of 5 cm and except during seeding and tillage operations remained in place for the entire year when installed the chambers had a headspace volume of 10 l and covered an area of 1000 cm2 twenty chambers were installed in each field at 6 25 m intervals along a 125 m linear transect supplemental fig s1 in an effort to avoid sampling the same seed rows and furrows along the sampling transect every second chamber was offset from the transect centerline by one meter plants were excluded from the chamber and the crop rows disturbed by chamber installation were replanted along the outside perimeter of the chamber base transects were oriented parallel to the direction of seeding to minimize disruption to normal cropping operations a major challenge associated with chamber based flux measurements is addressing the high spatial and temporal variation associated with soil ghg production to minimize sampling bias associated with diurnal variations in gas fluxes brought about by temperature fluctuations flux measurements were made during a four hour time window i e between 10 00 and 14 00 h on each sampling day sampling one transect took approximately 90 min and to avoid any temporal bias the first site sampled on a given day alternated between the dl and ir sites seasonality and day to day variations were addressed by increasing sampling frequency during periods when fluxes were expected to be greatest and most variable i e the highest sampling frequency 2 3 times per week occurred at the start of the season during spring thaw and following seeding operations sampling frequency then decreased from twice per week to once per week as the growing season progressed and emission intensity decreased and then to once every 2 3 weeks from harvest to soil freeze up in the fall in addition gas fluxes were measured 24 h after each irrigation event and after any significant 6 mm precipitation event during the sampling season in an effort to capture the extremely high spatial variability of gas fluxes especially n2o chambers were constructed with a large footprint 1000 cm2 and twenty points were sampled from each site to determine daily fluxes during each sampling event gas samples were drawn from chamber headspace through a rubber septum in the chamber lid using a 20 ml syringe fitted with a 25 gauge needle and immediately injected into pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vials labco limited uk for storage and transport samples were collected at 15 t15 30 t30 and 45 t45 minutes after lid closure in addition to headspace samples two sets of paired ambient air samples were collected before and after chamber sampling eight samples total to determine baseline gas concentrations i e the average ambient concentration was used to assign t0 and for calculation of the minimum detectable concentration difference mdcd which was used for data quality control as per yates et al 2006a concentrations of n2o co2 and ch4 were determined using gas chromatography bruker 450 gc bruker biosciences corporation usa farrell and elliott 2007 daily fluxes were estimated by fitting linear or exponential regression

core team 2011 fluxes were taken as the slope of the fitted regression at t0 as recommended by hmr unless the concentration differences between t0 and each subsequent time step did not exceed the mdcd yates et al 2006a in cases where subsequent samples did not exceed the mdcd they were not considered significantly different and fluxes were taken as the slope of the linear regression at t0 this method allowed for the calculation and inclusion of statistically non significant fluxes i e below the mdcd common to ch4 fluxes in the dataset to minimize left censoring ens 2012 daily fluxes are

precipitation or precipitation irrigation to potential evapotranspiration during the growing season the methodology assumes that irrigation is applied at rates such that precipitation irrigation water equals potential evapotranspiration i e p pe 1 and using this approach all irrigated regions in canada are assigned a default efeco of 0 017 the methodology further assumes that irrigated land is fertilized at the same rate as the non irrigated land neither assumption is valid for our study consequently site specific efs were calculated for the ir12 efir12 and ir13 efir13 sites using the measured values for precipitation irrigation water applied and pe calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 cumulative emission estimates were then made using the site specific emission factors and actual fertilizer n application rates 2 3 soil measurements in situ soil sensors were used to monitor soil conditions at the dl may 5 2012 to may 9 2014 ir12 may 5 2012

transects supplemental fig s1 the cs650 sensors were used to measure volumetric soil water content vswc and soil temperature data presented are the averages of the four sampling points ion exchange resin membranes prs probes western ag saskatoon canada were deployed at the dl and ir12 sites over four three week intervals during the latter half of the 2012 growing season to explore system nutrient cycling and provide complementary information for this study 2 4 ancillary data at each site precipitation measurements were made using a tipping bucket rain gauge tr 525 texas electronics inc usa connected to the cr3000 datalogger two gauges were installed in each field at 20 and 85 m along the sampling transect with the average of the two gauges taken as the daily precipitation value during the winter of 2012 a weighing precipitation gauge belfort 3000 belfort instrument baltimore md fitted with an alter shield to enhance catch efficiency during windy conditions was installed at the dl site to more accurately measure precipitation snow and rainfall irrigation quantities were determined by subtracting precipitation measured at the rainfed site dl from the total precipitation i

determine available melt water nitrogen fertilizer rate and source and details pertaining to chemical applications were provided by the cooperator crop yields were determined using an electronic crop yield monitor on the combine thresher and verified by the total grain yield harvested and sold by the cooperator crop nutrient and water management information for the 2012 and 2013 production years is summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 5 statistical analysis a preliminary data analysis revealed that daily soil ghg fluxes especially n2o fluxes were characterized by highly skewed distributions therefore the median x and interquartile range iqr the difference between the first and third quartiles presented as q1 and q 3 respectively were used as the summary statistics to describe the daily flux data corre et al 1996 pennock and corre 2001 in addition within site variability was graphically illustrated using boxplots where the lower and upper ends of the box were set equal to q1 and q 3 respectively the band inside the box was set to the median value and the ends of the whiskers were set equal to x 1 5 iqr cumulative flux data growing season and production year followed normal distributions and were described using the mean μ and standard deviation sd extreme outliers values greater than x 3 iqr were excluded from cumulative flux calculations and the data analyzed using a one way anova nitrous oxide and ch4 fluxes for the 2013 snow melt period followed a non normal distribution thus comparisons of these early spring emissions were made using the kruskall wallis test and a pairwise wilcoxon test with bonferroni adjusted p values the correlations between daily soil ghg fluxes soil temperature and soil volumetric water content were assessed using spearman rank correlation analysis and a significance level of 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out in the r environment r development core team 2011 3 results 3 1 climate and soil conditions precipitation during the period from may through august 2012 was greater than the 20 year average i e 309 mm vs 202 mm with the majority received during may 100 mm and june 110 mm during the same period in 2013 cumulative rainfall totaled only 176 mm which was about 13 lower than the 20 year average consequently irrigation was applied more frequently and provided a much greater proportion of the total water received on site 42 vs 14 in 2013 tables 3 and 4 the accumulation of winter precipitation as snowpack and its subsequent melting in early spring provided early season soil moisture snowpack at the field sites was much lower in the winter of 2011 12 totaling 13 27 mm snow water equivalent swe than the winter of 2012 13 81 104 mm swe it was assumed given the close proximity of the three field sites that winter precipitation i e snowfall was uniform over the study area however the resulting snowpack in each of the fields varied considerably as a result of wind redistribution of snow tables 3 and 4 generally in an open prairie setting such as ours the net accumulation of blowing snow depends on i the height of the standing stubble which acts to trap and hold snow in place and ii surface conditions stubble height and aerodynamic roughness in the upwind fields pomeroy and gray 1995 in this study considering that local stubble characteristics were similar between the irrigated and dryland fields the observed differences in snow accumulation can be attributed to differences in the ability of the upwind fields to retain snow high soil moisture near saturated conditions were observed prior to seeding at all sites and in both study years however system specific differences were noted in the limited post thaw period dataset spring 2013 the greater snowpack and higher antecedent fall 2012 soil moisture status at ir12 was reflected in the high soil water content measured during early spring average vswc may 1 to 10 ir12 39 vs dl 33 in fact very wet conditions at ir12 standing water for the week following thaw 23 apr 2013 through 30 apr 2013 made site access difficult likewise the ir13 site had standing water for three days following thaw up to 26 apr 2013 whereas standing water was not present at the dl site at the dryland site in both 2012 and 2013 soil moisture remained high 30 vswc in the month following seeding fig 2 b decreased steadily until mid to late summer and then remained at between 15 and 20 vswc until after the fall harvest conversely at the irrigated sites ir12 and ir13 high soil moisture levels 30 vswc were maintained throughout the peak growing season june and july as a result of the periodic application of irrigation water fig 3 b seasonal trends in soil temperature in the irrigated and dryland cropping systems exhibited only minor differences due to study logistics early season i e thaw to seeding soil temperatures were measured in 2013 only dl site presented in fig 2a ir12 site presented in fig 3a soil temperature increased rapidly following the spring thaw reached sustained daily maxima greater than 15 c within 30 days and maintained warm temperatures with daily maxima 20 c throughout the late summer after which temperatures decreased steadily until freeze up in general mid summer soil temperatures were between 15 and 20 c though notable year to year differences were observed in 2012 snowmelt and soil thaw occurred at the beginning of april while a late april thaw occurred in 2013 applications of fertilizer n differed between years and cropping systems in the 2012 season the wheat crop received 73 kg n ha 1 at the dl site and 110 kg n ha 1 at the ir12 site table 3 in 2013 the n rates for canola were 90 and 146 kg n ha 1 for the dl and ir13 sites respectively table 4 wet conditions early in the 2012 growing season resulted in some disease issues particularly with fusarium head blight which resulted in relatively low wheat yields i e 2 5 and 3 4 mg ha 1 at the dl and ir12 sites respectively not surprisingly therefore post harvest soil sampling revealed that there was more available soil n no3 nh4 remaining in surface 0 15 cm soils at the ir12 site 55 12 kg n ha 1 than at the dl site 22 6 kg n ha 1 conversely canola yields during the 2013 cropping season 2 4 and 3 6 mg ha 1 at the dl and ir13 sites respectively exceeded the 10 year average by 35 40 which likely depleted the plant available n in the soils indeed the post harvest soil tests revealed that the amount of plant available n in surface 0 15 cm soils at the ir13 site 20 3 kg n ha 1 was much lower than that remaining after the 2012 harvest and was comparable to that in soils at the dl site 23 1 kg n ha 1 3 2 nitrous oxide emissions daily n2o emissions demonstrated strong seasonal trends in both the irrigated and dryland cropping systems with the largest emissions occurring during spring thaw and early in the growing season in 2012 daily n2o emissions at both sites were greatest during the period immediately after the completion of seeding operations which included the application of seed placed n fertilizer see figs 2c and 3c at the irrigated site ir12 the largest daily flux x 28 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 12 77 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred two weeks after seeding on june 1st at the dryland site dl the largest daily flux x 5 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 3 7 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 also occurred approximately two weeks after seeding may 30th but with a magnitude that was about one fifth that at the irrigated site as well there was a large n2o emission x 3 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 2 6 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 at the dl site on july 16th following a significant precipitation event during which the field received 28 mm of rain fig 2b and c and the denitrification potential was high conversely in 2012 daily fluxes at both sites were smallest during the latter part of the season small negative fluxes i e an influx of n2o to the soil also were observed on several days though these were always associated with low flux days i e days with a median flux between 0 and 1 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 figs 2c and 3c although the 2012 sampling season did not include a full production year cumulative growing season emissions were calculated to facilitate a comparison between dryland and irrigated wheat production table 6 mean cumulative growing season emissions in 2012 were greater p 0 001 for the irrigated cropping system 540 g n2o n ha 1 than the dryland cropping system 140 g n2o n ha 1 emission factors calculated by modifying the cnir methodology rochette et al 2008 to include site specific data for the dl and ir12 sites for the 2012 cropping season were 0 0054 and 0 0077 respectively using these estimates to calculate annual cumulative n2o losses yielded values of 400 and 840 g n2o n ha 1 for the dl and ir12 sites respectively by way of comparison the cumulative n2o loss from the irrigated site calculated using the default efeco for irrigated regions 0 017 rochette et al 2008 was 1870 g n2o n ha 1 table 6 the 2013 sampling season included measurements for the full crop production year i e from the fall 2012 fertilizer application till just prior to the fall 2013 fertilizer application and in 2013 n2o emissions were greatest immediately following the onset of snowmelt and soil thaw figs 2c and 3c this was most notable in the irrigated cropping system ir13 where the largest daily flux measured during the study x 36 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 14 to 59 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred on april 28th fig 3c as was the case in 2012 the smallest daily fluxes at ir13 x 0 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred late in the season i e 19 oct 2012 10 sep 2013 and 04 oct 2013 at the dl site the largest daily flux x 19 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 iqr 8 to 31 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 occurred on may 13th towards the end of the spring thaw period fig 2c low flux days at the dl site x 2 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 were quite common during the late summer and continued to soil freeze up nov 16th variability in the daily n2o flux at the dl site was generally high during the two week period following seeding and spring fertilizer application i e may 17th to 31st for the 2013 production year cumulative emissions from the irrigated canola were 34 greater p 0 025 than those from the dryland canola table 7 likewise cumulative emissions during the spring thaw period i e 25 d april 23rd to may 17th at the irrigated site ir13 were more than double those at the dryland site table 8 and accounted for 38 of the total production year emissions as compared to only 24 at the dryland sites emissions during the 2013 spring thaw also were measured at the ir12 site see supplemental fig s2 and were also substantially greater p 0 001 than those at the dl site table 8 unlike the early season i e spring thaw emissions however cumulative growing season emissions in 2013 141 days may 17th to oct 4th did not differ p 0 95 between the irrigated and dryland canola production systems table 7 emission estimates for the 2013 growing season also were calculated using the site specific data yielding efs for the dl and ir13 sites of 0 0012 and 0 0055 respectively utilizing these factors resulted in cumulative n2o loss estimates of 110 and 800 g n2o n ha 1 for the dl and ir13 sites respectively the emission estimate obtained using the default efeco for irrigated production was 2480 g n2o n ha 1 a further analysis of the data identified strong positive correlations between daily n2o flux and vswc during the growing season i e seeding to post harvest for the dryland site in both years 2012 rs 0 76 p 0 001 2013 rs 0 95 p 0 001 and the irrigated site in 2012 ir12 rs 0 89 p 0 001 at the irrigated site in 2013 however there was only a weak positive correlation between daily n2o flux and vswc ir13 rs 0 44 p 0 049 3 3 carbon dioxide soil derived co2 emissions reflect both root and microbial respiration curtin et al 2000 ellert and janzen 2008 liebig et al 2010 rochette et al 1999 and in general followed a clear seasonal trend figs 2d and 3d that paralleled crop growth that is emissions were lowest prior to seeding increased to maxima during june and july and then decreased steadily through to the onset of soil freeze up in 2012 the magnitude of the co2 fluxes measured at the irrigated ir12 and dryland dl sites were comparable with peak emissions x 40 to 50 kg co2 c ha 1 d 1 occurring during june and july figs 2d and 3d likewise cumulative growing season emissions 115 days 30 may 2012 to 21 september 2012 from the dl site were comparable p 0 56 to those from the ir12 site table 6 during the 2013 production year 351 days 19 oct 2012 to 04 oct 2013 daily co2 emissions were generally greater from the dl site than from the ir13 site figs 2d and 3d likewise cumulative growing season and production year emissions from the dl site were greater p 0 001 than those from the ir13 site table 8 growing season emissions 141 days may 17th to oct 4th from the dl site also were greater p 0 001 under canola in 2013 table 8 than under wheat in 2012 table 6 conversely growing season emissions from the irrigated canola site ir13 were lower p 0 001 than those from the irrigated wheat site ir12 analysis of the data obtained during the growing season i e from seeding to post harvest revealed only a weak correlation between daily co2 flux and vswc for the dryland site in both years 2012 rs 0 42 p 0 058 2013 rs 0 33 p 0 084 and the irrigated site in 2012 ir12 rs 0 37 p 0 083 a similar correlation was observed between the daily co2 flux and the maximum daily soil temperature at the dryland and irrigated sites in 2012 dl rs 0 43 p 0 053 ir12 rs 0 47 p 0 022 carbon dioxide fluxes at the ir13 site were not correlated with any of the measured parameters 3 4 methane both the dryland dl and irrigated soils ir12 and ir13 were sinks for atmospheric ch4 figs 2e and 3e respectively however ch4 uptake measured at the dryland site was greater than that at the irrigated site in both years particularly during the period from august through october aside from the spring period april and may ch4 uptake from the dryland system exceeded 5 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 for the majority of both cropping seasons with periods in july and august during which uptake exceeded 10 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 in contrast daily ch4 emissions at the irrigated sites typically ranged from 0 to 2 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 throughout the entire season occasionally an efflux of ch4 i e flux 0 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 was measured from individual chambers along the sampling transects however only once 30 may 2012 at the dl site was there a positive median daily flux 5 g ch4 c ha 1 d 1 iqr 0 to 13 ch4 c ha 1 d 1 cumulative ch4 uptake during the growing season was greater p 0 001 from the dryland site in both years of the study tables 6 and 8 analysis of the ancillary data revealed that vswc was positively correlated p 0 002 with growing season seeding to post harvest ch4 fluxes at both sites and in both years 2012 dl rs 0 85 ir12 rs 0 60 2013 dl rs 0 92 ir13 rs 0 71 4 discussion seasonal trends in soil temperature in the irrigated and dryland cropping systems exhibited very little difference and the differences that were observed occurred on shorter time scales i e weeks to months and varied from year to year considering that the thermal properties of soil are largely dependent on soil water content i e wetter soil requires more energy to warm than dry soil it is not surprising that soil temperatures were slightly higher e g the mean annual soil temperature at 10 cm was 12 9 c at the dl site vs 12 4 c at the ir12 site and more variable under dryland conditions in both years irrigation events maintained soil moisture levels above 30 vswc until 2 3 weeks prior to swathing to allow the crop to dry and mature for harvest although these high soil moisture conditions can increase the potential for ghg production by increasing microbial respiration denitrification and methanogenesis trost et al 2013 our results suggest that in terms of net ghg emissions the implications were not as severe as expected nitrous oxide is perhaps the most important ghg associated with cropping systems as small quantities can elicit large effects in terms of radiative forcing as has been observed in numerous other studies in the northern great plains under both dryland dusenbury et al 2008 lemke et al 1998 liebig et al 2010 nyborg et al 1997 and irrigated cropping conditions mosier et al 2006 sainju et al 2012 n2o emissions were greatest during snow melt and spring thaw presumably this reflects the fact that fall fertilizer applications in the irrigated and dryland systems made large amounts of soil n potentially available for transformation and loss under the high soil moisture conditions that prevailed during spring thaw hao et al 2001 the fall 2012 spring 2013 comparison of the three study sites dl ir12 and ir13 highlights the range in magnitude of n2o emissions i e spatial variability that can occur under relatively similar site conditions within the same study year the much higher emissions observed at the ir12 site were likely a result of the saturated soil conditions i e high antecedent soil moisture from fall irrigation and spring melt water from the winter snowpack and high soil n levels although the rate of fall applied n fertilizer at the ir12 site 78 kg n ha 1 was the same as or lower than that at the dl and ir13 sites 78 and 140 kg n ha 1 respectively residual soil n levels were substantial 48 kg n ha 1 vs 22 and 55 kg n ha 1 at the dl and ir13 sites respectively resulting in high soil n levels at the ir12 site during spring 2013 in addition crop residue inputs also may have played a role in the elevated emissions measured at ir12 that is crop residues at the ir12 site were incorporated into the soil in the fall but were left on the surface at the dl site this plus the fact that the irrigated wheat yielded about 25 more residue than the dryland wheat would have increased the amount of residue n ca 40 kg n ha 1 added to the soil n pool indeed gregorich et al 2005 found that incorporation of stubble residues in the fall can lead to higher n2o emissions than if the residues are left on soil surface they attributed this to the generation of c and n inputs that could promote and sustain microbial n transformations and could also promote the formation of anoxic microsites in contrast the crop residue at ir13 was from dry bean which yields much less biomass than the wheat and was not incorporated thus the high n2o loss occurring at the ir12 site during the spring period of 2013 table 8 was most likely the result of a confluence of several factors high soil water content and elevated soil nitrogen and carbon levels in turn these factors were strongly influenced by farming practices fall application of irrigation water and n fertilizer and the incorporation of crop residues that were integral to the management system employed at this site after the period of peak n2o emissions during the spring thaw small increases in flux variability and median daily flux were observed at elevated soil moisture levels resulting from rainfall and irrigation events a trend commonly observed at other studies dobbie et al 1999 jabro et al 2008 liu et al 2006 mosier et al 2005 in both cropping systems the daily flux decreased steadily through june and remained low from july onward despite periods of high soil temperature and moisture at the irrigated sites the low magnitude of these late season emissions suggests that n2o production was limited more by n availability than by moisture constraints likewise the low emissions observed at the dl site during the early part of the growing season in 2012 are also likely a result of limited n availability this is supported by data from ion exchange resin membranes prs probes installed at the dl site during the 2012 growing season which indicated that available n supply rates were quite low 111 16 μg n 10 cm2 6 wk 1 compared to those at the ir12 site 371 55 μg n 10 cm2 6 wk 1 conversely the greater n availability at the ir12 site combined with high soil moisture conditions resulted in significantly greater early season emissions fig 3 than were observed at the dl site fig 2 the cnir methodology for estimating annual n2o emissions assumes that a moisture deficit is the predominant factor limiting soil n2o production and emission rochette et al 2008 this in turn suggests that high rates of n2o production would be observed if the moisture limitation was removed results from the present study indicate that when soil moisture limitations were reduced under irrigated conditions n availability appeared to limit cumulative n2o emissions although small peaks in n2o emissions were observed following irrigation events in both study years periods of high soil moisture during the summer months did not elicit a large n2o emission as would be expected if mineral n availability were non limiting considering a calculated soil porosity of 56 the optimal moisture levels for n2o production is expected to occur at around 39 vswc or 70 water filled pore space linn and doran 1984 soil moisture levels up to and exceeding 40 vswc were observed during multiple periods in both study years figs 2b and 3b without large n2o fluxes i e 5 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 again this adds support to our hypothesis that mineral n availability is likely limiting n2o production in the irrigated cropping systems results of the correlation analysis also support these observations the strong correlation between daily n2o fluxes and soil vswc content observed in the dryland system coupled with the greater quantities of available soil n after harvest in 2013 at least suggests that soil n2o production in this system was limited by low soil moisture low potential for denitrification activity in contrast a much weaker correlation was observed in the irrigated cropping system as high vswc conditions from july onward did not stimulate elevated n2o emissions this was likely due to a reduction in soil n availability later in the growing season resulting from crop uptake the proportion of fertilizer n lost as n2o was lower 0 5 vs 0 8 of applied n on the irrigated canola compared to the dryland canola in 2013 the cnir methodology provides an estimate of annual n2o emissions using local climate data i e potential evapotranspiration and precipitation for irrigated cropping conditions this methodology assumes that irrigation removes the moisture limitation i e precipitation irrigation water potential evapotranspiration or p pe 1 resulting in an ef of 0 017 g n2o n g 1 fertilizer n however this is not commonly the case for irrigated cropping systems in the prairies where the combination of irrigation and precipitation rarely match potential evapotranspiration thus the site specific emission estimates calculated for both cropping systems i e using the measured climate variables provided a more reasonable comparison regardless the default cnir emission estimates for the 2012 growing season were much greater than measured emissions i e 3 0 to 3 5 times greater considering the magnitude of spring emissions typical to the region the measured and estimated emissions would likely have been more comparable had the spring 2012 emissions been captured spring emissions were captured during the 2013 production cycle and cumulative annual emissions were greater than the modified cnir estimates using site specific climate data for both sites dl 8 times ir13 1 4 times in contrast the default ef for irrigated cropping systems overestimated emissions by more than 2 fold considering that environmental conditions during the 2013 cropping season were typical of the 20 year normal for the region the current inventory methodology likely underestimates n2o emissions for dryland cropping systems and overestimates n2o emissions for irrigated cropping systems in this region the seasonal trends observed in co2 emissions generally followed crop growth trends with the greatest co2 emissions observed during late june when crop growth was at its maximum carbon dioxide fluxes measured by plant excluded chambers capture the combination of soil microbial respiration and root respiration products and although relative contributions are difficult to separate estimates suggest that up to 50 of soil co2 emissions can be attributed to plant root respiration rochette et al 1999 curtin et al 2000 in addition elevated soil moisture levels appear to stimulate co2 emissions ellert and janzen 2008 jabro et al 2008 sainju et al 2012 trost et al 2013 indeed in a single year irrigated vs dryland comparison in north dakota jabro et al 2008 reported that overall co2 emissions were greater from irrigated treatments due to the elevated soil water content brought about by irrigation activities likewise lee et al 2009 reported that large co2 effluxes generally coincide with periods of soil rewetting and crop growth reflecting a concomitant increase in both autotrophic root and heterotrophic microbial respiration whereas daily variations in co2 efflux tend to mirror short term variations in soil moisture and temperature seasonal inter annual variations reflect the combined influence of climate and cropping system including water and nutrient management over the longer term in the present study we found that cumulative co2 emissions in the irrigated and dryland sites did not differ during the 2012 growing season table 6 whereas cumulative emissions from the irrigated site were lower than those from the dryland site during the 2013 growing season table 7 similar results were observed when considering the full production year in 2013 even though the irrigated site ir13 had consistently greater soil water content these inter annual differences are at least in part a result of differences in the crop sequences i e in the irrigated cropping system canola was preceded by dry bean phaseolus vulgarus whereas in the dryland system canola was preceded by wheat see table 2 which would affect both the quantity and quality of the residue remaining in the field gan et al 2009 in 2012 the wheat crop at both the dl and ir12 sites was seeded into canola stubble and estimates 1 1 estimates based on harvest indices and root shoot ratios obtained from gan et al 2009 together with the measured seed yields of the above and below ground residue inputs at the two sites were 10 77 and 8 58 mg ha 1 respectively suggesting a greater potential for heterotrophic respiration at the dl site at the same time root biomass estimates for the dryland and irrigated wheat were 0 92 and 1 17 mg ha 1 respectively suggesting a greater potential for autotrophic respiration at the ir12 site seasonal emission patterns at the two sites were quite similar with irrigation events having no discernable effect on daily emissions at the ir12 site reflecting the fact that both sites received adequate precipitation during the growing season thus while the relative contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration in the dryland and irrigated cropping systems may have differed the net result was total growing season co2 emissions that did not differ between the two sites in 2013 canola at the dl site was seeded into wheat stubble total residue input ca 6 72 mg ha 1 while at the irrigated ir13 site it was seeded into dry bean stubble total residue input ca 3 01 mg ha 1 dry bean residue decomposes more quickly than wheat residue van donk et al 2008 thus it was not surprising that early season pre seeding co2 emissions from the ir13 site were greater than those from the dryland site despite the differences in residue inputs however growing season emissions from the dl site were much greater than those from the ir13 site root biomass estimates for the 2013 canola crop ranged from 1 82 mg ha 1 at the dl site to 2 05 mg ha 1 at the ir13 site suggesting that differences in autotrophic respiration at the two sites may have been relatively minor and that the much greater cumulative co2 emissions at the dl site were likely related to heterotrophic respiration the capacity for atmospheric ch4 uptake oxidation by soils at the study sites was greatly diminished by irrigation see tables 6 and 7 likely due to a decrease in the diffusion of atmospheric ch4 into the soil coupled with a decrease in methanotrophic activity under elevated soil moisture conditions indeed we observed that in both cropping systems and during both years of the study ch4 uptake was greater during periods of low soil moisture this was supported by a strong negative correlation between ch4 uptake and vswc and is consistent with previous work mosier et al 2006 sainju et al 2012 moreover both the dryland and irrigated soils were net sinks for ch4 which is consistent with the results of ellert and janzen 2008 and sainju et al 2012 for irrigated soils in the semi arid northern great plains that is the soils under irrigated production remained a sink for atmospheric ch4 even though their sink capacity was somewhat lower than that of their dryland counterparts 5 conclusions compared to dryland cropping systems irrigated crop management results in changes to seasonal soil conditions in addition to supplemental water application producers enhance soil fertility with greater rates of fertilizer especially n grow a slightly different suite of crops which includes crops that may not be suitable for rainfed cropping conditions e g potato dry bean and other pulse crops and often adopt a more aggressive tillage regime i e tillage before fall n applications inter row tillage for weed control etc in the present study the most notable changes in soil conditions brought about by irrigation were the elevated soil n levels and soil water content elevated soil moisture had an effect on the flux dynamics of all three agricultural greenhouse gases leading to lower ch4 uptake and periodic increases in co2 and n2o emissions the greater fertilizer rates common to irrigated crop management create potential for high n2o emissions however this potential is often realized in short lived episodic bursts of n2o emission without substantially increasing cumulative n2o emissions from irrigated cropping systems as was observed in the 2013 season aside from the periods immediately following soil thaw and seeding daily n2o emissions were not drastically different between the dryland and irrigated sites despite much greater n fertilization under irrigated management due to removal of the soil moisture limitation n2o emissions dynamics in irrigated cropping systems appear to be limited by n availability rather than soil moisture status underscoring the importance of effective fertility management in irrigated cropping systems our results indicate that the methodology currently used for canadian national inventory overestimates n2o emissions from irrigated cropping systems in the semi arid prairie region moreover our results underscore the importance of taking a systems approach rather than a single

11361,the objective of the present study was to assess the impacts of climate change on irrigation cost in a groundwater dependent irrigated region in northwest bangladesh an ensemble of general circulation model gcms were used for the projection of climate an empirical hydrological model based on support vector machine svm was used to simulate groundwater level from climatic variables and a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to estimate the irrigation cost due to the changes in groundwater level the results revealed a declination of average groundwater level in the study area in the range of 0 45 01 19 m 0 55 1 79 m and 0 76 2 71 m under three representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and therefore an average increase in irrigation cost in the range of 1 61 to 9 82 usd hectare at 95 confidence level the maximum declination of groundwater level was projected in the northeast part of the study area in the range of 2 23 4 12 m by the gcm miroc esm chem which might cause an increase of irrigation cost in the range of 8 07 to 14 79 usd hector the study concludes that the impact of climate change induced fluctuations in groundwater level on crop production cost is much less compared to other costs but it may be significant in locations where groundwater level is declining fast keywords climate change groundwater level irrigation cost global circulation model bangladesh 1 introduction groundwater is one of the primary sources of irrigation and food production in many countries of the world shahid et al 2015 siebert et al 2010 treidel et al 2012 despite its huge significance groundwater resources are heading for a crisis in many regions mainly due to the huge exploitation of groundwater to extend irrigated agriculture to feed the growing population gandhi and bhamoriya 2011 pengra 2012 it is anticipated that climate change will pose another major threat to groundwater resources in the near future studies from different parts of the world show that increased temperature and changing rainfall patterns due to climate change will significantly affect groundwater recharge and accessibility davidson and yang 2007 ranjan et al 2006 shahid et al 2017 shahid and hazarika 2010 treidel et al 2012 the lowering of the groundwater table due to changes in precipitation patterns and rises in temperature may reduce well yield and increase pumping cost which may seriously affect the livelihood of farmers in the regions where groundwater is used as the major source of irrigation salem et al 2017b mitigation of climate change impacts on groundwater resources to limit irrigation cost and ensure farmers profits might be a major challenge in the near future particularly in agricultural based developing countries a number of studies have been conducted to assess climate change impacts on groundwater level davidson and yang 2007 ranjan et al 2006 treidel et al 2012 irrigation demand garrote et al 2015 shahid 2011 wang et al 2016 and irrigation cost mulangu and kraybill 2015 nelson et al 2010 however only a few studies have been conducted to assess the impact of declining groundwater level on irrigation cost kovacs and west 2016 medellín azuara et al 2015 narayanamoorthy 2015 nayak et al 2015 salem et al 2017a srivastava et al 2017 the majority of the studies was on economic assessment of declining groundwater level due to over exploitation narayanamoorthy 2015 a few of studies mentioned changes in irrigation cost due to global warming induced changes in groundwater level shahid 2011 indicated that declination of groundwater level due to climate change would increase irrigation cost in northwest bangladesh nayak et al 2015 assessed the impacts of different adaption measures to mitigate climate change impacts on irrigation cost however no study has been conducted to assess the possible changes in irrigation cost of groundwater dependent irrigated crop for different climate change scenarios as groundwater is the major source of irrigation in many developing countries understanding the impact of climate change on farmers profits in a groundwater dependent irrigated region is very impotent furthermore it is important for decision making towards adaptation and mitigation the gcm simulations of climate change fail to provide reliable information on spatial scales below about 200 km and therefore it is important to downscale coarse resolution gcm simulated climatic variables to local scales for impact assessment su et al 2016 climate downscaling methods can be broadly classified into two major groups namely i dynamical or physical downscaling where high resolution regional climate models rcms are employed gao et al 2016 laprise 2008 and ii statistical downscaling sd where statistical relationships between local climatic variables and gcm variables are used do hoai et al 2011 pour et al 2014 wilby et al 2004 compared to dynamical downscaling statistical downscaling methods are often preferred for their simplicity easiness flexibility quickness and ability to provide local scale information ahmed et al 2015 pour et al 2014 the statistical downscaling methods are subdivided into two large groups perfect prognosis pp and model output statistics mos maraun et al 2010 in pp a statistical relationship is established between observed climate variables predictand and observed large scale predictors while in mos the gcm simulated predictors instead of observed predictors are used to establish statistical relationship with observed predictands eden and widmann 2013 the mos models are able to explicitly account for gcm inherent error and bias eden and widmann 2013 turco et al 2011 and therefore found highly potential for climate change simulations eden and widmann 2013 sa adi et al 2017 shirvani and landman 2015 sunyer et al 2015 turco et al 2017 widmann et al 2003 a number of methods are available for correction of bias in gcms however the quantile mapping qm method is widely used as it has the capability to correct systematic distributional biases present in gcms argüeso et al 2013 cannon et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2013 themeßl et al 2012 the objective of the study was to investigate the impacts of climate change on groundwater level and irrigation cost for different rcp scenarios a climate downscaling model based on model output statistics mos an empirical hydrological model based on support vector machine svm and an econometric model based on multiple linear regression mlr were integrated in this study for this purpose the proposed modeling framework was applied to assess the impacts on climate change induced changes in groundwater and irrigation cost in rajshahi district located in northwest bangladesh fig 1 where groundwater is the only source of irrigation during dry season declination of the groundwater level is a major concern in the area in recent years the methodology provided in this study can be used to assess the impact of climate change on irrigation cost of groundwater dependent irrigated crop with associated uncertainties for any climatic and geographic region the knowledge generated through the application of proposed methodological framework can be used for planning adaptation to climate change impacts on livelihoods and economy of vast rural population of developing countries depending on groundwater based irrigate agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and sources the monthly rainfall and temperature simulated by eight gcms table 1 for historical 1961 2005 and future 2010 2099 periods were used in this study the choice of the selection of gcms was based on the availability of projections for all the three rcp scenarios for bangladesh the long term daily rainfall and temperature record 1961 2005 from a meteorological station located in the rajshahi district within the study area were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd the bi monthly data of groundwater level the depth to groundwater table from the land surface recorded at 10 observation wells across the study area fig 1 during 1991 2009 were obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb while the irrigation cost irrigated area groundwater withdrawal groundwater well age and harvesting date were collected from the brac bangladesh rural advancement committee research centre 2 2 methods the methodology adopted in the present study is shown by the flowchart in fig 2 the climate downscaling hydrological and irrigation cost models were integrated to assess the impacts of climate change induced changes in groundwater level and consequent changes in irrigation cost a mos downscaling technique was used for the downscaling of gcm simulated rainfall and temperature an empirical model was developed using svm for the simulation of groundwater depth from surface using climate and other influencing factors a mlr model was developed to predict irrigation cost from groundwater level and other factors the empirical groundwater model was calibrated and validated using historical observed data the projected rainfall and temperature by downscaling models were then used in the model to simulate groundwater levels for three rcp scenarios finally the projected groundwater level data were used in calibrated mlr model to forecast the impacts of climate change on irrigation cost the irrigation costs were computed for all the gcms under three rcp scenarios finally the mean and the 95 confidence intervals of irrigation cost were calculated to show the changes in irrigation cost with uncertainty for each rcp scenarios a description of the methods used in the study is given in the following sections 2 3 climate downscaling and projections the procedure used for statistical downscaling of rainfall and temperature was consisted of three steps as outlined below 1 the gcm simulated rainfall and temperature at four gcm grid points surrounding the study area were used to interpolate the rainfall and temperature at the point of meteorological station within the study area 2 the qm bias correction approach was used to correct the biases in gcm simulated rainfall temperature by comparing the simulated rainfall temperature with observed rainfall temperature for the period 1961 2005 3 the estimated qm parameters to correct biases in historical rainfall temperature were used for correcting the biases in gcm simulations for period 2010 2099 the qm is a non parametric bias correction approach the adjustment of data using qm can be represented as empirical cumulative density function cdf and its inverse as below fang et al 2015 1 p c o r m e c d f o b s m 1 e c d f r a w m p r a w m where pcor m is the bias corrected rainfall of m th month praw m is rainfall of m th month before bias correction ecdfobs m is the empirical cdf of observed data of m th month and ecdfraw m is the cdf of rainfall of m th month before bias correction description of the qm and its application to correct biases in the gcms can be found in fang et al 2015 in the present study qm bias correction approach was used to correct the biases in each gcm simulated rainfall or temperature separately 2 4 groundwater model the physical factors that influence the groundwater level in the study area are considered for the selection of controlling factors of groundwater level fluctuation groundwater level in the study depends on the seasonal pattern of climate irrigation abstraction recharge from water bodies etc salem et al 2017a four factors were considered in this study for modeling groundwater level through a thorough evaluation of all the natural and anthropogenic phenomena that may affect groundwater level in the area namely the monthly total rainfall crop evapotranspiration et groundwater abstraction and irrigation return period from the paddy field rainfall and temperature are directly related to groundwater recharge while abstraction of groundwater to meet irrigation demand and irrigation return flow to aquifer directly affect groundwater level therefore these four factors have been found capable of simulate groundwater level fluctuation in groundwater dependent irrigation region salem et al 2017a 2017b the following steps were used to assess the impacts of climate change on groundwater level and the irrigation cost 1 a water balance model fao 56 was used for the estimation of irrigation water demand or the groundwater abstraction groundwater abstraction was considered equal to irrigation demand as total water required for irrigation in dry season rice field in the study area comes from groundwater 2 an svm model was developed to simulate the depth to groundwater level from rainfall evapotranspiration et groundwater extraction and irrigation return flow data the model was calibrated and validated with observed data for the period 1991 to 2009 3 irrigation demand under future climate change scenarios was estimated using a fao 56 model which was considered as groundwater abstraction under climate change scenarios 4 the projected rainfall et under rising temperatures groundwater abstraction due to climate change estimated in step 3 and irrigation return flow for altered irrigation amount for the future period were used in the svm model to estimate the future changes in groundwater level due to climate change 5 the projected groundwater depths by different gcms were used to estimate the mean change in groundwater depth and its 95 confidence interval using a bayesian method for each rcp scenario 2 5 estimation of irrigation water demand various et based models such as priestley taylor penman hargreaves and samini penman monteith fao 56 etc have been proposed for estimation of irrigation water demand tukimat et al 2012 these models employ different approaches for various aspects of crop water use and provide a wide range of estimation weiß and menzel 2008 a number of studies reported that fao 56 method gives the best agreement with measured crop water use by lysimeter experiments when applied across environments kingston et al 2009 temesgen et al 2005 weiß and menzel 2008 fao 56 incorporates the biological and physical processes involved in et from cropped surfaces by relating et to a specific crop and therefore able to estimate the irrigation water requirement more accurately allen et al 1998 therefore the fao 56 model was used in this study to estimate the irrigation water demand 2 w i r r e t c r o p w l p w p s w l p e where w i r r is irrigation water requirements e t c r o p is crop evapotranspiration w l p is water required for land preparation w p s is percolation and seepage losses of water from paddy field w l is water to establish standing water layer and p e is effective precipitation accurate estimation of irrigation water demand depends on the reliable estimation of e t c r o p w p s and p e therefore well established methods in term of more accurate estimation of those parameters were used in this study the modified penman method doorenbos and pruitt 1977 was used to compute the reference crop et and the crop coefficient values provided by fao allen et al 1998 were used to estimate e t c r o p the monthly effective precipitation was calculated using the method proposed by the united states agriculture department united states et al 1970 the percolation loss from the irrigation field was considered as the irrigation return flow from the rice field percolation loss through a particular soil class were calculated according to the percentage of sand clay and loam in that soil class by following brouwer and heibloem 1985 because irrigation in the study area is mainly conducted from january to april a bi monthly time series of the irrigation return flow was constructed for only the irrigation period the irrigation return flow in the other months was considered zero total water required for irrigation in dry season rice field in the study area comes from groundwater ahammed et al 2018 therefore groundwater abstraction was considered equal to irrigation demand in the present study estimated values of irrigation water demand et and effective precipitation were compared with that obtained in previous studies to show accuracy in estimation 2 6 estimation of uncertainty in groundwater level bayesian statistics was used to estimate the credible interval in the domain of the distribution of model output contrast to frequentist confidence interval bayesian interval estimation considers related information from the prior distribution whereas confidence intervals are based only on the data rather than a large number of repeated samples for a given posterior p m r the confidence interval for m m l o m h i is estimated using bayesian approach as 3 c i m l o m h i p m r d m where ci is the confidence interval m hi and m lo are the upper and lower bounds of confidence intervals m is model parameters r is model output the function p m is the set of different probabilities for variable m p m r is the inverse probability distribution of r for given m and dm represents normalization scale 2 7 irrigation cost model the irrigation cost in groundwater dependent irrigated region mainly depends on irrigated area and groundwater depth besides that some other factors are also found to have influence on irrigation cost such as irrigation well efficiency harvesting data type of fuel used etc greater advantage of rainfall can be taken by rescheduling the cropping period and therefore the irrigation cost the irrigation cost can also be reduced by improving well efficiency and electricity operated pumps however the diesel operated irrigation pumps are almost the sole pump type is the study area due to lack of undisrupted power supply therefore it is not considered as variable to derive irrigation cost model due to lack of availability of well efficiency data well age was considered as the proxy of well efficiency the associations between irrigation cost and different factors were assessed to identify the influencing factors significant correlations between irrigation cost and irrigated area groundwater level and harvesting date were observed no association was found between irrigation cost and well age and therefore it was also not included for the development of irrigation cost model besides being highly correlated with the output the variables may also be correlated with each other and the multicollinearity in input variables can increase the likelihood of biased prediction therefore the correlation among irrigated area groundwater level and harvesting date also estimate as all the input variables define different physical property or phenomena no significant correlation among them was observed therefore these three variables were used to estimate the irrigation cost in the study area a multiple linear regression mlr model was developed for this purpose the mlr model relates the irrigation cost with the irrigated area groundwater depth and harvesting date the obtained model is given below 4 irrigation cost 10³ bdt 10 61 0 1 harvesting date 1 13 irrigation area 0 27 groundwater depth the mlr model was used to assess how the irrigation cost varies with groundwater depth 3 results 3 1 climate downscaling separate mos model was developed for downscaling rainfall and temperature of each gcm observed and downscaled rainfall temperature data were compared to assess the reliability of mos models to project future climate the monthly observed and downscaled rainfall at the rajshahi station for gcm miroc esm chem is shown in fig 3 as an example the result showed similarity between observed and downscaled rainfall similar results were obtained for other gcms however it should be noted that gcms are not developed for year to year forecasting of climate rather it is developed for long term projection of climate and therefore it cannot be expected that gcm simulated rainfall and temperature for historical period will accurately match with observed rainfall and temperature sa adi et al 2017 therefore the mismatch between observed and downscaled rainfall in some years as noticed in fig 3 may always happen the performance of downscaling model was also assessed using statistical indices namely nash sutcliff efficiency nse correlation coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse the results obtained for downscaling rainfall and temperature are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the results revealed that the errors in the downscaled rainfall and temperature were less for all the gcms the nse and r² values were more than 0 74 and 0 9 respectively for all of the gcms this indicates that the mos models were able to downscale rainfall and temperature in the study area efficiently and therefore can be used for the downscaling of gcm projected climate 3 2 climate projections the mean of the projected rainfall and maximum temperature of eight gcms under different rcp scenarios are shown in fig 6 the results show that both the rainfall and maximum temperature will increase in the study area due to climate change changes in rainfall and temperature for all the gcms for different rcps are shown in fig 7 the average temperatures in northwest bangladesh will increase in the range of 0 79 c 3 74 c at the end of this century in general the future projected temperature trend showed a good relationship with the degree of greenhouse gas emissions the ensemble mean of the gcms showed 1 33 c 1 76 c and 2 33 c increase in temperature for the low rcp 2 6 medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 emission scenarios respectively however changes in rainfall were not found as prominent as temperature rainfall was found to change in the range of 3 31 to 8 63 in the study area the rcp 2 6 projected the lowest increase while the rcp 8 5 projected the highest increase in rainfall when analyzed for different future periods a slight decrease in mean annual rainfall was found in the middle of the century 2040 2069 and then an increase in the last part of the century 2070 2099 for all the scenarios the rainfall was also found to be more variable for rcp8 5 compared to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 rising temperature is likely to affect evapotranspiration and atmospheric water storage and thereby the rainfall though the relationship between temperature and rainfall is non linear it has been reported that increase in temperature would cause an increase in rainfall in most part of the world shahid et al 2016 wang et al 2016 therefore higher increase in rainfall has been projected for rcp8 5 scenario compared to other scenarios the present study also found an increase in rainfall for rcp8 5 3 3 estimation of irrigation demand irrigation water demand at different locations in the study area was estimated using eq 2 the crop evapotranspiration in the study area was found in the range of 340 to 461 mm effective precipitation between 8 9 and 127 2 mm the seepage and percolation losses in the range of 386 to 714 mm and the total irrigation demand between 981 and 1175 mm shahid 2011 estimated irrigation water demand in the study area using same model and found that crop evapotranspiration in northwest bangladesh varies between 423 and 483 mm effective precipitation between 37 6 and 81 6 mm the seepage and percolation losses between 280 and 669 mm and the total irrigation demand of dry season borro rice is between 839 and 1210 mm hossain et al 2017 estimated crop evapotranspiration from a rice field in the range of 473 to 458 mm and seasonal irrigation water requirement of 1212 mm for dry season rice cultivation in the western part of bangladesh irrigation water demand estimated in the present study collaborate well with that found in previous studies and therefore it can be remarked that the evapotranspiration effective precipitation and irrigation water demand or groundwater abstraction estimated in this study is reliable 3 4 modeling the groundwater level separate svm model was developed for each groundwater monitoring well the svm models were calibrated and validated with 70 and 30 of the observed groundwater depth data respectively the observed and predicted depths to groundwater level matched very well during both model calibration and validation the performance of the models during calibration and validation at three locations is summarized in table 2 the rmse values were found very low 0 84 2 12 and r² and nse values greater than 0 59 in all of the cases 3 5 change in groundwater depth under the projected climate the calibrated and validated svm models were used to project future changes in groundwater depth under the projected climate for this purpose the projected rainfall and et estimated from the projected temperature by different gcms were used as inputs into the models the irrigation water demand under projected climate was estimated to proxy the groundwater abstraction the percolation losses of irrigation water for different gcm simulated climate were also estimated and used as input into the svm models different gcms projected different groundwater depths for the study area the mean of the projected groundwater depth under different rcp scenarios obtained at different locations were interpolated to prepare the map of the groundwater depth under the projected climate the spatial distribution of the projected groundwater depth for three future periods under different scenarios is shown in fig 8 the figure shows that the groundwater level will decrease more in the western and northeast parts of the study area the maximum declination of the groundwater level will be during 2070 2099 for rcp 8 5 the gcm miroc esm chem projected the highest decrease in groundwater level in the northeast part of the study area in the range of 2 23 4 12 m while the gcm mpi esm lr projected the least decrease 0 05 0 1 m in the central part sensitivity of groundwater level to rainfall and temperature was assessed by varying rainfall and et separately while all other parameters were kept constant it was observed that a 1 increase in et in the reference period 1991 2009 caused a decrease in groundwater depth by 1 6 during the irrigation period on the other hand a 1 increase in rainfall for the same reference period showed an increase in the groundwater table by 0 2 rainfall during irrigation period mainly occurs only march and april as thunderstorm the short and intense rainfall produces much runoff compared to groundwater recharge therefore increase in pre monsoon rainfall does not affect groundwater recharge much on the other hand temperature during march and april is higher compared to other months which cause higher et from paddy field mohsenipour et al 2018 the higher et decreases soil moisture as well as groundwater recharge and groundwater level therefore groundwater level in the study area is more sensible to temperature compared to rainfall during irrigated crop growing season the higher declination of groundwater table for rcp8 5 might be due to the higher increase of temperature for this scenario compared to other scenarios 3 6 uncertainty in the projected groundwater depth the groundwater depths projected by different gcms were used to estimate the uncertainty in the groundwater depth using bayesian method the upper and lower bounds of 95 confidence interval band along with the mean of the projected groundwater levels for the different future periods under three rcp scenarios at two out of ten locations are presented in fig 9 as an example the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 are low and intermediate emission scenarios the rcp 2 6 scenario considers that co2 concentrations peak around 2050 followed by a modest decline by 2099 while rcp 4 5 considers slight increase in co2 emissions before decline commences around 2040 the temperatures in the study area were found to become stable in last part of the century for these two scenarios therefore groundwater level was found to decrease until 2069 followed by a slight increase in the end of the century on the other hand both the maximum and minimum temperatures in the study area were found to increase continuously over the century and therefore the declination of groundwater level under rcp 8 5 scenario however as the relationship between climate and groundwater level is not linear it is not possible to explain all the changes in groundwater levels through simple analysis of rainfall and temperature the range between the upper and lower bounds of groundwater depth provided uncertainty in the projected groundwater level it was found that there was more uncertainty in the groundwater level for rcp 8 5 compared to other scenarios the uncertainty band in areal average groundwater level was found in the range of 0 98 to 0 74 m for rcp 2 6 1 23 to 0 97 m for rcp 4 5 and 1 77 to 0 74 m for rcp 8 5 the upper bound to the uncertainty was wider compared to the lower bound for all of the rcps this indicates that the projections of a higher declination of groundwater level are more uncertain 3 7 impacts of groundwater depth on irrigation cost the irrigation cost model eq 4 was verified through the scatter plot of the observed and the simulated irrigation cost shown in fig 10 the figure shows that most of the points are aligned along the diagonal line which indicates that the model can be used to forecast irrigation cost with reasonable accuracy the correlation coefficient between the observed and modeled irrigation cost was 0 72 which also indicates the reliability of the model 3 8 irrigation cost under projected climate the mlr model was used to project the future changes in irrigation cost due to climate change induced declination of the groundwater level the uncertainty in the irrigation cost due to uncertainty in the groundwater level drop under different climate change scenarios were also assessed the obtained results are presented in fig 11 the results show an increase in average irrigation cost due to groundwater level drop which was in the range of 0 12 to 0 32 thousand bdt 1 61 4 30 usd per ha 0 15 to 0 48 thousand bdt 2 01 6 45 usd per ha and 0 21 to 0 73 thousand bdt 2 82 9 82 usd per ha for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively the result revealed that the minimum increase of the irrigation cost will be 0 12 thousand bdt 1 61 usd per ha and the maximum will be 0 73 thousand bdt 9 82 usd per ha due to climate change the maximum increase in irrigation cost was projected by gcm miroc esm chem in the northeast part of the study area in the range of 0 6 1 1 thousand bdt 8 07 14 79 usd per ha while the least increase in irrigation cost was projected in the central part of the study area by gcm mpi esm lr in the range of 0 01 to 0 04 thousand bdt 0 13 to 0 53 usd per ha 4 discussion in the present study mos models were developed for downscaling of gcm simulated rainfall and temperature for the study area the systematic distributional biases present in gcm climate outputs were corrected in respect to observed climate using the qm method the comparison of observed and downscaled data proved that the mos models were able to downscale the climate of the study area therefore the projections of the gcms downscaled by the models can be trusted for the impact assessment the projections of climate in northwest bangladesh revealed a sharp rise in temperature but a small change in rainfall the findings of the study matched well with the recent climate trends in the study area shahid 2011 and future climate projected by others islam et al 2008 rahman et al 2012 rajib et al 2011 a significant increase in temperature and no appreciable change in rainfall except during the monsoon season may cause further declination of groundwater level during the irrigation period numerous conceptual and process based models have been developed and successfully applied for simulating groundwater level in a variety of hydrogeological settings coppola et al 2005 gholami et al 2015 uddameri 2007 however the physically based models are highly data intensive labour intensive and expensive which often hinder the development of such models in data scarce regions nikolos et al 2008 recent studies have reported the impressive predictive accuracy of empirical models based on machine learning methods in groundwater level simulation sahoo et al 2017 shortridge et al 2016 among the machine learning methods svm is found to perform better in groundwater level simulations because of its capability to simulate highly non linear relationships behzad mohsen et al 2010 ch and mathur 2012 guzmán et al 2018 raghavendra and deka 2015 salem et al 2017b sudheer et al 2014 tapak et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 the present study showed that svm was able to precisely predict historical groundwater levels which proves the capability of svm to simulate groundwater depth under the projected climate the svm models estimated a decrease in groundwater level under all climate change scenarios the minimum declination of the areal average of groundwater level was projected in the range of 0 45 m to 2 71 m insufficient recharge due to an increase in et under elevated temperature but no significant increase in precipitation during the irrigation months may be the reason for the groundwater level drop in northwest bangladesh the present study also revealed that four factors namely the monthly total rainfall crop evapotranspiration et groundwater abstraction and irrigation return flow from the paddy field are capable of modeling groundwater level fluctuation in the study area reliably the study estimated increases in average irrigation cost in the study area in the range of 0 12 to 0 73 thousand bdt 1 61 9 82 usd per ha at the 95 confidence interval due to climate change irrigation shares 21 81 of the total cost of paddy production in northwest bangladesh whereas labor cost is the highest 37 01 and the rest is for fertilizer 14 44 and other associated costs basak 2011 therefore labor irrigation and chemical costs define the price of rice or the farmers benefits in bangladesh diesel for operating pumps is becoming a major agricultural input in bangladesh with the expansion of groundwater based irrigated cultivation haque et al 2013 therefore the irrigation cost in bangladesh mainly depends on fuel price this study revealed that the irrigation cost in bangladesh will not only fluctuate due to the increasing cost of fuel or electricity but it will also increase due to climate change induced declination of groundwater level an analysis of the agricultural labor wage data for 2001 2010 revealed that the agricultural labor cost in bangladesh increased at a rate of 9 9 per year department of agricultural marketing bangladesh 2016 the fertilizer and pesticide price was found to highly fluctuate however there was an average increase of chemical cost by 1 8 per year it has been reported that soil fertility in bangladesh has decreased in recent years and more fertilizer are required to maintain crop production shahid et al 2006 furthermore a large amount of fertilizer is being used to cultivate high yielding varieties and consequently the demand for chemical fertilizers is following an increasing trend therefore it is very clear that fertilizer cost combined with labor cost will be a major driving force for the increase in crop production cost in bangladesh basak 2011 and miah et al 2008 also noted that the major component of rice production costs in bangladesh will be due to labor and chemical costs in addition an increasing trend in fuel price has been noticed in bangladesh like other parts of the world though fuel price fluctuates according to international price and the government policy of fuel subsidies the long term trend indicates a clear increase in fuel price in bangladesh increases in fuel cost will certainly cause an increase in irrigation costs in bangladesh along with labor and chemical costs the present study revealed that the irrigation cost in bangladesh will also increase due to the declination of groundwater level caused by climate change however the study revealed a large declination of groundwater level at the locations where the depth to groundwater level is already very high it indicates that increase in irrigation cost due to climate change will be significant in the locations where the depth to groundwater level is already very high and groundwater level is declining very fast 5 conclusions the impacts of climate change on groundwater dependent irrigation cost in northwest bangladesh was assessed in the study using an ensemble of eight gcms of cmip5 for three rcp scenarios the results show that climate change will cause an increase in both annual mean of daily temperature and total rainfall in the study area however a comparatively higher increase in temperature and no appreciable change in rainfall in winter and pre monsoon months will cause further declination of groundwater levels during the pre monsoon irrigation period the study reveals that the declination of groundwater level due to climate change will increase the irrigation cost for all of three rcp scenarios however the amount of groundwater declination and consequent increase in the irrigation cost will depend on climate change scenarios the study projects the maximum declination of average groundwater level by 1 19 1 79 and 2 71 for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively which will cause an increase in average irrigation cost by 0 32 0 48 and 0 73 thousand bdt 4 3 6 45 and 9 82 usd respectively analysis of data reveals that the increases in irrigation cost due to a climate change induced groundwater level drop is much less compared to that for the increases in labor charge fuel prices and fertilizer costs however it may be significant in the regions where the depth to groundwater

11361,the objective of the present study was to assess the impacts of climate change on irrigation cost in a groundwater dependent irrigated region in northwest bangladesh an ensemble of general circulation model gcms were used for the projection of climate an empirical hydrological model based on support vector machine svm was used to simulate groundwater level from climatic variables and a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to estimate the irrigation cost due to the changes in groundwater level the results revealed a declination of average groundwater level in the study area in the range of 0 45 01 19 m 0 55 1 79 m and 0 76 2 71 m under three representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and therefore an average increase in irrigation cost in the range of 1 61 to 9 82 usd hectare at 95 confidence level the maximum declination of groundwater level was projected in the northeast part of the study area in the range of 2 23 4 12 m by the gcm miroc esm chem which might cause an increase of irrigation cost in the range of 8 07 to 14 79 usd hector the study concludes that the impact of climate change induced fluctuations in groundwater level on crop production cost is much less compared to other costs but it may be significant in locations where groundwater level is declining fast keywords climate change groundwater level irrigation cost global circulation model bangladesh 1 introduction groundwater is one of the primary sources of irrigation and food production in many countries of the world shahid et al 2015 siebert et al 2010 treidel et al 2012 despite its huge significance groundwater resources are heading for a crisis in many regions mainly due to the huge exploitation of groundwater to extend irrigated agriculture to feed the growing population gandhi and bhamoriya 2011 pengra 2012 it is anticipated that climate change will pose another major threat to groundwater resources in the near future studies from different parts of the world show that increased temperature and changing rainfall patterns due to climate change will significantly affect groundwater recharge and accessibility davidson and yang 2007 ranjan et al 2006 shahid et al 2017 shahid and hazarika 2010 treidel et al 2012 the lowering of the groundwater table due to changes in precipitation patterns and rises in temperature may reduce well yield and increase pumping cost which may seriously affect the livelihood of farmers in the regions where groundwater is used as the major source of irrigation salem et al 2017b mitigation of climate change impacts on groundwater resources to limit irrigation cost and ensure farmers profits might be a major challenge in the near future particularly in agricultural based developing countries a number of studies have been conducted to assess climate change impacts on groundwater level davidson and yang 2007 ranjan et al 2006 treidel et al 2012 irrigation demand garrote et al 2015 shahid 2011 wang et al 2016 and irrigation cost mulangu and kraybill 2015 nelson et al 2010 however only a few studies have been conducted to assess the impact of declining groundwater level on irrigation cost kovacs and west 2016 medellín azuara et al 2015 narayanamoorthy 2015 nayak et al 2015 salem et al 2017a srivastava et al 2017 the majority of the studies was on economic assessment of declining groundwater level due to over exploitation narayanamoorthy 2015 a few of studies mentioned changes in irrigation cost due to global warming induced changes in groundwater level shahid 2011 indicated that declination of groundwater level due to climate change would increase irrigation cost in northwest bangladesh nayak et al 2015 assessed the impacts of different adaption measures to mitigate climate change impacts on irrigation cost however no study has been conducted to assess the possible changes in irrigation cost of groundwater dependent irrigated crop for different climate change scenarios as groundwater is the major source of irrigation in many developing countries understanding the impact of climate change on farmers profits in a groundwater dependent irrigated region is very impotent furthermore it is important for decision making towards adaptation and mitigation the gcm simulations of climate change fail to provide reliable information on spatial scales below about 200 km and therefore it is important to downscale coarse resolution gcm simulated climatic variables to local scales for impact assessment su et al 2016 climate downscaling methods can be broadly classified into two major groups namely i dynamical or physical downscaling where high resolution regional climate models rcms are employed gao et al 2016 laprise 2008 and ii statistical downscaling sd where statistical relationships between local climatic variables and gcm variables are used do hoai et al 2011 pour et al 2014 wilby et al 2004 compared to dynamical downscaling statistical downscaling methods are often preferred for their simplicity easiness flexibility quickness and ability to provide local scale information ahmed et al 2015 pour et al 2014 the statistical downscaling methods are subdivided into two large groups perfect prognosis pp and model output statistics mos maraun et al 2010 in pp a statistical relationship is established between observed climate variables predictand and observed large scale predictors while in mos the gcm simulated predictors instead of observed predictors are used to establish statistical relationship with observed predictands eden and widmann 2013 the mos models are able to explicitly account for gcm inherent error and bias eden and widmann 2013 turco et al 2011 and therefore found highly potential for climate change simulations eden and widmann 2013 sa adi et al 2017 shirvani and landman 2015 sunyer et al 2015 turco et al 2017 widmann et al 2003 a number of methods are available for correction of bias in gcms however the quantile mapping qm method is widely used as it has the capability to correct systematic distributional biases present in gcms argüeso et al 2013 cannon et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2013 themeßl et al 2012 the objective of the study was to investigate the impacts of climate change on groundwater level and irrigation cost for different rcp scenarios a climate downscaling model based on model output statistics mos an empirical hydrological model based on support vector machine svm and an econometric model based on multiple linear regression mlr were integrated in this study for this purpose the proposed modeling framework was applied to assess the impacts on climate change induced changes in groundwater and irrigation cost in rajshahi district located in northwest bangladesh fig 1 where groundwater is the only source of irrigation during dry season declination of the groundwater level is a major concern in the area in recent years the methodology provided in this study can be used to assess the impact of climate change on irrigation cost of groundwater dependent irrigated crop with associated uncertainties for any climatic and geographic region the knowledge generated through the application of proposed methodological framework can be used for planning adaptation to climate change impacts on livelihoods and economy of vast rural population of developing countries depending on groundwater based irrigate agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and sources the monthly rainfall and temperature simulated by eight gcms table 1 for historical 1961 2005 and future 2010 2099 periods were used in this study the choice of the selection of gcms was based on the availability of projections for all the three rcp scenarios for bangladesh the long term daily rainfall and temperature record 1961 2005 from a meteorological station located in the rajshahi district within the study area were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd the bi monthly data of groundwater level the depth to groundwater table from the land surface recorded at 10 observation wells across the study area fig 1 during 1991 2009 were obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb while the irrigation cost irrigated area groundwater withdrawal groundwater well age and harvesting date were collected from the brac bangladesh rural advancement committee research centre 2 2 methods the methodology adopted in the present study is shown by the flowchart in fig 2 the climate downscaling hydrological and irrigation cost models were integrated to assess the impacts of climate change induced changes in groundwater level and consequent changes in irrigation cost a mos downscaling technique was used for the downscaling of gcm simulated rainfall and temperature an empirical model was developed using svm for the simulation of groundwater depth from surface using climate and other influencing factors a mlr model was developed to predict irrigation cost from groundwater level and other factors the empirical groundwater model was calibrated and validated using historical observed data the projected rainfall and temperature by downscaling models were then used in the model to simulate groundwater levels for three rcp scenarios finally the projected groundwater level data were used in calibrated mlr model to forecast the impacts of climate change on irrigation cost the irrigation costs were computed for all the gcms under three rcp scenarios finally the mean and the 95 confidence intervals of irrigation cost were calculated to show the changes in irrigation cost with uncertainty for each rcp scenarios a description of the methods used in the study is given in the following sections 2 3 climate downscaling and projections the procedure used for statistical downscaling of rainfall and temperature was consisted of three steps as outlined below 1 the gcm simulated rainfall and temperature at four gcm grid points surrounding the study area were used to interpolate the rainfall and temperature at the point of meteorological station within the study area 2 the qm bias correction approach was used to correct the biases in gcm simulated rainfall temperature by comparing the simulated rainfall temperature with observed rainfall temperature for the period 1961 2005 3 the estimated qm parameters to correct biases in historical rainfall temperature were used for correcting the biases in gcm simulations for period 2010 2099 the qm is a non parametric bias correction approach the adjustment of data using qm can be represented as empirical cumulative density function cdf and its inverse as below fang et al 2015 1 p c o r m e c d f o b s m 1 e c d f r a w m p r a w m where pcor m is the bias corrected rainfall of m th month praw m is rainfall of m th month before bias correction ecdfobs m is the empirical cdf of observed data of m th month and ecdfraw m is the cdf of rainfall of m th month before bias correction description of the qm and its application to correct biases in the gcms can be found in fang et al 2015 in the present study qm bias correction approach was used to correct the biases in each gcm simulated rainfall or temperature separately 2 4 groundwater model the physical factors that influence the groundwater level in the study area are considered for the selection of controlling factors of groundwater level fluctuation groundwater level in the study depends on the seasonal pattern of climate irrigation abstraction recharge from water bodies etc salem et al 2017a four factors were considered in this study for modeling groundwater level through a thorough evaluation of all the natural and anthropogenic phenomena that may affect groundwater level in the area namely the monthly total rainfall crop evapotranspiration et groundwater abstraction and irrigation return period from the paddy field rainfall and temperature are directly related to groundwater recharge while abstraction of groundwater to meet irrigation demand and irrigation return flow to aquifer directly affect groundwater level therefore these four factors have been found capable of simulate groundwater level fluctuation in groundwater dependent irrigation region salem et al 2017a 2017b the following steps were used to assess the impacts of climate change on groundwater level and the irrigation cost 1 a water balance model fao 56 was used for the estimation of irrigation water demand or the groundwater abstraction groundwater abstraction was considered equal to irrigation demand as total water required for irrigation in dry season rice field in the study area comes from groundwater 2 an svm model was developed to simulate the depth to groundwater level from rainfall evapotranspiration et groundwater extraction and irrigation return flow data the model was calibrated and validated with observed data for the period 1991 to 2009 3 irrigation demand under future climate change scenarios was estimated using a fao 56 model which was considered as groundwater abstraction under climate change scenarios 4 the projected rainfall et under rising temperatures groundwater abstraction due to climate change estimated in step 3 and irrigation return flow for altered irrigation amount for the future period were used in the svm model to estimate the future changes in groundwater level due to climate change 5 the projected groundwater depths by different gcms were used to estimate the mean change in groundwater depth and its 95 confidence interval using a bayesian method for each rcp scenario 2 5 estimation of irrigation water demand various et based models such as priestley taylor penman hargreaves and samini penman monteith fao 56 etc have been proposed for estimation of irrigation water demand tukimat et al 2012 these models employ different approaches for various aspects of crop water use and provide a wide range of estimation weiß and menzel 2008 a number of studies reported that fao 56 method gives the best agreement with measured crop water use by lysimeter experiments when applied across environments kingston et al 2009 temesgen et al 2005 weiß and menzel 2008 fao 56 incorporates the biological and physical processes involved in et from cropped surfaces by relating et to a specific crop and therefore able to estimate the irrigation water requirement more accurately allen et al 1998 therefore the fao 56 model was used in this study to estimate the irrigation water demand 2 w i r r e t c r o p w l p w p s w l p e where w i r r is irrigation water requirements e t c r o p is crop evapotranspiration w l p is water required for land preparation w p s is percolation and seepage losses of water from paddy field w l is water to establish standing water layer and p e is effective precipitation accurate estimation of irrigation water demand depends on the reliable estimation of e t c r o p w p s and p e therefore well established methods in term of more accurate estimation of those parameters were used in this study the modified penman method doorenbos and pruitt 1977 was used to compute the reference crop et and the crop coefficient values provided by fao allen et al 1998 were used to estimate e t c r o p the monthly effective precipitation was calculated using the method proposed by the united states agriculture department united states et al 1970 the percolation loss from the irrigation field was considered as the irrigation return flow from the rice field percolation loss through a particular soil class were calculated according to the percentage of sand clay and loam in that soil class by following brouwer and heibloem 1985 because irrigation in the study area is mainly conducted from january to april a bi monthly time series of the irrigation return flow was constructed for only the irrigation period the irrigation return flow in the other months was considered zero total water required for irrigation in dry season rice field in the study area comes from groundwater ahammed et al 2018 therefore groundwater abstraction was considered equal to irrigation demand in the present study estimated values of irrigation water demand et and effective precipitation were compared with that obtained in previous studies to show accuracy in estimation 2 6 estimation of uncertainty in groundwater level bayesian statistics was used to estimate the credible interval in the domain of the distribution of model output contrast to frequentist confidence interval bayesian interval estimation considers related information from the prior distribution whereas confidence intervals are based only on the data rather than a large number of repeated samples for a given posterior p m r the confidence interval for m m l o m h i is estimated using bayesian approach as 3 c i m l o m h i p m r d m where ci is the confidence interval m hi and m lo are the upper and lower bounds of confidence intervals m is model parameters r is model output the function p m is the set of different probabilities for variable m p m r is the inverse probability distribution of r for given m and dm represents normalization scale 2 7 irrigation cost model the irrigation cost in groundwater dependent irrigated region mainly depends on irrigated area and groundwater depth besides that some other factors are also found to have influence on irrigation cost such as irrigation well efficiency harvesting data type of fuel used etc greater advantage of rainfall can be taken by rescheduling the cropping period and therefore the irrigation cost the irrigation cost can also be reduced by improving well efficiency and electricity operated pumps however the diesel operated irrigation pumps are almost the sole pump type is the study area due to lack of undisrupted power supply therefore it is not considered as variable to derive irrigation cost model due to lack of availability of well efficiency data well age was considered as the proxy of well efficiency the associations between irrigation cost and different factors were assessed to identify the influencing factors significant correlations between irrigation cost and irrigated area groundwater level and harvesting date were observed no association was found between irrigation cost and well age and therefore it was also not included for the development of irrigation cost model besides being highly correlated with the output the variables may also be correlated with each other and the multicollinearity in input variables can increase the likelihood of biased prediction therefore the correlation among irrigated area groundwater level and harvesting date also estimate as all the input variables define different physical property or phenomena no significant correlation among them was observed therefore these three variables were used to estimate the irrigation cost in the study area a multiple linear regression mlr model was developed for this purpose the mlr model relates the irrigation cost with the irrigated area groundwater depth and harvesting date the obtained model is given below 4 irrigation cost 10³ bdt 10 61 0 1 harvesting date 1 13 irrigation area 0 27 groundwater depth the mlr model was used to assess how the irrigation cost varies with groundwater depth 3 results 3 1 climate downscaling separate mos model was developed for downscaling rainfall and temperature of each gcm observed and downscaled rainfall temperature data were compared to assess the reliability of mos models to project future climate the monthly observed and downscaled rainfall at the rajshahi station for gcm miroc esm chem is shown in fig 3 as an example the result showed similarity between observed and downscaled rainfall similar results were obtained for other gcms however it should be noted that gcms are not developed for year to year forecasting of climate rather it is developed for long term projection of climate and therefore it cannot be expected that gcm simulated rainfall and temperature for historical period will accurately match with observed rainfall and temperature sa adi et al 2017 therefore the mismatch between observed and downscaled rainfall in some years as noticed in fig 3 may always happen the performance of downscaling model was also assessed using statistical indices namely nash sutcliff efficiency nse correlation coefficient r2 mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse the results obtained for downscaling rainfall and temperature are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the results revealed that the errors in the downscaled rainfall and temperature were less for all the gcms the nse and r² values were more than 0 74 and 0 9 respectively for all of the gcms this indicates that the mos models were able to downscale rainfall and temperature in the study area efficiently and therefore can be used for the downscaling of gcm projected climate 3 2 climate projections the mean of the projected rainfall and maximum temperature of eight gcms under different rcp scenarios are shown in fig 6 the results show that both the rainfall and maximum temperature will increase in the study area due to climate change changes in rainfall and temperature for all the gcms for different rcps are shown in fig 7 the average temperatures in northwest bangladesh will increase in the range of 0 79 c 3 74 c at the end of this century in general the future projected temperature trend showed a good relationship with the degree of greenhouse gas emissions the ensemble mean of the gcms showed 1 33 c 1 76 c and 2 33 c increase in temperature for the low rcp 2 6 medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 emission scenarios respectively however changes in rainfall were not found as prominent as temperature rainfall was found to change in the range of 3 31 to 8 63 in the study area the rcp 2 6 projected the lowest increase while the rcp 8 5 projected the highest increase in rainfall when analyzed for different future periods a slight decrease in mean annual rainfall was found in the middle of the century 2040 2069 and then an increase in the last part of the century 2070 2099 for all the scenarios the rainfall was also found to be more variable for rcp8 5 compared to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 rising temperature is likely to affect evapotranspiration and atmospheric water storage and thereby the rainfall though the relationship between temperature and rainfall is non linear it has been reported that increase in temperature would cause an increase in rainfall in most part of the world shahid et al 2016 wang et al 2016 therefore higher increase in rainfall has been projected for rcp8 5 scenario compared to other scenarios the present study also found an increase in rainfall for rcp8 5 3 3 estimation of irrigation demand irrigation water demand at different locations in the study area was estimated using eq 2 the crop evapotranspiration in the study area was found in the range of 340 to 461 mm effective precipitation between 8 9 and 127 2 mm the seepage and percolation losses in the range of 386 to 714 mm and the total irrigation demand between 981 and 1175 mm shahid 2011 estimated irrigation water demand in the study area using same model and found that crop evapotranspiration in northwest bangladesh varies between 423 and 483 mm effective precipitation between 37 6 and 81 6 mm the seepage and percolation losses between 280 and 669 mm and the total irrigation demand of dry season borro rice is between 839 and 1210 mm hossain et al 2017 estimated crop evapotranspiration from a rice field in the range of 473 to 458 mm and seasonal irrigation water requirement of 1212 mm for dry season rice cultivation in the western part of bangladesh irrigation water demand estimated in the present study collaborate well with that found in previous studies and therefore it can be remarked that the evapotranspiration effective precipitation and irrigation water demand or groundwater abstraction estimated in this study is reliable 3 4 modeling the groundwater level separate svm model was developed for each groundwater monitoring well the svm models were calibrated and validated with 70 and 30 of the observed groundwater depth data respectively the observed and predicted depths to groundwater level matched very well during both model calibration and validation the performance of the models during calibration and validation at three locations is summarized in table 2 the rmse values were found very low 0 84 2 12 and r² and nse values greater than 0 59 in all of the cases 3 5 change in groundwater depth under the projected climate the calibrated and validated svm models were used to project future changes in groundwater depth under the projected climate for this purpose the projected rainfall and et estimated from the projected temperature by different gcms were used as inputs into the models the irrigation water demand under projected climate was estimated to proxy the groundwater abstraction the percolation losses of irrigation water for different gcm simulated climate were also estimated and used as input into the svm models different gcms projected different groundwater depths for the study area the mean of the projected groundwater depth under different rcp scenarios obtained at different locations were interpolated to prepare the map of the groundwater depth under the projected climate the spatial distribution of the projected groundwater depth for three future periods under different scenarios is shown in fig 8 the figure shows that the groundwater level will decrease more in the western and northeast parts of the study area the maximum declination of the groundwater level will be during 2070 2099 for rcp 8 5 the gcm miroc esm chem projected the highest decrease in groundwater level in the northeast part of the study area in the range of 2 23 4 12 m while the gcm mpi esm lr projected the least decrease 0 05 0 1 m in the central part sensitivity of groundwater level to rainfall and temperature was assessed by varying rainfall and et separately while all other parameters were kept constant it was observed that a 1 increase in et in the reference period 1991 2009 caused a decrease in groundwater depth by 1 6 during the irrigation period on the other hand a 1 increase in rainfall for the same reference period showed an increase in the groundwater table by 0 2 rainfall during irrigation period mainly occurs only march and april as thunderstorm the short and intense rainfall produces much runoff compared to groundwater recharge therefore increase in pre monsoon rainfall does not affect groundwater recharge much on the other hand temperature during march and april is higher compared to other months which cause higher et from paddy field mohsenipour et al 2018 the higher et decreases soil moisture as well as groundwater recharge and groundwater level therefore groundwater level in the study area is more sensible to temperature compared to rainfall during irrigated crop growing season the higher declination of groundwater table for rcp8 5 might be due to the higher increase of temperature for this scenario compared to other scenarios 3 6 uncertainty in the projected groundwater depth the groundwater depths projected by different gcms were used to estimate the uncertainty in the groundwater depth using bayesian method the upper and lower bounds of 95 confidence interval band along with the mean of the projected groundwater levels for the different future periods under three rcp scenarios at two out of ten locations are presented in fig 9 as an example the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 are low and intermediate emission scenarios the rcp 2 6 scenario considers that co2 concentrations peak around 2050 followed by a modest decline by 2099 while rcp 4 5 considers slight increase in co2 emissions before decline commences around 2040 the temperatures in the study area were found to become stable in last part of the century for these two scenarios therefore groundwater level was found to decrease until 2069 followed by a slight increase in the end of the century on the other hand both the maximum and minimum temperatures in the study area were found to increase continuously over the century and therefore the declination of groundwater level under rcp 8 5 scenario however as the relationship between climate and groundwater level is not linear it is not possible to explain all the changes in groundwater levels through simple analysis of rainfall and temperature the range between the upper and lower bounds of groundwater depth provided uncertainty in the projected groundwater level it was found that there was more uncertainty in the groundwater level for rcp 8 5 compared to other scenarios the uncertainty band in areal average groundwater level was found in the range of 0 98 to 0 74 m for rcp 2 6 1 23 to 0 97 m for rcp 4 5 and 1 77 to 0 74 m for rcp 8 5 the upper bound to the uncertainty was wider compared to the lower bound for all of the rcps this indicates that the projections of a higher declination of groundwater level are more uncertain 3 7 impacts of groundwater depth on irrigation cost the irrigation cost model eq 4 was verified through the scatter plot of the observed and the simulated irrigation cost shown in fig 10 the figure shows that most of the points are aligned along the diagonal line which indicates that the model can be used to forecast irrigation cost with reasonable accuracy the correlation coefficient between the observed and modeled irrigation cost was 0 72 which also indicates the reliability of the model 3 8 irrigation cost under projected climate the mlr model was used to project the future changes in irrigation cost due to climate change induced declination of the groundwater level the uncertainty in the irrigation cost due to uncertainty in the groundwater level drop under different climate change scenarios were also assessed the obtained results are presented in fig 11 the results show an increase in average irrigation cost due to groundwater level drop which was in the range of 0 12 to 0 32 thousand bdt 1 61 4 30 usd per ha 0 15 to 0 48 thousand bdt 2 01 6 45 usd per ha and 0 21 to 0 73 thousand bdt 2 82 9 82 usd per ha for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively the result revealed that the minimum increase of the irrigation cost will be 0 12 thousand bdt 1 61 usd per ha and the maximum will be 0 73 thousand bdt 9 82 usd per ha due to climate change the maximum increase in irrigation cost was projected by gcm miroc esm chem in the northeast part of the study area in the range of 0 6 1 1 thousand bdt 8 07 14 79 usd per ha while the least increase in irrigation cost was projected in the central part of the study area by gcm mpi esm lr in the range of 0 01 to 0 04 thousand bdt 0 13 to 0 53 usd per ha 4 discussion in the present study mos models were developed for downscaling of gcm simulated rainfall and temperature for the study area the systematic distributional biases present in gcm climate outputs were corrected in respect to observed climate using the qm method the comparison of observed and downscaled data proved that the mos models were able to downscale the climate of the study area therefore the projections of the gcms downscaled by the models can be trusted for the impact assessment the projections of climate in northwest bangladesh revealed a sharp rise in temperature but a small change in rainfall the findings of the study matched well with the recent climate trends in the study area shahid 2011 and future climate projected by others islam et al 2008 rahman et al 2012 rajib et al 2011 a significant increase in temperature and no appreciable change in rainfall except during the monsoon season may cause further declination of groundwater level during the irrigation period numerous conceptual and process based models have been developed and successfully applied for simulating groundwater level in a variety of hydrogeological settings coppola et al 2005 gholami et al 2015 uddameri 2007 however the physically based models are highly data intensive labour intensive and expensive which often hinder the development of such models in data scarce regions nikolos et al 2008 recent studies have reported the impressive predictive accuracy of empirical models based on machine learning methods in groundwater level simulation sahoo et al 2017 shortridge et al 2016 among the machine learning methods svm is found to perform better in groundwater level simulations because of its capability to simulate highly non linear relationships behzad mohsen et al 2010 ch and mathur 2012 guzmán et al 2018 raghavendra and deka 2015 salem et al 2017b sudheer et al 2014 tapak et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 the present study showed that svm was able to precisely predict historical groundwater levels which proves the capability of svm to simulate groundwater depth under the projected climate the svm models estimated a decrease in groundwater level under all climate change scenarios the minimum declination of the areal average of groundwater level was projected in the range of 0 45 m to 2 71 m insufficient recharge due to an increase in et under elevated temperature but no significant increase in precipitation during the irrigation months may be the reason for the groundwater level drop in northwest bangladesh the present study also revealed that four factors namely the monthly total rainfall crop evapotranspiration et groundwater abstraction and irrigation return flow from the paddy field are capable of modeling groundwater level fluctuation in the study area reliably the study estimated increases in average irrigation cost in the study area in the range of 0 12 to 0 73 thousand bdt 1 61 9 82 usd per ha at the 95 confidence interval due to climate change irrigation shares 21 81 of the total cost of paddy production in northwest bangladesh whereas labor cost is the highest 37 01 and the rest is for fertilizer 14 44 and other associated costs basak 2011 therefore labor irrigation and chemical costs define the price of rice or the farmers benefits in bangladesh diesel for operating pumps is becoming a major agricultural input in bangladesh with the expansion of groundwater based irrigated cultivation haque et al 2013 therefore the irrigation cost in bangladesh mainly depends on fuel price this study revealed that the irrigation cost in bangladesh will not only fluctuate due to the increasing cost of fuel or electricity but it will also increase due to climate change induced declination of groundwater level an analysis of the agricultural labor wage data for 2001 2010 revealed that the agricultural labor cost in bangladesh increased at a rate of 9 9 per year department of agricultural marketing bangladesh 2016 the fertilizer and pesticide price was found to highly fluctuate however there was an average increase of chemical cost by 1 8 per year it has been reported that soil fertility in bangladesh has decreased in recent years and more fertilizer are required to maintain crop production shahid et al 2006 furthermore a large amount of fertilizer is being used to cultivate high yielding varieties and consequently the demand for chemical fertilizers is following an increasing trend therefore it is very clear that fertilizer cost combined with labor cost will be a major driving force for the increase in crop production cost in bangladesh basak 2011 and miah et al 2008 also noted that the major component of rice production costs in bangladesh will be due to labor and chemical costs in addition an increasing trend in fuel price has been noticed in bangladesh like other parts of the world though fuel price fluctuates according to international price and the government policy of fuel subsidies the long term trend indicates a clear increase in fuel price in bangladesh increases in fuel cost will certainly cause an increase in irrigation costs in bangladesh along with labor and chemical costs the present study revealed that the irrigation cost in bangladesh will also increase due to the declination of groundwater level caused by climate change however the study revealed a large declination of groundwater level at the locations where the depth to groundwater level is already very high it indicates that increase in irrigation cost due to climate change will be significant in the locations where the depth to groundwater level is already very high and groundwater level is declining very fast 5 conclusions the impacts of climate change on groundwater dependent irrigation cost in northwest bangladesh was assessed in the study using an ensemble of eight gcms of cmip5 for three rcp scenarios the results show that climate change will cause an increase in both annual mean of daily temperature and total rainfall in the study area however a comparatively higher increase in temperature and no appreciable change in rainfall in winter and pre monsoon months will cause further declination of groundwater levels during the pre monsoon irrigation period the study reveals that the declination of groundwater level due to climate change will increase the irrigation cost for all of three rcp scenarios however the amount of groundwater declination and consequent increase in the irrigation cost will depend on climate change scenarios the study projects the maximum declination of average groundwater level by 1 19 1 79 and 2 71 for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively which will cause an increase in average irrigation cost by 0 32 0 48 and 0 73 thousand bdt 4 3 6 45 and 9 82 usd respectively analysis of data reveals that the increases in irrigation cost due to a climate change induced groundwater level drop is much less compared to that for the increases in labor charge fuel prices and fertilizer costs however it may be significant in the regions where the depth to groundwater level is high acknowledgements the research for this paper was sponsored by the environment research and technology development fund s 14 of the ministry of the environment japan and the social implementation program on climate change adaptation technology si cat of mext japan special thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments which helped us to improve the quality of the

regional wp and water budgets assessment was performed the results showed that the groundwater contribution to crop evapotranspiration et would be up to 65 with a groundwater depth of 1 0 1 5 m but the agricultural productivity would be relatively low resulting from a waterlogged root zone additionally deep groundwater could result in a reduced wp due to less capillary rise while wp would be 2 02 and 1 98 kg m3 with groundwater depth of 2 5 3 0 m and 3 0 4 5 m under irrigation amount of 100 300 mm furthermore limited irrigation can enhance the contribution of groundwater to wp and irrigation water productivity iwp which is significant with groundwater depth increasing while the average iwp were 5 83 3 62 2 54 and 1 77 kg m3 respectively for irrigation amount of 100 300 300 500 500 700 and 700 900 mm and the average iwp decreased from 4 79 m to 3 18 kg m3 with groundwater depth increasing 0 5 1 0 m to 3 0 4 5 m however irrigation effective utilization cieu was affected by groundwater depth weakly with irrigation water increasing furthermore the optimal groundwater depth of 2 5 3 0 m was obtained by the impact of groundwater on irrigation water productivity iwp and cieu thus at the regional scale the spatial distribution of groundwater levels needs to be considered for making irrigation decisions keywords irrigation area shallow groundwater agricultural hydrology modeling agricultural water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity has become a serious limiting factor for worldwide agricultural and economic development with increasing food demands and populations however compared with developed countries water productivity is low in most developing countries in many semi arid and arid regions of the world irrigated agriculture accounts for 90 of the total water use improving agricultural water productivity is a priority for ensuring water and food security dalin et al 2015 therefore improving irrigation efficiency is becoming more important to increase agricultural water productivity agricultural water saving directly changes the soil water content of the root zone and groundwater upward flux which causes changes to the agricultural water cycle and crop growth bouman 2007 morison et al 2008 jaksa and sridhar 2015 agricultural water cycles are the driving processes for agricultural water productivity and the complex relationships between crop water consumption soil water content groundwater and irrigation at the regional scale are still unclear therefore based on understanding the linked process of crop growth and agricultural water cycles quantifying the effect of agricultural water saving on agricultural water productivity is the basis for realizing effective water use especially in a shallow groundwater district like the hetao irrigation district groundwater levels apparently fluctuate as a result of irrigation over the crop growing period xu et al 2015 and the agricultural water cycle becomes more complex with the implementation of water saving strategies the exchange between soil water and groundwater will be changing with declining groundwater furthermore the groundwater upward flux in the water table needs quantification due to its significance for crop water use yang et al 2007 huo et al 2012 the capillary rise from the water table is affected by several factors such as depth to groundwater soil hydraulic properties crop growing stage and irrigation amount many researchers have focused on the influencing factors of capillary rise santoni et al 2010 nishida and shiozawa 2010 liu et al 2016 based on the irrigation field experiment and weighing lysimeters experiment results showed that groundwater contributions amounted to approximately 40 of the total et of maize with a groundwater depth of 0 5 m and groundwater contribution to crop water use of safflower for the treatments without supplementary irrigation under 0 6 m deep groundwater were 72 ragab and fathi 1986 soppe and ayars 2003 ghamarnia et al 2013 however due to their inconvenience and expensive maintenance of field experimental methods the process based models are preferred to quantify the capillary rise the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuous gspac system is important to understand the agricultural water cycle wang et al 2004 zhou et al 2005 li et al 2011 numerical models such as hydrus simunek et al 2005 and swap van dam jos et al 2008 require many soil and crop parameters which limit the use of models to some extent schoups et al 2005 in contrast conceptual models of agricultural water cycles based on the water balance method are widely used due to their simple structure and limited parameters considering the impact of soil water on the crop et some studies incorporated a root uptake model in the water balance model kendy et al 2003 agricultural water productivity is not only related to the water cycle process but also to the crop growing process in agricultural water management the relationship between crop yield and crop et is often characterized using a water production function based on abundant field experiments but it ignores the formation process of crop growing development final biomass and yield and et therefore crop models become important to quantify the agricultural wp models such as sucros de wit et al 1970 and wofost diepen et al 1989 reveal the crop growth process and the effect of environmental factors on crop growth these models require many crop parameters which are not readily available alternatively simpler versions for describing physiological and biochemical process are used widely such as the dssat model jones et al 2003 and epic model williams 1995 due to the great applicability these models have been used for agricultural management at a regional scale cynthia et al 2014 the integration of crop and hydrological models is becoming more and more popular for evaluating agricultural wp for example the swap model linked to the wofost model van dam jos et al 2008 the rzwqm model coupled the dssat model with soil dynamic process hanson et al 1998 and the aquacrop model coupled the simple crop model and concept model of soil water vanuytrecht et al 2014 with the improvement of gis and remote sensing the distributed model has become an often used method for studying hydrological processes at the regional scale xue et al 2017 various examples confirm the appropriateness of gis applications in groundwater hydrology herzog et al 2003 jha et al 2007 brunner et al 2008 considering the above the aim of this study is to prove contribution of groundwater capillary rise to et at regional scale with various crops and soils this is important to optimize the irrigation management and design the reasonable water saving irrigation practices to improve irrigation water productivity by considering groundwater capillary rise to et with the calibration and application of agricultural wp management model awpm sg gao et al 2017a b in the jiefangzha irrigation area jfzia of the hetao irrigation district the detailed objectives of this study are 1 to indicate spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater upflow flux and effectivity of irrigation water in an irrigation district 2 identify the dependence of groundwater capillary rise contribution to regional evapotranspiration f et on groundwater depths 3 determine the impact of irrigation amounts and groundwater depth on water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area and data the jiefangzha irrigation area jfzia a typical irrigation area with shallow groundwater was chosen as the study area with an area of 1 12 mha the jfzia is a typical region of the hetao irrigation district which is located in the southeast of the lang mountains and northwest of the yellow river one of the largest irrigation districts in china fig 1 the topography of this area descends from the southeast to northeast with an average slope of 0 02 xu et al 2010 the region has a typical arid and semi arid continental climate the region has high temperature and drought in summer along with cold and less snow in the winter the monthly average temperature is 10 1 c in january and 23 8 c in july xu et al 2010 the average monthly temperature from april to september ranged from 10 49 c 24 93 c during 2009 2013 annual average pan evaporation is approximately 2000 mm while precipitation is only 155 mm in addition 80 of the precipitation occurs from april to september irrigation is required in this area throughout the crop growing season there are 3100 3300 hours of sunshine and 135 150 frost free days per year the average elevation of this study area is 1056 m the meteorological data during 2009 to 2013 are shown in fig 2 soils in the study were spatially heterogeneous with primarily silt loam and silt in the northern region and silt loam and sandy loam in the southern region fig 3 the soil begins to freeze in the middle of november and is frozen completely until late april or early may cai et al 2003 in may the soil begins to thaw and the groundwater depth decreases wheat maize and sunflower were the three main crops and account for 85 of total crop land in the study area due to low quantities of rainfall irrigation is necessary during the crop growing season the primary irrigation method is flood irrigation with an average application of 8000 m3 ha for the crop growing season it was observed that there was an autumn irrigation practice with an average application of 2600 m3 ha after the harvest of crops each year the aims of the autumn irrigation are to store up water in the soil for the next crop planting the mean soil salinity in this region was relatively low with 3 8 ms cm less than the mean threshold for the three crops allen et al 2006 and the effect of soil salinity on crop growth was ignored in this study the yellow river is the main water source of this irrigation district with annual water supplication of approximately 47 89 108 m3 the irrigation amount irrigation time and irrigation area were obtained from the hetao irrigation administration bureau in recent years water saving irrigation was widely applied in this region the irrigation amount was various in different regions a total of 51 irrigation units were determined by the corresponding control canals the distributions of the irrigation amount in the study area during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 4 according to the distribution of the main canals the study area was divided into four main sections including wulahe qinghui yangjiahe and huangji the majority of total irrigation was focused on wulahe and northeast of huangji the average irrigation amount in 2012 was lower than that in 2013 which was due to more precipitation in 2012 the groundwater depth at 51 sites was measured every five days from 2009 to 2013 during the five years the groundwater depth of 51 sites ranged from 0 1 m to 5 57 m in the jfzia the spatial distributions of groundwater depth during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 4 in most of the region the groundwater depth was shallower than 3 0 m the average groundwater depth of the wulahe yangjiahe huangji and qinghui irrigation area during 2009 2013 were 1 50 m 1 98 m 2 09 m and 2 23 m respectively with the implementation of water saving measurements the average groundwater depth increased from 1 96 m in 2009 to 2 12 m in 2011 then with more precipitation in 2012 the average groundwater depth became 1 78 m in 2012 and 1 92 m in 2013 2 2 regional agricultural water productivity simulation method 2 2 1 agricultural water productivity with shallow groundwater model at field scale in a previous study the agricultural water productivity management with shallow groundwater awpm sg model was developed and validated at the field scale gao et al 2017a b the model couples the soil water groundwater and crop growth processes saleh et al 1989 williams 1995 the awpm sg model consists of three parts a crop module an actual et module and a soil module an overview of the awpm sg model is given in fig 5 in this study the awpm sg model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of water fluxes crop et crop yield water productivity and irrigation water productivity at the regional scale in the awpm sg model the crop module is mainly based on the epic model environmental policy integrated climate developed by williams et al williams et al 1989 based on the temperature accumulation process the crop module consists of phenological development crop growth indicators lai biomass root development and crop yield water productivity and irrigation water productivity wp and iwp epic was coupled with the modified watershed irrigation potential estimation model wipe to simulate the flux of the groundwater soil water crop water consumption system the wipe model was developed by saleh et al 1989 to study the impact of irrigation management schemes on groundwater levels in bangladesh saleh et al 1989 precipitation irrigation soil properties such as moisture content and hydraulic conductivity and the initial groundwater level are required to run this model in this mode the soil profile was divided into four zones the actual root zone zone 1 potential root zone zone 2 transmission zone zone 3 and the saturated zone zone 4 which are shown in fig 5 zone 1 is the zone occupied by roots zone 2 is the zone that is not currently occupied by the roots but will be so after their complete development zone 3 is the unsaturated transition zone below the root zone with a lower boundary at water table and the thickness of this layer varies in time according to extraction evaporation and recharge and zone 4 is the saturated zone and is regarded as the water table zone 3 is always at a constant moisture content and is equal to the saturated moisture content minus the drainable porosity during the simulation process the soil texture in zones 1 and 2 were the same the water balance method was used for the water movement calculation of zone 1 when r d i r d m x water balance is calculated in the zone 1 1 w r i 1 w r i p i c a p c r

der molen 1985 the actual et was calculated based on soil water content crop leaf index and potential crop et etp in this model the potential et was obtained by the reference et et0 multiplied by the crop coefficient kc which is related to crop leaf area sau et al 2004 the ratio of potential evaporation ep to potential transpiration tp depends upon the developmental stage of the leaf canopy soil

with flat topography the same meteorological data were used for the entire study area considering the distributions of branch canals sub lateral canals groundwater depth and soil texture the study area was divided into 51 hrus wulahe q1 q9 qinghui q10 q17 yangjiahe q18 q35 and huangji q36 q51 fig s1 due to the lack of an actual land use data the wheat maize sunflower and uncultivated areas were simulated with proportions of 23 38 33 and 6 respectively for each hru sun 2014 the irrigation water depth of each hru was obtained from canal water dividing the control area the spatial distribution of hrus is shown in fig 1 the model was run for each hru with measured groundwater levels from 2009 to 2013 after the simulations the groundwater upward flux crop et crop yield and wp for each hru were calculated as weighted averages according to the ratios of wheat maize sunflower and uncultivated land the spatial distribution of hydrological elements during 2009 2013 was analyzed using element conversion in arcgis 10 then the relationships between the water use indicators and the groundwater fluxes or irrigation amount were investigated using result from 2009 to 2013 2 2 3 model calibration and validation at regional scale measurements of soil moisture content for 18 sites each year leaf area index for 2 sites each year and yield for 8 sites in 2012 and 2 sites in 2013 over the crop growing period of the study area were used to calibrate and validate the awpm sg model at the regional scale fig 1 the 2012 data were used for calibration and 2013 data were used for validation of the model the model reproduces the soil moisture of root zone zones 1 and 2 lai groundwater upward flux et and crop yield using the observed initial soil moisture content and groundwater

soil constant c and α and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and crop parameters maximum leaf area index laimx extinction coefficient of the canopy kb empirical parameters for evaporation and transpiration be and bt energy conversion factor be and harvest index hi were calibrated tables 1 and 2 during the calibration we set the parameters of model according to the measured data and recommended values and we analyzed the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of parameters fig s4 and table s1 and found the sensitive parameters for soil water groundwater depth and crop lai respectively such as θ f c laimx and so on then we adjust the parameters as their sensitivity to make the simulation result of model closer to measured data at last the calibrated parameters were used to validate the model using data of 2013 the initial crop parameters for simulating crop growth were used as the default values in the epic model for wheat maize and sunflower initial soil moisture content and groundwater depth were specified according to measurements for quantifying the model fitting performance during the calibration and validation processes the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 were calculated these indicators were defined as follows xu et al 2015 a mre mean relative error close to 0 indicates good model predictions and is calculated as 8 m r e 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 100 where n is the total number of observations and pi and oi are the ith predicted and observed values respectively i 1 2 n a rmse root mean square error value close to 0 indicates good model predictions and is calculated as 9 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n a nse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency close to

crop et during the crop growing season which was calculated as 12 w p y e t where y is the crop yield kg ha and et is the total crop et during the crop growth period mm iwp is defined as the ratio of crop yield to the seasonal application of irrigation water salah et al 2014 calculated as 13 i w p y i 2 4 coefficient of irrigation effective utilization cieu cieu is the ratio of the effective irrigation amount to the actual irrigation amount during the crop growing season and is an important indicator for evaluating water use at the spatial scale cieu is calculated as follows 14 c i e u i

this study the ie was calculated based on the crop consumption from irrigation water rainfall is minimal and its intensity is low in the study area then all the rainfall was considered as the effective rainfall and completely used by crops the soil water balance components with shallow groundwater are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the effective irrigation ie was calculated using the following equations when f 0 wf wi 15 i e e t p e w i w f when f 0 wf wi 16 i e e t p e when f 0 wf wi 17 i e e t p e f w i w f when f 0 wf wi 18 i e e t p e f where f is the net groundwater

of e plus t and w i a n d w f are the soil water content in the root zone at the initial and final times mm respectively 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the awpm sg model at the regional scale the data in 2012 were used for calibration and data in 2013 for validation of the awpm sg model calibrated soil and crop parameters for the model are shown in tables 1 and 2 performance of the model can be found in fig 6 the results showed that the simulated and measured data were distributed evenly on both sides of the 1 1 line with nse of 0 72 0 90 0 7 and 0 69 for soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield respectively in xu s study 2010 the simulated soil water content groundwater depth and lai showed agreement with the measured values resulting in nse of 0 61 0 81 and 0 99 respectively in addition the rmses were 25 53 mm 0 43 m 0 59 and 1178 kg ha for soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield respectively therefore we considered that the simulation results were accurate enough for our regional study to test the reasonability of the soil parameters and crop parameters the soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield at 18 sites in 2013 were used for validation fig 6 the results showed that the mre for soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield ranged from 10 89 to 26 the r2 for the four indicators were all greater than 0 4 and nse were all greater than 0 44 due to minimal yield data in 2013 the error for crop yield in the validation process was slightly greater 3 2 soil water and groundwater changes the temporal variations of soil water content in the root zone under different groundwater depths during 2009 2013 were analyzed statistically using data of 51 subunits in fig 7 the results showed that the averaged soil water content in the root zone decreased as groundwater depth increased due to the low groundwater contribution to soil water in the deep groundwater region especially when the groundwater depth was deeper than 2 5 m the soil water content of the root zone would notably decrease compared with the soil water content under the groundwater depth of 0 2 5 m due to low rainfall and deeper groundwater in 2013 the average soil water content was less than that in 2009 2012 especially in areas with deeper groundwater spatially the average groundwater depth gradually increased from west to east during 2009 2013 during the crop growing season the average declined value of groundwater levels for five years respectively were 0 42 0 32 0 12 and 0 08 m in wulahe yangjiahe huangji and qinghui therefore the groundwater depth decreased less in the regions with deep groundwater which showed that the groundwater contribution to crop et in the shallow groundwater regions was much higher than that in the deep groundwater regions 3 3 groundwater contribution to et and effectivity of irrigation water 3 3 1 groundwater contribution to et the spatial distributions of field et during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 8 a et ranged from 495 61 mm to 787 47 mm over the period of april to september for the five years at the regional scale the crop et values in the central parts of the study area were higher than those in the other parts in the calculation of this model groundwater upward flux was related to soil saturated hydraulic conductivity positively then low soil saturated conductivity lead to less groundwater upward flux and crop et fig 3 in the western part of the study area in the eastern part of the study area deep groundwater lead to less capillary rise which resulted in less crop et fig 4 shallow groundwater contribution to crop growth is important to determine irrigation scheduling here groundwater upward flux was used as the contribution of groundwater to et in this study the groundwater upward flux f was the net upward flux at the water table which is the upward flux minus the downward flux at the water table the spatial distributions of groundwater upward flux net groundwater contribution to soil water f during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 8b at the regional scale groundwater upward flux gradually decreased from west to east the maximum groundwater upward flux was 248 04 mm 298 23 mm 300 10 mm 90 13 mm and 172 74 mm during 2009 2013 respectively because of more rainfall in 2012 the groundwater upward flux was less than those in other years then in the hetao irrigation district with shallow groundwater the groundwater contribution to crop growth was significant furthermore groundwater upward flux has a significant seasonal trend from 2009 to 2013 fig 9 in may and june the groundwater upward flux was negative meaning the percolation of soil water was greater than groundwater upward flux this was because in may and june the crops have enough irrigation water supplied compared to the field crop water use while in july and august the crop et was greater than irrigation so the groundwater upward flux at this time was much greater than that in the other period in september the groundwater upward flux and crop et began to decrease 3 3 2 coefficient of irrigation effective utilization the spatial distributions of cieu during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 10 a and b in the five years the greater cieu was concentrated in the central and eastern parts and lower cieu was concentrated in the western part wulahe area at wulahe area the average cieu of five years was only about 0 6 which was due to the large irrigation amount in this region in the northeastern and southeastern parts the lower cieu was caused by the deeper groundwater then at the deep groundwater district the percolating water could not be well reused by crops the cieu ranged from 0 39 0 93 0 48 0 95 0 32 1 0 0 20 0 98 and 0 39 1 0 for 2009 2013 respectively 3 4 spatial distribution of wp and iwp 3 4 1 relative yield the relative yield was the ratio of simulated crop yield to the local average crop yield since there were different crop species in the study area the relative yield was used to describe the distributions of crop yield at the regional scale during 2009 2013 fig s3 the relative yield ranged from 0 94 to 1 33 0 68 1 28 0 69 1 26 0 55 1 27 and 0 59 1 31 during 2009 2013 at the regional scale from the regional distribution the greater relative yield appeared in the central and eastern regions of the study area which was consistent with the distribution of crop et then similar to the findings of gao et al 2017a b the crop yield was proportional to the crop et 3 4 2 water productivity and irrigation water productivity the spatial distributions of wp during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 11 a in the five years the wp slightly fluctuated from 1 50 kg m3 to 2 22 kg m3 at the regional scale specifically the wp in the southeastern part was greater than that in other parts of the study area this could be attributed to the fact that the average groundwater depth of approximately 2 5 m in the southeastern part qinghui area was the appropriate groundwater depth for wp with the application of water saving measures the wp gradually increased with wp values for 2009 2013 of 1 83 1 79 1 90 1 97 and 2 02 kg m3 respectively in agreement with the study of huo et al 2012 the wp was mainly affected by irrigation amounts and groundwater depth in this relatively dry region irrigation water productivity iwp is the ratio of crop yield to the actual irrigation amount the spatial distributions of iwp during 2009 2013 in the study area are shown in fig 11b the iwp ranged from 1 04 kg m3 to 8 73 kg m3 in the five years and due to greater rainfall and lower irrigation in 2012 the average iwp of 3 22 kg m3 in 2012 was less than the average iwp of 3 27 3 84 3 36 and 4 36 kg m3 in other four years different from the spatial distribution of wp the iwp in the northeastern part yangjiahe and huangji areas was greater than that in the other parts this result was directly related to the distributions of yield and irrigation especially in 2012 the irrigation amount in the northeastern part was lower than that in the other parts 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between groundwater upward flux to evapotranspiration f et and average groundwater depth to understand the seasonal trend of the impact of groundwater depth on f et the relationship between the monthly groundwater contribution to crop et f et and groundwater depth from 2009 to 2013 was analyzed in fig 12 a the results indicated that the f et decreased from 45 in april to 80 in june and increased from 80 in june to 50 in september of 2012 however groundwater became shallower from april to june due to the recharge from soil water thawing a significant trend was found where groundwater depth declined from 1 3 m in june to 1 8 m in september of 2012 and this could be attributed to the groundwater upward flux due to crop evapotranspiration although groundwater became deeper and deeper a higher water requirement of the crops resulted in the groundwater contribution to crop water consumption f et increasing from june to september additionally crop development stage is an important factor affecting groundwater evaporation wang et al 2016 the high f et values of 87 97 85 40 and 75 in april from 2009 to 2013 respectively were due to the groundwater upward flux under freezing and thawing and high wind speed in spring leading to high evaporation the f et and f et changing with groundwater depth over the crop growing period were statistically analyzed fig 12b the groundwater upward flux obviously decreased with groundwater depth from groundwater of 1 0 m to 4 5 m at the regional scale lower soil water content under deep groundwater confirmed this result when the groundwater depth was greater than 2 5 3 0 m the groundwater upward flux varied from positive values to negative values which showed that the groundwater contributing to crop growth was less than the soil water percolating to groundwater exceptionally when the groundwater depth was between 0 5 m 1 0 m the groundwater upward flux was less than that with groundwater depth of 1 0 m 1 5 m this was due to the low soil saturated conductivity and low groundwater evaporation in this area with a groundwater depth of 0 5 1 0 m based on experimental and numerical models previous research has concluded that shallower groundwater can produce greater groundwater upward flux in arid and semi arid regions grismer and gate 1988 based on lysimetric experiments ghamarnia et al 2013 reported that the groundwater contribution decreased from 65 to 38 when groundwater depth decreased from 0 60 m to 1 10 m xu et al 2015 reported that the groundwater contribution to crop growth was significant when the depth of the groundwater table was less than 1 50 m but was irrelevant for depths over 2 00 m compared with the trend of f the crop et decreased slightly with deeper groundwater when the groundwater depth ranged from 1 0 m to 3 0 m crop et was approximately 690 mm however the average crop et during the groundwater depths of 0 5 1 0 m were 660 mm which was attributed to less groundwater upward flux in this region similar to the findings of luo and sophocleous 2010 ratios of seasonal groundwater evaporation to seasonal potential et were plotted against the depth to the water table fig 12 when the groundwater was deeper than 3 0 m the crop et decreased significantly due to a lack of groundwater upward flux to crop growth under deeper groundwater this result could be attributed to lower groundwater upward flux to soil leading to low soil water content in the deep groundwater district mentioned in the previous description the effect of groundwater depth on the groundwater contribution to crop et f et is shown in fig 12b the variation trend was consistent with the tendency of groundwater upward flux at the regional scale with groundwater depths of 1 0 m to 4 5 m the f et obviously decreased with the decline of groundwater levels with the groundwater depths of 1 0 m to 1 5 m the f et varied up to 65 these results are in agreement with the findings of previous studies and the contribution of groundwater to et increased with a rising water table and decreased from 90 to 7 when the water table depth increased from 50 cm to 150 cm for the silt clay loam with lysimeters experiments of constant water table depths in the greenhouse torres and hanks 1989 kahlown et al 2005 karimov et al 2014 when the groundwater depth is greater than 3 0 m the groundwater cannot rise through capillary action to the root zone but some irrigation water can still percolate to the groundwater similarly luo and sophocleous 2010 investigated the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation that was approximately 3 8 m in addition the effect of the groundwater level on groundwater upward flux is also related to the soil texture crop growing season and climate condition especially the irrigation can also significantly affect the groundwater upward flux furthermore the groundwater depth can change the efficiency of irrigation water to some extent which is due to a part of the deep seepage irrigation water being able to be reused 4 2 relationship between water productivity and groundwater depth under various irrigation amounts 4 2 1 relationship between cieu and groundwater depth the relationship between cieu and groundwater depth under various irrigation amounts is shown in fig 13 a the cieu decreased slightly with increasing groundwater depths this can be attributed to more et in the shallow groundwater region and deeper groundwater leading to less capillary rise yang et al 2015 in addition the rate of decline in cieu would be much smaller when irrigation amounts increased which showed that the effect of groundwater depth on cieu would be weakened with increased irrigation this could be attributed to the fact that the groundwater contributions would decrease with increasing irrigation amounts gao et al 2017a b the rate of decline in cieu was 0 07 0 06 0 04 and 0 03 with irrigation amounts of 100 300 mm 300 400 mm 400 500 mm and 500 900 mm respectively overall the cieu focused on 0 6 to 1 0 4 2 2 relationship between water productivity wp and groundwater depth influenced by crops soil conditions groundwater depth and agricultural practices including fertilization and atmospheric factors wp varies both spatially and temporarily hatfield et al 2001 cox et al 2002 based on the statistical analysis of data for 51 hrus from 2009 to 2013 the wp under various groundwater depths and irrigation amounts at the regional scale is shown in table 3 though there was little difference of wp at the regional scale the mean wp was related to the distribution of groundwater depth with a slightly parabolic trend overall when the groundwater depth was less than 3 0 m the wp increased with increasing groundwater depth and then the wp began to decrease with groundwater depths greater than 3 0 m the average wp at 0 5 1 0 m 2 5 3 0 m and 3 0 4 5 m during 2009 2013 were 1 87 1 91 and 1 90 kg m3 respectively which illustrated that invalid groundwater evaporation that groundwater upward flux unused by crop growing existed under shallower groundwater and water stress affected crop transpiration under deeper groundwater with lower soil water content on the other hand with irrigation water increasing the wp decreased gradually thus simulations seem to agree with the earlier findings of huo et al 2012 and gao et al 2017a b where with appropriate irrigation the relationship between wp and groundwater depth had a parabolic trend in agreement with mueller et al 2005 the water use efficiency wue of wheat could be enhanced with deeper groundwater tables to some extent 4 2 3 relationship between irrigation water productivity iwp and groundwater depth irrigation water productivity iwp is affected by groundwater depth irrigation amount soil texture and climate the iwp under various groundwater depths and irrigation amounts at the regional scale from 2009 to 2013 is shown in table 4 the results showed that the iwp decreased with increasing irrigation amounts for each groundwater depth the mean iwp decreased from 5 83 to 1 77 kg m3 while the irrigation amount increased from 100 to 900 mm in agreement with the findings of howell et al 1997 and huang et al 2005 the irrigation water use efficiency for biomass and grain yield decreased with increasing irrigation on the other hand the effect of groundwater depth on iwp was generally linear the iwp decreased with the decline of the groundwater table under the same irrigation application which was due to more groundwater upward flux to crop growing in the shallow groundwater district and less groundwater upward flux with deep groundwater similar to the previous study of huo et al 2012 the iwp significantly decreased with the decline of the groundwater table under the same irrigation water application attributable to the shallow groundwater contributing to crop water use comparing the impact of groundwater depth on iwp and cieu the relationship between iwp and cieu was proportionally linear under groundwater depths of 0 to 2 5 3 0 m while the descending rate of cieu increased and the iwp varied gently under groundwater depths of 2 5 3 0 m to 4 5 m fig 13b this could be attributed to low groundwater upward flux and more irrigation percolation under deep groundwater furthermore the deep groundwater could not provide more water to crop growing and then iwp would be affected insignificantly therefore according to the irrigation schedule and crop growing the optimal groundwater depth was 2 5 3 0 m in this study area 5 conclusions based on the awpm sg model the spatial distributions of groundwater upward flux crop et crop yield and wp in the jiefangzha irrigation area from 2009 to 2013 were simulated furthermore the regional groundwater contribution to crop water use and efficiency of irrigation water were quantified from the regional simulation results the groundwater contribution to et and cieu are higher in fields with shallower groundwater of 1 0 3 0 m and the f et would be up to 65 during the groundwater depth of 1 0 1 5 m groundwater contributions to et can greatly increase biomass productivity the maximum wp appeared in the district with groundwater depths of approximately 3 0 m meanwhile the distributions of iwp were correlated with the distribution of groundwater depth from the relationship between iwp and cieu under various groundwater levels the optimal groundwater depth under the circumstances for these irrigated crops was 2 5 m 3 0 m in the study area overall for enhancing the efficiency of irrigation water and irrigation water productivity irrigation schedule need to be optimized by considering groundwater contributions to et in shallow groundwater field in arid and semi arid areas furthermore the contribution varies with other factors including soil texture and climate condition in future studies researchers should further investigate the impact of multiple factors on shallow

implementation of agricultural water saving in arid regions however the role of groundwater capillary rise to crop water use and wp is unclear at the regional scale as the soil texture irrigation amount planting pattern and groundwater depth is various for different fields based on the calibrated agricultural water productivity management for shallow groundwater awpm sg model a five year regional wp and water budgets assessment was performed the results showed that the groundwater contribution to crop evapotranspiration et would be up to 65 with a groundwater depth of 1 0 1 5 m but the agricultural productivity would be relatively low resulting from a waterlogged root zone additionally deep groundwater could result in a reduced wp due to less capillary rise while wp would be 2 02 and 1 98 kg m3 with groundwater depth of 2 5 3 0 m and 3 0 4 5 m under irrigation amount of 100 300 mm furthermore limited irrigation can enhance the contribution of groundwater to wp and irrigation water productivity iwp which is significant with groundwater depth increasing while the average iwp were 5 83 3 62 2 54 and 1 77 kg m3 respectively for irrigation amount of 100 300 300 500 500 700 and 700 900 mm and the average iwp decreased from 4 79 m to 3 18 kg m3 with groundwater depth increasing 0 5 1 0 m to 3 0 4 5 m however irrigation effective utilization cieu was affected by groundwater depth weakly with irrigation water increasing furthermore the optimal groundwater depth of 2 5 3 0 m was obtained by the impact of groundwater on irrigation water productivity iwp and cieu thus at the regional scale the spatial distribution of groundwater levels needs to be considered for making irrigation decisions keywords irrigation area shallow groundwater agricultural hydrology modeling agricultural water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity has become a serious limiting factor for worldwide agricultural and economic development with increasing food demands and populations however compared with developed countries water productivity is low in most developing countries in many semi arid and arid regions of the world irrigated agriculture accounts for 90 of the total water use improving agricultural water productivity is a priority for ensuring water and food security dalin et al 2015 therefore improving irrigation efficiency is becoming more important to increase agricultural water productivity agricultural water saving directly changes the soil water content of the root zone and groundwater upward flux which causes changes to the agricultural water cycle and crop growth bouman 2007 morison et al 2008 jaksa and sridhar 2015 agricultural water cycles are the driving processes for agricultural water productivity and the complex relationships between crop water consumption soil water content groundwater and irrigation at the regional scale are still unclear therefore based on understanding the linked process of crop growth and agricultural water cycles quantifying the effect of agricultural water saving on agricultural water productivity is the basis for realizing effective water use especially in a shallow groundwater district like the hetao irrigation district groundwater levels apparently fluctuate as a result of irrigation over the crop growing period xu et al 2015 and the agricultural water cycle becomes more complex with the implementation of water saving strategies the exchange between soil water and groundwater will be changing with declining groundwater furthermore the groundwater upward flux in the water table needs quantification due to its significance for crop water use yang et al 2007 huo et al 2012 the capillary rise from the water table is affected by several factors such as depth to groundwater soil hydraulic properties crop growing stage and irrigation amount many researchers have focused on the influencing factors of capillary rise santoni et al 2010 nishida and shiozawa 2010 liu et al 2016 based on the irrigation field experiment and weighing lysimeters experiment results showed that groundwater contributions amounted to approximately 40 of the total et of maize with a groundwater depth of 0 5 m and groundwater contribution to crop water use of safflower for the treatments without supplementary irrigation under 0 6 m deep groundwater were 72 ragab and fathi 1986 soppe and ayars 2003 ghamarnia et al 2013 however due to their inconvenience and expensive maintenance of field experimental methods the process based models are preferred to quantify the capillary rise the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuous gspac system is important to understand the agricultural water cycle wang et al 2004 zhou et al 2005 li et al 2011 numerical models such as hydrus simunek et al 2005 and swap van dam jos et al 2008 require many soil and crop parameters which limit the use of models to some extent schoups et al 2005 in contrast conceptual models of agricultural water cycles based on the water balance method are widely used due to their simple structure and limited parameters considering the impact of soil water on the crop et some studies incorporated a root uptake model in the water balance model kendy et al 2003 agricultural water productivity is not only related to the water cycle process but also to the crop growing process in agricultural water management the relationship between crop yield and crop et is often characterized using a water production function based on abundant field experiments but it ignores the formation process of crop growing development final biomass and yield and et therefore crop models become important to quantify the agricultural wp models such as sucros de wit et al 1970 and wofost diepen et al 1989 reveal the crop growth process and the effect of environmental factors on crop growth these models require many crop parameters which are not readily available alternatively simpler versions for describing physiological and biochemical process are used widely such as the dssat model jones et al 2003 and epic model williams 1995 due to the great applicability these models have been used for agricultural management at a regional scale cynthia et al 2014 the integration of crop and hydrological models is becoming more and more popular for evaluating agricultural wp for example the swap model linked to the wofost model van dam jos et al 2008 the rzwqm model coupled the dssat model with soil dynamic process hanson et al 1998 and the aquacrop model coupled the simple crop model and concept model of soil water vanuytrecht et al 2014 with the improvement of gis and remote sensing the distributed model has become an often used method for studying hydrological processes at the regional scale xue et al 2017 various examples confirm the appropriateness of gis applications in groundwater hydrology herzog et al 2003 jha et al 2007 brunner et al 2008 considering the above the aim of this study is to prove contribution of groundwater capillary rise to et at regional scale with various crops and soils this is important to optimize the irrigation management and design the reasonable water saving irrigation practices to improve irrigation water productivity by considering groundwater capillary rise to et with the calibration and application of agricultural wp management model awpm sg gao et al 2017a b in the jiefangzha irrigation area jfzia of the hetao irrigation district the detailed objectives of this study are 1 to indicate spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater upflow flux and effectivity of irrigation water in an irrigation district 2 identify the dependence of groundwater capillary rise contribution to regional evapotranspiration f et on groundwater depths 3 determine the impact of irrigation amounts and groundwater depth on water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area and data the jiefangzha irrigation area jfzia a typical irrigation area with shallow groundwater was chosen as the study area with an area of 1 12 mha the jfzia is a typical region of the hetao irrigation district which is located in the southeast of the lang mountains and northwest of the yellow river one of the largest irrigation districts in china fig 1 the topography of this area descends from the southeast to northeast with an average slope of 0 02 xu et al 2010 the region has a typical arid and semi arid continental climate the region has high temperature and drought in summer along with cold and less snow in the winter the monthly average temperature is 10 1 c in january and 23 8 c in july xu et al 2010 the average monthly temperature from april to september ranged from 10 49 c 24 93 c during 2009 2013 annual average pan evaporation is approximately 2000 mm while precipitation is only 155 mm in addition 80 of the precipitation occurs from april to september irrigation is required in this area throughout the crop growing season there are 3100 3300 hours of sunshine and 135 150 frost free days per year the average elevation of this study area is 1056 m the meteorological data during 2009 to 2013 are shown in fig 2 soils in the study were spatially heterogeneous with primarily silt loam and silt in the northern region and silt loam and sandy loam in the southern region fig 3 the soil begins to freeze in the middle of november and is frozen completely until late april or early may cai et al 2003 in may the soil begins to thaw and the groundwater depth decreases wheat maize and sunflower were the three main crops and account for 85 of total crop land in the study area due to low quantities of rainfall irrigation is necessary during the crop growing season the primary irrigation method is flood irrigation with an average application of 8000 m3 ha for the crop growing season it was observed that there was an autumn irrigation practice with an average application of 2600 m3 ha after the harvest of crops each year the aims of the autumn irrigation are to store up water in the soil for the next crop planting the mean soil salinity in this region was relatively low with 3 8 ms cm less than the mean threshold for the three crops allen et al 2006 and the effect of soil salinity on crop growth was ignored in this study the yellow river is the main water source of this irrigation district with annual water supplication of approximately 47 89 108 m3 the irrigation amount irrigation time and irrigation area were obtained from the hetao irrigation administration bureau in recent years water saving irrigation was widely applied in this region the irrigation amount was various in different regions a total of 51 irrigation units were determined by the corresponding control canals the distributions of the irrigation amount in the study area during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 4 according to the distribution of the main canals the study area was divided into four main sections including wulahe qinghui yangjiahe and huangji the majority of total irrigation was focused on wulahe and northeast of huangji the average irrigation amount in 2012 was lower than that in 2013 which was due to more precipitation in 2012 the groundwater depth at 51 sites was measured every five days from 2009 to 2013 during the five years the groundwater depth of 51 sites ranged from 0 1 m to 5 57 m in the jfzia the spatial distributions of groundwater depth during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 4 in most of the region the groundwater depth was shallower than 3 0 m the average groundwater depth of the wulahe yangjiahe huangji and qinghui irrigation area during 2009 2013 were 1 50 m 1 98 m 2 09 m and 2 23 m respectively with the implementation of water saving measurements the average groundwater depth increased from 1 96 m in 2009 to 2 12 m in 2011 then with more precipitation in 2012 the average groundwater depth became 1 78 m in 2012 and 1 92 m in 2013 2 2 regional agricultural water productivity simulation method 2 2 1 agricultural water productivity with shallow groundwater model at field scale in a previous study the agricultural water productivity management with shallow groundwater awpm sg model was developed and validated at the field scale gao et al 2017a b the model couples the soil water groundwater and crop growth processes saleh et al 1989 williams 1995 the awpm sg model consists of three parts a crop module an actual et module and a soil module an overview of the awpm sg model is given in fig 5 in this study the awpm sg model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of water fluxes crop et crop yield water productivity and irrigation water productivity at the regional scale in the awpm sg model the crop module is mainly based on the epic model environmental policy integrated climate developed by williams et al williams et al 1989 based on the temperature accumulation process the crop module consists of phenological development crop growth indicators lai biomass root development and crop yield water productivity and irrigation water productivity wp and iwp epic was coupled with the modified watershed irrigation potential estimation model wipe to simulate the flux of the groundwater soil water crop water consumption system the wipe model was developed by saleh et al 1989 to study the impact of irrigation management schemes on groundwater levels in bangladesh saleh et al 1989 precipitation irrigation soil properties such as moisture content and hydraulic conductivity and the initial groundwater level are required to run this model in this mode the soil profile was divided into four zones the actual root zone zone 1 potential root zone zone 2 transmission zone zone 3 and the saturated zone zone 4 which are shown in fig 5 zone 1 is the zone occupied by roots zone 2 is the zone that is not currently occupied by the roots but will be so after their complete development zone 3 is the unsaturated transition zone below the root zone with a lower boundary at water table and the thickness of this layer varies in time according to extraction evaporation and recharge and zone 4 is the saturated zone and is regarded as the water table zone 3 is always at a constant moisture content and is equal to the saturated moisture content minus the drainable porosity during the simulation process the soil texture in zones 1 and 2 were the same the water balance method was used for the water movement calculation of zone 1 when r d i r d m x water balance is calculated in the zone 1 1 w r i 1 w r i p i c a p c r

der molen 1985 the actual et was calculated based on soil water content crop leaf index and potential crop et etp in this model the potential et was obtained by the reference et et0 multiplied by the crop coefficient kc which is related to crop leaf area sau et al 2004 the ratio of potential evaporation ep to potential transpiration tp depends upon the developmental stage of the leaf canopy soil

with flat topography the same meteorological data were used for the entire study area considering the distributions of branch canals sub lateral canals groundwater depth and soil texture the study area was divided into 51 hrus wulahe q1 q9 qinghui q10 q17 yangjiahe q18 q35 and huangji q36 q51 fig s1 due to the lack of an actual land use data the wheat maize sunflower and uncultivated areas were simulated with proportions of 23 38 33 and 6 respectively for each hru sun 2014 the irrigation water depth of each hru was obtained from canal water dividing the control area the spatial distribution of hrus is shown in fig 1 the model was run for each hru with measured groundwater levels from 2009 to 2013 after the simulations the groundwater upward flux crop et crop yield and wp for each hru were calculated as weighted averages according to the ratios of wheat maize sunflower and uncultivated land the spatial distribution of hydrological elements during 2009 2013 was analyzed using element conversion in arcgis 10 then the relationships between the water use indicators and the groundwater fluxes or irrigation amount were investigated using result from 2009 to 2013 2 2 3 model calibration and validation at regional scale measurements of soil moisture content for 18 sites each year leaf area index for 2 sites each year and yield for 8 sites in 2012 and 2 sites in 2013 over the crop growing period of the study area were used to calibrate and validate the awpm sg model at the regional scale fig 1 the 2012 data were used for calibration and 2013 data were used for validation of the model the model reproduces the soil moisture of root zone zones 1 and 2 lai groundwater upward flux et and crop yield using the observed initial soil moisture content and groundwater

recommended values and we analyzed the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of parameters fig s4 and table s1 and found the sensitive parameters for soil water groundwater depth and crop lai respectively such as θ f c laimx and so on then we adjust the parameters as their sensitivity to make the simulation result of model closer to measured data at last the calibrated parameters were used to validate the model using data of 2013 the initial crop parameters for simulating crop growth were used as the default values in the epic model for wheat maize and sunflower initial soil moisture content and groundwater depth were specified according to measurements for quantifying the model fitting performance during the calibration and validation processes the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 were calculated these indicators were defined as follows xu et al 2015 a mre mean relative error close to 0 indicates good model predictions and is calculated as 8 m r e 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 100 where n is the total number of observations and pi and oi are the ith predicted and observed values

crop et during the crop growing season which was calculated as 12 w p y e t where y is the crop yield kg ha and et is the total crop et during the crop growth period mm iwp is defined as the ratio of crop yield to the seasonal application of irrigation water salah et al 2014 calculated as 13 i w p y i 2 4 coefficient of irrigation effective utilization cieu cieu is the ratio of the effective irrigation amount to the actual irrigation amount during the crop growing season and is an important indicator for evaluating water use at the spatial scale cieu is calculated as follows 14 c i e u i

this study the ie was calculated based on the crop consumption from irrigation water rainfall is minimal and its intensity is low in the study area then all the rainfall was considered as the effective rainfall and completely used by crops the soil water balance components with shallow groundwater are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the effective irrigation ie was calculated

scale the data in 2012 were used for calibration and data in 2013 for validation of the awpm sg model calibrated soil and crop parameters for the model are shown in tables 1 and 2 performance of the model can be found in fig 6 the results showed that the simulated and measured data were distributed evenly on both sides of the 1 1 line with nse of 0 72 0 90 0 7 and 0 69 for soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield respectively in xu s study 2010 the simulated soil water content groundwater depth and lai showed agreement with the measured values resulting in nse of 0 61 0 81 and 0 99 respectively in addition the rmses were 25 53 mm 0 43 m 0 59 and 1178 kg ha for soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield respectively therefore we considered that the simulation results were accurate enough for our regional study to test the reasonability of the soil parameters and crop parameters the soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield at 18 sites in 2013 were used for validation fig 6 the results showed that the mre for soil water content groundwater depth crop leaf area index and crop yield ranged from 10 89 to 26 the r2 for the four indicators were all greater than 0 4 and nse were all greater than 0 44 due to minimal yield data in 2013 the error for crop yield in the validation process was slightly greater 3 2 soil water and groundwater changes the temporal variations of soil water content in the root zone under different groundwater depths during 2009 2013 were analyzed statistically using data of 51 subunits in fig 7 the results showed that the averaged soil water content in the root zone decreased as groundwater depth increased due to the low groundwater contribution to soil water in the deep groundwater region especially when the groundwater depth was deeper than 2 5 m the soil water content of the root zone would notably decrease compared with the soil water content under the groundwater depth of 0 2 5 m due to low rainfall and deeper groundwater in 2013 the average soil water content was less than that in 2009 2012 especially in areas with deeper groundwater spatially the average groundwater depth gradually increased from west to east during 2009 2013 during the crop growing season the average declined value of groundwater levels for five years respectively were 0 42 0 32 0 12 and 0 08 m in wulahe yangjiahe huangji and qinghui therefore the groundwater depth decreased less in the regions with deep groundwater which showed that the groundwater contribution to crop et in the shallow groundwater regions was much higher than that in the deep groundwater regions 3 3 groundwater contribution to et and effectivity of irrigation water 3 3 1 groundwater contribution to et the spatial distributions of field et during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 8 a et ranged from 495 61 mm to 787 47 mm over the period of april to september for the five years at the regional scale the crop et values in the central parts of the study area were higher than those in the other parts in the calculation of this model groundwater upward flux was related to soil saturated hydraulic conductivity positively then low soil saturated conductivity lead to less groundwater upward flux and crop et fig 3 in the western part of the study area in the eastern part of the study area deep groundwater lead to less capillary rise which resulted in less crop et fig 4 shallow groundwater contribution to crop growth is important to determine irrigation scheduling here groundwater upward flux was used as the contribution of groundwater to et in this study the groundwater upward flux f was the net upward flux at the water table which is the upward flux minus the downward flux at the water table the spatial distributions of groundwater upward flux net groundwater contribution to soil water f during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 8b at the regional scale groundwater upward flux gradually decreased from west to east the maximum groundwater upward flux was 248 04 mm 298 23 mm 300 10 mm 90 13 mm and 172 74 mm during 2009 2013 respectively because of more rainfall in 2012 the groundwater upward flux was less than those in other years then in the hetao irrigation district with shallow groundwater the groundwater contribution to crop growth was significant furthermore groundwater upward flux has a significant seasonal trend from 2009 to 2013 fig 9 in may and june the groundwater upward flux was negative meaning the percolation of soil water was greater than groundwater upward flux this was because in may and june the crops have enough irrigation water supplied compared to the field crop water use while in july and august the crop et was greater than irrigation so the groundwater upward flux at this time was much greater than that in the other period in september the groundwater upward flux and crop et began to decrease 3 3 2 coefficient of irrigation effective utilization the spatial distributions of cieu during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 10 a and b in the five years the greater cieu was concentrated in the central and eastern parts and lower cieu was concentrated in the western part wulahe area at wulahe area the average cieu of five years was only about 0 6 which was due to the large irrigation amount in this region in the northeastern and southeastern parts the lower cieu was caused by the deeper groundwater then at the deep groundwater district the percolating water could not be well reused by crops the cieu ranged from 0 39 0 93 0 48 0 95 0 32 1 0 0 20 0 98 and 0 39 1 0 for 2009 2013 respectively 3 4 spatial distribution of wp and iwp 3 4 1 relative yield the relative yield was the ratio of simulated crop yield to the local average crop yield since there were different crop species in the study area the relative yield was used to describe the distributions of crop yield at the regional scale during 2009 2013 fig s3 the relative yield ranged from 0 94 to 1 33 0 68 1 28 0 69 1 26 0 55 1 27 and 0 59 1 31 during 2009 2013 at the regional scale from the regional distribution the greater relative yield appeared in the central and eastern regions of the study area which was consistent with the distribution of crop et then similar to the findings of gao et al 2017a b the crop yield was proportional to the crop et 3 4 2 water productivity and irrigation water productivity the spatial distributions of wp during 2009 2013 are shown in fig 11 a in the five years the wp slightly fluctuated from 1 50 kg m3 to 2 22 kg m3 at the regional scale specifically the wp in the southeastern part was greater than that in other parts of the study area this could be attributed to the fact that the average groundwater depth of approximately 2 5 m in the southeastern part qinghui area was the appropriate groundwater depth for wp with the application of water saving measures the wp gradually increased with wp values for 2009 2013 of 1 83 1 79 1 90 1 97 and 2 02 kg m3 respectively in agreement with the study of huo et al 2012 the wp was mainly affected by irrigation amounts and groundwater depth in this relatively dry region irrigation water productivity iwp is the ratio of crop yield to the actual irrigation amount the spatial distributions of iwp during 2009 2013 in the study area are shown in fig 11b the iwp ranged from 1 04 kg m3 to 8 73 kg m3 in the five years and due to greater rainfall and lower irrigation in 2012 the average iwp of 3 22 kg m3 in 2012 was less than the average iwp of 3 27 3 84 3 36 and 4 36 kg m3 in other four years different from the spatial distribution of wp the iwp in the northeastern part yangjiahe and huangji areas was greater than that in the other parts this result was directly related to the distributions of yield and irrigation especially in 2012 the irrigation amount in the northeastern part was lower than that in the other parts 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between groundwater upward flux to evapotranspiration f et and average groundwater depth to understand the seasonal trend of the impact of groundwater depth on f et the relationship between the monthly groundwater contribution to crop et f et and groundwater depth from 2009 to 2013 was analyzed in fig 12 a the results indicated that the f et decreased from 45 in april to 80 in june and increased from 80 in june to 50 in september of 2012 however groundwater became shallower from april to june due to the recharge from soil water thawing a significant trend was found where groundwater depth declined from 1 3 m in june to 1 8 m in september of 2012 and this could be attributed to the groundwater upward flux due to crop evapotranspiration although groundwater became deeper and deeper a higher water requirement of the crops resulted in the groundwater contribution to crop water consumption f et increasing from june to september additionally crop development stage is an important factor affecting groundwater evaporation wang et al 2016 the high f et values of 87 97 85 40 and 75 in april from 2009 to 2013 respectively were due to the groundwater upward flux under freezing and thawing and high wind speed in spring leading to high evaporation the f et and f et changing with groundwater depth over the crop growing period were statistically analyzed fig 12b the groundwater upward flux obviously decreased with groundwater depth from groundwater of 1 0 m to 4 5 m at the regional scale lower soil water content under deep groundwater confirmed this result when the groundwater depth was greater than 2 5 3 0 m the groundwater upward flux varied from positive values to negative values which showed that the groundwater contributing to crop growth was less than the soil water percolating to groundwater exceptionally when the groundwater depth was between 0 5 m 1 0 m the groundwater upward flux was less than that with groundwater depth of 1 0 m 1 5 m this was due to the low soil saturated conductivity and low groundwater evaporation in this area with a groundwater depth of 0 5 1 0 m based on experimental and numerical models previous research has concluded that shallower groundwater can produce greater groundwater upward flux in arid and semi arid regions grismer and gate 1988 based on lysimetric experiments ghamarnia et al 2013 reported that the groundwater contribution decreased from 65 to 38 when groundwater depth decreased from 0 60 m to 1 10 m xu et al 2015 reported that the groundwater contribution to crop growth was significant when the depth of the groundwater table was less than 1 50 m but was irrelevant for depths over 2 00 m compared with the trend of f the crop et decreased slightly with deeper groundwater when the groundwater depth ranged from 1 0 m to 3 0 m crop et was approximately 690 mm however the average crop et during the groundwater depths of 0 5 1 0 m were 660 mm which was attributed to less groundwater upward flux in this region similar to the findings of luo and sophocleous 2010 ratios of seasonal groundwater evaporation to seasonal potential et were plotted against the depth to the water table fig 12 when the groundwater was deeper than 3 0 m the crop et decreased significantly due to a lack of groundwater upward flux to crop growth under deeper groundwater this result could be attributed to lower groundwater upward flux to soil leading to low soil water content in the deep groundwater district mentioned in the previous description the effect of groundwater depth on the groundwater contribution to crop et f et is shown in fig 12b the variation trend was consistent with the tendency of groundwater upward flux at the regional scale with groundwater depths of 1 0 m to 4 5 m the f et obviously decreased with the decline of groundwater levels with the groundwater depths of 1 0 m to 1 5 m the f et varied up to 65 these results are in agreement with the findings of previous studies and the contribution of groundwater to et increased with a rising water table and decreased from 90 to 7 when the water table depth increased from 50 cm to 150 cm for the silt clay loam with lysimeters experiments of constant water table depths in the greenhouse torres and hanks 1989 kahlown et al 2005 karimov et al 2014 when the groundwater depth is greater than 3 0 m the groundwater cannot rise through capillary action to the root zone but some irrigation water can still percolate to the groundwater similarly luo and sophocleous 2010 investigated the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation that was approximately 3 8 m in addition the effect of the groundwater level on groundwater upward flux is also related to the soil texture crop growing season and climate condition especially the irrigation can also significantly affect the groundwater upward flux furthermore the groundwater depth can change the efficiency of irrigation water to some extent which is due to a part of the deep seepage irrigation water being able to be reused 4 2 relationship between water productivity and groundwater depth under various irrigation amounts 4 2 1 relationship between cieu and groundwater depth the relationship between cieu and groundwater depth under various irrigation amounts is shown in fig 13 a the cieu decreased slightly with increasing groundwater depths this can be attributed to more et in the shallow groundwater region and deeper groundwater leading to less capillary rise yang et al 2015 in addition the rate of decline in cieu would be much smaller when irrigation amounts increased which showed that the effect of groundwater depth on cieu would be weakened with increased irrigation this could be attributed to the fact that the groundwater contributions would decrease with increasing irrigation amounts gao et al 2017a b the rate of decline in cieu was 0 07 0 06 0 04 and 0 03 with irrigation amounts of 100 300 mm 300 400 mm 400 500 mm and 500 900 mm respectively overall the cieu focused on 0 6 to 1 0 4 2 2 relationship between water productivity wp and groundwater depth influenced by crops soil conditions groundwater depth and agricultural practices including fertilization and atmospheric factors wp varies both spatially and temporarily hatfield et al 2001 cox et al 2002 based on the statistical analysis of data for 51 hrus from 2009 to 2013 the wp under various groundwater depths and irrigation amounts at the regional scale is shown in table 3 though there was little difference of wp at the regional scale the mean wp was related to the distribution of groundwater depth with a slightly parabolic trend overall when the groundwater depth was less than 3 0 m the wp increased with increasing groundwater depth and then the wp began to decrease with groundwater depths greater than 3 0 m the average wp at 0 5 1 0 m 2 5 3 0 m and 3 0 4 5 m during 2009 2013 were 1 87 1 91 and 1 90 kg m3 respectively which illustrated that invalid groundwater evaporation that groundwater upward flux unused by crop growing existed under shallower groundwater and water stress affected crop transpiration under deeper groundwater with lower soil water content on the other hand with irrigation water increasing the wp decreased gradually thus simulations seem to agree with the earlier findings of huo et al 2012 and gao et al 2017a b where with appropriate irrigation the relationship between wp and groundwater depth had a parabolic trend in agreement with mueller et al 2005 the water use efficiency wue of wheat could be enhanced with deeper groundwater tables to some extent 4 2 3 relationship between irrigation water productivity iwp and groundwater depth irrigation water productivity iwp is affected by groundwater depth irrigation amount soil texture and climate the iwp under various groundwater depths and irrigation amounts at the regional scale from 2009 to 2013 is shown in table 4 the results showed that the iwp decreased with increasing irrigation amounts for each groundwater depth the mean iwp decreased from 5 83 to 1 77 kg m3 while the irrigation amount increased from 100 to 900 mm in agreement with the findings of howell et al 1997 and huang et al 2005 the irrigation water use efficiency for biomass and grain yield decreased with increasing irrigation on the other hand the effect of groundwater depth on iwp was generally linear the iwp decreased with the decline of the groundwater table under the same irrigation application which was due to more groundwater upward flux to crop growing in the shallow groundwater district and less groundwater upward flux with deep groundwater similar to the previous study of huo et al 2012 the iwp significantly decreased with the decline of the groundwater table under the same irrigation water application attributable to the shallow groundwater contributing to crop water use comparing the impact of groundwater depth on iwp and cieu the relationship between iwp and cieu was proportionally linear under groundwater depths of 0 to 2 5 3 0 m while the descending rate of cieu increased and the iwp varied gently under groundwater depths of 2 5 3 0 m to 4 5 m fig 13b this could be attributed to low groundwater upward flux and more irrigation percolation under deep groundwater furthermore the deep groundwater could not provide more water to crop growing and then iwp would be affected insignificantly therefore according to the irrigation schedule and crop growing the optimal groundwater depth was 2 5 3 0 m in this study area 5 conclusions based on the awpm sg model the spatial distributions of groundwater upward flux crop et crop yield and wp in the jiefangzha irrigation area from 2009 to 2013 were simulated furthermore the regional groundwater contribution to crop water use and efficiency of irrigation water were quantified from the regional simulation results the groundwater contribution to et and cieu are higher in fields with shallower groundwater of 1 0 3 0 m and the f et would be up to 65 during the groundwater depth of 1 0 1 5 m groundwater contributions to et can greatly increase biomass productivity the maximum wp appeared in the district with groundwater depths of approximately 3 0 m meanwhile the distributions of iwp were correlated with the distribution of groundwater depth from the relationship between iwp and cieu under various groundwater levels the optimal groundwater depth under the circumstances for these irrigated crops was 2 5 m 3 0 m in the study area overall for enhancing the efficiency of irrigation water and irrigation water productivity irrigation schedule need to be optimized by considering groundwater contributions to et in shallow groundwater field in arid and semi arid areas furthermore the contribution varies with other factors including soil texture and climate condition in future studies researchers should further investigate the impact of multiple factors on shallow

11363,even though potato solanum tuberosum l based intercropping systems are widely practised in developing countries only a few studies have focused on legumes as the companion intercrops this study

income and benefit cost ratio bcr the treatments comprised of pure potato stand ps potato dolichos lablab purpureus l pd potato garden pea pisum sativum l pg and potato bean phaseolus vulgaris l pb results indicated a significantly higher 69 ground cover at tuber initiation stage in pd compared to 66 in pg and pb and 56 in ps similarly the highest smc values were recorded at tuber initiation

dolichos is a promising legume crop that could be integrated into potato cropping systems to improve cwp without compromising the tuber yield keywords potato legume intercropping systems potato equivalent yield economic returns benefit cost ratio 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is an important food security crop and a major source of household income for smallholder farmers in kenya the country s area under potato production is 145 967 ha with an annual production of approximately 1 3 tg faostat 2017 nevertheless potato sector in kenya is still underdeveloped and is faced with low productivity of 8 15 t ha 1 against the attainable yield of 30 40 t ha 1 under normal field conditions muthoni et al 2013 gitari et al 2018 the low productivity is mainly ascribed to the erratic rainfall patterns mugo et al 2016 potato is mainly affected due to its superficial and fibrous root system of which about 85 is concentrated in the upper 0 3 m of the soil profile making the crop very susceptible to drought reyes cabrera et al 2016 burke 2017 aliche et al 2018 potato production under rain fed agriculture thus requires a focus on water use efficiency pereira et al 2012 various interventions that have been promoted to increase water use efficiency in rain fed agriculture include increasing the amount of fertilizer applied to crops supplemental irrigation use of plastic film and use of crop residues as mulch kumar et al 2000 essah et al 2012 carli et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 2017 nevertheless the first three interventions are far beyond the financial ability of most resource constrained farmers in kenya on the other hand one challenge of using crop residues as a moisture conservation strategy in potato production is their availability in adequate quantities coupled with their competitive uses as fuel and fodder karuku et al 2014 gachene et al 2015 in addition under tropical conditions organic mulches decompose rapidly besides being susceptible to termite infestation gachene et al 2015 kamau et al 2017 systematic integration of legume crops into potato production systems could be a viable option for addressing these challenges these crops can enhance soil moisture conservation by covering the soil surface which significantly reduces water loss through run off and evaporation ogindo and walker 2005 karuma et al 2011 chepkemoi et al 2014 namoi et al 2014 gitari et al 2017 singh et al 2017 various crops such as maize sulla spinach radish and beans have been intercropped with potato resulting in increased water use efficiency sharaiha and hadidi 2008 rezig et al 2013 fan et al 2016 singh et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however most of these studies focused on potato under non legume intercropping systems sharaiha and hadidi 2008 reported higher water use efficiency under potato bean intercropping under irrigation and singh et al 2016 observed higher potato equivalent yield when potato was intercropped with radish in kenya intercropping of potato with legumes dolichos garden peas and beans has been reported to reduce run off and soil loss compared with the pure stand of potato nyawade 2015 however the author did not monitor the soil moisture dynamics under those intercropping systems lower soil moisture occurring during tuber formation and bulking stages is very critical and can reduce yield more than when it occurs at any other growth stage of the potato steduto et al 2012 to attain the potential potato yield adequate soil moisture should be available in the rooting zone particularly during tuber formation stage reyes cabrera et al 2016 depending on the soil type climatic conditions and growth period potato requires about 500 700 mm of cumulative water in a growing season sood and singh 2003 ierna and mauromicale 2012 given the importance of potato as a food security crop in the most sub saharan farming system there is a need to understand how the integration of different legumes into potato production system affects the tuber yield therefore the objective of this study was to assess ground cover and soil moisture content under potato legume intercropping systems and the effects of these systems on economic yield and returns 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted at kabete field station college of agriculture and veterinary sciences university of nairobi the site falls in the sub humid agro ecological zone jaetzold et al 2006 and lies at 1 25 s 36 74 e and at 1860 m above sea level rainfall occurs in a bimodal pattern from october to december and march to june and locally referred to as short and long rains respectively 2 2 soil physico chemical properties of the experimental site the soil is classified as a humic nitisol which is well drained dark red to dark reddish brown clay very deep more than 1 8 m with low to moderate inherent soil fertility gachene et al 1997 karuku et al 2012 gitari 2013 gitari et al 2015 iuss working group wrb 2015 before establishing this experiment twelve soil samples were taken as described by pennock and yates 2008 at 0 0 3 m depth and they were composited air dried ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve soil ph soil water ratio of 1 2 5 was measured using a ph meter ryan et al 2001 total n by modified kjeldahl method bremner 1996 and organic carbon by modified walkley and

analysed following procedures provided by rhoades and polemio 1977 flame photometry method was used to analyse k and na while atomic absorption spectrophotometry was used for ca and mg analyses jackson 1967 soil texture was measured using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1979 undisturbed soil samples were also collected in core rings for bulk density determination as described by doran and mielke 1984 saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined following reynolds et al 2002 method the total available water saturation field capacity permanent wilting point and matric potential were estimated using the hydraulic properties calculator saxton and rawls 2006 the soil physico chemical properties of the experimental site are presented in table 1 2 3 experimental design the experiment was laid out using a randomized complete block design with four replications in 4 m x 6 m plots fig 1 treatments consisted of four cropping systems namely pure potato stand var shangi ps and potato intercropped with dolichos lablab purpureus l var uncinatus pd garden pea pisum sativum l var green feast pg and climbing bean phaseolus vulgaris l var kenya tamu pb shangi is the most common potato cultivar in kenya with an early maturity of 3 4 months and an attainable yield of 30 40 t ha 1 gitari et al 2018 the experiment was conducted for four consecutive seasons from the short rains season in 2014 to long rains season in 2016 planting was done manually at the onset of each rainy season with pre sprouted seed tubers planted at a spacing of 0 3 m within rows and 0 9 m between rows at a depth of 0 1 m to give a plant density of 36 400 plants ha 1 legumes were planted between the rows of potato with two seeds per hill spaced at 0 25 m to give a plant density of 88 000 plants ha 1 the seed rates were 1 8 t ha 1 and 20 kg ha 1 for potato and legumes respectively fertilizer application was done twice only on potato at planting with 200 kg ha 1 of npk 17 17 17 fertilizer and 28 days after planting dap with 200 kg ha 1 of calcium ammonium nitrate 27 n fertilizer to supply the crop with 88 kg n ha 1 34 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 34 kg k2o ha 1 potato was sprayed to control blight with ridomil gold mz 68 w g mefenoxam 40 g kg 1 mancozeb 640 g kg 1 alternated with daconil 720 sc chlorothalonil 720 g l 1 four times in a fortnight interval starting at 14 dap dolichos were sprayed with duduthrin 1 7 ec lambda cyhalothrin 17 5 g l 1 alternating with bestox 100 ec alpha cypermethrin 50 g l 1 to control aphids weeding was done by hand hoeing at 28 and 56 dap at 28 dap beans were staked using wooden sticks whereas potatoes were ridged with soil that was drawn gently from up to 0 35 m from each side of the potato rows 2 4 data collection soil moisture and ground cover were measured on a weekly basis starting from the planting date and 7 dap respectively up to 84th dap when potato had attained the physiological tuber maturation the data were taken from three different points per plot and subsequently grouped into four potato development stages based on biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industrie scale bbch hack et al 2001 the stages were stolon development tuber initiation tuber bulking and tuber maturation with bbch of 21 29 41 49 60 73 and 93 95 respectively percentage ground cover pgc was measured using a sighting frame and expressed in percentage as described by elwell and wendelaar 1977 eq 1 1 pgc no of tubes in which vegetation cover is sighted 100 total no of sighted tubes soil moisture content was measured using a digital handheld moisture sensor meter hsm50 omega moisture readings volumetric soil water contents θ v were taken from between and within the crop rows by inserting the sensor to a depth of 0 2 m and then they were converted to mm using eq 2 2 soil moisture content mm θ v sd where θ v is the volumetric soil water content and sd the sampling depth 300 mm the tuber and legume yield were estimated from the central 3 m by 2 m area of each plot harvesting was carried out manually at 85 dap for potato and bean and 120 dap for dolichos potato plants were dehaulmed by cutting at 0 1 m above the ground level and then tubers were dug out using a fork hoe dolichos and beans were harvested when 80 of the pods had turned brown the whole plant was uprooted sun dried for three days and threshed to obtain the grains peas were harvested twice between 65 and 75 dap when the pods were filled but still green the yield tubers and legumes was expressed in t ha 1 then converted into potato equivalent yield pey terms using eq 3 gitari et al 2018 3 pey kg h a 1 py kg h a 1 ly kg h a 1 lp us k g 1 pp us k g 1 where pey potato equivalent yield py potato yield ly legume yield pp market price of potato 0 34 us kg 1 and lp market price of the legume 0 78 0 97 and 1 17 us kg 1 for bean pea and dolichos respectively for economic analysis net income for each cropping system was estimated using eq 4 4 net income gross income total cost of cultivation where total cost of cultivation included the cost of inputs and labour the cost of inputs seed fertilizers fungicides and pesticides was estimated based on the local market prices labour was valued by recording the time taken to carry out various cultural activities land preparation planting weeding earthing up staking and harvesting and paid at the rate of us 4 85 man day 1 of 8 h gross income was taken as the total value of economic yield tubers and grains per cropping systems 2 5 data analysis generalized linear models glm were used to determine the effects of cropping systems on ground cover soil moisture content yield and economic returns the 2 2 3 version of r software r core team 2015 was used for statistical analyses using the package lme4 bates et al 2015 several models were fitted by sequentially adding the explanatory variables into the base model the choice of the best model was based on the lowest akaike information criterion aic means were separated using tukey s honest significant difference at p 0 05 abdi and williams 2010 3 results 3 1 rainfall reference evapotranspiration and temperature during the study period rainfall was above 500 mm in all the seasons except 2014 short rains which had a cumulative amount of 381 mm fig 2 the average seasonal rainfall was 547 mm for short rains and 788 mm for long rains respectively higher rainfall was received during tuber initiation and bulking potato development stages compared to sprout development stolon development and tuber maturation stages similarly reference evapotranspiration was relatively higher especially during bulking potato development stage with an average of 170 mm compared to 40 mm recorded in tuber maturation stage temperature ranged from 20 to 25 c across the seasons with the warmest 23 3 c season being 2015 short rains and the coolest 21 4 c was 2016 long rains 3 2 effect of cropping systems on ground cover and soil moisture content at different potato development stages and seasons there were significant p 0 001 effects of cropping systems cs on ground cover and soil moisture content at different potato development stages pds and seasons s table 2 the effect of these factors on ground cover was in the decreasing order of pds f 974 cs f 237 s f 100 across the potato development stages and seasons ground cover was significantly highest and lowest under pd 56 and ps 39 respectively while intermediate values were recorded in pg 51 and pb 50 cropping systems regardless of the season ground cover at the stolon development stage bbch 21 29 was significantly higher in pg and pb than pd and ps at tuber initiation stage bbch 21 29 ps had significantly less ground cover compared to the intercropping systems whereas at tuber bulking stage bbch 60 73 pd had the highest ground cover although the difference between pd and pb was not significant at the tuber maturation stage bbch 93 95 ps and pg had the lowest percentage ground cover while pb and pd had an intermediate and highest cover respectively interaction of cs by pds and cs by s were significant p 0 001 for soil moisture content smc but there was no three way interaction table 3 the effects of these factors on soil moisture content was in a decreasing order of pds f 893 s f 319 cs f 132 across the potato development stages and seasons smc varied significantly between cropping systems with the highest value in pd 207 mm m 1 lowest in ps 168 mm m 1 and intermediate in pg 183 mm m 1 and pb 179 mm m 1 table 4 depending on potato development stages at stolon development smc was significantly higher in pd than ps but the differences between pd and either pg or pb were not significant at tuber initiation stage smc recorded in pd was 10 13 and 18 higher than in pg pb and ps respectively soil moisture content value recorded in pd at tuber bulking stage was significantly higher than those in ps and pb by 18 and 17 respectively at tuber maturation pg and pb resulted in intermediate smc values which were 25 lower than in pd and 12 higher than in ps 3 3 effect of potato legume intercropping systems on yield and economic returns cropping systems significantly influenced tuber yield potato equivalent yield gross and net income variables and they varied with growing seasons table 4 across the seasons fresh tuber yield was highest in ps 36 t ha 1 and pd 35 t ha 1 and lowest in pb 30 t ha 1 and pg 29 t ha 1 fig 3 a when intercropped with potato dolichos grain yield was lowest compared to the other legumes ranging from 1 8 to 1 9 t ha 1 whereas beans and peas recorded yield ranging from 2 5 to 2 7 t ha 1 and 3 1 to 3 5 t ha 1 respectively fig 3b when all economic yields grain and tubers were expressed in potato equivalent yield terms the highest values were observed in pd and pb 43 and 40 t ha 1 respectively whereas pg and ps had the lowest 38 and 36 t ha 1 respectively table 4 the highest cost of production was incurred under potato legume intercropping systems ranging from us 1550 ha 1 in pg to us 1600 ha 1 in pd compared to us 1450 ha 1 in ps nevertheless these potato legume intercropping systems were the most profitable with net income of us 9174 8496 7884 ha 1 for pd pb and pg respectively compared to ps us 7436 ha 1 this resulted in higher benefit cost ratios in pd and pb 5 7 and 5 4 respectively compared to 5 1 in ps and pg 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cropping systems on ground cover and soil moisture the observed trends of ground cover indicate the potential role of legumes in promoting water conservation in these cropping systems the high ground cover in potato dolichos could be attributed to the ability of dolichos to accumulate more biomass than other legumes for

equivalent yield economic returns benefit cost ratio 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is an important food security crop and a major source of household income for smallholder farmers in kenya the country s area under potato production is 145 967 ha with an annual production of approximately 1 3 tg faostat 2017 nevertheless potato sector in kenya is still underdeveloped and is faced with low productivity of 8 15 t ha 1 against the attainable yield of 30 40 t ha 1 under normal field conditions muthoni et al 2013 gitari et al 2018 the low productivity is mainly ascribed to the erratic rainfall patterns mugo et al 2016 potato is mainly affected due to its superficial and fibrous root system of which about 85 is concentrated in the upper 0 3 m of the soil profile making the crop very susceptible to drought reyes cabrera et al 2016 burke 2017 aliche et al 2018 potato production under rain fed agriculture thus requires a focus on water use efficiency pereira et al 2012 various interventions that have been promoted to increase water use efficiency in rain fed agriculture include increasing the amount of fertilizer applied to crops supplemental irrigation use of plastic film and use of crop residues as mulch kumar et al 2000 essah et al 2012 carli et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 2017 nevertheless the first three interventions are far beyond the financial ability of most resource constrained farmers in kenya on the other hand one challenge of using crop residues as a moisture conservation strategy in potato production is their availability in adequate quantities coupled with their competitive uses as fuel and fodder karuku et al 2014 gachene et al 2015 in addition under tropical conditions organic mulches decompose rapidly besides being susceptible to termite infestation gachene et al 2015 kamau et al 2017 systematic integration of legume crops into potato production systems could be a viable option for addressing these challenges these crops can enhance soil moisture conservation by covering the soil surface which significantly reduces water loss through run off and evaporation ogindo and walker 2005 karuma et al 2011 chepkemoi et al 2014 namoi et al 2014 gitari et al 2017 singh et al 2017 various crops such as maize sulla spinach radish and beans have been intercropped with potato resulting in increased water use efficiency sharaiha and hadidi 2008 rezig et al 2013 fan et al 2016 singh et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however most of these studies focused on potato under non legume intercropping systems sharaiha and hadidi 2008 reported higher water use efficiency under potato bean intercropping under irrigation and singh et al 2016 observed higher potato equivalent yield when potato was intercropped with radish in kenya intercropping of potato with legumes dolichos garden peas and beans has been reported to reduce run off and soil loss compared with the pure stand of potato nyawade 2015 however the author did not monitor the soil moisture dynamics under those intercropping systems lower soil moisture occurring during tuber formation and bulking stages is very critical and can reduce yield more than when it occurs at any other growth stage of the potato steduto et al 2012 to attain the potential potato yield adequate soil moisture should be available in the rooting zone particularly during tuber formation stage reyes cabrera et al 2016 depending on the soil type climatic conditions and growth period potato requires about 500 700 mm of cumulative water in a growing season sood and singh 2003 ierna and mauromicale 2012 given the importance of potato as a food security crop in the most sub saharan farming system there is a need to understand how the integration of different legumes into potato production system affects the tuber yield therefore the objective of this study was to assess ground cover and soil moisture content under potato legume intercropping systems and the effects of these systems on economic yield and returns 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted at kabete field station college of agriculture and veterinary sciences university of nairobi the site falls in the sub humid agro ecological zone jaetzold et al 2006 and lies at 1 25 s 36 74 e and at 1860 m above sea level rainfall occurs in a bimodal pattern from october to december and march to june and locally referred to as short and long rains respectively 2 2 soil physico chemical properties of the experimental site the soil is classified as a humic nitisol which is well drained dark red to dark reddish brown clay very deep more than 1 8 m with low to moderate inherent soil fertility gachene et al 1997 karuku et al 2012 gitari 2013 gitari et al 2015 iuss working group wrb 2015 before establishing this experiment twelve soil samples were taken as described by pennock and yates 2008 at 0 0 3 m depth and they were composited air dried ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve soil ph soil water ratio of 1 2 5 was measured using a ph meter ryan et al 2001 total n by modified kjeldahl method bremner 1996 and organic carbon by modified walkley and black method nelson and sommers 1996 phosphorus was extracted by mehlich 1 method mehlich 1978 then measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer murphy and riley 1962 cation exchange capacity was analysed following procedures provided by rhoades and polemio 1977 flame photometry method was used to analyse k and na while atomic absorption spectrophotometry was used for ca and mg analyses jackson 1967 soil texture was measured using the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1979 undisturbed soil samples were also collected in core rings for bulk density determination as described by doran and mielke 1984 saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined following reynolds et al 2002 method the total available water saturation field capacity permanent wilting point and matric potential were estimated using the hydraulic properties calculator saxton and rawls 2006 the soil physico chemical properties of the experimental site are presented in table 1 2 3 experimental design the experiment was laid out using a randomized complete block design with four replications in 4 m x 6 m plots fig 1 treatments consisted of four cropping systems namely pure potato stand var shangi ps and potato intercropped with dolichos lablab purpureus l var uncinatus pd garden pea pisum sativum l var green feast pg and climbing bean phaseolus vulgaris l var kenya tamu pb shangi is the most common potato cultivar in kenya with an early maturity of 3 4 months and an attainable yield of 30 40 t ha 1 gitari et al 2018 the experiment was conducted for four consecutive seasons from the short rains season in 2014 to long rains season in 2016 planting was done manually at the onset of each rainy season with pre sprouted seed tubers planted at a spacing of 0 3 m within rows and 0 9 m between rows at a depth of 0 1 m to give a plant density of 36 400 plants ha 1 legumes were planted between the rows of potato with two seeds per hill spaced at 0 25 m to give a plant density of 88 000 plants ha 1 the seed rates were 1 8 t ha 1 and 20 kg ha 1 for potato and legumes respectively fertilizer application was done twice only on potato at planting with 200 kg ha 1 of npk 17 17 17 fertilizer and 28 days after planting dap with 200 kg ha 1 of calcium ammonium nitrate 27 n fertilizer to supply the crop with 88 kg n ha 1 34 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 34 kg k2o ha 1 potato was sprayed to control blight with ridomil gold mz 68 w g mefenoxam 40 g kg 1 mancozeb 640 g kg 1 alternated with daconil 720 sc chlorothalonil 720 g l 1 four times in a fortnight interval starting at 14 dap dolichos were sprayed with duduthrin 1 7 ec lambda cyhalothrin 17 5 g l 1 alternating with bestox 100 ec alpha cypermethrin 50 g l 1 to control aphids weeding was done by hand hoeing at 28 and 56 dap at 28 dap beans were staked using wooden sticks whereas potatoes were ridged with soil that was drawn gently from up to 0 35 m from each side of the potato rows 2 4 data collection soil moisture and ground cover were measured on a weekly basis starting from the planting date and 7 dap respectively up to 84th dap when potato had attained the physiological tuber maturation the data were taken from three different points per plot and subsequently grouped into four potato development stages based on biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industrie scale bbch hack et al 2001 the stages were stolon development tuber initiation tuber bulking and tuber maturation with bbch of 21 29 41 49 60 73 and 93 95 respectively percentage ground cover pgc was measured using a sighting frame and expressed in percentage as described by elwell and wendelaar 1977 eq 1 1 pgc no of tubes in which vegetation cover is sighted 100 total no of sighted tubes soil moisture content was measured using a digital handheld moisture sensor meter hsm50 omega moisture readings volumetric soil water contents θ v were taken from between and within the crop rows by inserting the sensor to a depth of 0 2 m and then they were converted to mm using eq 2 2 soil moisture content mm θ v sd where θ v is the volumetric soil water content and sd the sampling depth 300 mm the tuber and legume yield were estimated from the central 3 m by 2 m area of each plot harvesting was carried out manually at 85 dap for potato and bean and 120 dap for dolichos potato plants were dehaulmed by cutting at 0 1 m above the ground level and then tubers were dug out using a fork hoe dolichos and beans were harvested when 80 of the pods had turned brown the whole plant was uprooted sun dried for three days and threshed to obtain the grains peas were harvested twice between 65 and 75 dap when the pods were filled but still green the yield tubers and legumes was expressed in t ha 1 then converted into potato equivalent yield pey terms using eq 3 gitari et al 2018 3 pey kg h a 1 py kg h a 1 ly kg h a 1 lp us k g 1 pp us k g 1 where pey potato equivalent yield py potato yield ly legume yield pp market price of potato 0 34

income gross income total cost of cultivation where total cost of cultivation included the cost of inputs and labour the cost of inputs seed fertilizers fungicides and pesticides was estimated based on the local market prices labour was valued by recording the time taken to carry out various cultural activities land preparation planting weeding earthing up staking and harvesting and paid at the rate of us 4 85 man day 1 of 8 h gross income was taken as the total value of economic yield tubers and grains per cropping systems 2 5 data analysis generalized linear models glm were used to determine the effects of cropping systems on ground cover soil moisture content yield and economic returns the 2 2 3 version of r software r core team 2015 was used for statistical analyses using the package lme4 bates et al 2015 several models were fitted by sequentially adding the explanatory variables into the base model the choice of the best model was based on the lowest akaike information criterion aic means were separated using tukey s honest significant difference at p 0 05 abdi and williams 2010 3 results 3 1 rainfall reference evapotranspiration and temperature during the study period rainfall was above 500 mm in all the seasons except 2014 short rains which had a cumulative amount of 381 mm fig 2 the average seasonal rainfall was 547 mm for short rains and 788 mm for long rains respectively higher rainfall was received during tuber initiation and bulking potato development stages compared to sprout development stolon development and tuber maturation stages similarly reference evapotranspiration was relatively higher especially during bulking potato development stage with an average of 170 mm compared to 40 mm recorded in tuber maturation stage temperature ranged from 20 to 25 c across the seasons with the warmest 23 3 c season being 2015 short rains and the coolest 21 4 c was 2016 long rains 3 2 effect of cropping systems on ground cover and soil moisture

was highest in ps 36 t ha 1 and pd 35 t ha 1 and lowest in pb 30 t ha 1 and pg 29 t ha 1 fig 3 a when intercropped with potato dolichos grain yield was lowest compared to the other legumes ranging from 1 8 to 1 9 t ha 1 whereas beans and peas recorded yield ranging from 2 5 to 2 7 t ha 1 and 3 1 to 3 5 t ha 1 respectively fig 3b when all economic yields grain and tubers were expressed in potato equivalent yield terms the highest values were observed in pd and pb 43 and 40 t ha 1 respectively whereas pg and ps had the lowest 38 and 36 t ha 1 respectively table 4 the highest cost of production was incurred under potato legume intercropping systems ranging from us 1550 ha 1 in pg to us 1600 ha 1 in pd compared to us 1450 ha 1 in ps nevertheless these potato legume intercropping systems were the most profitable with net income of us 9174 8496 7884 ha 1 for pd pb and pg respectively compared to ps us 7436 ha 1 this resulted in higher benefit cost ratios in pd and pb 5 7 and 5 4 respectively compared to 5 1 in ps and pg 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cropping systems on ground cover and soil moisture the observed trends of ground cover indicate the potential role of legumes in promoting water conservation in these cropping systems the high ground cover in potato dolichos could be attributed to the ability of dolichos to accumulate more biomass than other legumes for instance in the 2014 short rains season the amount of rainfall received was 9 below seasonal average and unevenly distributed with october recording the highest rainfall 148 mm of which 76 only occurred in 2 days the crop might have used the available soil water effectively resulting in the high canopy cover and eventually more biomass production nyawade 2015 reported that dolichos usually maintain a high ground cover of up to 40 beyond the physiological maturity period of potato this probably was the reason for the high ground cover especially at early stages of potato development

sensitivity postharvest when it was closely related with ψstem consequently a multiple linear regression equation based on average ψm at a depth of 25 and 50 cm and mean daily air vapor pressure deficit vpd was established to estimate ψstem the estimated ψstem explained 84 of the variance in the measured ψstem hence the equation proposed can be used as a tool to estimate ψstem and for irrigation scheduling based on the relation mds vs ψstem and the observed agronomic response a postharvest threshold value of 1 3 mpa is proposed for deficit irrigation management in prime giant cherry trees keywords maximum daily branch shrinkage midday stem water potential soil matric potential soil volumetric water content stomatal conductance 1 introduction because of the scarcity water conservation in irrigated agriculture is of great importance in the mediterranean basin irrigation scheduling based on soil and plant water status sensors can contribute to increasing water productivity thereby aiding water conservation besides the use of sensors is crucial for precisely scheduling irrigation and to maximize water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture for this quantification of the spatial and temporal variability of the soil and plant water status is essential regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been shown to increase both water productivity and growers profits especially in the case of fruit trees and vines behboudian and mills 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 torrecillas et al 2018 controlled water deficits are applied during phenological stages when trees are relatively tolerant of water stress non critical periods thus minimizing or eliminating any adverse effects on yield and fruit mitchell et al 1984 implementing validated rdi strategies in commercial fields can contribute significantly to water conservation having said that most rdi experiments have been based on applying a percentage of crop evapotranspiration etc however replication of such rdi strategies in commercial fruit tree orchards even of the same variety is limited by the difficulty of achieving a similar soil or plant water status in part this is due to the uncertainties associated with tree canopy architecture the percentage of ground covered by the crop the management of the soil surface and weeds and variability in soil type and depth ortuño et al 2010 for this reason soil plant sensing approaches whereby the soil and plant water status threshold values are imposed experimentally are preferable to et based approaches several soil and plant water indicators have been used to quantify tree water stress levels fernández and cuevas 2010 ferreira 2017 jones 2007 among them midday stem water potential ψstem is accepted worldwide as one of the most stable reliable and accurate plant water status indicators for irrigation scheduling in many tree crops abrisqueta et al 2015 marsal et al 2002 naor and peres 2001 shackel et al 1997 because of its high sensitivity to irrigation regime naor and peres 2001 suggest that ψstem can be used as a reference water stress indicator to compare the performance of other indicators nevertheless measuring ψstem is a destructive and labour intensive method and the equipment used to measure it cannot be integrated into an independent irrigation scheduling process which limits its use puerto et al 2013 hence the estimation of ψstem from other easily automated and available variables such as meteorological soil and plant water variables might be considered of interest apart from midday stem water potential other water stress indicators are often used in irrigated agriculture such as soil volumetric water content θv and soil matric potential ψm and within the field of irrigation research leaf stomatal conductance gs and branch diameter fluctuations mds the measurement of θv ψm and mds is easily automated and several studies have demonstrated the influence of the first two on ψstem and a degree of correlation between ψstem and mds al yahyai 2012 intrigliolo and castel 2007 naor 2004 therefore the use of these water stress indicators could contribute to the estimation of ψstem plant water stress indicators are thought to better integrate the environmental conditions soil water content and evaporative demand to which the plant responds however θv and ψm both soil water deficit indicators are currently the most used in commercial plots as an aid to irrigation decision making navarro hellín et al 2015 2016 this is in part due to the fact of their measurement is easily automated and can be subject to remote control for it any improvement in the estimation of ψstem or even of any indicator concerning irrigation water management would be welcomed by growers in arid and semi arid areas mccutchan and shackel 1992 found a good correlation between gs and ψstem in prune trees leaf stomatal conductance represents water flow through the plant and the plant response to water use although its measurement cannot be automated based on trunk or branch diameter fluctuations the maximum daily shrinkage mds which is the daily difference between maximum and minimum diameter values can be calculated mds has been successfully used in irrigation scheduling in different fruit trees including citrus ortuño et al 2009 peach conejero et al 2011 almond puerto et al 2013 and nectarine de la rosa et al 2013 and in vines producing table grape conesa et al 2016 while this measurement can be automated it needs signal intensity threshold values and reference equations which are highly dependent on variety tree size crop load and other characteristics intrigliolo and castel 2007 continuous measurements of volumetric content or soil water status have long been used for irrigation scheduling abrisqueta et al 2012 mounzer et al 2008 a wide range of sensors based on capacitance and time domain transmission are available which can provide the continuous measurements of θv and ψm in real time moreover they have the advantage of being easily coupled to data transmission systems considering that in the soil plant atmosphere continuum the plant represents an intermediate system located in a water potential gradient between the soil and atmosphere any measurement of plant water status will inevitably depend on the soil and air water status it would therefore be interesting to have an equation that could be used to estimate the plant water status from soil and meteorological variables this could be easily automated while ψstem cannot as regards the crop in question spain is the second largest producer of cherries in europe and the seventh largest producer in the world sweet cherry prunus avium l is an interesting stone fruit highly appreciated by consumers and varieties such as prime giant are of particular interest due to its fruit quality attributes large size bright red colour firmness sweetness and balanced flavour lópez ortega et al 2016 nogueroles pérez 2005 prunus mahaleb sl64 rootstock has traditionally been used in sweet cherry trees in spain since it is well adapted to the rocky and calcareous soils that predominate in the mediterranean area however the roots of this rootstock have a low capacity to explore and root development is concentrated in the irrigated area particularly when the trees grow in arid or semiarid climates and have been provided with drip irrigation since planting bielorai 1982 paltineanu et al 2016 the main objective of this paper was to identify which of the commonly used soil and plant water status indicators is most useful for deficit irrigation scheduling of prime giant sweet cherry trees another aim was to estimate midday stem water potential from meteorological and soil and plant water status variables that can be easily integrated in automated systems to help achieve these objectives the physiological response of prime giant cherry trees subject to full and deficit irrigation is characterised over a two year period and ψstem is represented with respect to different soil and plant water status indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was performed during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons in a commercial orchard located in jumilla murcia spain 38 8 n 1 22 w the experimental plot had an area of 0 5 ha the trial was carried out on fifteen year old mature sweet cherry trees p avium l cv prime giant grafted on sl64 rootstock and early lory and brooks as pollenizer tree spacing was 5 m 3 m and average ground cover was around 55 at the beginning of the experiment the trunk diameter of the vase shaped trees averaged 16 3 0 18 cm the soil is characterized by a sandy loam texture 15 clay 17 5 silt and 67 5 sand is moderately stony with a high organic matter content 6 3 in the surface layer 5 35 cm depth and an acceptable active limestone 2 7 high assimilable phosphorus 108 67 mg kg 1 and adequate exchangeable potassium 0

respectively horticultural practices e g fertilization weed control and pruning were the same for all trees in trial and were carried out by the farm workers full bloom was in april and annual pruning was carried out both years in late august approximately 60 days after harvesting in june the drip irrigation system consisted of a single drip line per tree row and three pressure compensated emitters per tree 4 l h 1 discharge rate the irrigation treatments were initiated each season in march before flowering at the beginning of the dry period and suspended at the end of november the end of the dry period fertilization was applied in the drip irrigation water and followed the principle of re establishing the levels of nutrients taken up by mature trees the fertilization program was the same for all the treatments and regardless of the water applied and consisted of 63 30 107 and 8 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o and cao respectively applied in the drip irrigation water 2 2 irrigation treatments three irrigation treatments were imposed i a control treatment ctl irrigated at 110 of crop evapotranspiration etc to ensure non limiting soil water conditions ii a regulated deficit irrigation treatment rdi irrigated at 100 of etc during preharvest and the first days of flower differentiation 15 20 days after the first harvest and 55 of etc during postharvest a non critical period and iii farmer treatment frm irrigated according to the farmer s normal practice the average etc satisfied by the frm treatment during 2015 2016 periods was 98 but fluctuated between 140 and 115 etc in the preharvest period and between 90 and 50 etc postharvest crop water requirements under drip irrigation etc were calculated using the following equation etc et0 kc kr where et0 is the average reference

according to a completely randomized block design with four replicates each replicate comprised a row of seven adjacent trees sensors were installed in the two central trees per replicate the yield was measured from the five central trees with the other trees serving as guard trees irrigation frequency and timing varied during the season march november from two irrigations per week early in the season to 4 irrigations a day during early mid summer which was equivalent to 4 h per week and 7 h per day respectively in the last case and for the control treatment irrigation was distributed according to the time scheduling 01 00 02 00 h 07 00 09 30 h 13 00 15 00 h 18 00 19 30 h the irrigation at 7 00 h was common to and similar in all the treatments and was when fertirrigation was applied the objective of high frequency irrigation applied during summer was to place the irrigation water where the root system was denser keeping this area wetted and minimizing water losses through deep percolation 2 3 measurements the plant water status was monitored approximately every ten days at 12 00 13 30 h solar time by measuring stem water potential at noon ψstem with a scholander pressure chamber model 3000 soil moisture equipment santa barbara ca according to the methodology proposed by mccutchan and shackel 1992 in 6 trees per treatment equipped with linear variable differential transformer lvdt sensors the mature and healthy leaves selected were from the north quadrant close to the trunk thus avoiding solar exposure they were wrapped in small black polyethylene bags and covered with aluminum foil at least 2 h prior to the measurement the water stress integral wsiψstem mpa day was calculated from the ψstem values may november as in myers 1988 where the maximum ψstem reached was 0 30 mpa likewise stomatal conductance gs was measured at solar midday in four sun exposed leaves per replicate from the outer canopy with a photosynthetic photon flux

from direct sunlight the sensors were installed on aluminum and invar holders to prevent thermal expansion lvdt measurements were performed in differential input configurations the maximum daily branch shrinkage mds was calculated as the daily difference in diameter between the maximum and the minimum mds signal intensity simds was calculated by taking the ratio mdsrdi or frm mdsctl simds is a dimensionless variable where one is equivalent to absence of water stress and values above one indicate irrigation stress levels goldhamer and fereres 2001 simds was calculated for the rdi treatment during 2016 in order to know which threshold level corresponded to the irrigation scheduling applied 55 etc daily branch growth rate bgr was calculated as the difference in diameter between the maximum of two consecutive days goldhamer and fereres 2001 from the measured branch diameters the branch cross sectional area bcsa was calculated similarly at the beginning at harvest and at the end of the growing season trunk diameter td was measured with a tape measure mod pi meter mf612 a the measurements were always taken in the same place a marked location about 0 20 m from the soil surface in the five central trees per replicate trunk cross sectional area tcsa was assumed as circle area and estimated from the trunk perimeter soil volumetric water content θv was obtained with three fdr sensors enviroscan sentek pty ltd adelaide australia per replicate at 20 40 and 70 cm depth located 0 23 m from the emitter and 1 5 m from the trunk under the canopy projection based on these measurements and assuming a linear model between two consecutive depths the soil volumetric water content at 25 and 50 cm depth was calculated the daily minimum value of θv is referenced to field capacity as a percentage of the maximum soil water content available in the soil θvfc likewise the matric potential of soil water ψm was measured in one tree per replicate by means of two thermal compensation capacitive sensors mps 6 decagon devices inc pullman wa 99163 usa at 25 and 50 cm depth and at a distance of 0 23 m from the emitter the mean value of ψm from 11 00 to 14 00 h solar time was calculated branch diameter fluctuations volumetric water content and matric potential measurements were taken every 30 s and the datalogger was programmed to report means every 10 min two replicates per treatment were equipped using a wired platform by one datalogger and two multiplexers campbell scientific logan usa and the other two replicates using a zigbee wireless sensor network wsn widhoc ss fuente álamo spain and configured in a star topology morais et al 2008 data access was by wifi radio link provided by a local internet supplier daily agrometeorological records of air temperature air relative humidity rainfall as well as the crop reference evapotranspiration were provided by a weather station near the experimental orchard owned by siar 2018 integral consulting service in agriculture from the temperature and humidity data the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated according to allen et al 1998 vegetative growth was measured as canopy volume and pruning wood canopy volume and tree shaded area was calculated annually according to hutchison 1978 based on canopy height and diameters across and within rows before pruning the pruning wood of each tree was individually weighed in the field pruning wood data are expressed as dry weight using a transformation formula calculated from aliquots of pruning fresh samples dried to constant weight in a ventilated oven dry big jp selecta barcelona spain pruning wood dry weight kg 0 5618 pruning wood fresh weight kg 0 0393 at harvest june 3rd and 10th in 2015 and 17th and 22nd in 2016 fruits from 5 central trees of each replicate were harvested and weighed the individual yield of each tree was weighed to determine yield per tree similarly at harvest fruits were counted in 5 kg samples in order to calculate the unitary weight of the cherries on 19th may 2015 a hail storm damaged the crop and to quantify the damage suffered dropped fruit per tree were counted and weighed the sensitivity of the water stress indicators studied was calculated according to goldhamer and fereres 2001 and the new approach proposed by de la rosa et al 2014 traditional sensitivity s was calculated according to goldhamer and fereres 2001 s is the result of the division of the signal intensity si by the coefficient of variation cv corrected sensitivity s proposed by de la rosa et al 2014 is calculated by the ratio between si 1 and cv analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the effect of the three different irrigation treatments on the soil and plant indicators as well as to compare the estimation models for each irrigation season using the statistical software packages ibm spss statistic 24 and statgraphics centurion vi tukey s test was used to detect differences between means with a significance level of p 0 05 linear and nonlinear relationships as well as regression analysis between variables were calculated with sigmaplot 12 5 and microsoft excel microsoft windows 3 results 3 1 meteorological variables the weather was classified as typically mediterranean with hot dry summers and mild wet winters both years had similar weather conditions and the dry period was between march and november annual average temperature was 16 c with maximum temperatures of 40 c vpd reached daily mean values in summer of 4 0 and 3 8 kpa in 2015 and 2016 respectively annual rainfall was mainly distributed in spring and autumn the 263 and 280 mm of rain that fell corresponding to 1272 and 1220 mm of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 1 a and c this meant that the dry soil zone or the area that received no water from the drippers most of the inter row area did not receive water during the period of greatest evaporative demand this was also the period in which the water deficit was applied the average annual amount of irrigation water applied was 6981 4156 and 6198 m3 ha 1 for ctl rdi and frm respectively fig 1b and d the meteorological variables measured mean temperature tmean maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin mean relative humidity rhmean maximum relative humidity rhmax minimum relative humidity rhmin evapotranspiration et0 and vapor pressure deficit vpd were related to ψstem table 1 only taking into account the days when there were non limiting soil water conditions ψm 30 kpa in order to ensure the greatest relationship between ψstem and the meteorological variables relative humidity vs ψstem showed an opposite relationship with air temperature vpd and et0 vs ψstem vpd and maximum air temperature were the environmental parameters that best correlated with ψstem r 0 8 and as vpd is a more integrative variable it was chosen to estimate ψstem 3 2 midday stem water potential ψstem showed similar behavior patterns both years of the study with the highest mean values 0 4 mpa at the beginning and the end of the growing seasons fig 2 a and b coinciding with the periods of lowest evaporative demand fig 1 however from late june onwards in both seasons coinciding with the beginning of the water restriction ψstem values decreased as the evaporative demand rose reflecting the progression of the water deficit period in frm and rdi the ψstem values observed for the control trees were around 0 5 mpa during preharvest and 0 7 mpa during postharvest values which indicate that the control trees were not water stressed fig 2a and b before the deficit period the preharvest period hardly any differences in ψstem were detected among treatments the values remaining at a high level around 0 5 mpa indicating a total absence of water stress meanwhile differences between treatments were evident after harvest ψstem values reached a minimum of 0 92 1 45 and 1 32 mpa in 2015 and 1 00 1 56 and 1 21 mpa in 2016 in ctl rdi and frm respectively during midsummer stem water potential was closely associated with soil water content which was particularly clear when the water supply was reduced during postharvest ψstem values from the rdi treatment fell 0 5 mpa in the first 20 days fig 2a 3 3 maximum daily branch shrinkage mds varied from 30 μm in all treatments to around 400 μm in ctl 600 μm in rdi and 750 μm in frm giving mean values of 197 and 180 μm 289 and 244 μm and 258 and 216 μm for ctl rdi and frm in 2015 and 2016 respectively during 2015 and 2016 preharvest mean mds values were similar among treatments fig 2c and d however in 2016 ten days after deficit irrigation was applied in rdi differences in mds increased and the value in rdi trees was 33 higher than in ctl trees when pre and postharvest data were considered together a polynomial relationship was found between ψstem and mds in all treatments not only in 2015 but also in 2016 r2 0 78 this third grade polynomial relationship showed that mds increased as ψstem dropped from 0 5 mpa to a threshold value of around 1 3 mpa fig 2e in our experiment at values below 1 3 mpa ψstem decreases were not directly related to higher mds values a close linear relationship was observed between these two variables during the last preharvest weeks fruit growth period and first postharvest days from may to mid july part of the period when deficit irrigation was being applied doy 125 205 in 2015 and 123 203 in 2016 mds μm 472 69 ψstem mpa 86 21 r2 0 87 fig 2f the percentage of etc satisfied by irrigation in rdi during preharvest early postharvest when flower differentiation takes place and postharvest reflected simds mode values of 1 1 1 0 and 1 6 approximately 3 4 gas exchange stomatal conductance two well differentiated phases could be distinguished in the seasonal evolution of stomatal conductance gs in both years of the study we consider that during preharvest all the treatments showed similar behavior however during postharvest rdi and frm showed a different response to the water applied both giving significantly lower values than ctl for all the measurements in 2016 and almost all in 2015 fig 3 a and b two linear relationships were obtained between gs and ψstem i for the whole vegetative cycle expressed both variables as the difference between rdi and frm tri respect to ctl fig 3c ψstem tri ψstem ctl 0 0025 gs tri gs ctl 0 0326 r2 0 68 and ii when only the summer data were taken into account expressed as ψstem vs gs fig 3d ψstem 0 0026 gs 1 4761 r2 0 80 this last linear relationship could also be interesting because this period corresponds to july and august the time when the water deficit was being applied accompanied by the greatest crop evapotranspiration 3 5 soil volumetric water content during the preharvest period the mean soil volumetric water content expressed as a percentage of field capacity θvfc at 20 and 40 cm depth varied between 93 and 84 for the three treatments and both years these θv percentages correspond to non limiting soil water conditions and agree with the ψstem values of the non water stressed plants fig 2a and b however during postharvest the θvfc mean values in rdi and frm fell to 60 in the first 10 days of deficit irrigation and continued falling while the ctl values were higher than the 70 throughout the season data not shown at 70 cm depth during 2015 and 2016 preharvest θvfc mean values remained at about 75 80 reflecting the absence of a soil water deficit with no significant differences among treatments however during postharvest this trend only continued in ctl while in frm and rdi the θvfc dropped with the application of deficit irrigation and tended to remain stable except when it rained fig 4a and b the variations observed at 70 cm provided information about the fate of the irrigation water and the presence or not of drainage a relationship between θvfc mean value at 20 and 40 cm depth and midday stem water potential was found ψstem 0 00024 θvfc 2 0 0484 θvfc 3 003 r2 0 81 fig 4c as might be expected ψm at 25 and 50 cm and θvfc at 25 and 50 cm showed a good non linear relationship during both 2015 and 2016 ψm 681 2lnθvfc 3078 r2 0 80 which can be taken as confirmation of the reliability of the data obtained from both types of soil sensors fig 4d 3 6 soil matric potential the mean soil matric potential values at 25 and 50 cm depth were in line with the irrigation regimes all the treatments showed mean ψm values above 30 kpa at 25 50 cm during preharvest which reflects non limiting soil water conditions fig 5 a d however differences in ψm between treatments appeared during postharvest rdi and frm reached very low values at both depths and in both years of the study fig 5a d a non linear association between ψm mean values at 25 50 cm depth and ψstem was found ψstem 10 8 ψm 3 10 5 ψm 2 0 0045 ψm 0 4998 r2 0 71 fig 5e this association confirmed as expected that plant water status is related to soil water availability in the root zone and consequently to ψm as already indicated by numerous other authors 3 7 midday stem water potential estimation as the plant responds to soil water availability as well as atmospheric demand ψm and vpd were related to estimate ψstem this relation describes two different situations to obtain an estimated ψstem value which depends on soil water availability and evaporative demand if ψm is lower than 30 kpa there is a limiting soil water condition and the reference line is derived from ψm and vpd while if ψm is higher than 30 kpa ψstem is mainly influenced by the evaporative demand so it can be estimated from vpd the vpd best explained ψstem changes under non water deficit conditions a model consisting of two situations described above was obtained to estimate ψstem from the 2015 data to validate this model ψstem values measured in 2016 were compared to the values estimated by the model estimated ψstem values were able to explain 86 of the variation in the data measured fig 6 similarly 2016 data were used to obtain a similar model which was validated with 2015 ψstem data thus explaining 80 of the data measured in 2015 fig 6 the two regression lines obtained from the models showed no significant differences between them according to anova nor did intercepts p value 0 94 or slopes p value 0 31 r2 0 82 fig 6 as both regression lines were similar both years data were used to obtain a multiple linear regression model for situation 1 eq 1 and a linear regression model for situation 2 eq 2 1 if ψm 30 kpa ψstem estimated 0 3506 0 000642ψm 0 2143vpd r2 0 74 p value 0 01 2 if ψm 30 kpa ψstem estimated 0 1674vpd 0 3197 r2 0 78 p value 0 01 3 8 vegetative growth vegetative growth was measured as canopy volume in midsummer before the annual pruning which was weighed 27th august there were no differences among treatments in canopy volume or tree shaded area in 2015 or 2016 table 2 in contrast there were differences among treatments in pruning weight pruning was performed in such a way that a similar canopy volume was restored to all the trees regardless of the water they received which meant that the pruning weight differed each year of the study and cancelled differences in canopy volume this weight was much higher in 2016 when it differed significantly between the three treatments table 2 an inverse relationship was found between bgr expressed as the sum of the daily percentage of growth and the wsiψstem during postharvest the period when vegetative growth mainly takes place bgr 0 0007 wsiψstem 0 0856 r2 0 73 in the same way branch cross section annual increase expressed as branch cross section relative growth rate bcsgr was also seen to be inversely related to wsiψstem bcsgr 0 0014 wsiψstem 0 2373 r2 0 64 3 9 yield despite the different amounts of water applied no significant differences in fruit yield among treatments were found in 2015 or 2016 the year 2016 was a high cropping year 27 t ha 1 with a level that was almost one and a half times that of 2015 16 5 t ha 1 plus 1 8 t ha 1 as a result of hail damage with the result that fruit unitary weight was higher in 2015 11 1 g than in 2016 8 8 g with no differences among treatments 3 10 sensitivity of the indicators evaluation analysis showed gs to be the plant indicator with the highest signal intensity si in both years of the study followed by mds and ψstem table 3 although ψstem had a lower signal intensity than gs and similar to that of mds its sensitivity values s and s were much higher due to the low coefficient of variation cv obtained soil water deficit indicators showed high si values the si of θvfc data not shown was similar and even slightly lower than the si of the plant indicators but ψm had the highest si of all the studied indicators table 3 soil indicators also had the highest cv thus ψm was the indicator with the highest sensitivity in spite of the high cv 4 discussion seasonal stem water potential was obtained in three irrigation treatments over two consecutive years the three patterns showed a similar evolution with values decreasing as evaporating demand rose however rdi and frm showed a steeper and longer falling slope than ctl especially in rdi once the deficit was applied minimum values in all of them occurring in midsummer fig 2a and b this steep drop could also be a sign that the soil water reservoir was limited to the zone wetted by the dripper which suggests the low capacity of the not wetted zone to mitigate the reduction of water supply during postharvest the deficit period west et al 1970 reported that the roots of the dry zone remain dormant in dry periods and are activated only after rain rdi and frm treatments fell below 1 3 mpa the ψstem threshold obtained from the polynomial relationship between ψstem vs mds on three occasions during postharvest fig 2a and b however these treatments did not exceed the threshold value of 1 5 mpa reported by marsal et al 2010 in sweet cherry var summit consequently rdi and frm plants did not suffer severe water stress and so avoided any effect on the sweet cherry yield and fruit quality the following season according to girona et al 2006 naor and peres 2001 shackel et al 2000 ψstem can be considered as a reference water stress indicator in fruit trees therefore we compared ψstem with other indicators due to its high sensitivity high signal intensity and the low cv value table 3 the need for a comparative assessment of common water stress indicators on the part of researchers technicians and farmers led us to study different correlations of ψstem with gs mds θv and ψm the seasonal evolution of stomatal conductance gs showed good correlation with stem water potential r2 0 68 similar to that reported by marsal 2012 in summit sweet cherry fig 3d stomatal conductance was the plant indicator with highest signal intensity table 3 as reported by de la rosa et al 2014 in early nectarine trees these results were similar to those obtained in apple grapefruit and nectarine by naor 1998 and in plum by mccutchan and shackel 1992 during postharvest differences among treatments appeared as different irrigation treatments were imposed we found no differences in mean preharvest gs values between 2015 and 2016 despite the great difference in fruit load which could mean that gs in sweet cherry var prime giant did not differ with fruit load likewise naor 2001 did not observe any influence of different fruit loads on gs in pear trees contrary to that reported in almond trees by puerto et al 2013 and in apple trees by wünsche et al 2000 in our case the lack of differences in gs between years could be explained by differences in unitary fruit weight 11 1 g in 2015 when total yield was 16 5 t ha 1 and 8 8 g in 2016 when total yield was 27 t ha 1 moreover mean postharvest gs values in 2015 were slightly higher than in 2016 in all treatments which could be due to a 7 greater vpd values in 2016 on the days when measurements were made fig 3a and b thus flore 1985 pointed out in sour cherry a similar stomatal response to vpd variations mds showed a more similar s to gs than to ψstem and ψm however mds was the plant indicator showing the highest correlation with ψstem r2 0 78 moreover once the deficit irrigation was applied mds showed significant differences between treatments ten days before ψstem did so in prime giant mds would allow early water stress detection during the most water sensitive moments such as fruit set and development and flower induction and differentiation when water stress may reduce fruit growth or decrease the following year s harvest this suggests that mds is more useful than other water indicators for detecting slight water deficits during phenological stages when plant water stress should be avoided moreover mds has the advantage that its measures can be automated the data obtained for both years showed that the ψstem and mds relationship changed throughout the growing season fig 2e for example the relationship varied with the physiological phase of the crop and the age of the tree tissues similarly to that reported in pomegranate by intrigliolo et al 2011 and in peach by mirás avalos et al 2016 in our case the best relationship was found during the final fruit growth and early postharvest periods fig 2f intrigliolo et al 2011 reported that changes in the mds and ψstem relationship could be attributed to tissue elasticity changes since it is known that older tissues are less elastic hence as the season progresses mds could lose its sensitivity especially towards the end of the season tyree and jarvis 1982 when data were pooled it was necessary to establish as threshold value the limit below which ψstem and mds are not directly related i e when the slope changes direction inflection point according to our data this limit could be established as 1 3 mpa which corresponded to a maximum branch shrinkage of 500 μm determining the values between which mds is related to ψstem in sweet cherry var prime giant is important in order to set mds irrigation deficit scheduling girón et al 2016 mds values were less stable than ψstem within the same treatment which agrees with the results reported in almond trees fereres and goldhamer 2003 apple naor and cohen 2003 and plum intrigliolo and castel 2006 the cv of mds was almost three times higher than the cv obtained for ψstem these results point to mds as one of the earliest water stress indicators in sweet cherry trees as reported for plum trees intrigliolo and castel 2004 and lemon trees ortuño et al 2004 this rapid stress detection capacity might make mds a useful scheduling tool for avoiding detrimental stress levels in rdi treatments during preharvest the period of fruit development particularly in early varieties such as prime giant however during postharvest it would be less useful than ψstem especially during july and august doy 185 245 in our study despite this simds could also represent an interesting water stress indicator for rdi management depending on the different phenological phases in sweet cherry trees as expected θv showed good relationship with ψstem r2 0 81 fig 4c this polynomial relationship was slightly higher than the correlation reported by livellara et al 2011 in young sweet cherry trees var brooks and indicates that θv not only strongly influences plant water status but is also closely related with it this correlation similar to that the one obtained between ψm and ψstem points to the importance of soil monitoring in irrigation scheduling to prevent or cause soil water deficits and also to obtain threshold values as many authors such as thompson et al 2007 have reported this correlation between ψstem and both soil indicators and between themselves is not univocal since it is slightly different if it is obtained during the soil water absorption or desorption process fredlund and xing 1994 however the sensitivity analysis highlighted θv as the indicator with the lowest sensitivity due to the high noise rather than low signal intensity this may have been related with the difficulty involved in placing the fdr probe in a stony soil compared to an mps 6 sensor whose installation does not require a probe of the parameters analyzed in the sensitivity analysis ψm had the highest signal intensity and sensitivity however in a soil of medium water retention capacity such as ours small decreases in the soil volumetric water content below field capacity cause significant decreases in ψm which become pronounced as the soil water is decreasing for this reason the high coefficient of variation obtained should be taken into account as a disadvantage variability in the ψm readings increased with decreasing ψm values meaning that replications are necessary to obtain a more accurate soil water status representation and to reduce variation naor 2004 irrigation management using ψm sensors is based on the use of recommended threshold ψm values to indicate when irrigation is required shock and wang 2011 but ψm thresholds are influenced by the phenological stage and the evaporative conditions hanson and peters 2000 lou et al 2016 in this respect and on the basis of the good results obtained with ψm high si and s and closely related to ψstem r2 0 71 in soil water deficit conditions ψm 30 kpa the ψm values were used to estimate ψstem the good relationship between the estimated ψstem and the ψstem measured throughout the growing season r2 0 84 can be explained by efficient water movements in the soil and within the tree when evaporative demand increases which under our conditions was mainly due to a hydraulic control phenomenon sdoodee and somjun 2008 ψstem is a very reliable and sensitive measure to determine plant water status the estimation of which would otherwise involve a very laborious process therefore an equation relating ψm measured at midday and daily vpd with ψstem was obtained for trees under soil water limiting conditions ψm 30 kpa this estimation is interesting because both parameters are easily available to growers and the data used are the direct real time measurements not converted as the mds so farmers or technicians who already have soil and meteorological sensors installed in their orchard many more than those who use mds have the possibility of directly estimating ψstem such estimation based on different soil and meteorological variables depend on the crop evaporative demand as well as on the soil water status soil indicators showed a better relation with ψstem figs 4c and 5e than meteorological variables table 1 and made a higher contribution to ψstem estimation in deficit treatments and in the multiple linear regressions with both types of variables used climate and soil this ψstem and ψm relationship showed that ψstem was clearly influenced by ψm meaning that the obtained equation remained stable for longer periods and for different irrigation treatments these results reflected the importance of the soil components as reported by abrisqueta et al 2015 in peach trees and martí et al 2013 in orange trees eqs 1 and 2 can be useful tools for ψstem estimation since this parameter is not totally dependent on environmental indicators stagno et al 2011 thus this study points to the importance of knowing the soil water status when estimating ψstem the goodness of fit of the calculated relations between different indicators and ψstem can be ordered mds θv ψm gs but according to the sensitivity analysis the indicators could be classified as ψm ψstem gs mds θv sensitivity was measured according to goldhamer and fereres 2001 and de la rosa et al 2014 s and s respectively for all the indicators measured s was smaller than s although the order of the indicators did not change ψstem values were more stable with a lower coefficient of variation than ψm soil matric potential values reflected greater fluctuations than stem water potential which matches with the higher si of ψm and the results reported by naor 2004 in plum trees moreover ψstem had greater sensitivity than gs in all treatments and both years of the study and ψstem was twice as sensitive as gs when measured as s and 33 more sensitive when measured as s this is because s is more dependent on the coefficient of variability these results are in line with those of abdelfatah et al 2013 in young sweet cherry trees the variability observed in gs and mds has been reported in other tree species of the genus prunus such as nectarine de la rosa et al 2014 and plum intrigliolo and castel 2004 and it could be explained by the high variability of the measurements made in sun exposed leaves and the fact that branch shrinkage is not only affected by the tree water status but also by other anatomical characteristics ballester et al 2014 the high si and cv obtained for soil indicators compared to plant indicators agree with the results reported in olive trees under rdi by agüero alcaras et al 2016 likewise as castel and buj 1990 reported soil indicators showed the highest cv relationships between vegetative growth measured as branch growth and the water stress integral for both years of the study underline the influence of the irrigation treatments on vegetative growth bgr was lower in frm and rdi than in ctl during the 2016 postharvest period when deficit irrigation was applied likewise rdi pruning wood was statistically lower than ctl it is well known that plant or organ growth is a process that is highly sensitive to water stress hsiao 1973 wsiψstem was similar in 2015 and 2016 since the water applied and meteorological parameters were similar although fruit yield did not differ significantly among irrigation treatments it was observed that sweet cherry unitary weight was influenced by crop load as reported by einhorn et al 2011 although the different treatments had no effect on fruit yield the water supplied in rdi was 40 and 33 lower than in ctl and frm respectively during both years of the study 5 conclusion the results obtained in the search for an overall indicator for use in irrigation management suggest the following order ψstem ψm mds gs θv ψstem was seen to be the most reliable and stable water stress indicator as it clearly detected irrigation changes the main drawback with ψstem is that the measurement process cannot be automated and it provides one off measurements thus we propose a ψstem estimation model based on two easily available parameters vpd and ψm which continuously register soil and atmosphere water status and obtain indirectly information on the plant water status however two situations were distinguished depending on the soil water status if ψm is higher than 30 kpa no stress ψstem can be estimated from vpd alone while if ψm is lower than 30 kpa mild moderate stress ψstem should be calculated using both ψm and vpd in our experiment the estimated ψstem explained 84 of the variation of the measured ψstem the resulting estimation of ψstem could help know the current plant water status during the growing season and act as a useful tool in irrigation decision making mds was the indicator that first detected water stress which makes it useful in conditions when a slight water deficit can affect vegetative and fruit growth and yield an mds vs ψstem regression showed a threshold value of 1 3 mpa so mds as water stress indicator only has a limited range in which it can be used to manage rdi in prime giant

11364,a two year experiment with sweet cherry p avium l cv prime giant trees was carried out to ascertain which of the following commonly used soil and plant water indicators is most effective for deficit irrigation scheduling ψstem midday stem water potential mds maximum daily branch shrinkage gs stomatal conductance θv soil volumetric water content ψm soil matric potential for this soil and plant water relations as well as the physiological and agricultural responses of trees to three different irrigation treatments were evaluated the irrigation treatments imposed were i a control treatment ctl irrigated at 110 of crop evapotranspiration etc throughout the growing season ii a regulated deficit irrigation treatment rdi which met 100 etc at preharvest and during floral differentiation and 55 etc during the postharvest period and iii a treatment based on normal farming practices frm mds was the first indicator to detect water stress while ψm showed the highest sensitivity postharvest when it was closely related with ψstem consequently a multiple linear regression equation based on average ψm at a depth of 25 and 50 cm and mean daily air vapor pressure deficit vpd was established to estimate ψstem the estimated ψstem explained 84 of the variance in the measured ψstem hence the equation proposed can be used as a tool to estimate ψstem and for irrigation scheduling based on the relation mds vs ψstem and the observed agronomic response a postharvest threshold value of 1 3 mpa is proposed for deficit irrigation management in prime giant cherry trees keywords maximum daily branch shrinkage midday stem water potential soil matric potential soil volumetric water content stomatal conductance 1 introduction because of the scarcity water conservation in irrigated agriculture is of great importance in the mediterranean basin irrigation scheduling based on soil and plant water status sensors can contribute to increasing water productivity thereby aiding water conservation besides the use of sensors is crucial for precisely scheduling irrigation and to maximize water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture for this quantification of the spatial and temporal variability of the soil and plant water status is essential regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been shown to increase both water productivity and growers profits especially in the case of fruit trees and vines behboudian and mills 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 torrecillas et al 2018 controlled water deficits are applied during phenological stages when trees are relatively tolerant of water stress non critical periods thus minimizing or eliminating any adverse effects on yield and fruit mitchell et al 1984 implementing validated rdi strategies in commercial fields can contribute significantly to water conservation having said that most rdi experiments have been based on applying a percentage of crop evapotranspiration etc however replication of such rdi strategies in commercial fruit tree orchards even of the same variety is limited by the difficulty of achieving a similar soil or plant water status in part this is due to the uncertainties associated with tree canopy architecture the percentage of ground covered by the crop the management of the soil surface and weeds and variability in soil type and depth ortuño et al 2010 for this reason soil plant sensing approaches whereby the soil and plant water status threshold values are imposed experimentally are preferable to et based approaches several soil and plant water indicators have been used to quantify tree water stress levels fernández and cuevas 2010 ferreira 2017 jones 2007 among them midday stem water potential ψstem is accepted worldwide as one of the most stable reliable and accurate plant water status indicators for irrigation scheduling in many tree crops abrisqueta et al 2015 marsal et al 2002 naor and peres 2001 shackel et al 1997 because of its high sensitivity to irrigation regime naor and peres 2001 suggest that ψstem can be used as a reference water stress indicator to compare the performance of other indicators nevertheless measuring ψstem is a destructive and labour intensive method and the equipment used to measure it cannot be integrated into an independent irrigation scheduling process which limits its use puerto et al 2013 hence the estimation of ψstem from other easily automated and available variables such as meteorological soil and plant water variables might be considered of interest apart from midday stem water potential other water stress indicators are often used in irrigated agriculture such as soil volumetric water content θv and soil matric potential ψm and within the field of irrigation research leaf stomatal conductance gs and branch diameter fluctuations mds the measurement of θv ψm and mds is easily automated and several studies have demonstrated the influence of the first two on ψstem and a degree of correlation between ψstem and mds al yahyai 2012 intrigliolo and castel 2007 naor 2004 therefore the use of these water stress indicators could contribute to the estimation of ψstem plant water stress indicators are thought to better integrate the environmental conditions soil water content and evaporative demand to which the plant responds however θv and ψm both soil water deficit indicators are currently the most used in commercial plots as an aid to irrigation decision making navarro hellín et al 2015 2016 this is in part due to the fact of their measurement is easily automated and can be subject to remote control for it any improvement in the estimation of ψstem or even of any indicator concerning irrigation water management would be welcomed by growers in arid and semi arid areas mccutchan and shackel 1992 found a good correlation between gs and ψstem in prune trees leaf stomatal conductance represents water flow through the plant and the plant response to water use although its measurement cannot be automated based on trunk or branch diameter fluctuations the maximum daily shrinkage mds which is the daily difference between maximum and minimum diameter values can be calculated mds has been successfully used in irrigation scheduling in different fruit trees including citrus ortuño et al 2009 peach conejero et al 2011 almond puerto et al 2013 and nectarine de la rosa et al 2013 and in vines producing table grape conesa et al 2016 while this measurement can be automated it needs signal intensity threshold values and reference equations which are highly dependent on variety tree size crop load and other characteristics intrigliolo and castel 2007 continuous measurements of volumetric content or soil water status have long been used for irrigation scheduling abrisqueta et al 2012 mounzer et al 2008 a wide range of sensors based on capacitance and time domain transmission are available which can provide the continuous measurements of θv and ψm in real time moreover they have the advantage of being easily coupled to data transmission systems considering that in the soil plant atmosphere continuum the plant represents an intermediate system located in a water potential gradient between the soil and atmosphere any measurement of plant water status will inevitably depend on the soil and air water status it would therefore be interesting to have an equation that could be used to estimate the plant water status from soil and meteorological variables this could be easily automated while ψstem cannot as regards the crop in question spain is the second largest producer of cherries in europe and the seventh largest producer in the world sweet cherry prunus avium l is an interesting stone fruit highly appreciated by consumers and varieties such as prime giant are of particular interest due to its fruit quality attributes large size bright red colour firmness sweetness and balanced flavour lópez ortega et al 2016 nogueroles pérez 2005 prunus mahaleb sl64 rootstock has traditionally been used in sweet cherry trees in spain since it is well adapted to the rocky and calcareous soils that predominate in the mediterranean area however the roots of this rootstock have a low capacity to explore and root development is concentrated in the irrigated area particularly when the trees grow in arid or semiarid climates and have been provided with drip irrigation since planting bielorai 1982 paltineanu et al 2016 the main objective of this paper was to identify which of the commonly used soil and plant water status indicators is most useful for deficit irrigation scheduling of prime giant sweet cherry trees another aim was to estimate midday stem water potential from meteorological and soil and plant water status variables that can be easily integrated in automated systems to help achieve these objectives the physiological response of prime giant cherry trees subject to full and deficit irrigation is characterised over a two year period and ψstem is represented with respect to different soil and plant water status indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was performed during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons in a commercial orchard located in jumilla murcia spain 38 8 n 1 22 w the experimental plot had an area of 0 5 ha the trial was carried out on fifteen year old mature sweet cherry trees p avium l cv prime giant grafted on sl64 rootstock and early lory and brooks as pollenizer tree spacing was 5 m 3 m and average ground cover was around 55 at the beginning of the experiment the trunk diameter of the vase shaped trees averaged 16 3 0 18 cm the soil is characterized by a sandy loam texture 15 clay 17 5 silt and 67 5 sand is moderately

respectively horticultural practices e g fertilization weed control and pruning were the same for all trees in trial and were carried out by the farm workers full bloom was in april and annual pruning was carried out both years in late august approximately 60 days after harvesting in june the drip irrigation system consisted of a single drip line per tree row and three pressure compensated emitters per tree 4 l h 1 discharge rate the irrigation treatments were initiated each season in march before flowering at the beginning of the dry period and suspended at the end of november the end of the dry period fertilization was applied in the drip irrigation water and followed the principle of re establishing the levels of nutrients taken up by mature trees the fertilization program was the same for all the treatments and regardless of the water applied and consisted of 63 30 107 and 8 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o and cao respectively applied in the drip irrigation water 2 2 irrigation treatments three irrigation treatments were imposed i a control treatment ctl irrigated at 110 of crop evapotranspiration etc to ensure non limiting soil water conditions ii a regulated deficit irrigation

farmer treatment frm irrigated according to the farmer s normal practice the average etc satisfied by the frm treatment during 2015 2016 periods was 98 but fluctuated between 140 and 115 etc in the preharvest period and between 90 and 50 etc postharvest crop water requirements under drip irrigation etc were calculated using the following equation etc et0 kc kr where et0 is the average reference

according to a completely randomized block design with four replicates each replicate comprised a row of seven adjacent trees sensors were installed in the two central trees per replicate the yield was measured from the five central trees with the other trees serving as guard trees irrigation frequency and timing varied during the season march november from two irrigations per week early in the season to 4 irrigations a day during early mid summer which was equivalent to 4 h per week and 7 h per day respectively in the last case and for the control treatment irrigation was distributed according to the time scheduling 01 00 02 00 h 07 00 09 30 h 13 00 15 00 h 18 00 19 30 h the irrigation at 7 00 h was common to and similar in all the treatments and was when fertirrigation was applied the objective of high frequency irrigation applied during summer was to place the irrigation water where the root system was denser keeping this area wetted and minimizing water losses through deep percolation 2 3 measurements the plant water status was monitored approximately every ten days at 12 00 13 30 h solar time by measuring stem water potential at noon ψstem with a scholander pressure chamber model 3000 soil moisture equipment santa barbara ca according to the methodology proposed by mccutchan and shackel 1992 in 6 trees per treatment equipped with linear variable differential transformer lvdt sensors the mature and healthy leaves selected were from the north quadrant close to the trunk thus avoiding solar exposure they were wrapped in small black polyethylene bags and covered with aluminum foil at least 2 h prior to the measurement the water stress integral wsiψstem mpa day was calculated from the ψstem values may november as in myers 1988 where the maximum ψstem reached was 0 30 mpa likewise stomatal conductance gs was measured at solar midday in four sun exposed leaves per replicate from the outer canopy with a photosynthetic photon flux

from direct sunlight the sensors were installed on aluminum and invar holders to prevent thermal expansion lvdt measurements were performed in differential input configurations the maximum daily branch shrinkage mds was calculated as the daily difference in diameter between the maximum and the minimum mds signal intensity simds was calculated by taking the ratio mdsrdi or frm mdsctl simds is a dimensionless variable where one is equivalent to absence of water stress and values above one indicate irrigation stress levels goldhamer and fereres 2001 simds was calculated for the rdi treatment during 2016 in order to know which threshold level corresponded to the irrigation scheduling applied 55 etc daily branch growth rate bgr was calculated as the difference in diameter between the maximum of two consecutive days goldhamer and fereres 2001 from the measured branch diameters the branch cross sectional area bcsa was calculated similarly at the beginning at harvest and at the end of the growing season trunk diameter td was measured with a tape measure mod pi meter mf612 a the measurements were always taken in the same place a marked location about 0 20 m from the soil surface in the five central trees per replicate trunk cross sectional area tcsa was assumed as circle area and estimated from the trunk perimeter soil volumetric water content θv was obtained with three fdr sensors enviroscan sentek pty ltd adelaide australia per replicate at 20 40 and 70 cm depth located 0 23 m from the emitter and 1 5 m from the trunk under the canopy projection based on these measurements and assuming a linear model between two consecutive depths the soil volumetric water content at 25 and 50 cm depth was calculated the daily minimum value of θv is referenced to field capacity as a percentage of the maximum soil water content available in the soil θvfc likewise the matric potential of soil water ψm was measured in one tree per replicate by means of two thermal compensation capacitive sensors mps 6 decagon devices inc pullman wa 99163 usa at 25 and 50 cm depth and at a distance of 0 23 m from the emitter the mean value of ψm from 11 00 to 14 00 h solar time was calculated branch diameter fluctuations volumetric water content and matric potential measurements were taken every 30 s and the datalogger was programmed to report means every 10 min two replicates per treatment were equipped using a wired platform by one datalogger and two multiplexers campbell scientific logan usa and the other two replicates using a zigbee wireless sensor network

temperature air relative humidity rainfall as well as the crop reference evapotranspiration were provided by a weather station near the experimental orchard owned by siar 2018 integral consulting service in agriculture from the temperature and humidity data the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated according to allen et al 1998 vegetative growth was measured as canopy volume and pruning wood canopy volume and tree shaded area was calculated annually according to hutchison 1978 based on canopy height and diameters across and within rows before pruning the pruning wood of each tree was individually weighed in the field pruning wood data are expressed as dry weight using a transformation formula calculated from aliquots of pruning fresh samples dried to constant weight in a ventilated oven dry big jp selecta barcelona spain pruning wood dry weight kg 0 5618 pruning wood fresh weight kg 0 0393 at harvest june 3rd and 10th in 2015 and 17th and 22nd in 2016 fruits from 5 central trees of each replicate were harvested and weighed the individual yield of each tree was weighed to determine yield per tree similarly at harvest fruits were counted in 5 kg samples in order to calculate the unitary weight of the cherries on 19th may 2015 a hail storm damaged the crop and to quantify the damage suffered dropped fruit per tree were counted and weighed the sensitivity of the water stress indicators studied was calculated according to goldhamer and fereres 2001 and the new approach proposed by de la rosa et al 2014 traditional sensitivity s was calculated according to goldhamer and fereres 2001 s is the result of the division of the signal intensity si by the coefficient of variation cv corrected sensitivity s proposed by de la rosa et al 2014 is calculated by the ratio between si 1 and cv analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the effect of the three different irrigation treatments on the soil and plant indicators as well as to compare the estimation models for each irrigation season using the statistical software packages ibm spss statistic 24 and statgraphics centurion vi tukey s test was used to detect differences between means with a significance level of p 0 05 linear and nonlinear relationships as well as regression analysis between variables were calculated with sigmaplot 12 5 and microsoft excel microsoft windows 3 results 3 1 meteorological variables the weather was classified as typically mediterranean with hot dry summers and mild wet winters both years had similar weather conditions and the dry period was between march and november annual average temperature was 16 c with maximum temperatures of 40 c vpd reached daily mean values in summer of 4 0 and 3 8 kpa in 2015 and 2016 respectively annual rainfall was mainly distributed in spring and autumn the 263 and 280 mm of rain that fell corresponding to 1272 and 1220 mm of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 1 a and c this meant that the dry soil zone or the area that received no water from the drippers most of the inter row area did not receive water during the period of greatest evaporative demand this was also the period in which the water deficit was applied the average annual amount of irrigation water applied was 6981 4156 and 6198 m3 ha 1 for ctl rdi and frm respectively fig 1b and d the meteorological variables measured mean temperature tmean maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin mean relative humidity rhmean maximum relative humidity rhmax minimum relative humidity rhmin evapotranspiration et0 and vapor pressure deficit vpd were related to ψstem table 1 only taking into account the days when there were non limiting soil water conditions ψm 30 kpa in order to ensure the greatest relationship between ψstem and the meteorological variables relative humidity vs ψstem showed an opposite relationship with air temperature vpd and et0 vs ψstem vpd and maximum air temperature were the environmental parameters that best correlated with ψstem r 0 8 and as vpd is a more integrative variable it was chosen to estimate ψstem 3 2 midday stem water potential ψstem showed similar behavior patterns both years of the study with the highest mean values 0 4 mpa at the beginning and the end of the growing seasons fig 2 a and b coinciding with the periods of lowest evaporative demand fig 1 however from late june onwards in both seasons coinciding with the beginning of the water restriction ψstem values decreased as the evaporative demand rose reflecting the progression of the water deficit period in frm and rdi the ψstem values observed for the control trees were around 0 5 mpa during preharvest and 0 7 mpa during postharvest values which indicate that the control trees were not water stressed fig 2a and b before the deficit period the preharvest period hardly any differences in ψstem were detected among treatments the values remaining at a high level around 0 5 mpa indicating a total absence of water stress meanwhile differences between treatments were evident after harvest ψstem values reached a minimum of 0 92 1 45 and 1 32 mpa in 2015 and 1 00 1 56 and 1 21 mpa in 2016 in ctl rdi and frm respectively during midsummer stem water potential was closely associated with soil water content which was particularly clear when the water supply was reduced during postharvest ψstem values from the rdi treatment fell 0 5 mpa in the first 20 days fig 2a 3 3 maximum daily branch shrinkage mds varied from 30 μm in all treatments to around 400 μm in ctl 600 μm in rdi and 750 μm in frm giving mean values of 197 and 180 μm 289 and 244 μm and 258 and 216 μm for ctl rdi and frm in 2015 and 2016 respectively during 2015 and 2016 preharvest mean mds values were similar among treatments fig 2c and d however in 2016 ten days after deficit irrigation was applied in rdi differences in mds increased and the value in rdi trees was 33 higher than in ctl trees when pre and postharvest data were considered together a polynomial relationship was found between ψstem and mds in all treatments not only in 2015 but also in 2016 r2 0 78 this third grade polynomial relationship showed that mds increased as ψstem dropped from 0 5 mpa to a threshold value of around 1 3 mpa fig 2e in our experiment at values below 1 3 mpa ψstem decreases were not directly related to higher mds values a close linear relationship was observed between these two variables during the last preharvest weeks fruit growth period and first postharvest days from may to mid july part of the period when deficit irrigation was being applied doy 125 205 in 2015 and 123 203 in 2016 mds μm 472 69 ψstem mpa 86 21 r2 0 87 fig 2f the percentage of etc satisfied by irrigation in rdi during preharvest early postharvest when flower differentiation takes place and postharvest reflected simds mode values of 1 1 1 0 and 1 6 approximately 3 4 gas exchange stomatal conductance two well differentiated phases could be distinguished in the seasonal evolution of stomatal conductance gs in both years of the study we consider that during preharvest all the treatments showed similar behavior however during postharvest rdi and frm showed a different response to the water applied both giving significantly lower values than ctl for all the measurements in 2016 and almost all in 2015 fig 3 a and b two linear relationships were obtained between gs and ψstem i for the whole vegetative cycle expressed both variables as the difference between rdi and frm tri respect to ctl fig 3c ψstem tri ψstem ctl 0 0025 gs tri gs ctl 0 0326 r2 0 68 and ii when only the summer data were taken into account expressed as ψstem vs gs fig 3d ψstem 0 0026 gs 1 4761 r2 0 80 this last linear relationship could also be interesting because this period corresponds to july and august the time when the water deficit was being applied accompanied by the greatest crop evapotranspiration 3 5 soil volumetric water content during the preharvest period the mean soil volumetric water content expressed as a percentage of field capacity θvfc at 20 and 40 cm depth varied between 93 and 84 for the three treatments and both years these θv percentages correspond to non limiting soil water conditions and agree with the ψstem values of the non water stressed plants fig 2a and b however during postharvest the θvfc mean values in rdi and frm fell to 60 in the first 10 days of deficit irrigation and continued falling while the ctl values were higher than the 70 throughout the season data not shown at 70 cm depth during 2015 and 2016 preharvest θvfc mean values remained at about 75 80 reflecting the absence of a soil water deficit with no significant differences among treatments however during postharvest this trend only continued in ctl while in frm and rdi the θvfc dropped with the application of deficit irrigation and tended to remain stable except when it rained fig 4a and b the variations observed at 70 cm provided information about the fate of the irrigation water and the presence or not of drainage a relationship between θvfc mean value at 20 and 40 cm depth and midday stem water potential was found ψstem 0 00024 θvfc 2 0 0484 θvfc 3 003 r2 0 81 fig 4c as might be expected ψm at 25 and 50 cm and θvfc at 25 and 50 cm showed a good non linear relationship during both 2015 and 2016 ψm 681 2lnθvfc 3078 r2 0 80 which can be taken as confirmation of the reliability of the data obtained from both types of soil sensors fig 4d 3 6 soil matric potential the mean soil matric potential values at 25 and 50 cm depth were in line with the irrigation regimes all the treatments showed mean ψm values above 30 kpa at 25 50 cm during preharvest which reflects non limiting soil water conditions fig 5 a d however differences in ψm between treatments appeared during postharvest rdi and frm reached very low values at both depths and in both years of the study fig 5a d a non linear association between ψm mean values at 25 50 cm depth and ψstem was found ψstem 10 8 ψm 3 10 5 ψm 2 0 0045 ψm 0 4998 r2 0 71 fig 5e this association confirmed as expected that plant water status is related to soil water availability in the root zone and consequently to ψm as already indicated by numerous other authors 3 7 midday stem water potential estimation as the plant responds to soil water availability as well as atmospheric demand ψm and vpd were related to estimate ψstem this relation describes two different situations to obtain an estimated ψstem value which depends on soil water availability and evaporative demand if ψm is lower than 30 kpa there is a limiting soil water condition and the reference line is derived from ψm and vpd while if ψm is higher than 30 kpa ψstem is mainly influenced by the evaporative demand so it can be estimated from vpd the vpd best explained ψstem changes under non water deficit conditions a model consisting of two situations described above was obtained to estimate ψstem from the 2015 data to validate this model ψstem values measured in 2016 were compared to the values estimated by the model estimated ψstem values were able to explain 86 of the variation in the data measured fig 6 similarly 2016 data were used to obtain a similar model which was validated with 2015 ψstem data thus explaining 80 of the data measured in 2015 fig 6 the two regression lines obtained from the models showed no significant differences between them according to anova nor did intercepts p value 0 94 or slopes p value 0 31 r2 0 82 fig 6 as both regression lines were similar both years data were used to obtain a multiple linear regression model for situation 1 eq 1 and a linear regression model for situation 2 eq 2 1 if ψm 30 kpa

volume in midsummer before the annual pruning which was weighed 27th august there were no differences among treatments in canopy volume or tree shaded area in 2015 or 2016 table 2 in contrast there were differences among treatments in pruning weight pruning was performed in such a way that a similar canopy volume was restored to all the trees regardless of the water they received which meant that the pruning weight differed each year of the study and cancelled differences in canopy volume this weight was much higher in 2016 when it differed significantly between the three treatments table 2 an inverse relationship was found between bgr expressed as the sum of the daily percentage of growth and the wsiψstem during postharvest the period when vegetative growth mainly takes place bgr 0 0007 wsiψstem 0 0856 r2 0 73 in the same way branch cross section annual increase expressed as branch cross section relative growth rate bcsgr was also seen to be inversely related to wsiψstem bcsgr 0 0014 wsiψstem 0 2373 r2 0 64 3 9 yield despite the different amounts of water applied no significant differences in fruit yield among treatments were found in 2015 or 2016 the year 2016 was a high cropping year 27 t ha 1 with a level that was almost one and a half times that of 2015 16 5 t ha 1 plus 1 8 t ha 1 as a result of hail damage with the result that fruit unitary weight was higher in 2015 11 1 g than in 2016 8 8 g with no differences among treatments 3 10 sensitivity of the indicators evaluation analysis showed gs to be the plant indicator with the highest signal intensity si in both years of the study followed by mds and ψstem table 3 although ψstem had a lower signal intensity than gs and similar to that of mds its sensitivity values s and s were much higher due to the low coefficient of variation cv obtained soil water deficit indicators showed high si values the si of θvfc data not shown was similar and even slightly lower than the si of the plant indicators but ψm had the highest si of all the studied indicators table 3 soil indicators also had the highest cv thus ψm was the indicator with the highest sensitivity in spite of the high cv 4 discussion seasonal stem water potential was obtained in three irrigation treatments over two consecutive years the three patterns showed a similar evolution with values decreasing as evaporating demand rose however rdi and frm showed a steeper and longer falling slope than ctl especially in rdi once the deficit was applied minimum values in all of them occurring in midsummer fig 2a and b this steep drop could also be a sign that the soil water reservoir was limited to the zone wetted by the dripper which suggests the low capacity of the not wetted zone to mitigate the reduction of water supply during postharvest the deficit period west et al 1970 reported that the roots of the dry zone remain dormant in dry periods and are activated only after rain rdi and frm treatments fell below 1 3 mpa the ψstem threshold obtained from the polynomial relationship between ψstem vs mds on three occasions during postharvest fig 2a and b however these treatments did not exceed the threshold value of 1 5 mpa reported by marsal et al 2010 in sweet cherry var summit consequently rdi and frm plants did not suffer severe water stress and so avoided any effect on the sweet cherry yield and fruit quality the following season according to girona et al 2006 naor and peres 2001 shackel et al 2000 ψstem can be considered as a reference water stress indicator in fruit trees therefore we compared ψstem with other indicators due to its high sensitivity high signal intensity and the low cv value table 3 the need for a comparative assessment of common water stress indicators on the part of researchers technicians and farmers led us to study different correlations of ψstem with gs mds θv and ψm the seasonal evolution of stomatal conductance gs showed good correlation with stem water potential r2 0 68 similar to that reported by marsal 2012 in summit sweet cherry fig 3d stomatal conductance was the plant indicator with highest signal intensity table 3 as reported by de la rosa et al 2014 in early nectarine trees these results were similar to those obtained in apple grapefruit and nectarine by naor 1998 and in plum by mccutchan and shackel 1992 during postharvest differences among treatments appeared as different irrigation treatments were imposed we found no differences in mean preharvest gs values between 2015 and 2016 despite the great difference in fruit load which could mean that gs in sweet cherry var prime giant did not differ with fruit load likewise naor 2001 did not observe any influence of different fruit loads on gs in pear trees contrary to that reported in almond trees by puerto et al 2013 and in apple trees by wünsche et al 2000 in our case the lack of differences in gs between years could be explained by differences in unitary fruit weight 11 1 g in 2015 when total yield was 16 5 t ha 1 and 8 8 g in 2016 when total yield was 27 t ha 1 moreover mean postharvest gs values in 2015 were slightly higher than in 2016 in all treatments which could be due to a 7 greater vpd values in 2016 on the days when measurements were made fig 3a and b thus flore 1985 pointed out in sour cherry a similar stomatal response to vpd variations mds showed a more similar s to gs than to ψstem and ψm however mds was the plant indicator showing the highest correlation with ψstem r2 0 78 moreover once the deficit irrigation was applied mds showed significant differences between treatments ten days before ψstem did so in prime giant mds would allow early water stress detection during the most water sensitive moments such as fruit set and development and flower induction and differentiation when water stress may reduce fruit growth or decrease the following year s harvest this suggests that mds is more useful than other water indicators for detecting slight water deficits during phenological stages when plant water stress should be avoided moreover mds has the advantage that its measures can be automated the data obtained for both years showed that the ψstem and mds relationship changed throughout the growing season fig 2e for example the relationship varied with the physiological phase of the crop and the age of the tree tissues similarly to that reported in pomegranate by intrigliolo et al 2011 and in peach by mirás avalos et al 2016 in our case the best relationship was found during the final fruit growth and early postharvest periods fig 2f intrigliolo et al 2011 reported that changes in the mds and ψstem relationship could be attributed to tissue elasticity changes since it is known that older tissues are less elastic hence as the season progresses mds could lose its sensitivity especially towards the end of the season tyree and jarvis 1982 when data were pooled it was necessary to establish as threshold value the limit below which ψstem and mds are not directly related i e when the slope changes direction inflection point according to our data this limit could be established as 1 3 mpa which corresponded to a maximum branch shrinkage of 500 μm determining the values between which mds is related to ψstem in sweet cherry var prime giant is important in order to set mds irrigation deficit scheduling girón et al 2016 mds values were less stable than ψstem within the same treatment which agrees with the results reported in almond trees fereres and goldhamer 2003 apple naor and cohen 2003 and plum intrigliolo and castel 2006 the cv of mds was almost three times higher than the cv obtained for ψstem these results point to mds as one of the earliest water stress indicators in sweet cherry trees as reported for plum trees intrigliolo and castel 2004 and lemon trees ortuño et al 2004 this rapid stress detection capacity might make mds a useful scheduling tool for avoiding detrimental stress levels in rdi treatments during preharvest the period of fruit development particularly in early varieties such as prime giant however during postharvest it would be less useful than ψstem especially during july and august doy 185 245 in our study despite this simds could also represent an interesting water stress indicator for rdi management depending on the different phenological phases in sweet cherry trees as expected θv showed good relationship with ψstem r2 0 81 fig 4c this polynomial relationship was slightly higher than the correlation reported by livellara et al 2011 in young sweet cherry trees var brooks and indicates that θv not only strongly influences plant water status but is also closely related with it this correlation similar to that the one obtained between ψm and ψstem points to the importance of soil monitoring in irrigation scheduling to prevent or cause soil water deficits and also to obtain threshold values as many authors such as thompson et al 2007 have reported this correlation between ψstem and both soil indicators and between themselves is not univocal since it is slightly different if it is obtained during the soil water absorption or desorption process fredlund and xing 1994 however the sensitivity analysis highlighted θv as the indicator with the lowest sensitivity due to the high noise rather than low signal intensity this may have been related with the difficulty involved in placing the fdr probe in a stony soil compared to an mps 6 sensor whose installation does not require a probe of the parameters analyzed in the sensitivity analysis ψm had the highest signal intensity and sensitivity however in a soil of medium water retention capacity such as ours small decreases in the soil volumetric water content below field capacity cause significant decreases in ψm which become pronounced as the soil water is decreasing for this reason the high coefficient of variation obtained should be taken into account as a disadvantage variability in the ψm readings increased with decreasing ψm values meaning that replications are necessary to obtain a more accurate soil water status representation and to reduce variation naor 2004 irrigation management using ψm sensors is based on the use of recommended threshold ψm values to indicate when irrigation is required shock and wang 2011 but ψm thresholds are influenced by the phenological stage and the evaporative conditions hanson and peters 2000 lou et al 2016 in this respect and on the basis of the good results obtained with ψm high si and s and closely related to ψstem r2 0 71 in soil water deficit conditions ψm 30 kpa the ψm values were used to estimate ψstem the good relationship between the estimated ψstem and the ψstem measured throughout the growing season r2 0 84 can be explained by efficient water movements in the soil and within the tree when evaporative demand increases which under our conditions was mainly due to a hydraulic control phenomenon sdoodee and somjun 2008 ψstem is a very reliable and sensitive measure to determine plant water status the estimation of which would otherwise involve a very laborious process therefore an equation relating ψm measured at midday and daily vpd with ψstem was obtained for trees under soil water limiting conditions ψm 30 kpa this estimation is interesting because both parameters are easily available to growers and the data used are the direct real time measurements not converted as the mds so farmers or technicians who already have soil and meteorological sensors installed in their orchard many more than those who use mds have the possibility of directly estimating ψstem such estimation based on different soil and meteorological variables depend on the crop evaporative demand as well as on the soil water status soil indicators showed a better relation with ψstem figs 4c and 5e than meteorological variables table 1 and made a higher contribution to ψstem estimation in deficit treatments and in the multiple linear regressions with both types of variables used climate and soil this ψstem and ψm relationship showed that ψstem was clearly influenced by ψm meaning that the obtained equation remained stable for longer periods and for different irrigation treatments these results reflected the importance of the soil components as reported by abrisqueta et al 2015 in peach trees and martí et al 2013 in orange trees eqs 1 and 2 can be useful tools for ψstem estimation since this parameter is not totally dependent on environmental indicators stagno et al 2011 thus this study points to the importance of knowing the soil water status when estimating ψstem the goodness of fit of the calculated relations between different indicators and ψstem can be ordered mds θv ψm gs but according to the sensitivity analysis the indicators could be classified as ψm ψstem gs mds θv sensitivity was measured according to goldhamer and fereres 2001 and de la rosa et al 2014 s and s respectively for all the indicators measured s was smaller than s although the order of the indicators did not change ψstem values were more stable with a lower coefficient of variation than ψm soil matric potential values reflected greater fluctuations than stem water potential which matches with the higher si of ψm and the results reported by naor 2004 in plum trees moreover ψstem had greater sensitivity than gs in all treatments and both years of the study and ψstem was twice as sensitive as gs when measured as s and 33 more sensitive when measured as s this is because s is more dependent on the coefficient of variability these results are in line with those of abdelfatah et al 2013 in young sweet cherry trees the variability observed in gs and mds has been reported in other tree species of the genus prunus such as nectarine de la rosa et al 2014 and plum intrigliolo and castel 2004 and it could be explained by the high variability of the measurements made in sun exposed leaves and the fact that branch shrinkage is not only affected by the tree water status but also by other anatomical characteristics ballester et al 2014 the high si and cv obtained for soil indicators compared to plant indicators agree with the results reported in olive trees under rdi by agüero alcaras et al 2016 likewise as castel and buj 1990 reported soil indicators showed the highest cv relationships between vegetative growth measured as branch growth and the water stress integral for both years of the study underline the influence of the irrigation treatments on vegetative growth bgr was lower in frm and rdi than in ctl during the 2016 postharvest period when deficit irrigation was applied likewise rdi pruning wood was statistically lower than ctl it is well known that plant or organ growth is a process that is highly sensitive to water stress hsiao 1973 wsiψstem was similar in 2015 and 2016 since the water applied and meteorological parameters were similar although fruit yield did not differ significantly among irrigation treatments it was observed that sweet cherry unitary weight was influenced by crop load as reported by einhorn et al 2011 although the different treatments had no effect on fruit yield the water supplied in rdi was 40 and 33 lower than in ctl and frm respectively during both years of the study 5 conclusion the results obtained in the search for an overall indicator for use in irrigation management suggest the following order ψstem ψm mds gs θv ψstem was seen to be the most reliable and stable water stress indicator as it clearly detected irrigation changes the main drawback with ψstem is that the measurement process cannot be automated and it provides one off measurements thus we propose a ψstem estimation model based on two easily available parameters vpd and ψm which continuously register soil and atmosphere water status and obtain indirectly information on the plant water status however two situations were distinguished depending on the soil water status if ψm is higher than 30 kpa no stress ψstem can be estimated from vpd alone while if ψm is lower than 30 kpa mild moderate stress ψstem should be calculated using both ψm and vpd in our experiment the estimated ψstem explained 84 of the variation of the measured ψstem the resulting estimation of ψstem could help know the current plant water status during the growing season and act as a useful tool in irrigation decision making mds was the indicator that first detected water stress which makes it useful in conditions when a slight water deficit can affect vegetative and fruit growth and yield an mds vs ψstem regression showed a threshold value of 1 3 mpa so mds as water stress indicator only has a limited range in which it can be used to manage rdi in prime giant
