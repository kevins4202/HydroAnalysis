3830,flash droughts are regional phenomena that can manifest in large areas with rapid intensification for a period of time few studies have considered the spatial pathways of flash droughts or their drought period this study uses the five criteria based on the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr method to identify flash droughts and when a sesr value recovers to the 20th percentile the flash drought is considered to terminate to define spatially continuous flash droughts accurately the usual order of first calculating drought patches and then identifying flash droughts is reversed to first identify flash droughts on the grid and then determine flash drought patches in addition this study tracks the spatial paths of flash droughts via centroid transfers of flash drought patches using mod16 data the methodology is evaluated by analyzing the regional characteristics of flash droughts in the huaibei plain of china from 2001 to 2019 the flash droughts in this region most frequently tracked in the northeast and west the average flash drought duration was 31 days of which the rapid intensification period was 18 days and drought period was 14 days flash drought events in this region mostly occurred in may august and october and east to west transition and non transitions which accounted for 44 and 22 respectively were the main spatial track paths only 26 of flash drought events transitioned to long term drought events this study expands our knowledge of the evolution process of flash droughts to space time dimensions which is essential for flash droughts early warning and agricultural water management keywords agricultural drought spatio temporal drought analysis standardized evaporative stress ratio 1 introduction recent climate changes not only increase the occurrence of global and regional droughts since the middle of the 20th century nicholls 2004 noah et al 2015 but also impact drought characteristics dai 2013 huang et al 2016 sheffield and wood 2008 trenberth et al 2014 wang et al 2016 recently a new type of rapidly evolving drought termed as a flash drought has aroused considerable attention due to its devastating impacts basara et al 2014 chen et al 2019 christian et al 2020 liu et al 2020b yuan et al 2019 a flash drought is a rapidly intensifying water deficit process accompanied by a persistent shortage of precipitation anomalously warm surface temperatures low humidity strong winds and abundant sunshine in a time period ranging from a few weeks to months basara et al 2019 liu et al 2020a mo and lettenmaier 2016 a flash drought differs from a conventional drought which is a creeping phenomenon that can last for several months or years sheffield et al 2012 xia et al 2014 yuan et al 2017 the main characteristics of flash droughts are rapid development short prediction period strong intensity and destructive impact otkin et al 2018 for example during the summer of 2012 regions in the central united states experienced a rapid increase in drought conditions in less than two months with magnitudes increased by category four or five on the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 the drought resulted in excess of 30 billion dollars lost jin et al 2019 likewise the flash drought event across the northern united states in 2017 was associated with four category increases in drought severity over a 2 month period due to elevated surface temperature and exceptionally dry weather during the spring and early summer this particular flash drought cost the nation at least 26 billion dollars otkin et al 2018 a flash drought in the summer of 2013 occurred in 13 provinces in southern china in less than a month with more than 2 million hectares of crops damaged yuan et al 2015 these events demonstrate that extreme drought conditions can develop rapidly and have large agricultural and economic impacts via desiccation of soil moisture and deterioration of vegetation health therefore a flash drought is also a rapidly evolving agricultural drought when it occurs in the growing season which may lead to crop failure wang and yuan 2018 otkin et al 2021 the term flash drought was first coined by svoboda et al 2002 to describe a type of rapidly intensifying drought subsequently several flash drought definitions have been proposed mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 used pentads 5 day to define flash droughts based on the variation of temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture this definition focused on the short duration however otkin et al 2018 argued that this definition could not fully identify flash droughts because it did not include changes in soil moisture with time or a dry threshold they suggested that rather than focus on a short duration the definition of flash droughts should mainly focus on the rapid rate of intensification to distinguish them from slowly developing droughts several studies identified flash droughts based on an unusually rapid rate of intensification ford et al 2015 koster et al 2019 and liu et al 2020a identified a flash drought when the pentad average soil moisture declined from above the 40th percentile to below the 20th percentile in 4 pentads or less osman et al 2021 compared the one pentad average soil moisture and a period of at least four pentads average soil moisture to identify a flash drought furthermore yuan et al 2019 suggested that flash drought events encompassed processes of onset and recovery they thought that a water deficit condition should persist long enough to have significant impacts on the ecosystem or the society therefore they developed an improved definition that included the recovery stage and captured both rapid intensification and drought conditions otkin et al 2021 also suggested that in addition to the rapid intensification component the actual drought severity during or after the rapid intensification period was critical and should be considered they developed a new index that depicted both the rapid rate of intensification of flash droughts and the resultant drought severity flash drought events were also evaluated by evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet anomalies otkin et al 2013 and nguyen et al 2019 examined flash droughts via the satellite derived evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2007 and showed that temporal changes in the esi provided early warnings of flash droughts more recently christian et al 2019b proposed a consistent statistical methodology for explicitly characterizing flash droughts on the basis of the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr this approach used four criteria to identify flash droughts criteria 1 and 2 were based on a minimum length 30 days for flash drought development and on a drought threshold 20th percentile for the final sesr to emphasize the drought impacts on the environment while criteria 3 and 4 based on the temporal changes of sesr were used to describe the rapid rate of drought intensification there are some other identifications based on the evaporative demand hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 pendergrass et al 2020 water balance noguera et al 2020 or the usdm chen et al 2019 pendergrass et al 2020 though there are many definitions to describe the rapid intensification rate of a flash drought onset at a fixed grid or regional average scale very few definitions have considered the spatial pathway of a flash drought as well as the recovery stage because flash droughts are regional phenomena that can cover large areas for a period of time the rapid intensification and the spatial extent are two equally important features tracking flash droughts in both space and time is fundamental to enriching our knowledge of flash drought development and tracking can guide early warning and risk assessment recently li et al 2020 introduced a framework based on the intensification rate of the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi vicente serrano et al 2010 and spatial propagation to track flash droughts in space and time in this framework the grids under drought conditions were first identified and then drought patches were selected afterwards the flash drought events were defined by the change rate of the cumulative sedi of each drought patch this approach could include events when the cumulative sedi was suddenly decreased attributed by increased light drought areas rather than by a rapid intensity of drought conditions an event just with rapid spatial propagation without intensification will not be considered as a flash drought in this study because it may not have any significant impacts on the ecosystem or the society therefore the method proposed by li et al 2020 may overestimate flash drought frequency here we propose a method that identifies flash droughts in time series based on the sesr and then uses a simple clustering algorithm to select flash drought patches in space finally the spatial track paths are described by the centroids transfer of flash drought patches the sesr is a comprehensive index which not only represents meteorological information like temperature and water vapor pressure difference but also responds to crop and surface moisture deficit conditions osman et al 2021 meanwhile a definition based on the sesr has strong criteria that limit flash drought identification to rapid drought development moreover both the rapid intensification and actual drought impact should be considered when assessing flash drought characteristics otkin et al 2021 it is valuable to consider the drought period after the rapid intensification therefore this definition is expanded upon by first considering the drought period following the rapid intensification period and then using it to identify flash drought events on each grid in time series the purpose of this study is to define a flash drought event with an onset location a pathway over time and an end location moreover based on this expanded definition the meteorological conditions associated with the rapid intensification and drought period of flash droughts are investigated in a humid and semi humid region the huaibei plain china this method can be used to track temporal evolution and spatial extent of flash droughts which are essential to build an early warning system 2 material and methods 2 1 spatio temporal identification methodology of flash droughts 2 1 1 flash drought identification in time series the flash drought identification approach used in this study relies on the sesr basara et al 2019 christian et al 2019b the daily et and pet are used to calculate the daily evaporative stress ratio esr then the mean and standard deviation of the esr are used to compute the sesr at each grid point 1 sesr ijp esr ijp esr ijp σ esr ijp where sesrijp henceforth referred to as sesr is the z score of esr at a specific grid point i j for a specific time step p esr ijp is the mean esr at a specific grid point i j for a time step p for all years available in the gridded dataset and σ esr ijp is the standard deviation of esr for a specific time step p and a grid point i j for all years available in the gridded dataset rapid intensification a critical characteristic of flash droughts is derived by calculating temporal changes in sesr values the standardized change in sesr values is given as 2 δ s e s r ijp z δ s e s r ijp δ s e s r ipj σ δ s e s r ijp where δ s e s r ijp z henceforth referred to as δ s e s r is the z score of the change in sesr at a specific grid point i j for a specific time step p δ s e s r ijp is the mean change in sesr values at a specific grid point i j for a time step p for all years available in the gridded dataset and σ δ s e s r ijp is the standard deviation of the change in sesr for a specific time step p and a grid point i j for all years available in the gridded dataset the flash drought identification should account for both its rapid intensification i e the flash and the actual drought conditions drought conditions must persist for a period of time otkin et al 2018 christian et al 2019b used four criteria involving sesr to capture these two characteristics the first two criteria focus on the impacts of flash droughts while the latter two criteria emphasize the rapid rate of drought intensification the latter two criteria are used to identify rapid intensification period in this study the drought period following the intensification period is also an integral phase for a flash drought event otkin et al 2018 otkin et al 2021 consequently in this study a total of five criteria are used to define a complete flash drought process a pentad is often used as a time step to identify flash droughts but the time resolution of the data selected in this paper is 8 days so here the time step is set as 8 days the threshold percentiles in criterion 1 3 are the same as those used by christian et al 2019b regarding criterion 4 otkin et al 2018 states that when the drought index falls below the 20th percentile the event can be considered as a drought the whole flash drought process minimum length of 24 days for criterion 5 is selected based on the reported length of flash droughts in china yuan et al 2019 and the irrigation practices in which irrigation is carried out for ten consecutive drought days in the study area the criteria are listed as 1 a minimum sesr value during a flash drought event must be less than the 20th percentile value 2 a δ s e s r value between individual time steps must be at or below the 40th percentile with no more than one δ s e s r value above the 40th percentile following a δ s e s r value below the 40th percentile 3 the mean change in sesr during the entire length of the flash drought must be less than the 25th percentile 4 if a sesr value increases above the 20th percentile the drought terminates 5 a flash drought should last for at least 24 days three time steps an illustration of the five flash drought identifying criteria is shown in fig 1 based on the earlier identification criteria this flash drought event started on june 24 point f1 in fig 1 with a δ s e s r at the 15th percentile and ended on july 28 point f2 in fig 1 with a δ s e s r at the 58th percentile which violated criterion 2 yellow shaded area in fig 1 the sesr value was still below the 20th percentile after point f2 which meant the drought condition was still serious thus f2 was actually the final point of the rapid intensification period not the end of the flash drought event the new definition considered the drought period green shaded area in fig 1 following the rapid intensification period and suggested that a flash drought event ended when the declined sesr value surpassed the 20th percentile again identified as f3 in fig 1 therefore the total duration for this flash drought event was 48 days which satisfies criterion 5 2 1 2 spatial tracking of flash droughts a generalized flowchart of the flash drought identification process is presented in fig 2 the general procedure of spatial tracking of flash droughts can be divided into four steps as follow step1 flash drought identification occurs at each grid the five criteria proposed above are used to identify flash droughts in time series at each grid when a grid is identified to be in a flash drought event the value of 1 is recorded in this grid otherwise the grid value is set equal to 0 step 2 flash drought patches are computed the marked binary grids are then classified into drought patches by means of the contiguous drought area cda analysis corzo perez et al 2011 diaz et al 2020 in this approach a two scan algorithm is applied the first run is performed to connect the given grid with its 8 neighbors and assign a provisional label to the contiguous grids assignments are made as follows if the grid of the actual position is equal to 1 the labeled grid is searched in the 3 3 neighborhood around this grid if there is no label between the neighbors assign a new label number in this grid if only a neighbor has a label then this label number is assigned in this actual grid if there is more than one label between the neighborhoods assign the lowest one in the grid and record the equivalence label number in the table afterwards a second scan is carried out to relabel the linked labels recorded in the equivalence table as a unique label moreover an area threshold is defined with a minimum area required to have a spatial event according to earlier studies the area of drought patches is larger than 1 6 of the region of interest xu et al 2015 cda analysis is used in each time step over the whole grid step 3 flash drought centroid localization after identification of the flash drought patches its centroid is calculated in each time step then the flash drought track paths during each event are described by shifts in the centroid step 4 flash drought characteristics calculations thus far spatial temporal flash drought events have been identified the continuous drought patches in the time series constitute a flash drought event finally three variables are used to describe characteristics of each event duration is defined as the consecutive days of drought patches in time series the severity of a flash drought event is defined as the total sesr value within a drought patch in flash drought duration drought area is the area affected by a flash drought event 2 2 case study area and data to evaluate the methodology data from the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 were used in a humid and semi humid region of china the huaibei plain is situated in the middle and lower reaches of the huai river of northern anhui province china fig 3 a b one of the most important grain production areas it has a total area of 37 420 km2 between 32 25 to 34 35 n and 114 55 to 118 10 e it has a transitional zone of northern subtropical and warm temperate climate where the east asian summer monsoon interacts with the mid latitude westerly winds thus it is highly susceptible to natural disasters wang et al 2017 the climate parameters in this area have an obvious north south distribution fig 3 c f affected by monsoon precipitation decreases from south to north the maximum annual precipitation is 986 mm however controlled by the upper northwest circulation and the pacific subtropical high the annual distribution of precipitation in this region is uneven with 60 occurring as rainstorms from june to september fig 3 h with frequent droughts and floods guo 2001 yang et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the climate in the huaibei plain is warm and humid in summer and the et increases rapidly with the high temperature qiao et al 2000 leading to decreasing soil moisture and resultant flash droughts wang et al 2016 while the other seasons have low precipitation and dry overlying air fig 3 h such dryness may promote high et and cause a flash drought koster et al 2019 moreover the huaibei plain is a shallow groundwater region with an annual average 2 0 m water table depth the contribution of groundwater to the root zone provides water for crop growth leading to large et values and creating a favorable condition for flash droughts gou et al 2020 the main soil type in huaibei plain is lime concretion black soil that is rich in clay minerals montmorillonite liu et al 2017 due to its characteristic shrinkage and swelling the soil cracks easily when the water content is low and the soil pores shrink when it rains wei et al 2018 this soil type can intensify drought events consequently it is of significance to investigate how flash droughts have changed in this area to reveal the characteristics of flash droughts in the north south climate transition zone in particular since the spatial identification of flash droughts will be affected by the shape of the study area we expanded the flash drought identification range to the rectangular box composed by the longitude span 114 30 to 118 30 e and latitude span 32 to 35 n of the huaibei plain but only the flash droughts in the huaibei plain are analyzed the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 is part of the nasa eos project which uses satellite remote sensing data to estimate global terrestrial evapotranspiration from land surfaces the mod16 products include 8 day monthly and annual et latent heat flux le potential et pet and potential le ple produced at 1 km and 500 m pixel resolutions this dataset has been validated in global areas under various climatic and land use land cover conditions yang et al 2015 verified mod16 in the huai river basin and found that the magnitude and spatial distribution of mod16 are reasonable therefore the mod16a2 version 6 dataset which can be downloaded from the website https lpdaac usgs gov products mod16a2v006 with 8 day and 500 m pixel resolution from 2001 to 2019 was used in this paper modis reprojection tool mrt and arcmap software tools were used to handle and process the mod16 dataset furthermore to evaluate the meteorological conditions associated with flash droughts daily meteorological data from 2001 to 2019 including precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax relative humidity rh and wind speed win were collected from 36 meteorological stations in and around the region fig 3 these datasets were provided by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn a kriging method was used to interpolate the station data to provide spatial data with 500 m pixel resolution the 8 day accumulated precipitation and average tmax rh and win were calculated to match the time resolution of mod16 the anomaly of tmax rh and win are calculated as 3 a n o m l y t x y x x where xy is actual 8 day average meteorological factor tmax rh and win in t time steps for y year x is mean 8 day average meteorological factor in t time steps for many years anomlyt is the anomly in t time steps for y year notably flash drought identification was performed only during the growing season april to november given the potential damage of flash droughts to crops christian et al 2019a 3 results 3 1 frequency and duration of intensification period and drought period of flash droughts based on the mod16 et and pet data and the flash drought identification methodology described above all of the flash drought events and their characteristics in the huaibei plain during the growing seasons from 2001 to 2019 are listed in table 1 during these 19 growing seasons 38 flash drought events occurred in the huaibei plain the year 2006 had the most flash drought events when four drought events occurred in different regions of the huaibei plain there were three flash drought events per year in different regions of the huaibei plain during growing seasons in 2009 2012 2017 and 2018 except for 2003 2004 2005 2016 and 2019 which each had one flash drought event there were two flash droughts in every other years though there were a large number of flash drought events in the huaibei plain the areas affected by these events were relatively small eight flash droughts affected areas larger than 50 of the study region the most serious flash drought event occurred from august to october in 2001 persisting for 80 days with an affected area of 60 of the region and the flash droughts with largest affected areas 91 occurred from august to october in 2007 persisting for 56 days most of the flash drought events lasted for about 24 days showing a rapid intensification toward drought and only a few events persisted for more than 48 days fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of frequency and average duration of the rapid intensification period and drought period for flash droughts of each grid in the huaibei plain during growing seasons april to november between 2001 and 2019 only 0 02 of the region of the huaibei plain experienced more than 30 flash drought events in 19 years these areas are mainly located in the northeast sections of the huaibei plain fig 4 a and the region with the most flash droughts experienced 34 events in 19 years during the growing seasons the region that experienced more than 19 events in 19 years accounted for 40 3 of the study area these regions are located in the west and northeast part of the huaibei plain about 60 of the huaibei plain had less than 19 flash drought events which means that more than half of the area in this region had less than one per year these areas were mainly located in the southern and northwest regions the areas with less than 10 flash droughts in 19 years only accounted for about 1 of the huaibei plain and the area with the least number of flash drought events had only 6 events in 19 years in general the huaibei plain experienced an average of 18 flash drought events in 19 years during the growing seasons of which 15 to 21 events accounted for 74 of the total area the frequency of flash droughts in the northern part was higher than that in the southern part notably the annual average precipitation in the south was more than that in the north fig 3 c and the average annual temperature in the south was higher than that in the north fig 3 d the northeast part of the huaibei plain had the least precipitation and the lowest temperature while it had the most flash droughts during the growing seasons another area with a high frequency of flash droughts was the western part of the huaibei plain this area had more precipitation and higher temperature meanwhile the 8 day average maximum temperature also changed the most fig 3 g consequently regions with little precipitation and regions with large precipitation high temperature and large changes in the day maximum temperature were more prone to flash drought events although the northwest and southern regions experienced fewer flash drought events the durations in these regions were longer fig 4 the longest average intensification period duration was 28 days and the average following drought period lasted for 13 days the longest average drought period duration was 31 days which was 3 days longer than longest average intensification duration and the corresponding average intensification period duration was 15 days in contrast the western and northeast regions experienced more flash drought events with a shorter duration the fastest average rapid intensification duration was 11 days followed by a 20 day drought period the shortest average drought period duration was only 8 days which was 3 days less than fastest average rapid intensification duration and the corresponding average intensification period duration was 15 days the average duration of rapid intensification period of the huaibei plain was 18 days and the rapid intensification duration with the largest area was 16 days an intensification period average duration of 85 of the huaibei plain was between 15 and 19 days meanwhile the average duration of drought period of the huaibei plain was 14 days and the drought period duration with the largest area was 12 days about 87 of the huaibei plain had a average drought period lasting 11 to 16 days therefore the average duration of two periods of flash droughts in the huaibei plain was 32 days 3 2 tracking path of flash droughts the centroids of the largest drought patches located within the huaibei plain in each time step are presented in fig 5 the spatial flash drought extent is shown schematically with four color symbols that denote four intervals of the percentage of drought area with respect to the study area the centroids for small drought patches with areas less than 25 are mostly distributed in the northeast and southwest part of the huaibei plain which shows that northeastern and southwestern regions of the huaibei plain experience small extent flash droughts a relatively high density of the areas having a considerable extent can be seen in the center north of the huaibei plain almost all the centroids of the drought patches with areas that are larger than 25 of the study area are concentrated in the north central part of the huaibei plain namely bozhou as a result the center of flash droughts in the huaibei plain is just east of bozhou fig 6 shows flash drought track paths with the drought centroid located within the huaibei plain during growing seasons from 2001 to 2019 here we use the transfer path of the flash drought centroid to indicate the spatial track path of flash drought events the beginning drought centroid of the flash drought event is depicted by a solid circle and a triangle represents the final drought centroid of the flash drought event the polyline and arrow illustrate the track path of the flash drought event and the number marked in the figure indicates the sequence number of the flash drought events shown in table 1 notably only two types of flash droughts with relatively simple track paths are depicted in fig 6 one is an event with the starting drought centroid and the ending drought centroid occurring at the same location termed as a centroid no transfer event and the other is an event with no more than two transfer paths the remaining four flash drought events with complicated spatial track path are discussed in detail in the next section immediately apparent is that from 2001 to 2010 fig 5 a there are two regions with clustered flash drought centroids in the huaibei plain one located in the northern part fuyang with nearly 36 drought centroids and the other in the south central region bozhou with 21 drought centroids there are almost no flash drought centroids in the northwest and southeast corners in 2011 to 2019 fig 5 b the number of drought centroids located in the northern part has increased significantly while the centroids in the central part has decreased notably the centroids are almost uniformly distributed over the north part of the huaibei plain without clustered regions there are still no drought centroids in the southeast corners the statistical results of the spatial track paths of flash drought events during 2001 to 2019 in the huaibei plain are illustrated in fig 7 it is observed from fig 7 a that east to west transition and non transition are the main spatial track paths of flash droughts in the huaibei plain accounting for 44 and 22 respectively the track path from north to south accounts for 19 the regularity of this spatial track path may be related to the wind direction in this area fig 7 b shows the wind direction distribution of the maximum wind speed in the huaibei plain from 2001 to 2019 and the wind direction distribution of the maximum wind speed in the drought area during the flash droughts which has one of the three main transfer paths during the past 19 years east west winds occurred more often than north south winds in the huaibei plain red line in fig 7 b east winds occurred 11 of the time there was a good consistency between the wind direction distribution during the flash droughts period of different transfer paths and the transfer path for example east winds occurred most during the flash droughts period with the east to west track paths and north and south winds occurred more often during the flash droughts which transferred from south to north table 3 shows the number of flash drought events with three transfer paths and the number of flash drought events with the same wind direction in the drought area and transfer path about 63 of flash drought events had the same spatial track path and wind direction therefore the spatial track paths of flash drought in the huaibei plain were related to wind direction fig 7 c shows the distributions of the three main transfer paths during each growing month monthly flash drought frequency was variable between april and november flash drought events in the huaibei plain most occurred in may august and october winter wheat and summer maize were main crops in study area october and may were the sowing and heading periods of winter wheat crop in the huaibei plain respectively august was the filling period of summer maize during these three growth stages the crop required a large amount of water thus flash drought events during these stages seriously affected the yield of winter wheat and summer maize fig 8 shows the statistical results of the spatial track paths of the top ten severe ranked by the severity calculated in table 1 flash drought events in the huaibei plain east to west transition was still a main spatial track path accounting for 56 fig 8 a meanwhile the top ten sever flash droughts most occurred in may and june as a result crop managers should pay special attention to the impacts of flash droughts on winter wheat and summer maize especially for winter wheat to reduce agricultural losses 3 3 meteorological conditions associated with flash droughts fig 9 shows the spatial track paths of two events with complicated transfer paths that occurred in the huaibei plain and spatial variations of climate anomalies during these two typical flash drought events another two events with complicated transfer paths seen in fig s1 in supplementary fig 9 a depicts a flash drought event in 2012 the rapid drought intensification first began in the eastern region suzhou on april 6 while the sesr value of this area was still above normal which meant that the region experienced humid conditions at the time also see fig s1 a in supplementary eight days later the sesr value of this region declined to negative anomalies however after another 8 days the drought in southern suzhou terminated due to a small amount of precipitation but a rapid drought intensification then began in northern suzhou due to a temperature increase and then began in the western region fuyang of the huaibei plain on may 8 because of the increased temperature in a larger area and later developed to cover the entire huaibei plain on june 1 subsequently rising temperatures and deficit precipitation aggravated the drought in the huaibei plain and contributed to the rapid reduction of sesr values and rhu in a large area meanwhile the wind speed also had positive anomalies therefore low precipitation high temperature and wind speed connected to declining sesr values and rhu were the main reason for this flash drought also see fig s1 in supplementary the flash drought that occurred from april 7 to june 10 2014 in the huaibei plain is depicted in fig 9 b the rapid drought intensification started in the eastern and northwestern regions of the huaibei plain then started in the southwestern region on april 15 and later developed over the entire huaibei plain on april 23 although there was a small amount of precipitation from april 7 to april 23 the rhu and sesr values for the entire huaibei plain were negative on may 1 due to the increasing temperature and wind speed on may 9 the drought ended in most parts of the huaibei plain except for bozhou and north of suzhou due to precipitation after another 8 days western regions received precipitation and the drought in these regions ended while a drought signal appeared in the southwestern part there was a heavy precipitation 8 days later in the southwestern region but the sesr values were still negative this probably related to comparing coarsely spaced precipitation observations as such abnormally high temperature connected to declining sesr values was the main reason for flash drought events in the huaibei plain while precipitation only played an auxiliary role meanwhile dry hot wind during june to september prevailed in the area the dry hot wind was another important factor affecting flash droughts in this region otherwise even though the huaibei plain had near normal or above normal sesr values flash droughts could occur within 8 days to further explore the relationship between meteorological factors and flash droughts fig 10 presents boxplots of climate variable anomalies before lag 1 and during flash drought rapid intensification periods and during drought periods the boxplots for rapid intensification periods and drought periods were drawn using all the variables during these periods as expected most precipitation shows negative anomalies before and during the rapid intensification periods it was still negative during drought period similarly rh anomalies were negative corresponding to decreased precipitation before and during the rapid intensification periods while it increased in the drought period tmax showed slightly positive anomalies during rapid intensification periods and drought periods however win anomalies had no obvious positive or negative bias in the three periods 3 4 comparison of flash droughts and actual long term droughts flash drought events identified by the expanded method presented in this study table 1 were compared to 2006 to 2018 actual long term drought events reported by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2006 2018 table 2 the category in table 2 is based on the meteorological drought composite index mci developed by china meteorological administration ma et al 2019 and it can be downloaded from the website http cmdp ncc cma net extreme dust php product dust moni from 2006 to 2018 the huaibei plain experienced flash droughts every year but there were no long term droughts in 2014 to2016 there were four flash droughts in 2006 and the fourth event in october persisted to a long term drought similarly two flash droughts occurred in 2007 following a reported drought in 2008 and 2009 a long term drought occurred several months after a flash drought in 2010 after a flash drought occurred in western and southern regions of the huaibei plain during may to july a slight long term drought in the entire huaibei plain occurred from july to september an extremely long term drought occurred in the huaibei plain from january to april in 2011 and then the eastern region experienced a flash drought in may and june followed by an extremely long term drought in june and july and later the northwestern corner had a flash drought in august and september in 2012 the huaibei plain had a flash drought from april to june and the western region had an extremely long term drought in may and june in 2013 the southwestern and southeastern regions experienced a flash drought and the western region had a moderately long term drought in july and august similarly western regions had a flash drought and the entire huaibei plain experienced a moderately long term drought in july and august in 2017 a flash drought occurred in the northeastern corner in may and june in 2018 followed by a slightly long term drought in the western and northern regions in july and august meanwhile a flash drought over the entire huaibei plain was identified in the same month in summary only 26 of flash drought events were followed by long term drought events of which 60 of the flash droughts covered a smaller area than the long term drought events covered and 40 of flash droughts had similar coverage areas as the long term drought events 4 discussion 4 1 two improvements in the identification methodology in this study sesr values calculated by et and pet are used to identify droughts plant stress is key to using sesr values to characterize impactful drought events because stress rapidly reduces transpiration fluxes during drought intensification periods basara et al 2019 osman et al 2021 sesr not only directly incorporates near surface state variables such as temperature wind speed water vapor pressure difference latent heat and sensible heat flux and soil moisture but also depicts plant health christian et al 2019a therefore it may be more suitable than soil moisture to identify agriculturally impacting flash droughts a critical characteristic of a flash drought that distinguishes it from a more conventional slowly developing drought involves the flash component representing a rapid rate of intensification otkin et al 2018 this is derived by changes in sesr values between time steps christian et al 2019b use this methodology to identify flash droughts in the continental united states and the results compare well with previously identified flash drought cases estimated by satellite based esi and the u s drought monitor therefore the sesr is used as part of the flash drought identification method in this study however sesr only identifies the rapid development stage of droughts as well as the rapid development duration to judge whether the duration is long enough to significantly impact crops but in fact the drought period after the period of rapid intensification should also be included in determining whether the drought duration will have a significant impact on crops otkin et al 2021 propose a new flash drought monitoring framework that depicts both the rapid rate of intensification and the severity of the drought following the rapid intensification period in addition yuan et al 2019 suggest that flash droughts are a subset of all droughts so they should be composed of a development stage and a recovery stage as a result this paper further considers the drought period after the rapid intensification period based on the sesr flash drought identification method proposed by christian et al 2019b which makes the method for identifying flash drought events more complete almost all proposed flash drought identification methods simplify the space time characteristics of flash droughts by including the time series of drought indicators within fixed grids hunt et al 2014 mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 ford and labosier 2017 otkin et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 christian et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 otkin et al 2021 li et al 2020 propose a framework for tracking the spatio temporal development of flash droughts this framework expands the identification of flash droughts from the time dimension to the space time dimensions the process of the framework is to use drought indicators to first determine the spatially continuous drought patches and then use the change rate of the drought intensity of two consecutive drought patches to describe the rapid drought intensification however this identification process can misidentify events that develop from a small area of a light drought condition to a large area of still with a light drought condition as flash drought events obviously such events will not have a significant impact on the ecosystem or the society and do not satisfy the destructive characteristic of flash droughts therefore this study proposes a more reliable method that first identifies flash droughts on each grid with the sesr identification methodology and marks the identified flash drought grids and then clusters the marked grids to identify spatially continuous flash drought events notably this method has a limitation in dividing the rapid intensification period and drought period of spatial events the expanded methodology in this research has potential to be applied for flash drought identification in other regions of the world first the drought index used in this methodology is easy to calculate the sesr value is only calculated by et and pet which can be obtained by multiple reliable datasets such as mod 16 mu et al 2007 and gleam v3 5 global land evaporation amsterdam model martens et al 2017 second this index can always characterize the surface water availability and the plant health regardless of the climate regimes christian et al 2019a so it can be applied to other regions with different climatic zones finally the procedure of the temporal and spatial identification introduced in this study is simple and clear to reproduce in practice however there exists little discussion about the determination of the threshold of rapid intensification rate of flash droughts most of the thresholds 24 days 40 and 25 used in this study are based on the soil properties of study area and empirical values of previous research conclusions notably the thresholds especially 24 days should be adjusted when the methodology is applied in other regions with different soil properties further work should investigate how to determine the thresholds in various regions and examine the sensitivity of thresholds to flash drought identification in addition there are some limitations in our methodology this flash drought identification methodology is a percentile based approach it is challenging to apply percentile based approach to datasets with short periods of record since there is insufficient data to represent the distribution otkin et al 2021 liu et al 2020b report that the frequency of flash droughts derived from short series present higher values than those from long term series therefore it should be noted that the number of flash droughts identified by this methodology may be overestimated for short term datasets future work can investigate an appropriate absolute minimum value as a drought threshold to relief this limitation 4 2 spatial and temporal distribution of flash droughts the results from the frequency of flash droughts in the huaibei plain revealed that the average frequency of all regions in the huaibei plain was 18 events during the 19 growing seasons this frequency was the same as the frequency of precipitation deficit flash droughts obtained by wang and yuan 2018 a flash drought was most likely to occur in the northeastern regions where the average annual precipitation was low and in western regions with large precipitation high temperature and large changes in the daily maximum temperature in the huaibei plain gao et al 2015 analyzed the distribution of the annual maximum series of extreme precipitation and the coefficient of variation cv of annual maximum series in the huai river basin the results indicated that the northeastern and western regions of the huaibei plain which experienced relatively large numbers of flash droughts had high cv values indicating that these regions suffered frequent from extreme precipitation events therefore the variability of maximum temperature and precipitation were also significant contributors to flash droughts in some ways this was at odds with studies in the previous literature that identified meteorological conditions such as precipitation and mean temperature as being important for flash drought development wang et al 2016 wang and yuan 2018 koster et al 2019 it is worth noting that in addition to the precipitation and temperature we should also pay attention to the variability of maximum precipitation and temperature in the future flash droughts research the average duration of the rapid intensification period in the huaibei plain was 18 days and the average drought period duration was 14 days yuan et al 2019 investigated the flash droughts in china from 1961 to 2005 based on soil moisture they found that the duration of flash droughts including the rapid intensification period and the drought period in the huaibei plain was 30 days which was consistent with our study one key result of this study was that flash droughts occurred more often during may august and october and the top ten severe flash droughts mostly occurred in may and june several factors contributed to this temporal distribution of flash droughts during the growing seasons first dry hot wind prevailed in may in the huaibei plain li et al 2018 the dry hot wind also called heat stress was a type of agrometeorological hazard with high temperature low humidity and certain wind speed wang et al 2021 as such rapid increased temperature and wind speed within this region in may could increase the likelihood of flash drought development another likely factor contributing to the high frequency in the summer was that the huaibei plain was susceptible to a cyclonic anomaly over the western north pacific in the summer the formation of a strong cyclonic anomaly over the western north pacific led to the anomalous northeasterly wind which resulted in the deficit of precipitation and the increase of temperature and promoted the development of flash droughts wang and yuan 2021 furthermore may august and october were the main water consumption periods for winter wheat and summer maize in this region during the sowing and heading periods of winter wheat crop and filling period of summer maize a higher rate of evapotranspiration occurred which in turn sharply consumed the soil moisture rapidly increased the evaporative stress and further developed flash droughts tuan et al 2011 gou et al 2020 christian et al 2019a another major concern was that anomalies of precipitation and rhu were negative before and during the rapid intensification period and positive anomalies were observed for tmax while win anomalies had no obvious positive or negative bias before and during the rapid intensification period and drought period previous studies also reported that win was less variable and showed no significant positive or negative bias li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b when the huaibei plain had near normal or above normal sesr values flash droughts could occur within 8 days a similar result was reported by basara et al 2019 who found that antecedent surface conditions did not serve to inhibit the development of flash droughts finally we compared the flash droughts and the long term droughts from 2006 to 2018 the flash droughts had a rapid intensification period however not all rapid intensification period led to long term drought conditions due to the diverse climatic conditions e g precipitation after a period of rapid drought intensification and underlying surface conditions e g vegetation cover notably despite the short duration of flash droughts it could still have devastating effects on agriculture and ecosystems wang and yuan 2021 we found that only 26 of flash drought events were followed by long term drought events christian et al 2019a also reported that over 50 of flash droughts did not transition to long term drought in the united states 5 conclusions in this study an expanded methodology was introduced to allow the identification of flash drought tracking in time and space the expanded method was applied to the huaibei plain in china sesr values calculated by et and pet and changes in sesr values were used to identify the rapid intensification period and drought period of flash droughts on each grid at time series a contiguous drought area cda approach focused on the determination of spatial flash drought events finally the centroid of spatial drought events in the cda analysis was used to track the flash drought in time and space the following key findings are derived from the application of the spatio temporal identification methodology to the huaibei plain during the growing seasons 1 flash droughts occur most frequently in northeastern and western parts of the huaibei plain and the region with the most flash droughts experienced 34 events in 19 years the average frequency is 18 flash drought events in 19 years furthermore the average flash drought duration is about 31 days of which the rapid intensification period is about 18 days and the drought period is about 14 days 2 flash drought events in the huaibei plain mostly occur in may august and october and east to west transition and non transition accounting for 44 and 22 respectively are the main spatial track paths 3 abnormally high temperature connected to declining sesr values is the main reason for flash drought events in the huaibei plain while precipitation only plays an auxiliary role 4 only 26 of flash drought events transition to long term drought events the improved flash drought identification methodology includes a drought period following the rapid intensification period which improves the accuracy of flash drought event identification this improved methodology can also track the transfer path of flash droughts in time and space which expands our knowledge of the evolution process of flash droughts to space time dimensions these additions improve flash drought predictions and inform mitigation techniques in addition this study explores the regional characteristics of flash droughts in a humid and semi humid region which broadens the overall understanding of flash droughts the flash drought identification methodology presented in this study provides a foundation for future studies of the climatological

3830,flash droughts are regional phenomena that can manifest in large areas with rapid intensification for a period of time few studies have considered the spatial pathways of flash droughts or their drought period this study uses the five criteria based on the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr method to identify flash droughts and when a sesr value recovers to the 20th percentile the flash drought is considered to terminate to define spatially continuous flash droughts accurately the usual order of first calculating drought patches and then identifying flash droughts is reversed to first identify flash droughts on the grid and then determine flash drought patches in addition this study tracks the spatial paths of flash droughts via centroid transfers of flash drought patches using mod16 data the methodology is evaluated by analyzing the regional characteristics of flash droughts in the huaibei plain of china from 2001 to 2019 the flash droughts in this region most frequently tracked in the northeast and west the average flash drought duration was 31 days of which the rapid intensification period was 18 days and drought period was 14 days flash drought events in this region mostly occurred in may august and october and east to west transition and non transitions which accounted for 44 and 22 respectively were the main spatial track paths only 26 of flash drought events transitioned to long term drought events this study expands our knowledge of the evolution process of flash droughts to space time dimensions which is essential for flash droughts early warning and agricultural water management keywords agricultural drought spatio temporal drought analysis standardized evaporative stress ratio 1 introduction recent climate changes not only increase the occurrence of global and regional droughts since the middle of the 20th century nicholls 2004 noah et al 2015 but also impact drought characteristics dai 2013 huang et al 2016 sheffield and wood 2008 trenberth et al 2014 wang et al 2016 recently a new type of rapidly evolving drought termed as a flash drought has aroused considerable attention due to its devastating impacts basara et al 2014 chen et al 2019 christian et al 2020 liu et al 2020b yuan et al 2019 a flash drought is a rapidly intensifying water deficit process accompanied by a persistent shortage of precipitation anomalously warm surface temperatures low humidity strong winds and abundant sunshine in a time period ranging from a few weeks to months basara et al 2019 liu et al 2020a mo and lettenmaier 2016 a flash drought differs from a conventional drought which is a creeping phenomenon that can last for several months or years sheffield et al 2012 xia et al 2014 yuan et al 2017 the main characteristics of flash droughts are rapid development short prediction period strong intensity and destructive impact otkin et al 2018 for example during the summer of 2012 regions in the central united states experienced a rapid increase in drought conditions in less than two months with magnitudes increased by category four or five on the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 the drought resulted in excess of 30 billion dollars lost jin et al 2019 likewise the flash drought event across the northern united states in 2017 was associated with four category increases in drought severity over a 2 month period due to elevated surface temperature and exceptionally dry weather during the spring and early summer this particular flash drought cost the nation at least 26 billion dollars otkin et al 2018 a flash drought in the summer of 2013 occurred in 13 provinces in southern china in less than a month with more than 2 million hectares of crops damaged yuan et al 2015 these events demonstrate that extreme drought conditions can develop rapidly and have large agricultural and economic impacts via desiccation of soil moisture and deterioration of vegetation health therefore a flash drought is also a rapidly evolving agricultural drought when it occurs in the growing season which may lead to crop failure wang and yuan 2018 otkin et al 2021 the term flash drought was first coined by svoboda et al 2002 to describe a type of rapidly intensifying drought subsequently several flash drought definitions have been proposed mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 used pentads 5 day to define flash droughts based on the variation of temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture this definition focused on the short duration however otkin et al 2018 argued that this definition could not fully identify flash droughts because it did not include changes in soil moisture with time or a dry threshold they suggested that rather than focus on a short duration the definition of flash droughts should mainly focus on the rapid rate of intensification to distinguish them from slowly developing droughts several studies identified flash droughts based on an unusually rapid rate of intensification ford et al 2015 koster et al 2019 and liu et al 2020a identified a flash drought when the pentad average soil moisture declined from above the 40th percentile to below the 20th percentile in 4 pentads or less osman et al 2021 compared the one pentad average soil moisture and a period of at least four pentads average soil moisture to identify a flash drought furthermore yuan et al 2019 suggested that flash drought events encompassed processes of onset and recovery they thought that a water deficit condition should persist long enough to have significant impacts on the ecosystem or the society therefore they developed an improved definition that included the recovery stage and captured both rapid intensification and drought conditions otkin et al 2021 also suggested that in addition to the rapid intensification component the actual drought severity during or after the rapid intensification period was critical and should be considered they developed a new index that depicted both the rapid rate of intensification of flash droughts and the resultant drought severity flash drought events were also evaluated by evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet anomalies otkin et al 2013 and nguyen et al 2019 examined flash droughts via the satellite derived evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2007 and showed that temporal changes in the esi provided early warnings of flash droughts more recently christian et al 2019b proposed a consistent statistical methodology for explicitly characterizing flash droughts on the basis of the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr this approach used four criteria to identify flash droughts criteria 1 and 2 were based on a minimum length 30 days for flash drought development and on a drought threshold 20th percentile for the final sesr to emphasize the drought impacts on the environment while criteria 3 and 4 based on the temporal changes of sesr were used to describe the rapid rate of drought intensification there are some other identifications based on the evaporative demand hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 pendergrass et al 2020 water balance noguera et al 2020 or the usdm chen et al 2019 pendergrass et al 2020 though there are many definitions to describe the rapid intensification rate of a flash drought onset at a fixed grid or regional average scale very few definitions have considered the spatial pathway of a flash drought as well as the recovery stage because flash droughts are regional phenomena that can cover large areas for a period of time the rapid intensification and the spatial extent are two equally important features tracking flash droughts in both space and time is fundamental to enriching our knowledge of flash drought development and tracking can guide early warning and risk assessment recently li et al 2020 introduced a framework based on the intensification rate of the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi vicente serrano et al 2010 and spatial propagation to track flash droughts in space and time in this framework the grids under drought conditions were first identified and then drought patches were selected afterwards the flash drought events were defined by the change rate of the cumulative sedi of each drought patch this approach could include events when the cumulative sedi was suddenly decreased attributed by increased light drought areas rather than by a rapid intensity of drought conditions an event just with rapid spatial propagation without intensification will not be considered as a flash drought in this study because it may not have any significant impacts on the ecosystem or the society therefore the method proposed by li et al 2020 may overestimate flash drought frequency here we propose a method that identifies flash droughts in time series based on the sesr and then uses a simple clustering algorithm to select flash drought patches in space finally the spatial track paths are described by the centroids transfer of flash drought patches the sesr is a comprehensive index which not only represents meteorological information like temperature and water vapor pressure difference but also responds to crop and surface moisture deficit conditions osman et al 2021 meanwhile a definition based on the sesr has strong criteria that limit flash drought identification to rapid drought development moreover both the rapid intensification and actual drought impact should be considered when assessing flash drought characteristics otkin et al 2021 it is valuable to consider the drought period after the rapid intensification therefore this definition is expanded upon by first considering the drought period following the rapid intensification period and then using it to identify flash drought events on each grid in time series the purpose of this study is to define a flash drought event with an onset location a pathway over time and an end location moreover based on this expanded definition the meteorological conditions associated with the rapid intensification and drought period of flash droughts are investigated in a humid and semi humid region the huaibei plain china this method can be used to track temporal evolution and spatial extent of flash droughts which are essential to build an early warning system 2 material and methods 2 1 spatio temporal identification methodology of flash droughts 2 1 1 flash drought identification in time series the flash drought identification approach used in this study relies on the sesr basara et al 2019 christian et al 2019b the daily et and pet are used to calculate the daily evaporative stress ratio esr then the mean and standard deviation of the esr are used to compute the sesr at each grid point 1 sesr ijp esr ijp esr ijp σ esr ijp where sesrijp henceforth referred to as sesr is the z score of esr at a specific grid point i j for a specific time step p esr ijp is the mean esr at a specific grid point i j for a time step p for all years available in the gridded dataset and σ esr ijp is the standard deviation of esr for a specific time step p and a grid point i j for all years available in the gridded dataset rapid intensification a critical characteristic of flash droughts is derived by calculating temporal changes in sesr values the standardized change in sesr values is given as 2 δ s e s r ijp z δ s e s r ijp δ s e s r ipj σ δ s e s r ijp where δ s e s r ijp z henceforth referred to as δ s e s r is the z score of the change in sesr at a specific grid point i j for a specific time step p δ s e s r ijp is the mean change in sesr values at a specific grid point i j for a time step p for all years available in the gridded dataset and σ δ s e s r ijp is the standard deviation of the change in sesr for a specific time step p and a grid point i j for all years available in the gridded dataset the flash drought identification should account for both its rapid intensification i e the flash and the actual drought conditions drought conditions must persist for a period of time otkin et al 2018 christian et al 2019b used four criteria involving sesr to capture these two characteristics the first two criteria focus on the impacts of flash droughts while the latter two criteria emphasize the rapid rate of drought intensification the latter two criteria are used to identify rapid intensification period in this study the drought period following the intensification period is also an integral phase for a flash drought event otkin et al 2018 otkin et al 2021 consequently in this study a total of five criteria are used to define a complete flash drought process a pentad is often used as a time step to identify flash droughts but the time resolution of the data selected in this paper is 8 days so here the time step is set as 8 days the threshold percentiles in criterion 1 3 are the same as those used by christian et al 2019b regarding criterion 4 otkin et al 2018 states that when the drought index falls below the 20th percentile the event can be considered as a drought the whole flash drought process minimum length of 24 days for criterion 5 is selected based on the reported length of flash droughts in china yuan et al 2019 and the irrigation practices in which irrigation is carried out for ten consecutive drought days in the study area the criteria are listed as 1 a minimum sesr value during a flash drought event must be less than the 20th percentile value 2 a δ s e s r value between individual time steps must be at or below the 40th percentile with no more than one δ s e s r value above the 40th percentile following a δ s e s r value below the 40th percentile 3 the mean change in sesr during the entire length of the flash drought must be less than the 25th percentile 4 if a sesr value increases above the 20th percentile the drought terminates 5 a flash drought should last for at least 24 days three time steps an illustration of the five flash drought identifying criteria is shown in fig 1 based on the earlier identification criteria this flash drought event started on june 24 point f1 in fig 1 with a δ s e s r at the 15th percentile and ended on july 28 point f2 in fig 1 with a δ s e s r at the 58th percentile which violated criterion 2 yellow shaded area in fig 1 the sesr value was still below the 20th percentile after point f2 which meant the drought condition was still serious thus f2 was actually the final point of the rapid intensification period not the end of the flash drought event the new definition considered the drought period green shaded area in fig 1 following the rapid intensification period and suggested that a flash drought event ended when the declined sesr value surpassed the 20th percentile again identified as f3 in fig 1 therefore the total duration for this flash drought event was 48 days which satisfies criterion 5 2 1 2 spatial tracking of flash droughts a generalized flowchart of the flash drought identification process is presented in fig 2 the general procedure of spatial tracking of flash droughts can be divided into four steps as follow step1 flash drought identification occurs at each grid the five criteria proposed above are used to identify flash droughts in time series at each grid when a grid is identified to be in a flash drought event the value of 1 is recorded in this grid otherwise the grid value is set equal to 0 step 2 flash drought patches are computed the marked binary grids are then classified into drought patches by means of the contiguous drought area cda analysis corzo perez et al 2011 diaz et al 2020 in this approach a two scan algorithm is applied the first run is performed to connect the given grid with its 8 neighbors and assign a provisional label to the contiguous grids assignments are made as follows if the grid of the actual position is equal to 1 the labeled grid is searched in the 3 3 neighborhood around this grid if there is no label between the neighbors assign a new label number in this grid if only a neighbor has a label then this label number is assigned in this actual grid if there is more than one label between the neighborhoods assign the lowest one in the grid and record the equivalence label number in the table afterwards a second scan is carried out to relabel the linked labels recorded in the equivalence table as a unique label moreover an area threshold is defined with a minimum area required to have a spatial event according to earlier studies the area of drought patches is larger than 1 6 of the region of interest xu et al 2015 cda analysis is used in each time step over the whole grid step 3 flash drought centroid localization after identification of the flash drought patches its centroid is calculated in each time step then the flash drought track paths during each event are described by shifts in the centroid step 4 flash drought characteristics calculations thus far spatial temporal flash drought events have been identified the continuous drought patches in the time series constitute a flash drought event finally three variables are used to describe characteristics of each event duration is defined as the consecutive days of drought patches in time series the severity of a flash drought event is defined as the total sesr value within a drought patch in flash drought duration drought area is the area affected by a flash drought event 2 2 case study area and data to evaluate the methodology data from the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 were used in a humid and semi humid region of china the huaibei plain is situated in the middle and lower reaches of the huai river of northern anhui province china fig 3 a b one of the most important grain production areas it has a total area of 37 420 km2 between 32 25 to 34 35 n and 114 55 to 118 10 e it has a transitional zone of northern subtropical and warm temperate climate where the east asian summer monsoon interacts with the mid latitude westerly winds thus it is highly susceptible to natural disasters wang et al 2017 the climate parameters in this area have an obvious north south distribution fig 3 c f affected by monsoon precipitation decreases from south to north the maximum annual precipitation is 986 mm however controlled by the upper northwest circulation and the pacific subtropical high the annual distribution of precipitation in this region is uneven with 60 occurring as rainstorms from june to september fig 3 h with frequent droughts and floods guo 2001 yang et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the climate in the huaibei plain is warm and humid in summer and the et increases rapidly with the high temperature qiao et al 2000 leading to decreasing soil moisture and resultant flash droughts wang et al 2016 while the other seasons have low precipitation and dry overlying air fig 3 h such dryness may promote high et and cause a flash drought koster et al 2019 moreover the huaibei plain is a shallow groundwater region with an annual average 2 0 m water table depth the contribution of groundwater to the root zone provides water for crop growth leading to large et values and creating a favorable condition for flash droughts gou et al 2020 the main soil type in huaibei plain is lime concretion black soil that is rich in clay minerals montmorillonite liu et al 2017 due to its characteristic shrinkage and swelling the soil cracks easily when the water content is low and the soil pores shrink when it rains wei et al 2018 this soil type can intensify drought events consequently it is of significance to investigate how flash droughts have changed in this area to reveal the characteristics of flash droughts in the north south climate transition zone in particular since the spatial identification of flash droughts will be affected by the shape of the study area we expanded the flash drought identification range to the rectangular box composed by the longitude span 114 30 to 118 30 e and latitude span 32 to 35 n of the huaibei plain but only the flash droughts in the huaibei plain are analyzed the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 is part of the nasa eos project which uses satellite remote sensing data to estimate global terrestrial evapotranspiration from land surfaces the mod16 products include 8 day monthly and annual et latent heat flux le potential et pet and potential le ple produced at 1 km and 500 m pixel resolutions this dataset has been validated in global areas under various climatic and land use land cover conditions yang et al 2015 verified mod16 in the huai river basin and found that the magnitude and spatial distribution of mod16 are reasonable therefore the mod16a2 version 6 dataset which can be downloaded from the website https lpdaac usgs gov products mod16a2v006 with 8 day and 500 m pixel resolution from 2001 to 2019 was used in this paper modis reprojection tool mrt and arcmap software tools were used to handle and process the mod16 dataset furthermore to evaluate the meteorological conditions associated with flash droughts daily meteorological data from 2001 to 2019 including precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax relative humidity rh and wind speed win were collected from 36 meteorological stations in and around the region fig 3 these datasets were provided by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn a kriging method was used to interpolate the station data to provide spatial data with 500 m pixel resolution the 8 day accumulated precipitation and average tmax rh and win were calculated to match the time resolution of mod16 the anomaly of tmax rh and win are calculated as 3 a n o m l y t x y x x where xy is actual 8 day average meteorological factor tmax rh and win in t time steps for y year x is mean 8 day average meteorological factor in t time steps for many years anomlyt is the anomly in t time steps for y year notably flash drought identification was performed only during the growing season april to november given the potential damage of flash droughts to crops christian et al 2019a 3 results 3 1 frequency and duration of intensification period and drought period of flash droughts based on the mod16 et and pet data and the flash drought identification methodology described above all of the flash drought events and their characteristics in the huaibei plain during the growing seasons from 2001 to 2019 are listed in table 1 during these 19 growing seasons 38 flash drought events occurred in the huaibei plain the year 2006 had the most flash drought events when four drought events occurred in different regions of the huaibei plain there were three flash drought events per year in different regions of the huaibei plain during growing seasons in 2009 2012 2017 and 2018 except for 2003 2004 2005 2016 and 2019 which each had one flash drought event there were two flash droughts in every other years though there were a large number of flash drought events in the huaibei plain the areas affected by these events were relatively small eight flash droughts affected areas larger than 50 of the study region the most serious flash drought event occurred from august to october in 2001 persisting for 80 days with an affected area of 60 of the region and the flash droughts with largest affected areas 91 occurred from august to october in 2007 persisting for 56 days most of the flash drought events lasted for about 24 days showing a rapid intensification toward drought and only a few events persisted for more than 48 days fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of frequency and average duration of the rapid intensification period and drought period for flash droughts of each grid in the huaibei plain during growing seasons april to november between 2001 and 2019 only 0 02 of the region of the huaibei plain experienced more than 30 flash drought events in 19 years these areas are mainly located in the northeast sections of the huaibei plain fig 4 a and the region with the most flash droughts experienced 34 events in 19 years during the growing seasons the region that experienced more than 19 events in 19 years accounted for 40 3 of the study area these regions are located in the west and northeast part of the huaibei plain about 60 of the huaibei plain had less than 19 flash drought events which means that more than half of the area in this region had less than one per year these areas were mainly located in the southern and northwest regions the areas with less than 10 flash droughts in 19 years only accounted for about 1 of the huaibei plain and the area with the least number of flash drought events had only 6 events in 19 years in general the huaibei plain experienced an average of 18 flash drought events in 19 years during the growing seasons of which 15 to 21 events accounted for 74 of the total area the frequency of flash droughts in the northern part was higher than that in the southern part notably the annual average precipitation in the south was more than that in the north fig 3 c and the average annual temperature in the south was higher than that in the north fig 3 d the northeast part of the huaibei plain had the least precipitation and the lowest temperature while it had the most flash droughts during the growing seasons another area with a high frequency of flash droughts was the western part of the huaibei plain this area had more precipitation and higher temperature meanwhile the 8 day average maximum temperature also changed the most fig 3 g consequently regions with little precipitation and regions with large precipitation high temperature and large changes in the day maximum temperature were more prone to flash drought events although the northwest and southern regions experienced fewer flash drought events the durations in these regions were longer fig 4 the longest average intensification period duration was 28 days and the average following drought period lasted for 13 days the longest average drought period duration was 31 days which was 3 days longer than longest average intensification duration and the corresponding average intensification period duration was 15 days in contrast the western and northeast regions experienced more flash drought events with a shorter duration the fastest average rapid intensification duration was 11 days followed by a 20 day drought period the shortest average drought period duration was only 8 days which was 3 days less than fastest average rapid intensification duration and the corresponding average intensification period duration was 15 days the average duration of rapid intensification period of the huaibei plain was 18 days and the rapid intensification duration with the largest area was 16 days an intensification period average duration of 85 of the huaibei plain was between 15 and 19 days meanwhile the average duration of drought period of the huaibei plain was 14 days and the drought period duration with the largest area was 12 days about 87 of the huaibei plain had a average drought period lasting 11 to 16 days therefore the average duration of two periods of flash droughts in the huaibei plain was 32 days 3 2 tracking path of flash droughts the centroids of the largest drought patches located within the huaibei plain in each time step are presented in fig 5 the spatial flash drought extent is shown schematically with four color symbols that denote four intervals of the percentage of drought area with respect to the study area the centroids for small drought patches with areas less than 25 are mostly distributed in the northeast and southwest part of the huaibei plain which shows that northeastern and southwestern regions of the huaibei plain experience small extent flash droughts a relatively high density of the areas having a considerable extent can be seen in the center north of the huaibei plain almost all the centroids of the drought patches with areas that are larger than 25 of the study area are concentrated in the north central part of the huaibei plain namely bozhou as a result the center of flash droughts in the huaibei plain is just east of bozhou fig 6 shows flash drought track paths with the drought centroid located within the huaibei plain during growing seasons from 2001 to 2019 here we use the transfer path of the flash drought centroid to indicate the spatial track path of flash drought events the beginning drought centroid of the flash drought event is depicted by a solid circle and a triangle represents the final drought centroid of the flash drought event the polyline and arrow illustrate the track path of the flash drought event and the number marked in the figure indicates the sequence number of the flash drought events shown in table 1 notably only two types of flash droughts with relatively simple track paths are depicted in fig 6 one is an event with the starting drought centroid and the ending drought centroid occurring at the same location termed as a centroid no transfer event and the other is an event with no more than two transfer paths the remaining four flash drought events with complicated spatial track path are discussed in detail in the next section immediately apparent is that from 2001 to 2010 fig 5 a there are two regions with clustered flash drought centroids in the huaibei plain one located in the northern part fuyang with nearly 36 drought centroids and the other in the south central region bozhou with 21 drought centroids there are almost no flash drought centroids in the northwest and southeast corners in 2011 to 2019 fig 5 b the number of drought centroids located in the northern part has increased significantly while the centroids in the central part has decreased notably the centroids are almost uniformly distributed over the north part of the huaibei plain without clustered regions there are still no drought centroids in the southeast corners the statistical results of the spatial track paths of flash drought events during 2001 to 2019 in the huaibei plain are illustrated in fig 7 it is observed from fig 7 a that east to west transition and non transition are the main spatial track paths of flash droughts in the huaibei plain accounting for 44 and 22 respectively the track path from north to south accounts for 19 the regularity of this spatial track path may be related to the wind direction in this area fig 7 b shows the wind direction distribution of the maximum wind speed in the huaibei plain from 2001 to 2019 and the wind direction distribution of the maximum wind speed in the drought area during the flash droughts which has one of the three main transfer paths during the past 19 years east west winds occurred more often than north south winds in the huaibei plain red line in fig 7 b east winds occurred 11 of the time there was a good consistency between the wind direction distribution during the flash droughts period of different transfer paths and the transfer path for example east winds occurred most during the flash droughts period with the east to west track paths and north and south winds occurred more often during the flash droughts which transferred from south to north table 3 shows the number of flash drought events with three transfer paths and the number of flash drought events with the same wind direction in the drought area and transfer path about 63 of flash drought events had the same spatial track path and wind direction therefore the spatial track paths of flash drought in the huaibei plain were related to wind direction fig 7 c shows the distributions of the three main transfer paths during each growing month monthly flash drought frequency was variable between april and november flash drought events in the huaibei plain most occurred in may august and october winter wheat and summer maize were main crops in study area october and may were the sowing and heading periods of winter wheat crop in the huaibei plain respectively august was the filling period of summer maize during these three growth stages the crop required a large amount of water thus flash drought events during these stages seriously affected the yield of winter wheat and summer maize fig 8 shows the statistical results of the spatial track paths of the top ten severe ranked by the severity calculated in table 1 flash drought events in the huaibei plain east to west transition was still a main spatial track path accounting for 56 fig 8 a meanwhile the top ten sever flash droughts most occurred in may and june as a result crop managers should pay special attention to the impacts of flash droughts on winter wheat and summer maize especially for winter wheat to reduce agricultural losses 3 3 meteorological conditions associated with flash droughts fig 9 shows the spatial track paths of two events with complicated transfer paths that occurred in the huaibei plain and spatial variations of climate anomalies during these two typical flash drought events another two events with complicated transfer paths seen in fig s1 in supplementary fig 9 a depicts a flash drought event in 2012 the rapid drought intensification first began in the eastern region suzhou on april 6 while the sesr value of this area was still above normal which meant that the region experienced humid conditions at the time also see fig s1 a in supplementary eight days later the sesr value of this region declined to negative anomalies however after another 8 days the drought in southern suzhou terminated due to a small amount of precipitation but a rapid drought intensification then began in northern suzhou due to a temperature increase and then began in the western region fuyang of the huaibei plain on may 8 because of the increased temperature in a larger area and later developed to cover the entire huaibei plain on june 1 subsequently rising temperatures and deficit precipitation aggravated the drought in the huaibei plain and contributed to the rapid reduction of sesr values and rhu in a large area meanwhile the wind speed also had positive anomalies therefore low precipitation high temperature and wind speed connected to declining sesr values and rhu were the main reason for this flash drought also see fig s1 in supplementary the flash drought that occurred from april 7 to june 10 2014 in the huaibei plain is depicted in fig 9 b the rapid drought intensification started in the eastern and northwestern regions of the huaibei plain then started in the southwestern region on april 15 and later developed over the entire huaibei plain on april 23 although there was a small amount of precipitation from april 7 to april 23 the rhu and sesr values for the entire huaibei plain were negative on may 1 due to the increasing temperature and wind speed on may 9 the drought ended in most parts of the huaibei plain except for bozhou and north of suzhou due to precipitation after another 8 days western regions received precipitation and the drought in these regions ended while a drought signal appeared in the southwestern part there was a heavy precipitation 8 days later in the southwestern region but the sesr values were still negative this probably related to comparing coarsely spaced precipitation observations as such abnormally high temperature connected to declining sesr values was the main reason for flash drought events in the huaibei plain while precipitation only played an auxiliary role meanwhile dry hot wind during june to september prevailed in the area the dry hot wind was another important factor affecting flash droughts in this region otherwise even though the huaibei plain had near normal or above normal sesr values flash droughts could occur within 8 days to further explore the relationship between meteorological factors and flash droughts fig 10 presents boxplots of climate variable anomalies before lag 1 and during flash drought rapid intensification periods and during drought periods the boxplots for rapid intensification periods and drought periods were drawn using all the variables during these periods as expected most precipitation shows negative anomalies before and during the rapid intensification periods it was still negative during drought period similarly rh anomalies were negative corresponding to decreased precipitation before and during the rapid intensification periods while it increased in the drought period tmax showed slightly positive anomalies during rapid intensification periods and drought periods however win anomalies had no obvious positive or negative bias in the three periods 3 4 comparison of flash droughts and actual long term droughts flash drought events identified by the expanded method presented in this study table 1 were compared to 2006 to 2018 actual long term drought events reported by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2006 2018 table 2 the category in table 2 is based on the meteorological drought composite index mci developed by china meteorological administration ma et al 2019 and it can be downloaded from the website http cmdp ncc cma net extreme dust php product dust moni from 2006 to 2018 the huaibei plain experienced flash droughts every year but there were no long term droughts in 2014 to2016 there were four flash droughts in 2006 and the fourth event in october persisted to a long term drought similarly two flash droughts occurred in 2007 following a reported drought in 2008 and 2009 a long term drought occurred several months after a flash drought in 2010 after a flash drought occurred in western and southern regions of the huaibei plain during may to july a slight long term drought in the entire huaibei plain occurred from july to september an extremely long term drought occurred in the huaibei plain from january to april in 2011 and then the eastern region experienced a flash drought in may and june followed by an extremely long term drought in june and july and later the northwestern corner had a flash drought in august and september in 2012 the huaibei plain had a flash drought from april to june and the western region had an extremely long term drought in may and june in 2013 the southwestern and southeastern regions experienced a flash drought and the western region had a moderately long term drought in july and august similarly western regions had a flash drought and the entire huaibei plain experienced a moderately long term drought in july and august in 2017 a flash drought occurred in the northeastern corner in may and june in 2018 followed by a slightly long term drought in the western and northern regions in july and august meanwhile a flash drought over the entire huaibei plain was identified in the same month in summary only 26 of flash drought events were followed by long term drought events of which 60 of the flash droughts covered a smaller area than the long term drought events covered and 40 of flash droughts had similar coverage areas as the long term drought events 4 discussion 4 1 two improvements in the identification methodology in this study sesr values calculated by et and pet are used to identify droughts plant stress is key to using sesr values to characterize impactful drought events because stress rapidly reduces transpiration fluxes during drought intensification periods basara et al 2019 osman et al 2021 sesr not only directly incorporates near surface state variables such as temperature wind speed water vapor pressure difference latent heat and sensible heat flux and soil moisture but also depicts plant health christian et al 2019a therefore it may be more suitable than soil moisture to identify agriculturally impacting flash droughts a critical characteristic of a flash drought that distinguishes it from a more conventional slowly developing drought involves the flash component representing a rapid rate of intensification otkin et al 2018 this is derived by changes in sesr values between time steps christian et al 2019b use this methodology to identify flash droughts in the continental united states and the results compare well with previously identified flash drought cases estimated by satellite based esi and the u s drought monitor therefore the sesr is used as part of the flash drought identification method in this study however sesr only identifies the rapid development stage of droughts as well as the rapid development duration to judge whether the duration is long enough to significantly impact crops but in fact the drought period after the period of rapid intensification should also be included in determining whether the drought duration will have a significant impact on crops otkin et al 2021 propose a new flash drought monitoring framework that depicts both the rapid rate of intensification and the severity of the drought following the rapid intensification period in addition yuan et al 2019 suggest that flash droughts are a subset of all droughts so they should be composed of a development stage and a recovery stage as a result this paper further considers the drought period after the rapid intensification period based on the sesr flash drought identification method proposed by christian et al 2019b which makes the method for identifying flash drought events more complete almost all proposed flash drought identification methods simplify the space time characteristics of flash droughts by including the time series of drought indicators within fixed grids hunt et al 2014 mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 ford and labosier 2017 otkin et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 christian et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 otkin et al 2021 li et al 2020 propose a framework for tracking the spatio temporal development of flash droughts this framework expands the identification of flash droughts from the time dimension to the space time dimensions the process of the framework is to use drought indicators to first determine the spatially continuous drought patches and then use the change rate of the drought intensity of two consecutive drought patches to describe the rapid drought intensification however this identification process can misidentify events that develop from a small area of a light drought condition to a large area of still with a light drought condition as flash drought events obviously such events will not have a significant impact on the ecosystem or the society and do not satisfy the destructive characteristic of flash droughts therefore this study proposes a more reliable method that first identifies flash droughts on each grid with the sesr identification methodology and marks the identified flash drought grids and then clusters the marked grids to identify spatially continuous flash drought events notably this method has a limitation in dividing the rapid intensification period and drought period of spatial events the expanded methodology in this research has potential to be applied for flash drought identification in other regions of the world first the drought index used in this methodology is easy to calculate the sesr value is only calculated by et and pet which can be obtained by multiple reliable datasets such as mod 16 mu et al 2007 and gleam v3 5 global land evaporation amsterdam model martens et al 2017 second this index can always characterize the surface water availability and the plant health regardless of the climate regimes christian et al 2019a so it can be applied to other regions with different climatic zones finally the procedure of the temporal and spatial identification introduced in this study is simple and clear to reproduce in practice however there exists little discussion about the determination of the threshold of rapid intensification rate of flash droughts most of the thresholds 24 days 40 and 25 used in this study are based on the soil properties of study area and empirical values of previous research conclusions notably the thresholds especially 24 days should be adjusted when the methodology is applied in other regions with different soil properties further work should investigate how to determine the thresholds in various regions and examine the sensitivity of thresholds to flash drought identification in addition there are some limitations in our methodology this flash drought identification methodology is a percentile based approach it is challenging to apply percentile based approach to datasets with short periods of record since there is insufficient data to represent the distribution otkin et al 2021 liu et al 2020b report that the frequency of flash droughts derived from short series present higher values than those from long term series therefore it should be noted that the number of flash droughts identified by this methodology may be overestimated for short term datasets future work can investigate an appropriate absolute minimum value as a drought threshold to relief this limitation 4 2 spatial and temporal distribution of flash droughts the results from the frequency of flash droughts in the huaibei plain revealed that the average frequency of all regions in the huaibei plain was 18 events during the 19 growing seasons this frequency was the same as the frequency of precipitation deficit flash droughts obtained by wang and yuan 2018 a flash drought was most likely to occur in the northeastern regions where the average annual precipitation was low and in western regions with large precipitation high temperature and large changes in the daily maximum temperature in the huaibei plain gao et al 2015 analyzed the distribution of the annual maximum series of extreme precipitation and the coefficient of variation cv of annual maximum series in the huai river basin the results indicated that the northeastern and western regions of the huaibei plain which experienced relatively large numbers of flash droughts had high cv values indicating that these regions suffered frequent from extreme precipitation events therefore the variability of maximum temperature and precipitation were also significant contributors to flash droughts in some ways this was at odds with studies in the previous literature that identified meteorological conditions such as precipitation and mean temperature as being important for flash drought development wang et al 2016 wang and yuan 2018 koster et al 2019 it is worth noting that in addition to the precipitation and temperature we should also pay attention to the variability of maximum precipitation and temperature in the future flash droughts research the average duration of the rapid intensification period in the huaibei plain was 18 days and the average drought period duration was 14 days yuan et al 2019 investigated the flash droughts in china from 1961 to 2005 based on soil moisture they found that the duration of flash droughts including the rapid intensification period and the drought period in the huaibei plain was 30 days which was consistent with our study one key result of this study was that flash droughts occurred more often during may august and october and the top ten severe flash droughts mostly occurred in may and june several factors contributed to this temporal distribution of flash droughts during the growing seasons first dry hot wind prevailed in may in the huaibei plain li et al 2018 the dry hot wind also called heat stress was a type of agrometeorological hazard with high temperature low humidity and certain wind speed wang et al 2021 as such rapid increased temperature and wind speed within this region in may could increase the likelihood of flash drought development another likely factor contributing to the high frequency in the summer was that the huaibei plain was susceptible to a cyclonic anomaly over the western north pacific in the summer the formation of a strong cyclonic anomaly over the western north pacific led to the anomalous northeasterly wind which resulted in the deficit of precipitation and the increase of temperature and promoted the development of flash droughts wang and yuan 2021 furthermore may august and october were the main water consumption periods for winter wheat and summer maize in this region during the sowing and heading periods of winter wheat crop and filling period of summer maize a higher rate of evapotranspiration occurred which in turn sharply consumed the soil moisture rapidly increased the evaporative stress and further developed flash droughts tuan et al 2011 gou et al 2020 christian et al 2019a another major concern was that anomalies of precipitation and rhu were negative before and during the rapid intensification period and positive anomalies were observed for tmax while win anomalies had no obvious positive or negative bias before and during the rapid intensification period and drought period previous studies also reported that win was less variable and showed no significant positive or negative bias li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b when the huaibei plain had near normal or above normal sesr values flash droughts could occur within 8 days a similar result was reported by basara et al 2019 who found that antecedent surface conditions did not serve to inhibit the development of flash droughts finally we compared the flash droughts and the long term droughts from 2006 to 2018 the flash droughts had a rapid intensification period however not all rapid intensification period led to long term drought conditions due to the diverse climatic conditions e g precipitation after a period of rapid drought intensification and underlying surface conditions e g vegetation cover notably despite the short duration of flash droughts it could still have devastating effects on agriculture and ecosystems wang and yuan 2021 we found that only 26 of flash drought events were followed by long term drought events christian et al 2019a also reported that over 50 of flash droughts did not transition to long term drought in the united states 5 conclusions in this study an expanded methodology was introduced to allow the identification of flash drought tracking in time and space the expanded method was applied to the huaibei plain in china sesr values calculated by et and pet and changes in sesr values were used to identify the rapid intensification period and drought period of flash droughts on each grid at time series a contiguous drought area cda approach focused on the determination of spatial flash drought events finally the centroid of spatial drought events in the cda analysis was used to track the flash drought in time and space the following key findings are derived from the application of the spatio temporal identification methodology to the huaibei plain during the growing seasons 1 flash droughts occur most frequently in northeastern and western parts of the huaibei plain and the region with the most flash droughts experienced 34 events in 19 years the average frequency is 18 flash drought events in 19 years furthermore the average flash drought duration is about 31 days of which the rapid intensification period is about 18 days and the drought period is about 14 days 2 flash drought events in the huaibei plain mostly occur in may august and october and east to west transition and non transition accounting for 44 and 22 respectively are the main spatial track paths 3 abnormally high temperature connected to declining sesr values is the main reason for flash drought events in the huaibei plain while precipitation only plays an auxiliary role 4 only 26 of flash drought events transition to long term drought events the improved flash drought identification methodology includes a drought period following the rapid intensification period which improves the accuracy of flash drought event identification this improved methodology can also track the transfer path of flash droughts in time and space which expands our knowledge of the evolution process of flash droughts to space time dimensions these additions improve flash drought predictions and inform mitigation techniques in addition this study explores the regional characteristics of flash droughts in a humid and semi humid region which broadens the overall understanding of flash droughts the flash drought identification methodology presented in this study provides a foundation for future studies of the climatological

3831,urban flood warning systems need fast response times between the rainfall forecast and the flood alarm flood forecasts from physically based numerical models usually need much computation time flood forecasts based on databases from previous events or pre simulated events can speed up the process of decision making this work introduces and compares four distance metrics for temporal rainfall patterns used in a nearest neighbour based forecast system for dynamic water levels and velocities during pluvial floods the system uses a database of 960 pre calculated flood events the performance of each metric is evaluated by analysis of time series of flow variables for the error quantification a procedure to find a small number of representative locations in an urban catchment is described a new approach to quantify the similarity of dynamic flow fields is introduced which makes use of particle transport tracking the four distance metrics are tested on forecast for four exemplary pluvial flood events resulting from rainfall of durations between 15 and 50 min and return periods between 10 and 100 years the best metric is based on the temporal precipitation pattern and takes the response time of the drainage system into account if the pattern has a very short duration a simpler characterisation metric can be used which takes the total volume peak intensity and peak position into account keywords pluvial flood forecast nearest neighbour ensemble selection dynamic water level 1 introduction pluvial floods in urban areas threaten infrastructure and human life due to sudden water level rise and high flow velocity jha et al 2012 these floods are caused by short but strong rainfall events if the storm sewer capacity is exceeded drainage takes place in the pipe network and on the streets with complex exchanges between surface and subsurface transport paths even if the precipitation event could be forecasted the dynamics of surface water level and flow is often hard to predict flood prediction often focuses on maximum flood depth or total flood volumes jamali et al 2018 kim and cho 2019 berkhahn et al 2019 however local fluxes can be very important water level and velocity can increase the risk of destruction during flood events drag forces and debris can cause damage to buildings and other obstacles on its way including vehicles and humans martínez gomariz et al 2017 detailed information on fluxes can help to protect infrastructures and guide the rescue services for urban pluvial floods it is important that people and rescue forces can safely walk and operate in flooded areas as an example people in rubber boots who operate in high water are safe as long as they can stand in the water without getting swept away therefore the adhesive force of their sole must be larger than the drag force of the water the stability of humans in water flow is described by the equation of force balance between drag and friction as discussed for example in xia et al 2011 an example for an adult of 70kgis the save condition h v 2 0 8 to 1 2 m 3 s on asphalt where h m is the water level and v m s the flow velocity these results agree with the australian rainfall and runoff guidelines cox et al 2010 and similar findings listed in shand et al 2010 in water with high velocity of v 2 m s adults can be flushed away in water levels that are even below knee depth hazard of water can already occur from relatively low depth or from low velocity in combination with high water levels during pluvial floods thus forecasting the spatial extent of hazardous regions is important the knowledge about dynamic variation over time can help rescue forces to safely operate in flooded regions besides dynamic water level and velocity the view on the continuous flow field can indicate potential additional hazards like debris chemical or biological pollution in the water while methods to predict water levels are widely discussed predictions of velocities are more challenging the goal of this work is to find a fast way to forecast the dynamic flow fieldvariables like water levels velocities and discharge in an urban catchment during pluvial floods including the surface and subsurface domain this allows to predict time series of these flood variables and transport processes of pollutants in the drainage water influenced by them sämann et al 2019 rözer et al 2021 early warning of pluvial floods mainly depends on the quality of the precipitation forecast the lead time is limited to a few hours and kilometre wide spatial resolution for example the german weather service dwd uses radar tracking and nowcasting of precipitation with a lead time of two hours on a 1x1km grid winterrath 2020 longer lead times can be achieved with numerical weather prediction models although such models are getting more precise and faster they often have a coarser time and space resolution than radar based forecasts wilson et al 2020 for example the cosmo model for europe has a spatial resolution of 6km and a temporal resolution of 1h jourdier 2020 ideally the relation between precipitation and flood dynamics in a forecast is computed with hydrodynamic models that calculate the volume flow with physically based equations a lot of data are needed for a good representation of the urban domain high resolution surface topography 10cm to 1m pipe system topology street inlet locations and precipitation information need to be known to predict approximations for the resulting water level and flow velocity in all parts of the town at any time on the surface and in the drainage pipe system zanchetta and coulibaly 2020 the calculation time for an urban hydrodynamic model can take several hours depending on the size of the catchment the spatial resolution of the model and the complexity of the physical equations henonin et al 2013 the highest degree of complexity can be found in 1d 2d models which use a bidirectional coupling of the 1d pipe system and the 2d surface domain e g hystem extran 2d itwh 2017 and mike urban mike21 dhi 2017 many different approaches for hydrodynamic models exist in operative state with simplifications of the flow domain to speed up the calculation process acosta coll et al 2018 the reduction of model complexity can be problematic because the prediction quality is not sufficient the lack of a 2d surface prevents the ability to calculate velocities and water levels on streets the lack of a 1d pipe system in a model neglects drainage and therefore overestimates the surface flood flooding induced by exceeded pipe capacity through overspilling manholes cannot be represented in such models rené et al 2013 davidsen et al 2017 the reduction of complexity for faster computation comes with the cost of insufficient prediction quality hofmann and schüttrumpf 2020 subdivide the physical simulation into hot spot catchments for fast calculation from these small scale forecasts no catchment wide flow field and transport paths can be analysed to overcome the problem of long duration in hydrodynamic calculation surrogate models with machine learning ml techniques can reduce the prediction time to a minimum several seconds and therefore increase the effective flood forecast lead time one type of ml is the artificial neuronal network ann technique that can be used as surrogate model an ann learns the relation between multiple input e g precipitation upstream discharge and multiple output e g water level velocity at different locations values by training from prepared data this can be historical records of measurements or output from physically based models ochoa rodríguez et al 2015 anns can predict the size and maximum water level in urban areas with a prediction quality that is related to the quality of the precipitation data berkhahn et al 2019 the potential to forecast dynamic flood level in urban areas is shown by chang et al 2014 their scope is the prediction of water level at pumping stations and sink ponds in recent reviews it is stated that ann models are not yet capable to simulate the dynamics of a flash flood zounemat kermani et al 2020 additionally they are not yet used to predict flow velocities on streets this leads to the conclusion that a prediction of dynamic flow fields including surface velocity and water levels with high resolution in space metres and time minutes exceeds the capability of current available anns flow fields and time sequences of physical processes need to be forecasted with alternative methods time series of flow velocities and water levels can be calculated with hydrodynamic software and be stored in a result database these results represent the resulting flow fields of pre calculated rainfall events a database with such results can also be a side product of the generation of training sets for anns that predict less complex outputs such as flood volumes precipitation is the input flood values are the output several online real time inundation forecast models are listed in acosta coll et al 2018 and henonin et al 2013 which use a database of pre calculated historical events to predict possible scenarios only little information of the forecast procedure from the database is given events of the database have to be chosen by comparing the rainfall forecast to the rainfall events that correspond to the flood events in the database in ochoa rodríguez et al 2015 and peyron et al 2007 the exceeding of thresholds of volume and duration of the precipitation is used as criterion for similarity of rain events the results of the model are maximum flood extents wu et al 2014 uses a dimensionless pattern to represent the dynamics of multi peak events single values of a high resolution precipitation time series are not analysed to the best of our knowledge a forecast for dynamic flow fields with ml methods has not been discussed yet we present a method to forecast a dynamic flow field based on rainfall precipitation pattern from a database of pre calculated flood events the flow model considers 1d flow in pipes and 2d flow fields on the surface such as streets coupled bi directionally the generation of debris flow or scour and failure of the ground is not considered the basic assumption is that similar precipitation temporal patterns result in similar flow fields a nearest neighbour nn approach is used with a selection metric that gives a scalar distance between two precipitation patterns it is an open question what metrics are useful for such predictions we present and discuss four types of selection metrics the similarity assumption is evaluated using error quantifications of different variables of the resultant flow field for the dynamic surface water level surface velocity and pipe discharge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is used the continuity of the flow field in the catchment is evaluated using a particle transport model to track the paths of a tracer in the bi directional coupled flow field of the surface and the pipe network the precipitation forecast is a critical research topic dealing with the uncertainty of precipitation is a reason to explore the capability of ensemble weather model forecasts the influence of the precipitation forecast uncertainty is not discussed here the precipitation is assumed to be exact as the focus is on the error due to the selection from the event database mostly a small number of pre simulated scenarios is used in the database 4 in hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 20 in chang et al 2018 120 in bermúdez et al 2018 320 in kim and cho 2019 we use a database with a total number of 960 pre calculated flood events 2 model 2 1 selection methods the goal of the presented methods is to forecast time series of water levels and flow velocities on streets and discharge in the pipe network during a pluvial flood event for this purpose we use a database of pre calculated flood events using a nearest neighbour nn approachfor the selection the forecast workflow followed in this paper is shown in fig 1 as a preparation step step a database of results from a physically based model is created from an ensemble of time series of recorded heavy rainfall events each event is a key value pair with the precipitation as key the value part is the result of the hydrodynamic simulation with time series of velocities water levels discharge etc for that event both key and value are multidimensional objects as the amount of data can become very large a suitable database architecture has to be used to store the data it is recommended to store the keys in storage with fast access as this is the only part required for the selection method described in the following paragraph the flow field value part can be multiple gigabytes of disc space per event and should only be loaded from the file system for further investigation the nn selection filters the events so that only the most promising candidates are analysed in the forecast the event key precipitation pattern is the rain record it samples the volume of rainfall during a certain time interval data sources can be precipitation radar or rain gauge stations for this paper the volume per interval is measured in mm of rain in the interval duration of 5 min this is equal to the unit of litres m 2 per 5 min the workflow of a flow field forecast starts by receiving a precipitation pattern from a weather forecast system for an actual event step ① the precipitation volume and pattern over time is known but the resulting flow field is not the forecasted precipitation pattern is named reference pattern all rainfall events from the database keys are tested for their correspondence with the reference pattern therefore they are referred to as test patterns a scalar distance d between each test reference tuple is calculated with a metric to quantify their level of correspondence this is done for every combination of the reference with each test pattern step ② in this study four different metric algorithms are presented in detail below the events are ranked by their evaluated distance step ③ the ranking number is given in the stars in the figure a smaller distance implies a more similar rainfall pattern and therefore so the assumption corresponds to a higher similarity of the flow field values after the ranking a number of events is chosen to serve as a collection of potential flow field forecasts this collection is named an ensemble of possible realisations for the requested event the size of the ensemble can be limited by a plain number and by a threshold for the distance the threshold in fig 1 uses as an example a limit of distance d 1 therefore event number 2 is not taken for the ensemble the relation between the correspondence of precipitation to the correspondence of flow fields is discussed in section 2 5 different metrics that quantify the similarity of rainfall time series are defined and compared against each other the first is based on characteristics of a rainfall pattern the other three metrics are based on the full time series of rain volume per time interval of the precipitation pattern 2 2 characteristics based metric char rainfall characteristics describe general features of a precipitation pattern they are calculated from the time series of gauge values the characteristic properties duration total volume and peak volume are often used to describe a rainfall event the peak intensity and relative temporal peak position play an important role for the flow at the outlets of the catchment singh 1997 for the first metric these three values are used to calculate the distance between two precipitation patterns when thinking about a database setup to store the variables it is much easier to use these scalar values instead of storing temporal precipitation patterns time series of individual length let a precipitation pattern p be defined as a temporal sequence of sampled volumes p i during n equal distant time intervals mm 5 min e g from a rain gauge p p 1 p 2 p n the three significant characteristics used in this paper are tv total rainfall i 1 n p i pv peak volume max p i p rl relative location of highest peak i max p i n these values come with different units and order of magnitudes and have to be normalised before they can be used as metric components for normalisation values of the reference pattern are used in this paper for this reason the metric function parameters have to be strictly ordered and are non interchangeable the index naming is according to the two patterns p where the index ref is for reference and test is for the dataset pattern that is tested against the reference in the metric distance 1 d char p ref p test tv test tv ref 1 2 pv test pv ref 1 2 rl test rl ref 2 this can be interpreted as the euclidean distance of the normalised features in r 3 where tv pv rl are values on orthogonal axes although the values may not be independent this assumption is chosen for method testing further improvements can also be obtained by finding weights of the characteristics a drawback of this metric is the non commutative nature of the value normalisation procedure d char p ref p test d char p test p ref 2 3 slot metrics slot metrics calculate the distance involving the whole series of single volumes per time interval p i the patterns are organised in slots such that each slot contains an interval value of the reference and the test pattern fig 2 shows an example the reference pattern occupies six slots with interval p i the test pattern has five intervals the test pattern is shifted by an offset of 2 slots therefore the total number of slots is seven slots which contain reference and test volumes are called joint slots slots that contain no volume information for one of the patterns are filled up with 0 values they are called tailing slots of the non zero pattern rain events usually do not have the same length and the position of equivalent values do not necessarily occur at the same time after the beginning of the rain therefore all possible offsets of the time patterns are considered for the pattern analysis a scalar distance slot metric is dened as the sum of squared differences between the reference and the test value per slot s such that 2 d s p ref p test i n s i test s i ref 2 where i is the index of the slot and s i x is a single interval volume of a quantity to be compared between reference and test event for example p i note that a slot can have several values with different index if the offset is not 0 see fig 2 the number n of slots depends on the length of the patterns and the offset this relation is indicated by the slot index of the test pattern the slot numbering always sticks to the beginning of the reference pattern starting with 1 in the example in fig 2 the reference pattern has 6 intervals and the test pattern has 5 intervals with the offset of 2 the start of the test pattern is shifted 2 slots 10 min into the future therefore the test pattern ends one slot later than the reference and the number of slots to be calculated is n 7 the best offset can be found by calculating the distance for all offset combinations and using the one with the smallest distance see fig 3 the minimum and maximum offset is calculated from the length of both patterns the range of the offset depends on the type of slot metric the number n of slots to compare in the inner metric process calculating eq 2 depends on the offset possible combinations are listed as follows if both patterns start with the same slot index offset 0 and share the same number of elements n is equal to the number of intervals in each of the patterns if the offset is 0 but both patterns have different lengths n is equal to the larger number of intervals in this case the empty intervals of the shorter pattern are assumed to be 0 as missing values indicate dry conditions with offset 0 the calculation becomes more complex because the interval volume p i is compared to p i offset of the reference pattern it is not necessary to use all slots for the distance calculation three slot metrics each with a different strategy to select the slots are discussed when presenting the offset calculation for the different metrics the number of intervals is the number of occupied slots and is referred to as ref length and test length for the reference and the test pattern respectively 2 3 1 reference cut refc this type of slot metric defines the slots to be considered as the ones that are given by the reference pattern see fig 4 overhang intervals of the test pattern are cut out missing values are populated as 0 dry the offset is in the range test length to ref length in the example given in fig 4 the ref length is 8 the test length is 9 the shown offset is 3 only slots from index 0 to 7 are included in the distance calculation the high peak at slot index 2 and the direct neighbouring values of the test pattern are not considered in the distance 2 3 2 response time resp the response time tailing metric adds a time buffer to the reference pattern this buffer is as large as the response time of the runoff signal in the catchment therefore this metric can only be used if the hydraulic characteristics of the catchment are well known the basic idea of this metric is that the flow field from the test pattern that should correspond is not only influenced by the rainfall at the reference time but also by the surface runoff from previous precipitation events the enlargement of the number of slots buffer to calculate the distance is applied before and after the reference slots the offset can be in the range test length ref length each shift in the offset is possible but only slots contained in the reference pattern extended by the number of slots for the response time are considered in the metric fig 5 shows a setup with offset 3 and a response time buffer of one slot because the reference pattern has six intervals the considered slots for the distance are 1 7 combinations with a low number of joint slots cause high distance values because all tailing slots count into the distance the number of evaluated slots depends on the reference event therefore the parameters of this metric are non commutative 2 4 intensity slope metric slop this metric does not take the slot volumes but the difference of two successive volumes into account the changes of intensity between slots are the main driver of this distance calculation each slot is allocated with the change of intensity between two intervals called slope fig 6 shows the slope calculation for the same patterns used in fig 2 in a first step a slope pattern is calculated for both the reference and the test pattern the number of elements for the slope signal is one element larger than the number of interval volumes p i the first slot value is the intensity of the first pattern as the previous intensity is assumed to be zero the last element is the negative volume of the last interval as the precipitation signal drops to zero the distance in the slop metric is calculated with the same procedure as defined by the response time resp metric the only difference is the new definition of the slot values 2 5 error quantification the quality of the flow field prediction made with the different selection metrics is quantified by several error quantification measures the generation of the dataset of flow fields is described in section 3 the similarity of the resulting flow fields from two rainfall events is evaluated using hydrodynamic variables of the flow field at different locations in the catchment in general the goal is to make a good prediction for the flow field in the whole catchment it is however more practical to select representative output values outlet pipes are locations that are suitable to quantify the pipe discharge values of water level and velocity are distributed all over the catchment surface the error is quantified on the timelines of these variables at selected locations in addition a novel method is used to quantify the equality of the dynamic flow paths by comparing the transport paths of a solute tracer in the flow field hydrodynamic 1d 2d simulations provide time series of various variables water level flow velocity and outlet discharge in the pipe system and on the surface therefore multiple variables can be addressed to quantify the error between two flow fields to compare multiple variables calculated at different locations which can have a wide range of values the error quantification should be normalised to be representative for the whole domain therefore the nash sutcliffe efficiency 3 nse 1 t 1 t o test t o ref t 2 t 1 t o ref t o ref 2 is used for error quantification of thetime series of water level flow velocity and pipe discharge nash and sutcliffe 1970 it uses the value of the test scenario o test against the reference value o ref over t time intervals number of slots used for evaluation it ranges from for a poor correspondence to 1 for best fit values of the nse of more than 0 7 are considered to represent very good values for the discharge panigrahi and goyal 2017 rain that is not analysed in the metric could have a strong influence on the flow field therefore the timespan considered for the error quantification is different from that used for the metric all values are evaluated from the start of the rain until the end of the rain of the reference event plus an additional timespan of the response time this duration is always the same independent from the metric 2 6 comparison of transport paths to compare flow fields the analysis of discharge velocity and water level at single locations outlet pipes and locations of interest is not sufficient complex flow paths can occur due to the change of velocity and direction over time it is very challenging to compare these variables a shift of peak intensities by only a few minutes can readily result in a poor match in the resulting flow fields therefore a virtual solute tracer is injected into the dynamic flow field and its transport paths are observed the spreading and the area passed by the tracer are analysed to quantify the similarity of the flow field at the end of each precipitation event the shape of the area where the solute was traced is stored this procedure is repeated for injections at the beginning of each pattern interval every five minutes to have comparable areas for each offset combination both reference and test areas a ref and a test are compared against each other to quantify the difference a scalar distance iou is calculated this is the fraction of the intersection area l2 divided by the union area it is commonly used for image analysis with the name intersection over union iou rezatofighi et al 2019 defined as 4 iou a ref a test a ref a test for a value of 1 both areas are identical worst agreement relates to iou 0 when no common region has been passed by the tracer the ratio can only be indefinite if neither the reference nor the test surface gets contaminated this case can be avoided by considering that the solute is released directly onto the surface then the injection cell is part of both areas solute transport is modelled with a particle based approach in our example 10000 particles are injected at the injection location the velocity field gives the input for advective transport while for dispersion a constant coefficient of 0 01 m2 s for the surface and 1 m2 s for the pipe domain is used a detailed description of the transport model can be found in sämann et al 2019 the advective dispersive transport is solved via a random walk approach based on ahlstrom et al 1977 each surface cell that was passed by a tracer particle is part of the final area shape the random movement of particles results in a limitation of reproducibility of the area shape a variation of the randomisation seed shows the influence of the random walk approach to the final shape with an example catchment the iou for the same flow field but varying randomisation seed only reached 0 8 therefore the limit of the best fit iou for the analysis is lower than 1 0 and further thresholds like the exclude limit must also be lowered 3 data 3 1 precipitation gauge the nearest neighbour model is tested with a database of 900 real and 60 synthetic heavy rainfall events the data were collected in northern germany and scaled for the city of hannover in lower saxony by shehu and haberlandt 2019 the database includes only storm events for return periods from 10 to 100 years with a duration between 15 min and 24 h the time resolution of the precipitation is 5 min and is applied spatially constant over the catchment 3 2 test catchment characteristics the study area is an urban catchment of size 2kmx3km because the spatial resolution of radar rainfall data is 1 km2 the assumption of spatially constant precipitation intensity is reasonable the mean slope of the domain topography is about 1 from west to east while it is negligible for the north to south direction see fig 8 the catchment has industrial and domestic areas the surface was modelled using airborne laser and mobile mapping techniques to create a fine surface map of 0 1m resolution for the hydrodynamic simulation the surface is discretised with an unstructured triangular mesh with a mean cell size of 3 m2 49 of the total surface is unsealed 2 4 km2 where water can infiltrate into the soil the remaining part is sealed surface 1 1 km2 roofs 1 4 km2 streets precipitation is routed only by gravitation in storm water pipes and on the surface no pumps or special retention capacities are considered in the model all locations of manholes and street inlets are known and mapped to create a realistic surface subsurface flow coupling behaviour the time until the signal of precipitation arrives at the outlet pipes response time is around 30 min this time is important when selecting the time span of past rainfall that still has influence on the current pipe capacity the response time tailing resp metric takes six pattern slots of 5 min into account when analysing the input pattern when analysing the flow field selection the 30 min are considered for all metrics 3 3 runoff calculation a hydrodynamic approach is used to calculate the rainfall runoff process precipitation is applied on the surface triangle mesh and water flux is calculated from the diffusive wave approximation of the shallow water equation using an explicit euler time integration scheme on the surface the flow is calculated in 2d space while in the pipe network a 1d domain is used the software to solve the hydrodynamics is hystem extran 2d in version 7 9 itwh 2017 the roughness parameter distinguishes between street and green ground surface these are wetted directly by precipitation roof area follows a hydraulic approach and drains directly into the pipe system debris and deformation of ground scour is not considered the consideration of ponding water infiltration into the soil is not possible in the hydrodynamic model with the assumption that short and strong rainfall does not find time to percolate to a large extent this deficiency can be neglected the simulation time step size is restricted by the courant friedrichs lewy criterion courant et al 1928 the condition of cfl v δ t δ x 1 has to be kept for a stable and convergent calculation where v is the advective velocity δ t the simulation time step size and δ x the spatial discretisation here cfl 0 8 is chosen in the hydrodynamic model the condition is fulfilled by adjusting the time step to an appropriate value during the simulation δ x is set for each cell element by its geometry and the velocity is variable this restricts the simulation time step sizes to 10 s the computation time is about one hour of the model for one hour of precipitation input this long time span is the main reason why the hydrodynamic simulation cannot be used directly in a flood forecast the hystem extran 2d software calculates the water depth and velocity in pipes and at the surface and can store the information in variable time intervals due to restriction in hard disc space the output was stored in 10 min intervals for all pipes and all surface triangles including water level and velocity 3 4 selecting measurement outlets a drainage network might consist of different branches and a badly chosen domain boundary might lead to a high number of potential outlet pipes the discharge signal of outlets with a small accumulation area is not much influenced by surface dynamics and therefore is not of interest for the error quantification in this study to find the pipes with the highest cumulative outlet volume v sum l3 a benchmark event should be run in advance for the catchment used in this work the benchmark is a synthetic rain event euler 2 with return period of 5 years 6 out of 19 outlets are selected for the analysis which cover more than 95 of total discharge fig 7 3 5 selecting surface elements in hydrodynamic simulations including 2d surface water level and velocity values on the surface are calculated and can be used for error quantification when the quantification is done via a mean value from a high number of locations the resulting error is very low dampened most flow velocities and water levels at different locations have only small differences and the error becomes meaningless to generate a meaningful error locations have to be selected where these variables have a high sensitivity surface cells neighbouring all that have already been selected and near zero values for velocity and water level are not of interest to select sensitive locations a benchmark event is run to generate the hydrodynamic variables with the results of the simulation run a list is created for each variable where the values are ordered descendingly only a small number 50 in this example of first locations is taken from each list because many elements with significant values are located close to each other a buffer is applied to exclude neighbouring cells that might be physically connected this is especially useful for values of water level where cells that are close to each other build up ponds which are hydraulically connected such cells would synchronously change their water level and therefore are not of interest for the error quantification the buffer depends on the local structure of the catchment from the benchmark event one can analyse the ponds and local minima in surface elevation to find a good value to minimize the physical dependency between cells the selection of locations is done individually for three variables water level the maximum change in water level calculated as the difference from the simulation end value the highest value is often a cellar or deep sinkhole which always gets filled at the beginning of the rainfall event and is never drained during a simulation run because these locations are filled up for every event their significance is small it is thus important to use more than one location velocity surface elements with the highest absolute velocity high values are found in steep regions specific discharge the product of water level and velocity is an indicator for flow hazard for humans and buildings high discharge occurs all over the catchment but can be found more often in steeper regions drag force a modification of the specific discharge value using squared influence of the velocity water level velocity2 indicates locations where the drag force is strong in the catchment used here for testing the surface is discretized with 1 3 million triangles with dynamic values for water level and velocity a buffer size of 100m is chosen for locations analysed for the water level because ponds in the street have a maximum length of 80m the buffer for locations analysed for velocity along streets is also set to 100m although elements along single streets lie within longer flow paths locations analysed for specific discharge values have a buffer of 50m locations with high force equivalent values are not analysed for selection of locations because the locations found already showed a good distribution in the catchment and the number of locations should not be too high fig 8 shows the map with all chosen locations it can be seen that positions of high velocities large squares are in the steeper west half of the area while the water level concentrates its maxima small squares on the east half of the catchment positions with high discharge circles are spread all over the catchment these locations are considered to be representative for the catchment and are used for the error quantification of the forecasted flow field here 50 locations are chosen per variable this step is independent of the other variables therefore the locations might overlap in our case 23 of the locations are identical therefore only 127 locations are in the final set that are used for the error quantification of water level and velocity not restricted to the variable they are selected for 3 6 shape of travel paths for the last type of error quantification a tracer transport is calculated in the flow field for all precipitation patterns a single point injection is used to start the particle trace in the flow field fig 9 shows the extent of the reachable area for the injected solute throughout all 960 historical events for each event multiple runs with injections at different injection times every 5 min were performed in total 17211 scenario results were produced the union area of all shapes has a total size of 0 41m2 and consists of 10 single regions that are interconnected only by the underlying drainage network the tracer can change between the pipe system and surface multiple times through manholes and street inlets before reaching an outlet pipe or getting stuck on the surface the spreading underlines the importance of considering the complex flow paths between the surface and pipe domain to test for the maximum possible iou 50 runs with different randomization seeds are performed with 10000 particles the iou is in the range 0 72 to 0 83 which is caused by the error of the random walk step this leads to the assumption that patterns which reach a iou of at least 0 7 are very good for reproducing the reference flow field acceptable values are chosen by visual analysis between 0 5 and 0 7 better agreements might be possible with a higher number of particles and smaller simulation time steps due to the long computation time it was not possible to perform simulations with better resolution for the large number of event scenarios 3 7 application scenario to compare the performance of predictions made with the four different metrics an application of the nearest neighbour selection is tested with four of the 960 pre calculated heavy rain events the events are chosen to illustrate different aspects of rainfall characteristics 1 short duration 15minutes low intensity 10yr return period 2 long duration 50minutes low intensity 10yr return period 3 short duration 15minutes extreme intensity 100yr return period 4 two peak event 30minutes low intensity 10yr return period the first two represent moderate rainfall intensity in terms of pluvial floods these events already lead to surcharging manholes as the intensity implied in the return period exceeds the capacity of the drainage system the third event has one of the highest intensities among the events of the dataset the last case is a particular challenging case as it has two separate high rainfall intensity periods the pattern of all events are shown in fig 10 for each of the four reference patterns a nearest neighbour selection is performed on the whole dataset the reference pattern is excluded from the 960 events so that no perfect match can be found for each metric the best 50 members are selected because the distances of the different metrics have different ranges they cannot be compared to each other directly instead of comparing the distances in terms of their numerical values the 50 members with the lowest metric distance for each metric separately are selected ranked and grouped in batches of five in addition a second analysis for selected metrics is carried out based on the numerical value of the metric distance to show a more general trend and potential of the metric for this the 100 events with smallest metric distance are selected the grouping is here done based on the metric values so that the groups contain different numbers of members the grouping interval of the distance is different for the metrics and can be compared in between the plots the error is shown with the minimum and maximum value first second and for the third quantile for the first two cases this is done for all four metrics for the other two cases only for the two best performing metrics and only for the transport paths as the most challenging case with these comparisons we want to address the following questions how good is the match of the precipitation with a metric to predict time series of discharge local water level local velocity and the shapes of transport paths how well is the distance of the different metrics related to the match of the output a good relation should be reflected in a monotonic behaviour between metric distance and error measure the questions will be discussed in detail for the first event as the least challenging case and the other cases will be discussed more briefly with reference to the first case 4 result and discussion 4 1 least challenging case low intensity short duration 15 min the reference precipitation pattern has a duration of 15 min in three intervals with a total volume of 15 2mm with a peak at the second interval see fig 10 left pattern this intensity already causes manhole surcharge and flooding in the streets the different error quantification measures for the different metrics is shown in fig 11 resp and char metrics show a good match as well as monotonic behaviour for all four variables refc and slop do not behave monotonically at all and also do not have a good value for low distances of the metrics therefore they are not useful metrics for flow field identification the reason for this is the missing information of the rainfall pattern outside of the reference slots and the missing information of the rainfall volume resp and char show monotonic behaviour for small distances of the metric but also fluctuate for larger distances the overall performance shows best results for the discharge time series time series at local spots for water level and velocity are not equally well matched the shape behaves better and more robustly as it is an integrative and time independent measure fig 12 shows the whisker plots of the first 100 rain events selected by the well performing metric char the distance d for these events is between 0 and 0 5 the values are grouped in intervals of 0 1 the first whisker box contains results with a distance between 0 0 and 0 1 all values for the char are monotonic for the nse and iou which was not seen in fig 11 this is due to the fact that a higher number of events is grouped and individual values do not have a large impact good error measures are obtained only for small distances in this case the limiting variables are the local velocity and water level which show a nse 0 7 for a distance d 0 2 fig 13 shows the evaluation of the second metric resp similar to the figures for the char the distance reaches from d 0 7 to d 3 7 and is here grouped in integer intervals a clear relation between distance and error can be seen with monotonic decrease of the median nse and iou values the discharge has less scatter than that of the char but more scatter for velocity water level and the shape values resp shows good performance as long as distances are small enough slop has a monotonic behaviour for the median discharge but not for the other three variables see fig 14 the scatter of velocity water level and shape is large for all distances this metric does not show such a good performance as the ones before refc shows no monotonic behaviour and large scatter for all variables see fig 15 refc is not a useful metric for this test case 4 2 not very challenging case low intensity long duration 50 min for the long duration event the evaluation for the best first 50 selections in fig 16 show significant deviation from the results of the evaluation of the short event no monotonic behaviour can be observed for any metric char is useful for water level velocity and shape while resp is useful for discharge and shape each metric is analysed in detail on its own by showing the box plots of the first 100 selections per metric ordered by the distance d fig 17 shows the evaluation of char selections the distance for the first 100 selections ranges from 0 to 0 4 and is grouped in intervals of 0 1 the first group shows good results for discharge water level and velocity the performance drops for distances that are not very small the evaluation of refc and resp selection show similar results see fig 18 and 19 both show good nse for the discharge with the first quantile above 0 7 for all shown distances and good to very good values the behaviour is monotonic for small distances first three batches for water level and velocity a non monotonic relation between distance and the nse is observed the iou of the shape is constantly below the acceptable value slop shows monotonic behaviour for the discharge but not for the local measures and the shape see fig 20 all values except the discharge are below the acceptable threshold from this analysis char and resp are the only two acceptable metrics 4 3 high intensity short duration relevant for flash floods flash flood forecast is crucial for high precipitation during a very short time the event considered here has a return period of 100 years and causes severe flooding in the streets the analysis of this event is shown in fig 21 refc and slop are not monotonic and values fluctuate a lot for velocity and water level discharge is well captured by char resp and also slop local values of velocity and water level are captured well by resp but show monotonic behaviour only for high ranks char has some more fluctuations than resp but performs also well the shape is captured acceptably by char and resp a closer look at this is taken in fig 22 where the transport is measured in relation to the metric distance to highlight the forecast of flow fields during flash floods for both metrics only the median line appears for the box plot related to the smallest distance in this bin only one realization is sampled for the other groups the median iou is almost constant around 0 4 for the char the resp shows a linear decrease of the iou of the shape for increasing distance the variation of the char values is higher than for the resp values from a detailed look at the single selections not shown this is an effect caused by a high number of events with a longer duration than the reference event such events create different flow fields and the tracer shape looks very different the performance of metrics is similar to case 1 where rainfall intensity is lower the higher peak intensity in this event makes it easier to identify similar events therefore char and resp perform very well 4 4 most challenging two peak event an event with two peaks has a more complex dynamic flow field than a single peak event water from the second peak moves faster because it falls onto an already wetted surface and is not retained the forecast of multi peak events is more challenging than the single peak cases fig 23 shows the evaluation of the first 50 best ranked selections of flow fields char and resp perform best and show monotonic behaviour for all variables with only a few outliers refc and slop have bad first group values and strong fluctuations overall the performance is not as good as for the first case event but the first groups of resp and char lead to very good similarity for discharge and water level and good for velocity and shape evaluation fig 24 highlights the comparison of char and resp for the shape evaluation two single events are in the first bin of the char and in the first two bins of the shown resp selections only a single line appears for the box plot and no outliers are indicated at those iou values for the other bins the median iou is relatively constant around 0 5 for the char the resp shows a monotonic decrease for increasing distance the variation of the char values is higher than for the resp values from a detailed look at the single selections not shown this is an effect caused by a high number of events with a longer duration than the reference event such events create different flow fields and the tracer shape looks very different 5 summary and conclusion four distance metrics for a nearest neighbour selection model to select dynamic water levels and flow velocities from a pre calculated flood event database with a time series of rainfall as input are developed and tested the focus herein is on strong rainfall that causes pluvial floods we focus on dynamic scenarios where water level and velocity change fast with time the goal is to find useful metrics for water levels velocities and also for capturing the flow fields a procedure to find representative locations in a catchment to test the performance of the flood prediction made using a certain distance metric for the rainfall time series is described the locations should be positioned with a large enough distance to each other to eliminate direct hydraulic connection the test catchment of 2kmx3km has a single rain gauge with time pattern intervals of 5 min the response time of the rain signal for this catchment is 30 min four different pluvial flood events of duration between 15 to 50 min and return periods between 10 to 100 years are chosen from a database of 960 pre calculated events as test cases for discharge at the outlet of the domain local water level and local velocity the nse is used as a measure for quality of the match between the forecasts and the test case a new approach for quantification of the similarity of dynamic flow fields is introduced which uses the shape of transport paths of a tracer a comparison between the local velocity values and the solute transport paths show that these two variables have no strong relation their error measures in the test cases behave differently as an example for fluctuating errors of the velocity the error of the shapes can grow monotonically with metric distance and vice versa local velocities and flow paths have to be considered as independent error measures the relation between quality of prediction of local water level and that of local velocity is strong in general the water level is better reproduced than the velocity it has been found that due to large fluctuations of the relation between metric distance ranking and the quality measure of the forecast large ensembles have to be chosen in order to get a good relation between the metric distance and the quality of the averaged flood forecast an important point for all cases that were analysed is the spread of the error measures throughout all examples the spread was large even if the metric distance was small even if the median value of an error measure from small metric distances was good the spread is large and a single realization can show strong deviation from the mean behaviour this leads to the conclusion that it is very important to work with ensembles and to choose the ensembles large enough if predictions based on nearest neighbour methods should be made for flow field or flood predictions the best metric in terms of showing a monotonic behaviour between quality measure and metric distance as well as in terms of quality measures as absolute values is the distance metric resp which analyses each interval of the precipitation pattern and takes the response time of the drainage system into account a limit of maximum distance that still leads to reasonable prediction of dynamic variables cannot be given in general they have been found to be case dependent short duration and lower intensity cases can be analysed to get a lower limit longer duration and higher intensity cases can be used for an upper limit the distance metric char has been found to be the second most useful metric it uses only four characteristic variables derived from the precipitation pattern the results of this metric are poor if it comes to events with different durations this causes a high variance of the error measures it was found that if the precipitation comes with a wetting pre phase the outlet discharge signal is about 5 to 10 min earlier compared to dry events which increases the error when comparing the timelines of discharge water level velocity and flow field this has a high impact on the evaluation when very long rainfall patterns are compared to short ones for further analysis on this metric the weight of the duration for the distance calculation could be increased further investigation on the weights and maybe more characteristic variables could be possible a huge benefit of this metric is the fixed number of scalar values characterising a rainfall pattern that can be stored in the database directly for fast access the distance metric slop which uses the slope of the rain intensity and refc which uses only the timespan of the reference pattern and ignores all other information do not give acceptable selections in the nearest neighbour selection procedure for a flood prediction our test cases also show that predictions of variables that integrate the flow such as discharge time series at the outlet pipes can be matched quite well using databases and nearest neighbour methods prediction of the area covering flow paths and local quantities such as local flow velocities and local flood heights are much more challenging to match however one can conclude that with one of the two better performing metrics and with large enough ensembles reasonable predictions of dynamic flow fields can be made 6 outlook the approach that was taken here to predict dynamic water levels and velocities during a pluvial flood event using a database and nearest neighbour relations for the rainfall patterns had the purpose to test the potential of database methods for such predictions it was not chosen to be implemented in a real forecast system for real applications the approach has limitations that would need to be overcome and improved in future work these limitations will be discussed in the following the catchment area in the test case is relatively small and therefore the assumption that rainfall is not spatially distributed which was made is reasonable for larger areas this might not be a good assumption spatial patterns could be available from radar based precipitation forecasts in the domain with sufficient spatial resolution further research is needed to provide selection metrics that handle spatially distributed precipitation patterns for the analysis of the continuous flow field only the area shape of the tracer is investigated where the shape includes all surface cells that have been visited by at least one particle during the transport simulation the transport model that was used is quite uncertain it is a general problem of models for solute transport in urban systems that these models can hardly be validated many processes such as the mixing are not very clear apart from this there are other quantifications for the travel paths that could have been used with measurements of concentration or mass of the tracer a quantitative comparison between two events will be possible with more information about the intensity and the uncertainty we hope to produce more stable results of the tracer spread that might result in a higher iou the selection from the event database is used here as an ensemble of single realisations for the forecast each event is taken as a potential representation of the forecasted event for flood warning systems a combination weighted interpolation of multiple realisations could be possible this needs further investigation for forecasts that deal with the outcome of the ensemble selection one could think of merging multiple flow fields in a different way than simply averaging them in the case of pollution forecast caution to the balance of continuity at the single cells is necessary to avoid unphysical values as this forecast model is not developed to serve this need the combination was not considered instead the parallel forecast with multiple ensemble members is performed rözer et al 2021 the number of events in the database and its influence on the prediction quality could not be analysed within the scope of this study further research is required to find a suitable number of events for different complexity of the precipitation pattern in this study the duration of the events is short which limits the complexity the forecast model that is tested here did not consider uncertainty of predictions even if averages of ensembles of database entries are used in the end it is clear that prediction uncertainty is a crucial issue that should be addressed and needs to be studied many weather forecast systems already work with ensembles which can be used for uncertainty quantification of the rainfall prediction it would be natural to take this uncertainty up and also to include uncertainty of the flood forecast model in order to make a prediction not only of water levels and flow velocities but also of the uncertainty of the weather prediction authors contribution rs conceived this study implemented the methods performed the analysis and wrote the

3831,urban flood warning systems need fast response times between the rainfall forecast and the flood alarm flood forecasts from physically based numerical models usually need much computation time flood forecasts based on databases from previous events or pre simulated events can speed up the process of decision making this work introduces and compares four distance metrics for temporal rainfall patterns used in a nearest neighbour based forecast system for dynamic water levels and velocities during pluvial floods the system uses a database of 960 pre calculated flood events the performance of each metric is evaluated by analysis of time series of flow variables for the error quantification a procedure to find a small number of representative locations in an urban catchment is described a new approach to quantify the similarity of dynamic flow fields is introduced which makes use of particle transport tracking the four distance metrics are tested on forecast for four exemplary pluvial flood events resulting from rainfall of durations between 15 and 50 min and return periods between 10 and 100 years the best metric is based on the temporal precipitation pattern and takes the response time of the drainage system into account if the pattern has a very short duration a simpler characterisation metric can be used which takes the total volume peak intensity and peak position into account keywords pluvial flood forecast nearest neighbour ensemble selection dynamic water level 1 introduction pluvial floods in urban areas threaten infrastructure and human life due to sudden water level rise and high flow velocity jha et al 2012 these floods are caused by short but strong rainfall events if the storm sewer capacity is exceeded drainage takes place in the pipe network and on the streets with complex exchanges between surface and subsurface transport paths even if the precipitation event could be forecasted the dynamics of surface water level and flow is often hard to predict flood prediction often focuses on maximum flood depth or total flood volumes jamali et al 2018 kim and cho 2019 berkhahn et al 2019 however local fluxes can be very important water level and velocity can increase the risk of destruction during flood events drag forces and debris can cause damage to buildings and other obstacles on its way including vehicles and humans martínez gomariz et al 2017 detailed information on fluxes can help to protect infrastructures and guide the rescue services for urban pluvial floods it is important that people and rescue forces can safely walk and operate in flooded areas as an example people in rubber boots who operate in high water are safe as long as they can stand in the water without getting swept away therefore the adhesive force of their sole must be larger than the drag force of the water the stability of humans in water flow is described by the equation of force balance between drag and friction as discussed for example in xia et al 2011 an example for an adult of 70kgis the save condition h v 2 0 8 to 1 2 m 3 s on asphalt where h m is the water level and v m s the flow velocity these results agree with the australian rainfall and runoff guidelines cox et al 2010 and similar findings listed in shand et al 2010 in water with high velocity of v 2 m s adults can be flushed away in water levels that are even below knee depth hazard of water can already occur from relatively low depth or from low velocity in combination with high water levels during pluvial floods thus forecasting the spatial extent of hazardous regions is important the knowledge about dynamic variation over time can help rescue forces to safely operate in flooded regions besides dynamic water level and velocity the view on the continuous flow field can indicate potential additional hazards like debris chemical or biological pollution in the water while methods to predict water levels are widely discussed predictions of velocities are more challenging the goal of this work is to find a fast way to forecast the dynamic flow fieldvariables like water levels velocities and discharge in an urban catchment during pluvial floods including the surface and subsurface domain this allows to predict time series of these flood variables and transport processes of pollutants in the drainage water influenced by them sämann et al 2019 rözer et al 2021 early warning of pluvial floods mainly depends on the quality of the precipitation forecast the lead time is limited to a few hours and kilometre wide spatial resolution for example the german weather service dwd uses radar tracking and nowcasting of precipitation with a lead time of two hours on a 1x1km grid winterrath 2020 longer lead times can be achieved with numerical weather prediction models although such models are getting more precise and faster they often have a coarser time and space resolution than radar based forecasts wilson et al 2020 for example the cosmo model for europe has a spatial resolution of 6km and a temporal resolution of 1h jourdier 2020 ideally the relation between precipitation and flood dynamics in a forecast is computed with hydrodynamic models that calculate the volume flow with physically based equations a lot of data are needed for a good representation of the urban domain high resolution surface topography 10cm to 1m pipe system topology street inlet locations and precipitation information need to be known to predict approximations for the resulting water level and flow velocity in all parts of the town at any time on the surface and in the drainage pipe system zanchetta and coulibaly 2020 the calculation time for an urban hydrodynamic model can take several hours depending on the size of the catchment the spatial resolution of the model and the complexity of the physical equations henonin et al 2013 the highest degree of complexity can be found in 1d 2d models which use a bidirectional coupling of the 1d pipe system and the 2d surface domain e g hystem extran 2d itwh 2017 and mike urban mike21 dhi 2017 many different approaches for hydrodynamic models exist in operative state with simplifications of the flow domain to speed up the calculation process acosta coll et al 2018 the reduction of model complexity can be problematic because the prediction quality is not sufficient the lack of a 2d surface prevents the ability to calculate velocities and water levels on streets the lack of a 1d pipe system in a model neglects drainage and therefore overestimates the surface flood flooding induced by exceeded pipe capacity through overspilling manholes cannot be represented in such models rené et al 2013 davidsen et al 2017 the reduction of complexity for faster computation comes with the cost of insufficient prediction quality hofmann and schüttrumpf 2020 subdivide the physical simulation into hot spot catchments for fast calculation from these small scale forecasts no catchment wide flow field and transport paths can be analysed to overcome the problem of long duration in hydrodynamic calculation surrogate models with machine learning ml techniques can reduce the prediction time to a minimum several seconds and therefore increase the effective flood forecast lead time one type of ml is the artificial neuronal network ann technique that can be used as surrogate model an ann learns the relation between multiple input e g precipitation upstream discharge and multiple output e g water level velocity at different locations values by training from prepared data this can be historical records of measurements or output from physically based models ochoa rodríguez et al 2015 anns can predict the size and maximum water level in urban areas with a prediction quality that is related to the quality of the precipitation data berkhahn et al 2019 the potential to forecast dynamic flood level in urban areas is shown by chang et al 2014 their scope is the prediction of water level at pumping stations and sink ponds in recent reviews it is stated that ann models are not yet capable to simulate the dynamics of a flash flood zounemat kermani et al 2020 additionally they are not yet used to predict flow velocities on streets this leads to the conclusion that a prediction of dynamic flow fields including surface velocity and water levels with high resolution in space metres and time minutes exceeds the capability of current available anns flow fields and time sequences of physical processes need to be forecasted with alternative methods time series of flow velocities and water levels can be calculated with hydrodynamic software and be stored in a result database these results represent the resulting flow fields of pre calculated rainfall events a database with such results can also be a side product of the generation of training sets for anns that predict less complex outputs such as flood volumes precipitation is the input flood values are the output several online real time inundation forecast models are listed in acosta coll et al 2018 and henonin et al 2013 which use a database of pre calculated historical events to predict possible scenarios only little information of the forecast procedure from the database is given events of the database have to be chosen by comparing the rainfall forecast to the rainfall events that correspond to the flood events in the database in ochoa rodríguez et al 2015 and peyron et al 2007 the exceeding of thresholds of volume and duration of the precipitation is used as criterion for similarity of rain events the results of the model are maximum flood extents wu et al 2014 uses a dimensionless pattern to represent the dynamics of multi peak events single values of a high resolution precipitation time series are not analysed to the best of our knowledge a forecast for dynamic flow fields with ml methods has not been discussed yet we present a method to forecast a dynamic flow field based on rainfall precipitation pattern from a database of pre calculated flood events the flow model considers 1d flow in pipes and 2d flow fields on the surface such as streets coupled bi directionally the generation of debris flow or scour and failure of the ground is not considered the basic assumption is that similar precipitation temporal patterns result in similar flow fields a nearest neighbour nn approach is used with a selection metric that gives a scalar distance between two precipitation patterns it is an open question what metrics are useful for such predictions we present and discuss four types of selection metrics the similarity assumption is evaluated using error quantifications of different variables of the resultant flow field for the dynamic surface water level surface velocity and pipe discharge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is used the continuity of the flow field in the catchment is evaluated using a particle transport model to track the paths of a tracer in the bi directional coupled flow field of the surface and the pipe network the precipitation forecast is a critical research topic dealing with the uncertainty of precipitation is a reason to explore the capability of ensemble weather model forecasts the influence of the precipitation forecast uncertainty is not discussed here the precipitation is assumed to be exact as the focus is on the error due to the selection from the event database mostly a small number of pre simulated scenarios is used in the database 4 in hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 20 in chang et al 2018 120 in bermúdez et al 2018 320 in kim and cho 2019 we use a database with a total number of 960 pre calculated flood events 2 model 2 1 selection methods the goal of the presented methods is to forecast time series of water levels and flow velocities on streets and discharge in the pipe network during a pluvial flood event for this purpose we use a database of pre calculated flood events using a nearest neighbour nn approachfor the selection the forecast workflow followed in this paper is shown in fig 1 as a preparation step step a database of results from a physically based model is created from an ensemble of time series of recorded heavy rainfall events each event is a key value pair with the precipitation as key the value part is the result of the hydrodynamic simulation with time series of velocities water levels discharge etc for that event both key and value are multidimensional objects as the amount of data can become very large a suitable database architecture has to be used to store the data it is recommended to store the keys in storage with fast access as this is the only part required for the selection method described in the following paragraph the flow field value part can be multiple gigabytes of disc space per event and should only be loaded from the file system for further investigation the nn selection filters the events so that only the most promising candidates are analysed in the forecast the event key precipitation pattern is the rain record it samples the volume of rainfall during a certain time interval data sources can be precipitation radar or rain gauge stations for this paper the volume per interval is measured in mm of rain in the interval duration of 5 min this is equal to the unit of litres m 2 per 5 min the workflow of a flow field forecast starts by receiving a precipitation pattern from a weather forecast system for an actual event step ① the precipitation volume and pattern over time is known but the resulting flow field is not the forecasted precipitation pattern is named reference pattern all rainfall events from the database keys are tested for their correspondence with the reference pattern therefore they are referred to as test patterns a scalar distance d between each test reference tuple is calculated with a metric to quantify their level of correspondence this is done for every combination of the reference with each test pattern step ② in this study four different metric algorithms are presented in detail below the events are ranked by their evaluated distance step ③ the ranking number is given in the stars in the figure a smaller distance implies a more similar rainfall pattern and therefore so the assumption corresponds to a higher similarity of the flow field values after the ranking a number of events is chosen to serve as a collection of potential flow field forecasts this collection is named an ensemble of possible realisations for the requested event the size of the ensemble can be limited by a plain number and by a threshold for the distance the threshold in fig 1 uses as an example a limit of distance d 1 therefore event number 2 is not taken for the ensemble the relation between the correspondence of precipitation to the correspondence of flow fields is discussed in section 2 5 different metrics that quantify the similarity of rainfall time series are defined and compared against each other the first is based on characteristics of a rainfall pattern the other three metrics are based on the full time series of rain volume per time interval of the precipitation pattern 2 2 characteristics based metric char rainfall characteristics describe general features of a precipitation pattern they are calculated from the time series of gauge values the characteristic properties duration total volume and peak volume are often used to describe a rainfall event the peak intensity and relative temporal peak position play an important role for the flow at the outlets of the catchment singh 1997 for the first metric these three values are used to calculate the distance between two precipitation patterns when thinking about a database setup to store the variables it is much easier to use these scalar values instead of storing temporal precipitation patterns time series of individual length let a precipitation pattern p be defined as a temporal sequence of sampled volumes p i during n equal distant time intervals mm 5 min e g from a rain gauge p p 1 p 2 p n the three significant characteristics used in this paper are tv total rainfall i 1 n p i pv peak volume max p i p rl relative location of highest peak i max p i n these values come with different units and order of magnitudes and have to be normalised before they can be used as metric components for normalisation values of the reference pattern are used in this paper for this reason the metric function parameters have to be strictly ordered and are non interchangeable the index naming is according to the two patterns p where the index ref is for reference and test is for the dataset pattern that is tested against the reference in the metric distance 1 d char p ref p test tv test tv ref 1 2 pv test pv ref 1 2 rl test rl ref 2 this can be interpreted as the euclidean distance of the normalised features in r 3 where tv pv rl are values on orthogonal axes although the values may not be independent this assumption is chosen for method testing further improvements can also be obtained by finding weights of the characteristics a drawback of this metric is the non commutative nature of the value normalisation procedure d char p ref p test d char p test p ref 2 3 slot metrics slot metrics calculate the distance involving the whole series of single volumes per time interval p i the patterns are organised in slots such that each slot contains an interval value of the reference and the test pattern fig 2 shows an example the reference pattern occupies six slots with interval p i the test pattern has five intervals the test pattern is shifted by an offset of 2 slots therefore the total number of slots is seven slots which contain reference and test volumes are called joint slots slots that contain no volume information for one of the patterns are filled up with 0 values they are called tailing slots of the non zero pattern rain events usually do not have the same length and the position of equivalent values do not necessarily occur at the same time after the beginning of the rain therefore all possible offsets of the time patterns are considered for the pattern analysis a scalar distance slot metric is dened as the sum of squared differences between the reference and the test value per slot s such that 2 d s p ref p test i n s i test s i ref 2 where i is the index of the slot and s i x is a single interval volume of a quantity to be compared between reference and test event for example p i note that a slot can have several values with different index if the offset is not 0 see fig 2 the number n of slots depends on the length of the patterns and the offset this relation is indicated by the slot index of the test pattern the slot numbering always sticks to the beginning of the reference pattern starting with 1 in the example in fig 2 the reference pattern has 6 intervals and the test pattern has 5 intervals with the offset of 2 the start of the test pattern is shifted 2 slots 10 min into the future therefore the test pattern ends one slot later than the reference and the number of slots to be calculated is n 7 the best offset can be found by calculating the distance for all offset combinations and using the one with the smallest distance see fig 3 the minimum and maximum offset is calculated from the length of both patterns the range of the offset depends on the type of slot metric the number n of slots to compare in the inner metric process calculating eq 2 depends on the offset possible combinations are listed as follows if both patterns start with the same slot index offset 0 and share the same number of elements n is equal to the number of intervals in each of the patterns if the offset is 0 but both patterns have different lengths n is equal to the larger number of intervals in this case the empty intervals of the shorter pattern are assumed to be 0 as missing values indicate dry conditions with offset 0 the calculation becomes more complex because the interval volume p i is compared to p i offset of the reference pattern it is not necessary to use all slots for the distance calculation three slot metrics each with a different strategy to select the slots are discussed when presenting the offset calculation for the different metrics the number of intervals is the number of occupied slots and is referred to as ref length and test length for the reference and the test pattern respectively 2 3 1 reference cut refc this type of slot metric defines the slots to be considered as the ones that are given by the reference pattern see fig 4 overhang intervals of the test pattern are cut out missing values are populated as 0 dry the offset is in the range test length to ref length in the example given in fig 4 the ref length is 8 the test length is 9 the shown offset is 3 only slots from index 0 to 7 are included in the distance calculation the high peak at slot index 2 and the direct neighbouring values of the test pattern are not considered in the distance 2 3 2 response time resp the response time tailing metric adds a time buffer to the reference pattern this buffer is as large as the response time of the runoff signal in the catchment therefore this metric can only be used if the hydraulic characteristics of the catchment are well known the basic idea of this metric is that the flow field from the test pattern that should correspond is not only influenced by the rainfall at the reference time but also by the surface runoff from previous precipitation events the enlargement of the number of slots buffer to calculate the distance is applied before and after the reference slots the offset can be in the range test length ref length each shift in the offset is possible but only slots contained in the reference pattern extended by the number of slots for the response time are considered in the metric fig 5 shows a setup with offset 3 and a response time buffer of one slot because the reference pattern has six intervals the considered slots for the distance are 1 7 combinations with a low number of joint slots cause high distance values because all tailing slots count into the distance the number of evaluated slots depends on the reference event therefore the parameters of this metric are non commutative 2 4 intensity slope metric slop this metric does not take the slot volumes but the difference of two successive volumes into account the changes of intensity between slots are the main driver of this distance calculation each slot is allocated with the change of intensity between two intervals called slope fig 6 shows the slope calculation for the same patterns used in fig 2 in a first step a slope pattern is calculated for both the reference and the test pattern the number of elements for the slope signal is one element larger than the number of interval volumes p i the first slot value is the intensity of the first pattern as the previous intensity is assumed to be zero the last element is the negative volume of the last interval as the precipitation signal drops to zero the distance in the slop metric is calculated with the same procedure as defined by the response time resp metric the only difference is the new definition of the slot values 2 5 error quantification the quality of the flow field prediction made with the different selection metrics is quantified by several error quantification measures the generation of the dataset of flow fields is described in section 3 the similarity of the resulting flow fields from two rainfall events is evaluated using hydrodynamic variables of the flow field at different locations in the catchment in general the goal is to make a good prediction for the flow field in the whole catchment it is however more practical to select representative output values outlet pipes are locations that are suitable to quantify the pipe discharge values of water level and velocity are distributed all over the catchment surface the error is quantified on the timelines of these variables at selected locations in addition a novel method is used to quantify the equality of the dynamic flow paths by comparing the transport paths of a solute tracer in the flow field hydrodynamic 1d 2d simulations provide time series of various variables water level flow velocity and outlet discharge in the pipe system and on the surface therefore multiple variables can be addressed to quantify the error between two flow fields to compare multiple variables calculated at different locations which can have a wide range of values the error quantification should be normalised to be representative for the whole domain therefore the nash sutcliffe efficiency 3 nse 1 t 1 t o test t o ref t 2 t 1 t o ref t o ref 2 is used for error quantification of thetime series of water level flow velocity and pipe discharge nash and sutcliffe 1970 it uses the value of the test scenario o test against the reference value o ref over t time intervals number of slots used for evaluation it ranges from for a poor correspondence to 1 for best fit values of the nse of more than 0 7 are considered to represent very good values for the discharge panigrahi and goyal 2017 rain that is not analysed in the metric could have a strong influence on the flow field therefore the timespan considered for the error quantification is different from that used for the metric all values are evaluated from the start of the rain until the end of the rain of the reference event plus an additional timespan of the response time this duration is always the same independent from the metric 2 6 comparison of transport paths to compare flow fields the analysis of discharge velocity and water level at single locations outlet pipes and locations of interest is not sufficient complex flow paths can occur due to the change of velocity and direction over time it is very challenging to compare these variables a shift of peak intensities by only a few minutes can readily result in a poor match in the resulting flow fields therefore a virtual solute tracer is injected into the dynamic flow field and its transport paths are observed the spreading and the area passed by the tracer are analysed to quantify the similarity of the flow field at the end of each precipitation event the shape of the area where the solute was traced is stored this procedure is repeated for injections at the beginning of each pattern interval every five minutes to have comparable areas for each offset combination both reference and test areas a ref and a test are compared against each other to quantify the difference a scalar distance iou is calculated this is the fraction of the intersection area l2 divided by the union area it is commonly used for image analysis with the name intersection over union iou rezatofighi et al 2019 defined as 4 iou a ref a test a ref a test for a value of 1 both areas are identical worst agreement relates to iou 0 when no common region has been passed by the tracer the ratio can only be indefinite if neither the reference nor the test surface gets contaminated this case can be avoided by considering that the solute is released directly onto the surface then the injection cell is part of both areas solute transport is modelled with a particle based approach in our example 10000 particles are injected at the injection location the velocity field gives the input for advective transport while for dispersion a constant coefficient of 0 01 m2 s for the surface and 1 m2 s for the pipe domain is used a detailed description of the transport model can be found in sämann et al 2019 the advective dispersive transport is solved via a random walk approach based on ahlstrom et al 1977 each surface cell that was passed by a tracer particle is part of the final area shape the random movement of particles results in a limitation of reproducibility of the area shape a variation of the randomisation seed shows the influence of the random walk approach to the final shape with an example catchment the iou for the same flow field but varying randomisation seed only reached 0 8 therefore the limit of the best fit iou for the analysis is lower than 1 0 and further thresholds like the exclude limit must also be lowered 3 data 3 1 precipitation gauge the nearest neighbour model is tested with a database of 900 real and 60 synthetic heavy rainfall events the data were collected in northern germany and scaled for the city of hannover in lower saxony by shehu and haberlandt 2019 the database includes only storm events for return periods from 10 to 100 years with a duration between 15 min and 24 h the time resolution of the precipitation is 5 min and is applied spatially constant over the catchment 3 2 test catchment characteristics the study area is an urban catchment of size 2kmx3km because the spatial resolution of radar rainfall data is 1 km2 the assumption of spatially constant precipitation intensity is reasonable the mean slope of the domain topography is about 1 from west to east while it is negligible for the north to south direction see fig 8 the catchment has industrial and domestic areas the surface was modelled using airborne laser and mobile mapping techniques to create a fine surface map of 0 1m resolution for the hydrodynamic simulation the surface is discretised with an unstructured triangular mesh with a mean cell size of 3 m2 49 of the total surface is unsealed 2 4 km2 where water can infiltrate into the soil the remaining part is sealed surface 1 1 km2 roofs 1 4 km2 streets precipitation is routed only by gravitation in storm water pipes and on the surface no pumps or special retention capacities are considered in the model all locations of manholes and street inlets are known and mapped to create a realistic surface subsurface flow coupling behaviour the time until the signal of precipitation arrives at the outlet pipes response time is around 30 min this time is important when selecting the time span of past rainfall that still has influence on the current pipe capacity the response time tailing resp metric takes six pattern slots of 5 min into account when analysing the input pattern when analysing the flow field selection the 30 min are considered for all metrics 3 3 runoff calculation a hydrodynamic approach is used to calculate the rainfall runoff process precipitation is applied on the surface triangle mesh and water flux is calculated from the diffusive wave approximation of the shallow water equation using an explicit euler time integration scheme on the surface the flow is calculated in 2d space while in the pipe network a 1d domain is used the software to solve the hydrodynamics is hystem extran 2d in version 7 9 itwh 2017 the roughness parameter distinguishes between street and green ground surface these are wetted directly by precipitation roof area follows a hydraulic approach and drains directly into the pipe system debris and deformation of ground scour is not considered the consideration of ponding water infiltration into the soil is not possible in the hydrodynamic model with the assumption that short and strong rainfall does not find time to percolate to a large extent this deficiency can be neglected the simulation time step size is restricted by the courant friedrichs lewy criterion courant et al 1928 the condition of cfl v δ t δ x 1 has to be kept for a stable and convergent calculation where v is the advective velocity δ t the simulation time step size and δ x the spatial discretisation here cfl 0 8 is chosen in the hydrodynamic model the condition is fulfilled by adjusting the time step to an appropriate value during the simulation δ x is set for each cell element by its geometry and the velocity is variable this restricts the simulation time step sizes to 10 s the computation time is about one hour of the model for one hour of precipitation input this long time span is the main reason why the hydrodynamic simulation cannot be used directly in a flood forecast the hystem extran 2d software calculates the water depth and velocity in pipes and at the surface and can store the information in variable time intervals due to restriction in hard disc space the output was stored in 10 min intervals for all pipes and all surface triangles including water level and velocity 3 4 selecting measurement outlets a drainage network might consist of different branches and a badly chosen domain boundary might lead to a high number of potential outlet pipes the discharge signal of outlets with a small accumulation area is not much influenced by surface dynamics and therefore is not of interest for the error quantification in this study to find the pipes with the highest cumulative outlet volume v sum l3 a benchmark event should be run in advance for the catchment used in this work the benchmark is a synthetic rain event euler 2 with return period of 5 years 6 out of 19 outlets are selected for the analysis which cover more than 95 of total discharge fig 7 3 5 selecting surface elements in hydrodynamic simulations including 2d surface water level and velocity values on the surface are calculated and can be used for error quantification when the quantification is done via a mean value from a high number of locations the resulting error is very low dampened most flow velocities and water levels at different locations have only small differences and the error becomes meaningless to generate a meaningful error locations have to be selected where these variables have a high sensitivity surface cells neighbouring all that have already been selected and near zero values for velocity and water level are not of interest to select sensitive locations a benchmark event is run to generate the hydrodynamic variables with the results of the simulation run a list is created for each variable where the values are ordered descendingly only a small number 50 in this example of first locations is taken from each list because many elements with significant values are located close to each other a buffer is applied to exclude neighbouring cells that might be physically connected this is especially useful for values of water level where cells that are close to each other build up ponds which are hydraulically connected such cells would synchronously change their water level and therefore are not of interest for the error quantification the buffer depends on the local structure of the catchment from the benchmark event one can analyse the ponds and local minima in surface elevation to find a good value to minimize the physical dependency between cells the selection of locations is done individually for three variables water level the maximum change in water level calculated as the difference from the simulation end value the highest value is often a cellar or deep sinkhole which always gets filled at the beginning of the rainfall event and is never drained during a simulation run because these locations are filled up for every event their significance is small it is thus important to use more than one location velocity surface elements with the highest absolute velocity high values are found in steep regions specific discharge the product of water level and velocity is an indicator for flow hazard for humans and buildings high discharge occurs all over the catchment but can be found more often in steeper regions drag force a modification of the specific discharge value using squared influence of the velocity water level velocity2 indicates locations where the drag force is strong in the catchment used here for testing the surface is discretized with 1 3 million triangles with dynamic values for water level and velocity a buffer size of 100m is chosen for locations analysed for the water level because ponds in the street have a maximum length of 80m the buffer for locations analysed for velocity along streets is also set to 100m although elements along single streets lie within longer flow paths locations analysed for specific discharge values have a buffer of 50m locations with high force equivalent values are not analysed for selection of locations because the locations found already showed a good distribution in the catchment and the number of locations should not be too high fig 8 shows the map with all chosen locations it can be seen that positions of high velocities large squares are in the steeper west half of the area while the water level concentrates its maxima small squares on the east half of the catchment positions with high discharge circles are spread all over the catchment these locations are considered to be representative for the catchment and are used for the error quantification of the forecasted flow field here 50 locations are chosen per variable this step is independent of the other variables therefore the locations might overlap in our case 23 of the locations are identical therefore only 127 locations are in the final set that are used for the error quantification of water level and velocity not restricted to the variable they are selected for 3 6 shape of travel paths for the last type of error quantification a tracer transport is calculated in the flow field for all precipitation patterns a single point injection is used to start the particle trace in the flow field fig 9 shows the extent of the reachable area for the injected solute throughout all 960 historical events for each event multiple runs with injections at different injection times every 5 min were performed in total 17211 scenario results were produced the union area of all shapes has a total size of 0 41m2 and consists of 10 single regions that are interconnected only by the underlying drainage network the tracer can change between the pipe system and surface multiple times through manholes and street inlets before reaching an outlet pipe or getting stuck on the surface the spreading underlines the importance of considering the complex flow paths between the surface and pipe domain to test for the maximum possible iou 50 runs with different randomization seeds are performed with 10000 particles the iou is in the range 0 72 to 0 83 which is caused by the error of the random walk step this leads to the assumption that patterns which reach a iou of at least 0 7 are very good for reproducing the reference flow field acceptable values are chosen by visual analysis between 0 5 and 0 7 better agreements might be possible with a higher number of particles and smaller simulation time steps due to the long computation time it was not possible to perform simulations with better resolution for the large number of event scenarios 3 7 application scenario to compare the performance of predictions made with the four different metrics an application of the nearest neighbour selection is tested with four of the 960 pre calculated heavy rain events the events are chosen to illustrate different aspects of rainfall characteristics 1 short duration 15minutes low intensity 10yr return period 2 long duration 50minutes low intensity 10yr return period 3 short duration 15minutes extreme intensity 100yr return period 4 two peak event 30minutes low intensity 10yr return period the first two represent moderate rainfall intensity in terms of pluvial floods these events already lead to surcharging manholes as the intensity implied in the return period exceeds the capacity of the drainage system the third event has one of the highest intensities among the events of the dataset the last case is a particular challenging case as it has two separate high rainfall intensity periods the pattern of all events are shown in fig 10 for each of the four reference patterns a nearest neighbour selection is performed on the whole dataset the reference pattern is excluded from the 960 events so that no perfect match can be found for each metric the best 50 members are selected because the distances of the different metrics have different ranges they cannot be compared to each other directly instead of comparing the distances in terms of their numerical values the 50 members with the lowest metric distance for each metric separately are selected ranked and grouped in batches of five in addition a second analysis for selected metrics is carried out based on the numerical value of the metric distance to show a more general trend and potential of the metric for this the 100 events with smallest metric distance are selected the grouping is here done based on the metric values so that the groups contain different numbers of members the grouping interval of the distance is different for the metrics and can be compared in between the plots the error is shown with the minimum and maximum value first second and for the third quantile for the first two cases this is done for all four metrics for the other two cases only for the two best performing metrics and only for the transport paths as the most challenging case with these comparisons we want to address the following questions how good is the match of the precipitation with a metric to predict time series of discharge local water level local velocity and the shapes of transport paths how well is the distance of the different metrics related to the match of the output a good relation should be reflected in a monotonic behaviour between metric distance and error measure the questions will be discussed in detail for the first event as the least challenging case and the other cases will be discussed more briefly with reference to the first case 4 result and discussion 4 1 least challenging case low intensity short duration 15 min the reference precipitation pattern has a duration of 15 min in three intervals with a total volume of 15 2mm with a peak at the second interval see fig 10 left pattern this intensity already causes manhole surcharge and flooding in the streets the different error quantification measures for the different metrics is shown in fig 11 resp and char metrics show a good match as well as monotonic behaviour for all four variables refc and slop do not behave monotonically at all and also do not have a good value for low distances of the metrics therefore they are not useful metrics for flow field identification the reason for this is the missing information of the rainfall pattern outside of the reference slots and the missing information of the rainfall volume resp and char show monotonic behaviour for small distances of the metric but also fluctuate for larger distances the overall performance shows best results for the discharge time series time series at local spots for water level and velocity are not equally well matched the shape behaves better and more robustly as it is an integrative and time independent measure fig 12 shows the whisker plots of the first 100 rain events selected by the well performing metric char the distance d for these events is between 0 and 0 5 the values are grouped in intervals of 0 1 the first whisker box contains results with a distance between 0 0 and 0 1 all values for the char are monotonic for the nse and iou which was not seen in fig 11 this is due to the fact that a higher number of events is grouped and individual values do not have a large impact good error measures are obtained only for small distances in this case the limiting variables are the local velocity and water level which show a nse 0 7 for a distance d 0 2 fig 13 shows the evaluation of the second metric resp similar to the figures for the char the distance reaches from d 0 7 to d 3 7 and is here grouped in integer intervals a clear relation between distance and error can be seen with monotonic decrease of the median nse and iou values the discharge has less scatter than that of the char but more scatter for velocity water level and the shape values resp shows good performance as long as distances are small enough slop has a monotonic behaviour for the median discharge but not for the other three variables see fig 14 the scatter of velocity water level and shape is large for all distances this metric does not show such a good performance as the ones before refc shows no monotonic behaviour and large scatter for all variables see fig 15 refc is not a useful metric for this test case 4 2 not very challenging case low intensity long duration 50 min for the long duration event the evaluation for the best first 50 selections in fig 16 show significant deviation from the results of the evaluation of the short event no monotonic behaviour can be observed for any metric char is useful for water level velocity and shape while resp is useful for discharge and shape each metric is analysed in detail on its own by showing the box plots of the first 100 selections per metric ordered by the distance d fig 17 shows the evaluation of char selections the distance for the first 100 selections ranges from 0 to 0 4 and is grouped in intervals of 0 1 the first group shows good results for discharge water level and velocity the performance drops for distances that are not very small the evaluation of refc and resp selection show similar results see fig 18 and 19 both show good nse for the discharge with the first quantile above 0 7 for all shown distances and good to very good values the behaviour is monotonic for small distances first three batches for water level and velocity a non monotonic relation between distance and the nse is observed the iou of the shape is constantly below the acceptable value slop shows monotonic behaviour for the discharge but not for the local measures and the shape see fig 20 all values except the discharge are below the acceptable threshold from this analysis char and resp are the only two acceptable metrics 4 3 high intensity short duration relevant for flash floods flash flood forecast is crucial for high precipitation during a very short time the event considered here has a return period of 100 years and causes severe flooding in the streets the analysis of this event is shown in fig 21 refc and slop are not monotonic and values fluctuate a lot for velocity and water level discharge is well captured by char resp and also slop local values of velocity and water level are captured well by resp but show monotonic behaviour only for high ranks char has some more fluctuations than resp but performs also well the shape is captured acceptably by char and resp a closer look at this is taken in fig 22 where the transport is measured in relation to the metric distance to highlight the forecast of flow fields during flash floods for both metrics only the median line appears for the box plot related to the smallest distance in this bin only one realization is sampled for the other groups the median iou is almost constant around 0 4 for the char the resp shows a linear decrease of the iou of the shape for increasing distance the variation of the char values is higher than for the resp values from a detailed look at the single selections not shown this is an effect caused by a high number of events with a longer duration than the reference event such events create different flow fields and the tracer shape looks very different the performance of metrics is similar to case 1 where rainfall intensity is lower the higher peak intensity in this event makes it easier to identify similar events therefore char and resp perform very well 4 4 most challenging two peak event an event with two peaks has a more complex dynamic flow field than a single peak event water from the second peak moves faster because it falls onto an already wetted surface and is not retained the forecast of multi peak events is more challenging than the single peak cases fig 23 shows the evaluation of the first 50 best ranked selections of flow fields char and resp perform best and show monotonic behaviour for all variables with only a few outliers refc and slop have bad first group values and strong fluctuations overall the performance is not as good as for the first case event but the first groups of resp and char lead to very good similarity for discharge and water level and good for velocity and shape evaluation fig 24 highlights the comparison of char and resp for the shape evaluation two single events are in the first bin of the char and in the first two bins of the shown resp selections only a single line appears for the box plot and no outliers are indicated at those iou values for the other bins the median iou is relatively constant around 0 5 for the char the resp shows a monotonic decrease for increasing distance the variation of the char values is higher than for the resp values from a detailed look at the single selections not shown this is an effect caused by a high number of events with a longer duration than the reference event such events create different flow fields and the tracer shape looks very different 5 summary and conclusion four distance metrics for a nearest neighbour selection model to select dynamic water levels and flow velocities from a pre calculated flood event database with a time series of rainfall as input are developed and tested the focus herein is on strong rainfall that causes pluvial floods we focus on dynamic scenarios where water level and velocity change fast with time the goal is to find useful metrics for water levels velocities and also for capturing the flow fields a procedure to find representative locations in a catchment to test the performance of the flood prediction made using a certain distance metric for the rainfall time series is described the locations should be positioned with a large enough distance to each other to eliminate direct hydraulic connection the test catchment of 2kmx3km has a single rain gauge with time pattern intervals of 5 min the response time of the rain signal for this catchment is 30 min four different pluvial flood events of duration between 15 to 50 min and return periods between 10 to 100 years are chosen from a database of 960 pre calculated events as test cases for discharge at the outlet of the domain local water level and local velocity the nse is used as a measure for quality of the match between the forecasts and the test case a new approach for quantification of the similarity of dynamic flow fields is introduced which uses the shape of transport paths of a tracer a comparison between the local velocity values and the solute transport paths show that these two variables have no strong relation their error measures in the test cases behave differently as an example for fluctuating errors of the velocity the error of the shapes can grow monotonically with metric distance and vice versa local velocities and flow paths have to be considered as independent error measures the relation between quality of prediction of local water level and that of local velocity is strong in general the water level is better reproduced than the velocity it has been found that due to large fluctuations of the relation between metric distance ranking and the quality measure of the forecast large ensembles have to be chosen in order to get a good relation between the metric distance and the quality of the averaged flood forecast an important point for all cases that were analysed is the spread of the error measures throughout all examples the spread was large even if the metric distance was small even if the median value of an error measure from small metric distances was good the spread is large and a single realization can show strong deviation from the mean behaviour this leads to the conclusion that it is very important to work with ensembles and to choose the ensembles large enough if predictions based on nearest neighbour methods should be made for flow field or flood predictions the best metric in terms of showing a monotonic behaviour between quality measure and metric distance as well as in terms of quality measures as absolute values is the distance metric resp which analyses each interval of the precipitation pattern and takes the response time of the drainage system into account a limit of maximum distance that still leads to reasonable prediction of dynamic variables cannot be given in general they have been found to be case dependent short duration and lower intensity cases can be analysed to get a lower limit longer duration and higher intensity cases can be used for an upper limit the distance metric char has been found to be the second most useful metric it uses only four characteristic variables derived from the precipitation pattern the results of this metric are poor if it comes to events with different durations this causes a high variance of the error measures it was found that if the precipitation comes with a wetting pre phase the outlet discharge signal is about 5 to 10 min earlier compared to dry events which increases the error when comparing the timelines of discharge water level velocity and flow field this has a high impact on the evaluation when very long rainfall patterns are compared to short ones for further analysis on this metric the weight of the duration for the distance calculation could be increased further investigation on the weights and maybe more characteristic variables could be possible a huge benefit of this metric is the fixed number of scalar values characterising a rainfall pattern that can be stored in the database directly for fast access the distance metric slop which uses the slope of the rain intensity and refc which uses only the timespan of the reference pattern and ignores all other information do not give acceptable selections in the nearest neighbour selection procedure for a flood prediction our test cases also show that predictions of variables that integrate the flow such as discharge time series at the outlet pipes can be matched quite well using databases and nearest neighbour methods prediction of the area covering flow paths and local quantities such as local flow velocities and local flood heights are much more challenging to match however one can conclude that with one of the two better performing metrics and with large enough ensembles reasonable predictions of dynamic flow fields can be made 6 outlook the approach that was taken here to predict dynamic water levels and velocities during a pluvial flood event using a database and nearest neighbour relations for the rainfall patterns had the purpose to test the potential of database methods for such predictions it was not chosen to be implemented in a real forecast system for real applications the approach has limitations that would need to be overcome and improved in future work these limitations will be discussed in the following the catchment area in the test case is relatively small and therefore the assumption that rainfall is not spatially distributed which was made is reasonable for larger areas this might not be a good assumption spatial patterns could be available from radar based precipitation forecasts in the domain with sufficient spatial resolution further research is needed to provide selection metrics that handle spatially distributed precipitation patterns for the analysis of the continuous flow field only the area shape of the tracer is investigated where the shape includes all surface cells that have been visited by at least one particle during the transport simulation the transport model that was used is quite uncertain it is a general problem of models for solute transport in urban systems that these models can hardly be validated many processes such as the mixing are not very clear apart from this there are other quantifications for the travel paths that could have been used with measurements of concentration or mass of the tracer a quantitative comparison between two events will be possible with more information about the intensity and the uncertainty we hope to produce more stable results of the tracer spread that might result in a higher iou the selection from the event database is used here as an ensemble of single realisations for the forecast each event is taken as a potential representation of the forecasted event for flood warning systems a combination weighted interpolation of multiple realisations could be possible this needs further investigation for forecasts that deal with the outcome of the ensemble selection one could think of merging multiple flow fields in a different way than simply averaging them in the case of pollution forecast caution to the balance of continuity at the single cells is necessary to avoid unphysical values as this forecast model is not developed to serve this need the combination was not considered instead the parallel forecast with multiple ensemble members is performed rözer et al 2021 the number of events in the database and its influence on the prediction quality could not be analysed within the scope of this study further research is required to find a suitable number of events for different complexity of the precipitation pattern in this study the duration of the events is short which limits the complexity the forecast model that is tested here did not consider uncertainty of predictions even if averages of ensembles of database entries are used in the end it is clear that prediction uncertainty is a crucial issue that should be addressed and needs to be studied many weather forecast systems already work with ensembles which can be used for uncertainty quantification of the rainfall prediction it would be natural to take this uncertainty up and also to include uncertainty of the flood forecast model in order to make a prediction not only of water levels and flow velocities but also of the uncertainty of the weather prediction authors contribution rs conceived this study implemented the methods performed the analysis and wrote the

3832,in recent years cellular automata ca has emerged as a powerful tool for solving optimization problems in water resources engineering and in particular reservoir operation problems this study utilizes the capabilities of the ca based method to maximize the firm energy yield of multi reservoir hydropower systems installed capacities ics are selected as decision variables in the design phase and be determined in an iterative procedure the reservoir storages at the beginning and the end of the periods are used as the decision variables in the operation phase and be calculated by the ca the process starts with specifying an arbitrary initial installed ic for each reservoir determined based on long term average annual inflow then the system is optimally operated to maximize the energy yield under user specified reliability of the system using a hybrid approach cellular automata simulating annealing ca sa the system s ics are then increased decreased depending on whether the system s energy yield reliability is greater less than the target reliability this iterative process lasts till the system s energy yield reliability is equal to the target reliability the proposed method is used to optimally design the three reservoir khersan hydropower system and also the largest hydropower reservoir system in iran composed of 16 reservoirs the results are presented and compared with those of the existing methods in the literature the results show that the proposed method can be efficiently and effectively used for improving the firm energy yield of real world multi reservoir hydropower systems keywords reliability based firm energy hydropower design and operation multi reservoir cellular automata 1 introduction clean and renewable energy production is an essential task to meet the world s energy demands hydropower plants are environmentally friendly infrastructures to produce electricity from a renewable energy source these systems however require a great amount of initial investment therefore optimizing the complex design and operation of hydropower systems calls for the development of more efficient and accurate optimization methods for this purpose the optimal design and operation of hydropower reservoirs is one of the most complex optimization problems in water resources due to its non convexity nonlinearity and more importantly scale of the problem generally optimal design and operation of hydropower reservoir systems require the determination of a wide range of variables including design decision variables such as installed capacity ic minimum operating level mol normal water level nwl penstock diameters and more importantly operation policy of the reservoirs over a long enough period of operation the optimal operation policies for energy generation can be classified into two different categories i rule based operation policies where the release from the reservoir is determined by a priori known operation policy ii free rule optimal operation policies which releases from the reservoir over the horizon operation are determined by using an optimization method in the first approach the solutions may not be optimal for the case considered though having less computational cost while the latter approach can lead to achieving optimal operational variables in the cost of more computational effort in the first category various rule based approaches for the hydropower reservoir operation have been proposed such as modified standard operation policy sop tayebiyan et al 2016 hedging rule hr neelakantan and sasireka 2013 zeng et al 2014 sasireka and neelakantan 2017 xu et al 2017 ming et al 2017a ming et al 2017b wang et al 2019 and linear and nonlinear decision rules fallah mehdipour et al 2013 ahmadianfar et al 2019 feng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 he et al 2020 many studies used the second approach and employed different optimization algorithms for reservoir operation with the objective of maximizing energy generation e g yurtal et al 2005 li and wei 2008 choong et al 2017 feng et al 2018 ming et al 2017a b moeini et al 2017 niu et al 2018 sharifi et al 2013 sun et al 2016 yoo 2009 zhang et al 2016

soghrati and moeini 2020 zhou et al 2020 li et al 2020 hatamkhani and moridi 2021 despite the rich literature in the field of hydropower reservoir operation there have been few studies in the field of hydropower systems design and most existing design methods are unable to simultaneously consider the interdependency between design planning and operation management mortazavi naeini et al 2014 tian et al 2018 existing approaches in the field of integrated design and operation of hydropower systems fall under two categories in the first category a priori known operation policy is assumed and the problem is solved for the design decision variables resulting in a problem with reduced numbers of decision variables in fact using a given operation policy can convert operational decision variables to state variables making the problem easier to solve but the optimality of solutions would be questionable some researchers used this approach for the design and operation of hydropower systems afzali et al 2008 extended the reliability based simulation rbs model which is commonly used for the single reservoir design problems for optimal ic determination of multi reservoir hydropower systems by introducing a single period optimization sub model for determining the optimal releases from reservoirs at each time period to maximize the firm energy production they conclude that using a single period optimization sub model could significantly improve the results in comparison with the original rbs model zadeh et al 2016 proposed an optimization method for the design and operation of cascade hydropower systems they employed pso to determine optimal design decision variables and the sequential streamflow routing ssr was used for reservoir operation yazdi and moridi 2018 employed sop for the multi objective optimization of the reservoir as well as optimal design and operation of hydropower systems hatamkhani et al 2020 developed a simulation optimization model using weap software due to weap s limitations a new module was developed and added to weap to simulate the operation problem and coupled with pso to choose design decision variables hatamkhani et al 2021 coupled invasive weed optimization iwo with weap software for optimal design and operation of a hydropower reservoir while using a priori known operation policy makes the problem much easier it may lead to sub optimal solutions since the assumed operation policy may not be optimal for the case considered as an alternative approach in the second category of existing approaches design and operation decision variables are determined simultaneously leading to the development of a problem with a scale much larger than the first approach s problem this approach is expected to normally yield solutions superior to that of the first approach since all of the decision variables are determined at the same time rare studies in the field of integrated design and operation of hydropower systems can be attributed to the complexity of the resulting problem haddad et al 2008 considered the simultaneous design and operation of single and multi reservoir hydropower systems using the honeybee mating optimization hbmo algorithm haddad et al 2013 developed an optimization model to simultaneously determine the reservoir capacity ic and penstock diameter as design parameters along with the plant factor and reservoir storage volume at each time step as the operation decision variables bertoni et al 2019 proposed an integrated framework to address simultaneous dam sizing and operation problems all of these studies used evolutionary algorithms for solving the design and operation of hydropower problems however it is well known that the downside of the evolutionary algorithms is their computational burden especially for the large scale problems moreover these studies incorporated the interdependency of design and operation of small scale hydropower systems while real world problems are generally large scale hydropower systems that should be dealt with this study aims at proposing an effective and efficient method for reliability based design and operation of multi hydropower systems both optimal solution production and computational cost are the main concerns of the present study for the design and operation of large scale real world hydropower systems these are achieved through employing the capabilities of a ca based method for reliability based design and operation rbdo of multi reservoir hydropower systems to maximize firm energy production ics are used as the decision variables for the design phase determined in an iterative manner while the reservoir storages at the beginning and the end of the period are used as the operation decision variables determined by ca the process starts with an arbitrary selection of an initial ic for each reservoir based on the average annual inflow over sufficiently long operation periods the system is then optimally operated using a ca based model namely the cellular automata simulated annealing method ca sa to find the optimal values of the operation decision variables by maximizing the system s firm energy production the system ics are then increased decreased depending on whether the system s energy yield reliability is greater less than the target reliability this process is iterated until the system s energy yield reliability is equal to the target reliability the proposed method is validated in two different case studies the first one is the three reservoir khersan hydropower system in iran and the second is the largest hydropower reservoir system in iran with including 16 reservoirs results are presented and compared with those of the existing methods in the literature revealing a great improvement by the proposed method which can more efficiently and effectively optimize the design and operation of real world multi reservoir hydropower systems 2 optimal design and operation of multi reservoir hydropower systems proper selection of power plants ics which yields the best economic performance is of great importance in designing the hydropower multi reservoir systems the energy production of a multi reservoir system is a function of power plants ics as well as hydrologic variability of inflow to the reservoirs a long and sufficient hydrological period of data is needed and should be considered in the study to evaluate any candidate set of ics and to analyze the performance of the system for the selected candidate since there are many alternative sets of ics which satisfy problem

ic increases decreases this means that if the calculated system reliability rel system was greater smaller than the required reliability the system s ic ic system would increase decrease here the following iterative relation is developed in this study to update the value of the systems ic at each step based on the current ic and corresponding reliability ic system step 1 ic system step 1 ic system step 1 ic system step rel system step 1 rel system step rel system step 1 rel target f o r s t e p 0 with 12 ic system 1 1 rel system rel target ic system 0 where ic system step 1 is the system ic in the next step ic system step 1 is the system ic in the previous step ic system step is the system ic in the current step rel system step 1 is the system s energy yield reliability in the previous step rel system step is the system s energy yield reliability in the current step and rel target is the target reliability it is clear that if the updated system ic is greater smaller than the current system ic the ics of the reservoirs should be increased decreased so the raised question would be how to distribute the updated system ic surplus deficit among the problem s decision variables namely the reservoirs ics here a novel method is used in which the system total ic surplus deficit is distributed among the reservoirs proportional to the total deficit of produced energy from the firm energy defined as 13 ic k step 1 1 td k k 1 k 1 td k a b s ic system step 1 ic system step ic k step 14 ic k step 1 ic k step td k k 1 k td k abs i c system step 1 ic system step with 15

deficit of produced energy in meeting the firm energy at the reservoir k the flowchart of the proposed rbdo model is shown in fig 1 2 2 operation problem hydropower operation of multi reservoir systems is one of the complex problems to solve due to its nonlinear non convex and large scale nature since conventional methods are long known to be incompetent in solving these types of problems evolutionary algorithms have been used and shown to successfully handle the complexity of these problems at the expense of significant computational cost particularly when the population based methods are used a novel hybrid cellular automata simulated annealing ca sa method is proposed in this study which avoids the shortcomings of the existing conventional and evolutionary methods for the optimal hydropower operation of multi reservoir systems in this problem the objective function is formed as the sum of the positive deviation of the produced power from the ic for each hydropower plant as

where a b c and d are constant coefficients the produced total firm energy at period t is calculated as follows 26 fe t k 1 k ic k pf k nh t the operation problem defined by equations 17 to 26 is solved here using the ca sa approach the method has been introduced by azizipour et al 2020 for maximizing the energy production of hydropower multi reservoir systems a modified form of the method however has to be adopted here to account for the reliability constraints of the design problem this feature has not been considered in the original version in what follows the reliability based ca sa operation method rbo is briefly introduced more information can be found in azizipour et al 2020 2 2 1 ca component application of ca to any optimization problem requires defining the four basic components of the ca namely cell cell state cell neighbors and updating rule the cells cell states and the cell neighbor are co related and the selection of either leads to the definition of other components in optimization problems the decision variables are often considered as the cell state afshar and shahidi 2009 showed that proper selection of cell state yields a more efficient and effective ca model they reported that in reservoir operation problems the storage volume is a better choice as the cell state of the corresponding ca model in this study therefore the cells are considered as discrete points in time represented by the beginning or the end of each period so that the corresponding storage volumes can be assumed as the cell states for an operation problem over t periods this leads to t 1 cells with corresponding cell states cell neighbors are naturally considered as the surrounding cells which means that each internal cell has two neighbors except boundary cells t 1 and t t 1 which have only one neighbor definition of updating rule as the most crucial component of ca is the final step of formulating the ca approach for the underlying problem here the localized property of the reservoir storage and the underlying operation problem is used for driving the updating rule the local updating rule for the cell t is defined by the problem of finding the updated value of cell state s t such that the cost of system operation is minimized while neighboring state values s t 1 and s t 1 are kept constant this leads to the following optimization sub problem with a size equal to the number of reservoirs in the system as the local updating rule which has to be solved for the cell state s t 27 minimizef local k 1 k i c k p k t 1 i c k p k t α c s v o csv r 0 5 where f local is the local cost function α is the penalty coefficient for the operational and reliability constraints csv o and csv r are the operational and reliability constraint violations respectively defined by 28 csv o j t 1 t k 1 k csv o k j min c s v o k j max 29 csv r j t 1 t csv r j 30 csv r j m a x fe j e j 1 0 31 csv o k j min m a x 1 r k t r k t min 0 32 csv o k j max m a x r k t r k t max 1 0 the proposed ca process starts with a set of randomly initial guess for the cell states reservoir storages denoted by s t old at all periods of operation the local rule defined by equations 27 to 32 is used to find the updated value of the cell state denoted by s t new for all periods in turn using the current values of the neighboring cell states once all cell states are updated the old cell state values are replaced by the new updated values and the process is continued until the convergence is achieved no improvement in the cell states are made 2 2 2 sa component simulated annealing sa as a stochastic search technique was developed by kirkpatrick et al 1983 the technique s name and inspiration are adopted from the annealing process used in metallurgical processes which involves heating and controlled cooling of material for maximizing its strength and minimizing its brittleness heating and cooling the materials affect the temperature and thermodynamic free energy the rate of cooling dictates the magnitude of decrease in the energy with slower cooling producing a bigger decrease in energy as an optimization technique sa finds a particular configuration of the system such that minimizes the energy of the system in other words each particle in the material is located such that the thermodynamic free energy is minimized in the problem under consideration each particle represents a solution the configuration of the system is defined by decision variables namely storage volumes and the energy of the system is evaluated by the benefit function sa has some free parameters including initial temperature the decrement rate of temperature or cooling mechanism the number of transitions at each temperature and the final temperature as the stopping criteria of the algorithm these parameters play important role in the performance of sa and should be defined carefully li and wei 2008 the large values of initial temperature allow the algorithm to thoroughly explore the search space and increase the probability of finding better solutions however a too big initial temperature leads to higher computational time on the other hand too small values of initial temperature limit the algorithm to a smaller search space at each temperature particles are allowed to move to a new position such that to achieve the minimum possible energy the search process of sa can be considered as a markov chain whose length is defined by the number of movements allowed at the current temperature tospornsampan et al 2005 the new position is accepted or rejected according to an acceptance criterion defined by 33 μ m i n 1 exp e m 1 e m t i in which µ is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 the new position is accepted if the inequality 33 is satisfied and rejected otherwise here em 1 and em are the energy of the particle in consecutive movements and ti is the temperature at the i th iteration after reaching the maximum number of movements the temperature is decreased the performance of sa is highly dependent on the cooling rate sa interprets cooling as decreasing the acceptance probability of worse solutions while exploring the search space the higher acceptance probability leads to higher computational time while the lower acceptance probability decreases the effectiveness of the algorithm here the cooling process is defined as 34 t i 1 α i t 0 where ti 1 and t0 are temperatures of the current iteration and initial temperature respectively and α is the cooling rate which ranges between 0 8 and 0 99 as suggested by kirkpatrick et al 1983 the flowchart of the proposed rbo for hydropower reservoir operation and inter relation between ca and sa is presented in fig 2 the process starts with creating initial random solutions for the ca at each iteration of ca the sub problem defined by equations 27 to 32 is solved by sa using the current solution as the sa starting point as shown in the flowchart the cooling schedule of sa is handled during ca iterations in other words the temperature is changed only during ca iterations and therefore the sub problems defined by equations 27 to 32 for each cell of the problem is solved with a constant temperature following some preliminary runs cooling rate α and initial temperature t 0 are set to 0 98 and 105 respectively the number of movements at each temperature is limited to 10 for computational efficiency the new points are also produced using the annealingfast function of matlab once all sub problems equal to the number of cells are solved at each iteration of the ca the cell states are updated simultaneously and the process is continued at the end of each ca iteration the results are checked for convergence and the algorithm is stopped if converged otherwise the temperature is decreased using equation 34 and the new ca iteration is started the proposed iterative process is continued until the convergence criterion is met in this study the convergence criterion is met when there is no significant improvement in the values of the objective function in two consequent ca iterations 2 3 rbs model rbs is a commonly used method to evaluate the energy generation potential in single and multi reservoir systems the process begins with an arbitrary ic and the system is operated with ssr considering operational constraints to specify the reliability of energy yield the estimated ic is then changed until the obtained reliability is equal to target reliability afzali et al 2008 developed a multi reservoir rbs using a single period optimization sub model for determining the optimal releases from reservoirs at each time period to maximize the firm energy production more details about both models can be found in afzali et al 2008 3 case study the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for reliability based design and operation rbdo of hydropower systems is demonstrated on two cases of three reservoir and sixteen reservoir systems located in the southwest of iran the three reservoir khersan system is used to compare the results of the proposed method with those existing in the literature afzali et al 2008 the capability of the proposed rbdo model for solving large scale design and operation problems is investigated by sixteen reservoir problem 3 1 three reservoir system the khersan river is a 225 km long river in the southwest of iran that runs from yasuj mountains and ranges to its confluence with karoun river in khuzestan province the river is mainly fed by marbareh and garmroud as well as many other headwaters and tributaries three dams of khersan3 khersan2 and khersan1 are planned to be built on the river for hydropower generation and flood control purposes the main characteristic presented in table 1 afzali et al 2008 fig 3 also shows monthly inflow to the most upstream reservoir khersan3 for a horizon period of 41 years 3 2 sixteen reservoir system the karoun river is the longest river in the country in the southwest of iran draining a catchment area of about 67 000 km2 there are seven large dams on the karoun river and more nine dams are planned to be constructed on the river the location of the sixteen reservoir system in the map of iran is shown in fig 4 table 2 presents the main characteristic of the reservoirs and the distribution of monthly inflow to the system is illustrated in fig 5 a 4 results and discussion in this section the results of two different case studies are presented first the results of the three reservoir khersan hydropower system are shown and compared with those existing results to show the effectiveness of the proposed rbdo model afterward obtained results of a large scale hydropower system namely 16 reservoir are introduced to prove the capability of the model to solve large scale real world hydropower systems 4 1 three reservoir system for the three reservoir system there are three design decision variables namely ic of the reservoirs and 1476 operational decision variables leading to a problem with the total number of 1479 decision variables the proposed rbdo method is used to determine the optimal system s ic and resulting system s firm energy for different mols considering the target reliability of 90 which is known as a marketable reliability level the results are presented in table 3 this table also compares the results of rbdo with those obtained by rbs and the proposed method of afzali et al 2008 this table indicates that the proposed rbdo model is able to produce more system firm energy in comparison with rbs and afzali s best model in different mols such a significant improvement can be attributed to using the proposed optimization method called the rbo to optimally determine the operational decision variables while the rbs model utilizes standard operation policy sop to operate the model afzali et al 2008 tried to improve the results by employing a single period optimization model and they succeeded to improve the results in comparison with the rbs model however according to table 3 there is a substantial difference between rbdo results and the model proposed by afzali et al 2008 the table also indicates that in both proposed rbdo and afzali et al 2008 the highest energy production occurs when the mol is considered as 1390 1205 and 981 for khersan 3 khersan 2 and khersan 1 respectively these mols are therefore selected as the optimum mol for three reservoirs it should be noted that the rbs model suggested 10 m higher level as the best mol than those proposed by rbdo as seen in table 3 the ic of the system determined by the proposed method for mols below the optimum ones 1390 1205 and 981 masl remains constant and equal to that obtained for optimum mols which is in contrast with the results obtained by rbs and afzali s model 2008 while lowering the mol enlarges the search space of the problem it does not change the optimal solution which has already been determined as optimum mols moreover the best obtained system s ic by the proposed rbdo afzali s model 2008 and rbs are 1470 1332 and 1234 respectively it shows that the proposed rbdo method could increase the system s ic by about 11 and 19 in comparison with those obtained by afzali s model 2008 and rbs respectively and consequently produces more firm energy it is of interest to note that not only the proposed rbdo method could produce superior solutions to the existing results in the literature but also requires significantly low computational effort the runtime of the proposed rbdo method was as low as 350 s for all cases considered in table 3 this achievement is ascribed to the purposive design iterative manner and the capability of cellular automata concept for rapid convergence the monthly distribution of the system s total energy obtained by rbs afzali s model 2008 and the proposed rbdo method are illustrated in fig 5b as shown in the fig 5b for all models more inflow to the system leads to more energy production in this regard the proposed rbdo method outperforms the existing methods in producing energy in all months this is due to the capability of the proposed rbdo method in spill management the mean monthly spill volume from the reservoirs and the mean monthly release from turbines are shown in fig 5c and 5d respectively as illustrated in fig 5c the proposed rbdo method is able to store more water in the system than those stored by existing models consequently the water head h increases in the system using both the turbine release and the water head lead to generating more energy in upcoming dry seasons in comparison with existing models this is illustrated in fig 5d where the proposed rbdo method releases more water in dry months in which the inflow to the system is lower than normal inflow to the system as shown in fig 5d although in april and may the proposed rbdo method releases less water according to fig 5b the proposed model utilizes the water head to produce more energy in these months 4 2 sixteen reservoir system the design and operation of a large scale hydropower system the 16 reservoir system of karoun in iran is considered in this section to evaluate the capability of the proposed method for maximizing energy yield of large scale systems while meeting pre defined target reliability although the 16 reservoir system of karoun is operated as a multi purpose multi reservoir system the single objective of power generation is considered here to assess the efficiency of the proposed method for solving large scale problems this system of reservoirs has 16 design decision variables along with 9600 operational decision variables leading to a problem with the total number of 9616 decision variables to show the role of the interdependency of design and operation in optimal solving large scale problems two approaches are considered here first given the existing ics presented in table 2 the 16 reservoir problem is optimally operated here by using the proposed rbo model in the other words the problem is treated as an operation problem with pre defined fixed ics in the second approach the proposed rbdo method is employed for simultaneous design and operation of the 16 reservoir problem in both approaches the target reliability is set to 90 as a marketable level of reliability the results obtained by the first and second approaches including the maximum minimum and average monthly energy generation firm and secondary energy along with the system s ic are presented in table 4 since the secondary energy cannot be relied upon the firm energy is valued at a higher price therefore it is desirable to produce more firm energy rather than secondary energy table 4 demonstrates the role of considering simultaneous design and operation by which the secondary energy is converted to firm energy by optimal selection of ics according to this table the proposed rbdo method yields the system s ic equal to 17944 which is 25 more than the existing system s ic as a result using the second approach could increase the firm energy by more than 21 percent in comparison with the first approach which considers pre defined fixed ics additionally the average energy generated increased from 4392 gwh to 4652 gwh about 6 fig 6 compares the energy duration curve obtained by the first and second approaches these curves characterize the ability of the system to produce energy of various magnitudes since the hydropower plants are designed to perform well within the range of higher exceedance probability e g 75 it is preferred to have a higher energy production level in this part of the energy duration curve as it is specifically illustrated for exceedance probability of 90 as a marketable level of producing energy fig 6 proves that the proposed rbdo method outperforms the first approach which is operated by rbo in generating more energy in addition the area under the energy duration curve gives the average generated energy therefore it can be concluded from fig 6 that the proposed rbdo method could produce more energy than energy generation by the first approach only seeking optimal operation considering pre defined ics the monthly changes of mean storage along with inflow to the reservoirs for the most upstream and downstream reservoirs in the system are illustrated in fig 7 as shown in the figure both upstream and downstream reservoirs perform the same in the transition from drawdown to refill seasons the proposed rbdo method creates a balance between turbine discharge r and water head h as the main factors affecting energy production on the verge of drawdown seasons when the system inflow decreases the rbdo method intends to increase the water head reservoir storage to meet one of the main factors of energy production namelyh this is crucial for steady energy production especially for upstream reservoirs because downstream reservoirs receive more inflows the performance of the proposed rbdo method in designing the system for different target reliabilities is also studied and the results are presented in table 5 the table shows the calculated system s ic the system s firm energy and the number of design steps for model convergence and corresponding run time it is seen from the table that the higher level of target reliability the less firm energy is produced as expected the extraordinarily low run time for different target reliabilities demonstrates the efficiency of the model to solve large scale hydropower design and operation problems this efficiency is due to the efficiency of both the design and operation methodology the efficiency of the design method is indicated in fig 8 showing that a maximum of three steps is needed by the proposed model to converge for all reliability levels starting from an initial system s ic calculated by equation 8 fig 9 illustrates the two nested iterative processes used for handling the design and operation phases of the problem for the target reliability of 90 in this figure part a represents the design phase in which the method could achieve the optimal solution with only two steps given the ic of the system determined at each step of the design phase the rbo is used to determine the optimal operation of the system the convergence curves of the operation objective function along with the system reliability are shown in fig 9b and 9c fig 9b indicates that the iterative process of rbo for solving the operation problem converges to a solution with a reliability of 88 5 which is lower than target reliability and therefore not acceptable at the next design step the system s ic is modified using equation 12 and the operation problem is resolved with the convergence curve illustrated in fig 9c as shown in the figure the iterative process of rbo converges to an operational solution with a reliability of 90 which is equal to the target reliability therefore the convergence criterion is met and the algorithm is terminated 5 summary and conclusions typically a majority of the existing methods for the design of multi hydropower systems unable to consider the interdependency between design planning and operation management furthermore large scale design and operation problems require a burdensome computational cost to be dealt with this paper proposes a method to overcome the drawbacks of existing models in addressing such problems this is achieved through developing a reliability based design and operation rbdo model for designing large scale hydropower systems the problem at hand is decomposed into two phases rbdo benefits from the capabilities of ca in the operational phase while the design phase is handled by a purposive iterative procedure the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model are demonstrated by solving two systems with different levels of complexities a three reservoir system namely the khersan system is selected to validate the proposed model over the existing results and the improvement is quantified then a sixteen reservoir large scale hydropower system including 9616 decision variables is considered to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving large scale real world problems the results showed that the proposed rbdo model is capable of finding the optimal solution within negligible run time the model s effectiveness can be mainly attributed to considering interdependency between design and operation and the efficiency can be assigned to the efficient features of ca and the purposive iterative manner of design phase credit authorship contribution statement m azizipour conceptualization methodology data curation writing

3832,in recent years cellular automata ca has emerged as a powerful tool for solving optimization problems in water resources engineering and in particular reservoir operation problems this study utilizes the capabilities of the ca based method to maximize the firm energy yield of multi reservoir hydropower systems installed capacities ics are selected as decision variables in the design phase and be determined in an iterative procedure the reservoir storages at the beginning and the end of the periods are used as the decision variables in the operation phase and be calculated by the ca the process starts with specifying an arbitrary initial installed ic for each reservoir determined based on long term average annual inflow then the system is optimally operated to maximize the energy yield under user specified reliability of the system using a hybrid approach cellular automata simulating annealing ca sa the system s ics are then increased decreased depending on whether the system s energy yield reliability is greater less than the target reliability this iterative process lasts till the system s energy yield reliability is equal to the target reliability the proposed method is used to optimally design the three reservoir khersan hydropower system and also the largest hydropower reservoir system in iran composed of 16 reservoirs the results are presented and compared with those of the existing methods in the literature the results show that the proposed method can be efficiently and effectively used for improving the firm energy yield of real world multi reservoir hydropower systems keywords reliability based firm energy hydropower design and operation multi reservoir cellular automata 1 introduction clean and renewable energy production is an essential task to meet the world s energy demands hydropower plants are environmentally friendly infrastructures to produce electricity from a renewable energy source these systems however require a great amount of initial investment therefore optimizing the complex design and operation of hydropower systems calls for the development of more efficient and accurate optimization methods for this purpose the optimal design and operation of hydropower reservoirs is one of the most complex optimization problems in water resources due to its non convexity nonlinearity and more importantly scale of the problem generally optimal design and operation of hydropower reservoir systems require the determination of a wide range of variables including design decision variables such as installed capacity ic minimum operating level mol normal water level nwl penstock diameters and more importantly operation policy of the reservoirs over a long enough period of operation the optimal operation policies for energy generation can be classified into two different categories i rule based operation policies where the release from the reservoir is determined by a priori known operation policy ii free rule optimal operation policies which releases from the reservoir over the horizon operation are determined by using an optimization method in the first approach the solutions may not be optimal for the case considered though having less computational cost while the latter approach can lead to achieving optimal operational variables in the cost of more computational effort in the first category various rule based approaches for the hydropower reservoir operation have been proposed such as modified standard operation policy sop tayebiyan et al 2016 hedging rule hr neelakantan and sasireka 2013 zeng et al 2014 sasireka and neelakantan 2017 xu et al 2017 ming et al 2017a ming et al 2017b wang et al 2019 and linear and nonlinear decision rules fallah mehdipour et al 2013 ahmadianfar et al 2019 feng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 he et al 2020 many studies used the second approach and employed different optimization algorithms for reservoir operation with the objective of maximizing energy generation e g yurtal et al 2005 li and wei 2008 choong et al 2017 feng et al 2018 ming et al 2017a b moeini et al 2017 niu et al 2018 sharifi et al 2013 sun et al 2016 yoo 2009 zhang et al 2016

soghrati and moeini 2020 zhou et al 2020 li et al 2020 hatamkhani and moridi 2021 despite the rich literature in the field of hydropower reservoir operation there have been few studies in the field of hydropower systems design and most existing design methods are unable to simultaneously consider the interdependency between design planning and operation management mortazavi naeini et al 2014 tian et al 2018 existing approaches in the field of integrated design and operation of hydropower systems fall under two categories in the first category a priori known operation policy is assumed and the problem is solved for the design decision variables resulting in a problem with reduced numbers of decision variables in fact using a given operation policy can convert operational decision variables to state variables making the problem easier to solve but the optimality of solutions would be questionable some researchers used this approach for the design and operation of hydropower systems afzali et al 2008 extended the reliability based simulation rbs model which is commonly used for the single reservoir design problems for optimal ic determination of multi reservoir hydropower systems by introducing a single period optimization sub model for determining the optimal releases from reservoirs at each time period to maximize the firm energy production they conclude that using a single period optimization sub model could significantly improve the results in comparison with the original rbs model zadeh et al 2016 proposed an optimization method for the design and operation of cascade hydropower systems they employed pso to determine optimal design decision variables and the sequential streamflow routing ssr was used for reservoir operation yazdi and moridi 2018 employed sop for the multi objective optimization of the reservoir as well as optimal design and operation of hydropower systems hatamkhani et al 2020 developed a simulation optimization model using weap software due to weap s limitations a new module was developed and added to weap to simulate the operation problem and coupled with pso to choose design decision variables hatamkhani et al 2021 coupled invasive weed optimization iwo with weap software for optimal design and operation of a hydropower reservoir while using a priori known operation policy makes the problem much easier it may lead to sub optimal solutions since the assumed operation policy may not be optimal for the case considered as an alternative approach in the second category of existing approaches design and operation decision variables are determined simultaneously leading to the development of a problem with a scale much larger than the first approach s problem this approach is expected to normally yield solutions superior to that of the first approach since all of the decision variables are determined at the same time rare studies in the field of integrated design and operation of hydropower systems can be attributed to the complexity of the resulting problem haddad et al 2008 considered the simultaneous design and operation of single and multi reservoir hydropower systems using the honeybee mating optimization hbmo algorithm haddad et al 2013 developed an optimization model to simultaneously determine the reservoir capacity ic and penstock diameter as design parameters along with the plant factor and reservoir storage volume at each time step as the operation decision variables bertoni et al 2019 proposed an integrated framework to address simultaneous dam sizing and operation problems all of these studies used evolutionary algorithms for solving the design and operation of hydropower problems however it is well known that the downside of the evolutionary algorithms is their computational burden especially for the large scale problems moreover these studies incorporated the interdependency of design and operation of small scale hydropower systems while real world problems are generally large scale hydropower systems that should be dealt with this study aims at proposing an effective and efficient method for reliability based design and operation of multi hydropower systems both optimal solution production and computational cost are the main concerns of the present study for the design and operation of large scale real world hydropower systems these are achieved through employing the capabilities of a ca based method for reliability based design and operation rbdo of multi reservoir hydropower systems to maximize firm energy production ics are used as the decision variables for the design phase determined in an iterative manner while the reservoir storages at the beginning and the end of the period are used as the operation decision variables determined by ca the process starts with an arbitrary selection of an initial ic for each reservoir based on the average annual inflow over sufficiently long operation periods the system is then optimally operated using a ca based model namely the cellular automata simulated annealing method ca sa to find the optimal values of the operation decision variables by maximizing the system s firm energy production the system ics are then increased decreased depending on whether the system s energy yield reliability is greater less than the target reliability this process is iterated until the system s energy yield reliability is equal to the target reliability the proposed method is validated in two different case studies the first one is the three reservoir khersan hydropower system in iran and the second is the largest hydropower reservoir system in iran with including 16 reservoirs results are presented and compared with those of the existing methods in the literature revealing a great improvement by the proposed method which can more efficiently and effectively optimize the design and operation of real world multi reservoir hydropower systems 2 optimal design and operation of multi reservoir hydropower systems proper selection of power plants ics which yields the best economic performance is of great importance in designing the hydropower multi reservoir systems the energy production of a multi reservoir system is a function of power plants ics as well as hydrologic variability of inflow to the reservoirs a long and sufficient hydrological period of data is needed and should be considered in the study to evaluate any candidate set of ics and to analyze the performance of the system for the selected candidate since there are many alternative sets of ics which satisfy problem

the efficiency of the hydropower plant of the kth reservoir h k t is the effective head on the kth power plant at time step t and rel taregt is the target reliability to solve the problem defined by equations 1 to 7 by using the proposed method the problem is decomposed into the design phase and operation phase which are interconnected the decision variables in the design phase ics are determined through an iterative procedure given the system s ics the ca sa optimization method is used for identifying decision variables in the operation phase reservoirs storages 2 1 design phase the ic of the system is determined such that the hydropower operation of the reservoir meets the target reliability the procedure of determining ic starts with calculating an initial ic for each reservoir as 8 ic k

horizon h ave is the average water elevation e k is the efficiency of the hydropower plant k pf k is the power plant factor of the reservoir k nh is the number of hours per month it should be noted that the final systems ic ic system is calculated as the summation of all ics of reservoirs in the system once the initial ics for all reservoirs are determined using equation 8 the system is operated by solving the problem via a ca based approach to maximize the system s energy which leads to the calculation of system storage volumes and the release volumes from each reservoir over the whole operation periods considering the release volumes of each reservoir are known the system s energy yield reliability rel system is defined as the percentage of periods in which the system is able to produce energy more than or equal to the system s firm energy as follows 9 rel system t 1 t z t t 10 z t 1 k 1 k e k t k 1 k fe k t 0 o t h e r w i s e where the rel system is the calculated reliability of the system t is the time step and t is the total number of time steps it is generally accepted that for a fixed operation policy the system reliability decreases increases if the system ic increases decreases this means that if the calculated system reliability rel system was greater smaller than the required reliability the system s ic ic system would increase decrease here the following iterative relation is developed in this study to update the value of the systems ic at each step based on the current ic and corresponding reliability ic system step 1 ic system step 1 ic

previous step rel system step is the system s energy yield reliability in the current step and rel target is the target reliability it is clear that if the updated system ic is greater smaller than the current system ic the ics of the reservoirs should be increased decreased so the raised question would be how to distribute the updated system ic surplus deficit among the problem s decision variables namely the reservoirs ics here a novel method is used in which the system total ic surplus deficit is distributed among the reservoirs proportional to the total deficit of produced energy from the firm energy defined as 13 ic k step 1 1 td k k 1 k 1 td k a b s ic system step 1 ic system step ic k step 14 ic k step 1 ic k step td k k 1 k td k abs i c system step 1 ic system step with 15

deficit of produced energy in meeting the firm energy at the reservoir k the flowchart of the proposed rbdo model is shown in fig 1 2 2 operation problem hydropower operation of multi reservoir systems is one of the complex problems to solve due to its nonlinear non convex and large scale nature since conventional methods are long known to be incompetent in solving these types of problems evolutionary algorithms have been used and shown to successfully handle the complexity of these problems at the expense of significant computational cost particularly when the population based methods are used a novel hybrid cellular automata simulated annealing ca sa method is proposed in this study which avoids the shortcomings of the existing conventional and evolutionary methods for the optimal hydropower operation of multi reservoir systems in this problem the objective function is formed as the sum of the positive deviation of the produced power from the ic for each hydropower plant as

where a b c and d are constant coefficients the produced total firm energy at period t is calculated as follows 26 fe t k 1 k ic k pf k nh t the operation problem defined by equations 17 to 26 is solved here using the ca sa approach the method has been introduced by azizipour et al 2020 for maximizing the energy production of hydropower multi reservoir systems a modified form of the method however has to be adopted here to account for the reliability constraints of the design problem this feature has not been considered in the original version in what follows the reliability based ca sa operation method rbo is briefly introduced more information can be found in azizipour et al 2020 2 2 1 ca component application of ca to any optimization problem requires defining the four basic components of the ca namely cell cell state cell neighbors and updating rule the cells cell states and the cell neighbor are co related and the selection of either leads to the definition of other components in optimization problems the decision variables are often considered as the cell state afshar and shahidi 2009 showed that proper selection of cell state yields a more efficient and effective ca model they reported that in reservoir operation problems the storage volume is a better choice as the cell state of the corresponding ca model in this study therefore the cells are considered as discrete points in time represented by the beginning or the end of each period so that the corresponding storage volumes can be assumed as the cell states for an operation problem over t periods this leads to t 1 cells with corresponding cell states cell neighbors are naturally considered as the surrounding cells which means that each internal cell has two neighbors except boundary cells t 1 and t t 1 which have only one neighbor definition of updating rule as the most crucial component of ca is the final step of formulating the ca approach for the underlying problem here the localized property of the reservoir storage and the underlying operation problem is used for driving the updating rule the local updating rule for the cell t is defined by the problem of finding the updated value of cell state s t such that the cost of system operation is minimized while neighboring state values s t 1 and s t 1 are kept constant this leads to the following optimization sub problem with a size equal to the number of reservoirs in the system as the local updating rule which has to be solved for the cell state s t 27 minimizef local k 1 k i c k p k t 1 i c k p k t α c s v o csv r 0 5 where f local is the local cost function α is the penalty coefficient for the operational and reliability constraints csv o and csv r are the operational and reliability constraint violations respectively defined by 28 csv o j t 1 t k 1 k csv o k j min c s v o k j max 29 csv r j t 1 t csv r j 30 csv r j m a x fe j e j 1 0 31 csv o k j min m a x 1 r k t r k t min 0 32 csv o k j max m a x r k t r k t max 1 0 the proposed ca process starts with a set of randomly initial guess for the cell states reservoir storages denoted by s t old at all periods of operation the local rule defined by equations 27 to 32 is used to find the updated value of the cell state denoted by s t new for all periods in turn using the current values of the neighboring cell states once all cell states are updated the old cell state values are replaced by the new updated values and the process is continued until the convergence is achieved no improvement in the cell states are made 2 2 2 sa component simulated annealing sa as a stochastic search technique was developed by kirkpatrick et al 1983 the technique s name and inspiration are adopted from the annealing process used in metallurgical processes which involves heating and controlled cooling of material for maximizing its strength and minimizing its brittleness heating and cooling the materials affect the temperature and thermodynamic free energy the rate of cooling dictates the magnitude of decrease in the energy with slower cooling producing a bigger decrease in energy as an optimization technique sa finds a particular configuration of the system such that minimizes the energy of the system in other words each particle in the material is located such that the thermodynamic free energy is minimized in the problem under consideration each particle represents a solution the configuration of the system is defined by decision variables namely storage volumes and the energy of the system is evaluated by the benefit function sa has some free parameters including initial temperature the decrement rate of temperature or cooling mechanism the number of transitions at each temperature and the final temperature as the stopping criteria of the algorithm these parameters play important role in the performance of sa and should be defined carefully li and wei 2008 the large values of initial temperature allow the algorithm to thoroughly explore the search space and increase the probability of finding better solutions however a too big initial temperature leads to higher computational time on the other hand too small values of initial temperature limit the algorithm to a smaller search space at each temperature particles are allowed to move to a new position such that to achieve the minimum possible energy the search process of sa can be considered as a markov chain whose length is defined by the number of movements allowed at the current temperature tospornsampan et al 2005 the new position is accepted or rejected according to an acceptance criterion defined by 33 μ m i n 1 exp e m 1 e m t i in which µ is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 the new position is accepted if the inequality 33 is satisfied and rejected otherwise here em 1 and em are the energy of the particle in consecutive movements and ti is the temperature at the i th iteration after reaching the maximum number of movements the temperature is decreased the performance of sa is highly dependent on the cooling rate sa interprets cooling as decreasing the acceptance probability of worse solutions while exploring the search space the higher acceptance probability leads to higher computational time while the lower acceptance probability decreases the effectiveness of the algorithm here the cooling process is defined as 34 t i 1 α i t 0 where ti 1 and t0 are temperatures of the current iteration and initial temperature respectively and α is the cooling rate which ranges between 0 8 and 0 99 as suggested by kirkpatrick et al 1983 the flowchart of the proposed rbo for hydropower reservoir operation and inter relation between ca and sa is presented in fig 2 the process starts with creating initial random solutions for the ca at each iteration of ca the sub problem defined by equations 27 to 32 is solved by sa using the current solution as the sa starting point as shown in the flowchart the cooling schedule of sa is handled during ca iterations in other words the temperature is changed only during ca iterations and therefore the sub problems defined by equations 27 to 32 for each cell of the problem is solved with a constant temperature following some preliminary runs cooling rate α and initial temperature t 0 are set to 0 98 and 105 respectively the number of movements at each temperature is limited to 10 for computational efficiency the new points are also produced using the annealingfast function of matlab once all sub problems equal to the number of cells are solved at each iteration of the ca the cell states are updated simultaneously and the process is continued at the end of each ca iteration the results are checked for convergence and the algorithm is stopped if converged otherwise the temperature is decreased using equation 34 and the new ca iteration is started the proposed iterative process is continued until the convergence criterion is met in this study the convergence criterion is met when there is no significant improvement in the values of the objective function in two consequent ca iterations 2 3 rbs model rbs is a commonly used method to evaluate the energy generation potential in single and multi reservoir systems the process begins with an arbitrary ic and the system is operated with ssr considering operational constraints to specify the reliability of energy yield the estimated ic is then changed until the obtained reliability is equal to target reliability afzali et al 2008 developed a multi reservoir rbs using a single period optimization sub model for determining the optimal releases from reservoirs at each time period to maximize the firm energy production more details about both models can be found in afzali et al 2008 3 case study the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for reliability based design and operation rbdo of hydropower systems is demonstrated on two cases of three reservoir and sixteen reservoir systems located in the southwest of iran the three reservoir khersan system is used to compare the results of the proposed method with those existing in the literature afzali et al 2008 the capability of the proposed rbdo model for solving large scale design and operation problems is investigated by sixteen reservoir problem 3 1 three reservoir system the khersan river is a 225 km long river in the southwest of iran that runs from yasuj mountains and ranges to its confluence with karoun river in khuzestan province the river is mainly fed by marbareh and garmroud as well as many other headwaters and tributaries three dams of khersan3 khersan2 and khersan1 are planned to be built on the river for hydropower generation and flood control purposes the main characteristic presented in table 1 afzali et al 2008 fig 3 also shows monthly inflow to the most upstream reservoir khersan3 for a horizon period of 41 years 3 2 sixteen reservoir system the karoun river is the longest river in the country in the southwest of iran draining a catchment area of about 67 000 km2 there are seven large dams on the karoun river and more nine dams are planned to be constructed on the river the location of the sixteen reservoir system in the map of iran is shown in fig 4 table 2 presents the main characteristic of the reservoirs and the distribution of monthly inflow to the system is illustrated in fig 5 a 4 results and discussion in this section the results of two different case studies are presented first the results of the three reservoir khersan hydropower system are shown and compared with those existing results to show the effectiveness of the proposed rbdo model afterward obtained results of a large scale hydropower system namely 16 reservoir are introduced to prove the capability of the model to solve large scale real world hydropower systems 4 1 three reservoir system for the three reservoir system there are three design decision variables namely ic of the reservoirs and 1476 operational decision variables leading to a problem with the total number of 1479 decision variables the proposed rbdo method is used to determine the optimal system s ic and resulting system s firm energy for different mols considering the target reliability of 90 which is known as a marketable reliability level the results are presented in table 3 this table also compares the results of rbdo with those obtained by rbs and the proposed method of afzali et al 2008 this table indicates that the proposed rbdo model is able to produce more system firm energy in comparison with rbs and afzali s best model in different mols such a significant improvement can be attributed to using the proposed optimization method called the rbo to optimally determine the operational decision variables while the rbs model utilizes standard operation policy sop to operate the model afzali et al 2008 tried to improve the results by employing a single period optimization model and they succeeded to improve the results in comparison with the rbs model however according to table 3 there is a substantial difference between rbdo results and the model proposed by afzali et al 2008 the table also indicates that in both proposed rbdo and afzali et al 2008 the highest energy production occurs when the mol is considered as 1390 1205 and 981 for khersan 3 khersan 2 and khersan 1 respectively these mols are therefore selected as the optimum mol for three reservoirs it should be noted that the rbs model suggested 10 m higher level as the best mol than those proposed by rbdo as seen in table 3 the ic of the system determined by the proposed method for mols below the optimum ones 1390 1205 and 981 masl remains constant and equal to that obtained for optimum mols which is in contrast with the results obtained by rbs and afzali s model 2008 while lowering the mol enlarges the search space of the problem it does not change the optimal solution which has already been determined as optimum mols moreover the best obtained system s ic by the proposed rbdo afzali s model 2008 and rbs are 1470 1332 and 1234 respectively it shows that the proposed rbdo method could increase the system s ic by about 11 and 19 in comparison with those obtained by afzali s model 2008 and rbs respectively and consequently produces more firm energy it is of interest to note that not only the proposed rbdo method could produce superior solutions to the existing results in the literature but also requires significantly low computational effort the runtime of the proposed rbdo method was as low as 350 s for all cases considered in table 3 this achievement is ascribed to the purposive design iterative manner and the capability of cellular automata concept for rapid convergence the monthly distribution of the system s total energy obtained by rbs afzali s model 2008 and the proposed rbdo method are illustrated in fig 5b as shown in the fig 5b for all models more inflow to the system leads to more energy production in this regard the proposed rbdo method outperforms the existing methods in producing energy in all months this is due to the capability of the proposed rbdo method in spill management the mean monthly spill volume from the reservoirs and the mean monthly release from turbines are shown in fig 5c and 5d respectively as illustrated in fig 5c the proposed rbdo method is able to store more water in the system than those stored by existing models consequently the water head h increases in the system using both the turbine release and the water head lead to generating more energy in upcoming dry seasons in comparison with existing models this is illustrated in fig 5d where the proposed rbdo method releases more water in dry months in which the inflow to the system is lower than normal inflow to the system as shown in fig 5d although in april and may the proposed rbdo method releases less water according to fig 5b the proposed model utilizes the water head to produce more energy in these months 4 2 sixteen reservoir system the design and operation of a large scale hydropower system the 16 reservoir system of karoun in iran is considered in this section to evaluate the capability of the proposed method for maximizing energy yield of large scale systems while meeting pre defined target reliability although the 16 reservoir system of karoun is operated as a multi purpose multi reservoir system the single objective of power generation is considered here to assess the efficiency of the proposed method for solving large scale problems this system of reservoirs has 16 design decision variables along with 9600 operational decision variables leading to a problem with the total number of 9616 decision variables to show the role of the interdependency of design and operation in optimal solving large scale problems two approaches are considered here first given the existing ics presented in table 2 the 16 reservoir problem is optimally operated here by using the proposed rbo model in the other words the problem is treated as an operation problem with pre defined fixed ics in the second approach the proposed rbdo method is employed for simultaneous design and operation of the 16 reservoir problem in both approaches the target reliability is set to 90 as a marketable level of reliability the results obtained by the first and second approaches including the maximum minimum and average monthly energy generation firm and secondary energy along with the system s ic are presented in table 4 since the secondary energy cannot be relied upon the firm energy is valued at a higher price therefore it is desirable to produce more firm energy rather than secondary energy table 4 demonstrates the role of considering simultaneous design and operation by which the secondary energy is converted to firm energy by optimal selection of ics according to this table the proposed rbdo method yields the system s ic equal to 17944 which is 25 more than the existing system s ic as a result using the second approach could increase the firm energy by more than 21 percent in comparison with the first approach which considers pre defined fixed ics additionally the average energy generated increased from 4392 gwh to 4652 gwh about 6 fig 6 compares the energy duration curve obtained by the first and second approaches these curves characterize the ability of the system to produce energy of various magnitudes since the hydropower plants are designed to perform well within the range of higher exceedance probability e g 75 it is preferred to have a higher energy production level in this part of the energy duration curve as it is specifically illustrated for exceedance probability of 90 as a marketable level of producing energy fig 6 proves that the proposed rbdo method outperforms the first approach which is operated by rbo in generating more energy in addition the area under the energy duration curve gives the average generated energy therefore it can be concluded from fig 6 that the proposed rbdo method could produce more energy than energy generation by the first approach only seeking optimal operation considering pre defined ics the monthly changes of mean storage along with inflow to the reservoirs for the most upstream and downstream reservoirs in the system are illustrated in fig 7 as shown in the figure both upstream and downstream reservoirs perform the same in the transition from drawdown to refill seasons the proposed rbdo method creates a balance between turbine discharge r and water head h as the main factors affecting energy production on the verge of drawdown seasons when the system inflow decreases the rbdo method intends to increase the water head reservoir storage to meet one of the main factors of energy production namelyh this is crucial for steady energy production especially for upstream reservoirs because downstream reservoirs receive more inflows the performance of the proposed rbdo method in designing the system for different target reliabilities is also studied and the results are presented in table 5 the table shows the calculated system s ic the system s firm energy and the number of design steps for model convergence and corresponding run time it is seen from the table that the higher level of target reliability the less firm energy is produced as expected the extraordinarily low run time for different target reliabilities demonstrates the efficiency of the model to solve large scale hydropower design and operation problems this efficiency is due to the efficiency of both the design and operation methodology the efficiency of the design method is indicated in fig 8 showing that a maximum of three steps is needed by the proposed model to converge for all reliability levels starting from an initial system s ic calculated by equation 8 fig 9 illustrates the two nested iterative processes used for handling the design and operation phases of the problem for the target reliability of 90 in this figure part a represents the design phase in which the method could achieve the optimal solution with only two steps given the ic of the system determined at each step of the design phase the rbo is used to determine the optimal operation of the system the convergence curves of the operation objective function along with the system reliability are shown in fig 9b and 9c fig 9b indicates that the iterative process of rbo for solving the operation problem converges to a solution with a reliability of 88 5 which is lower than target reliability and therefore not acceptable at the next design step the system s ic is modified using equation 12 and the operation problem is resolved with the convergence curve illustrated in fig 9c as shown in the figure the iterative process of rbo converges to an operational solution with a reliability of 90 which is equal to the target reliability therefore the convergence criterion is met and the algorithm is terminated 5 summary and conclusions typically a majority of the existing methods for the design of multi hydropower systems unable to consider the interdependency between design planning and operation management furthermore large scale design and operation problems require a burdensome computational cost to be dealt with this paper proposes a method to overcome the drawbacks of existing models in addressing such problems this is achieved through developing a reliability based design and operation rbdo model for designing large scale hydropower systems the problem at hand is decomposed into two phases rbdo benefits from the capabilities of ca in the operational phase while the design phase is handled by a purposive iterative procedure the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model are demonstrated by solving two systems with different levels of complexities a three reservoir system namely the khersan system is selected to validate the proposed model over the existing results and the improvement is quantified then a sixteen reservoir large scale hydropower system including 9616 decision variables is considered to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving large scale real world problems the results showed that the proposed rbdo model is capable of finding the optimal solution within negligible run time the model s effectiveness can be mainly attributed to considering interdependency between design and operation and the efficiency can be assigned to the efficient features of ca and the purposive iterative manner of design phase credit authorship contribution statement m azizipour conceptualization methodology data curation writing

3833,compared with a single drought event compound drought i e two or more droughts occurring simultaneously has more substantial effects on economic growth water resources and the ecological environment a useful framework for assessing compound drought events from a drought propagation perspective was proposed the framework includes the definition identification and risk assessment of compound drought we defined compound drought as a drought event from a drought propagation perspective when meteorological drought and hydrological drought occur simultaneously the standardized streamflow index ssi and standardized precipitation index spi were used to represent hydrological and meteorological drought respectively by applying a certain truncation threshold of run theory the compound drought events in the time series were identified and characterized according to their duration and severity five univariate distribution functions i e log normal exponential gamma weibull and pareto and four bivariate copula models i e gaussian clayton frank and gumbel were used for fitting both the duration and severity of compound drought and their joint return periods a 40 year monthly streamflow and precipitation dataset from the dongjiang river basin which is located on the southern coast of china was used as a case study the characteristics of compound drought including duration and severity were captured by considering the time continuity of meteorological and hydrological droughts from a drought propagation perspective based on run theory the most severe compound droughts in the study area were observed in 1963 and 2004 2005 the characteristics of compound drought duration and severity were related to the timescale of the drought index i e ssi and spi for the study basin the spi at a 2 3 month timescale better matched the ssi on the monthly timescale compared with other timescales the gaussian copula function better characterized the joint return periods between the duration and severity of compound drought compared with three other copula models although reservoir regulation played an important role in decreasing the duration lower by 8 25 and severity lower by 9 27 of compound drought it had little effect on extreme compound drought events overall the results indicated that the proposed method provides a useful tool for statistical assessments of compound drought from a drought propagation perspective this framework could also be applied to other regions keywords compound drought hydrological drought meteorological drought drought propagation reservoir dongjiang river basin 1 introduction droughts have threatened economic growth ecological health and the security of water resources throughout human history liu et al 2018 schubert et al 2016 zeng et al 2021 in recent decades severe drought events including the 2009 2010 southwest china drought yang et al 2012 2012 2015 california drought aghakouchak et al 2014 and 2016 extreme drought in the horn of africa qu et al 2019 have resulted in considerable losses to agriculture ecosystems and water resources the extensive impacts of recent droughts at regional and global scales highlight the urgent need to improve drought diagnosis and identification in order to mitigate the impacts of drought aghakouchak et al 2020 yu zhai 2020 the main factor causing drought is a lack of precipitation where the lack of precipitation propagates through the hydrological cycle and causes different types of drought including meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought mishra singh 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological drought is characterized by a precipitation deficit during a particular period and is closely related to other types of droughts the occurrence of agricultural or forest drought depends on prevailing soil moisture conditions which might delay the onset of meteorological drought hydrological drought occurs when a precipitation shortage affects surface runoff and results in river streamflow deficits which affect water usage by society hydrological drought is usually referred to as the most severe type of drought linsley et al 1982 socio economic drought refers to the imbalance between incoming water and social water use shi et al 2018 propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought is typically referred to as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 eltahir yeh 1999 several previous studies have examined the propagation process or the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought using various statistical analyses e g correlation analysis non linear relationship and run theory jehanzaib et al 2020a lorenzo moreno et al 2013 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 these studies have shown that propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought is a crucial feature for drought prevention and mitigation especially given anticipated changes associated with climate warming jehanzaib et al 2020a jehanzaib kim 2020 for example jehanzaib et al 2020a evaluated the impact of climate warming on drought propagation using multi model ensemble projections across south korea and found that the propagation probability increased significantly under climate change wu et al 2021a wu et al 2021b showed that drought propagation is related not only to the drought index timescale but also to the conversion of rainfall into effective streamflow magnitude in addition some researchers have studied propagation dynamics after the formation of hydrological drought hydrological drought propagation has been separated into development and recovery processes parry et al 2016 for example wu et al 2018a assessed the dynamic evolution of hydrological drought propagation and noted that factors affecting hydrological drought propagation are complex and include not only meteorological and basin properties but also human water regulation activities huang et al 2021 explored drought recovery patterns over the yangtze river basin china and found seasonal differences in drought recovery patterns they suggested thatforests in the yangtze river basin require near normal precipitation to achieve full recovery from drought whereas grasslands recover after receiving approximately 50 of the long term average precipitation a number of studies have provided important insights into drought propagation and its effects huang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020b however these studies have focused on meteorological drought and hydrological drought separately or hydrological drought formed following meteorological drought e g the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the simultaneous occurrence of meteorological drought and hydrological drought i e compound drought has received less attention by comparison after meteorological drought transitions to hydrological drought meteorological drought is likely still present van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2018a hence compound drought occurs when both meteorological drought and hydrological drought co exist during a particular period in natural situations meteorological drought is the external driving force of hydrological drought mishra singh 2010 that is hydrological drought is often triggered because of meteorological drought which leads to compound drought consequently compound droughts are inevitable and may cause serious water shortages that negatively affect the ecological environment to a greater extent than a single drought type i e meteorological or hydrological drought aghakouchak et al 2020 vogel et al 2021 yu zhai 2020 thus the assessment of compound drought is important for drought prevention and mitigation and for ensuring the safety of water resources the health of the ecological environment and sustainable economic development despite the fact that the adverse effects of compound drought may be more significant than those of a single drought type few studies have examined the evolution of compound drought drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al l 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are typically used to identify meteorological drought the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 and standardized runoff index sri shukla wood 2008 are derived from the spi and they are typically used to indicate hydrological drought the sri focuses on the surface runoff of catchments whereas the ssi is calculated using streamflow for river channels wu et al 2019 these standardized drought indexes are more widely used than other indexes because they require fewer input data and can be applied at multiple timescales mishra singh 2010 however timescale is key for the ability of drought indexes to identify compound drought for example hydrological drought typically lags meteorological drought van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2018a wu et al 2021a consequently selecting an appropriate timescale where the meteorological drought index matches the timescale of the hydrological drought index is particularly important for identifying compound drought in addition droughts are characterized by multiple features such as duration d severity s and intensity i which can be extracted from a continuous or discrete drought index time series by considering a particular truncation level tl of run theory mishra singh 2010 the drought properties of the truncated events are not only individual random processes but they also affect each other tu et al 2018 that is a sequence of events is a multivariate random process with multivariate dependence chang et al 2016 consequently copula functions which can model random variables and their dependence and multivariate joint distributions as well as their joint return periods have been widely used in multivariate drought studies chebana and ouarda 2021 chang et al 2016 huang et al 2021 tu et al 2018 given the ubiquity of human impacts on the terrestrial hydrosphere it is difficult to find a watershed that is not affected by human activities haddeland et al 2014 that is human activities such as land use change the construction and operation of reservoirs or water extraction for irrigation intensify or adjust the complicated response of the hydrological process to climatic conditions cooley et al 2021 jehanzaib et al 2020b wu et al 2017 in particular the construction and operation of large reservoirs i e total capacity 100 million m3 have been shown to significantly affect hydrological processes cooley et al 2021 rottler et al 2020 and modify the propagation of drought from meteorological to hydrological drought aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016 because meteorological drought and hydrological drought can occur simultaneously compound drought may strain the water supply there is thus a need to examine the relationship between compound drought and the regulation of large reservoirs this study was initiated to develop a framework for assessing compound drought events from a drought propagation perspective by considering the temporal continuity of drought the components of the framework are as follows i definition of compound drought and identification of its characteristics d s and i from a drought propagation perspective ii assessment of the multivariate joint distributions as well as their joint return periods and iii determination of the effect of the regulation of large reservoirs on compound drought this framework enhances our knowledge of drought especially compound drought and could be used to aid the timely warning of drought and the need for drought relief 2 methodology 2 1 overview our methodological framework includes three steps fig 1 step 1 define compound drought from a drought propagation perspective step 2 identify compound drought based on hydrometeorological variables this step includes two parts the first is to select the timescale of hydrological and meteorological drought indices because hydrological drought responds to meteorological drought in a specific manner lorenzo moreno et al 2013 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the timescale for meteorological drought needs to match the timescale for hydrological drought wu et al 2021a after selecting timescales for the drought indices hydrological and meteorological drought are identified and the characteristics of compound drought are extracted for use in subsequent analysis step 3 evaluate the evolution of compound drought characteristics including d s and i as well as their joint return periods with copula functions e g gaussian clayton frank and gumbel finally we use a comparative analysisto analyze the impact of reservoir regulation on compound drought fig 1 shows the schematic flowchart for the proposed methodological framework that is described below 2 2 definition and identification of compound drought 2 2 1 definition of compound drought we define compound drought from a drought propagation perspective that is the continuous process underlying the simultaneous occurrence of hydrological drought and meteorological drought because the onset time of hydrological drought usually lags the onset of meteorological drought and meteorological drought ends before the end of hydrological drought huang et al 2017 mishra singh 2010 wu et al 2018b we use the start time of hydrological drought i e hd st in step 1 of fig 1 to define the onset time of compound drought i e cd st in step 1 of fig 1 and the end of meteorological drought i e md tt in step 1 of fig 1 as the end time of compound drought i e cd tt in step 1 of fig 1 as not all meteorological droughts will lead to hydrological drought sometimes hydrological drought and meteorological drought are independent mishra singh 2010 for example more than one independent meteorological drought might occur within a hydrological drought here we refer to overlapping hydrological drought and meteorological drought events as compound drought 2 2 2 identifying the characteristics of compound drought 1 standardized drought indices ssi and spi were calculated by fitting a specific cumulative probability density function to long term monthly streamflow and precipitation records 30 years the monthly streamflow and precipitation data were then transformed into a standard normal distribution for the actual ssi and spi series mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 here the log normal probability density functions were used to calculate the ssi and spi series because previous studies in southern china e g jinjiang dongjiang and xijiang river basins have indicated that the log normal distribution function is a better fit for both the monthly precipitation and streamflow records for calculating spi and ssi compared with other functions wu et al 2018b niu et al 2015 the dryness wetness levels from spi and ssi were 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 0 1 5 0 5 1 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 1 0 1 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 which correspond to extreme wet severe wet moderate wet mild wet normal mild dry moderate dry severe dry and extreme dry respectively mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 the start and end times of meteorological drought and hydrological drought were identified by the 0 thresholds of ssi and spi the 0 threshold of spi or ssi was used because it is used to indicate the precipitation or streamflow anomalies for a region mishra singh 2010 the start and end times of compound drought were identified based on the definition of compound drought we do not present details of the ssi and spi calculations as they are described in detail elsewhere mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 1 selection of the timescale for drought indices ssi and spi can be calculated at different timescales or time units such as 1 month 3 month and 12 month values mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 the different timescales reflect different hydrological and meteorological events and thus different drought characteristics wu et al 2018b to clearly describe the characteristics of compound droughts we examined the monthly timescale of ssi i e ssi 1 and used the pearson correlation coefficient pcc analysis method to identify the spi timescale with the maximum correlation tmax with the ssi 1 time series fig 1 we then used these timescales to extract the compound droughts barker et al 2016 hellwig et al 2020 this approach was motivated by the fact that anomalies in the monthly streamflow and the accumulation of the precipitation anomaly significantly differ among timescales hellwig et al 2020 thus an appropriate timescale for the accumulation of precipitation anomaly is needed to calculate meteorological drought to calculate tmax by the pcc method streamflow and the precipitation time series were standardized using the standardization procedure of ssi and spi the spi precipitation time series was standardized for different accumulation periods spi n where n stands for the accumulation period in months e g ranging from 1 to 12 the ssi time series was correlated with each of the spi n time series the n with the largest pcc value was selected as tmax and the appropriate timescale for the meteorological drought was determined 2 identification of compound drought characteristics based on run theory the characteristics of compound drought including d s and i were extracted by run theory yevjevich 1967 according to run theory if the drought index in a certain month falls below the drought threshold the month is considered a possible drought month if the drought index series i e ssi or spi less than 0 for a certain period remains below the threshold i e for at least 3 months this period is considered a drought event thus the d of compound drought was defined as the period from the start of hydrological drought to the end of meteorological drought in addition the negative value of the difference between the drought indices and drought threshold at each time point was referred to as the drought i of each month the cumulative i during drought d is defined as drought s the equation of s is as follows 1 s hd h d st h d tt ss i i 2 s md m d st m d tt sp i i where shd and smd represent the severity of hydrological and meteorological drought respectively i is a certain month during drought d hdst and hdtt represent the start and end of hydrological drought respectively and mdst and hdtt represent the start and end of meteorological drought respectively the s of compound drought is the sum of drought i within the compound drought according to the definition of compound drought the i of compound drought can be divided into the following three types i the absolute value of ssii minus the absolute value of spii during the compound drought is equal to 0 that is ssii and spii are equal thus ssii or spii are used to represent the compound drought i in the month ii1 ii the absolute value of ssii minus the absolute value of spii during the compound drought is greater than 0 which means that the hydrological drought i in the month is more severe than that of meteorological drought hence the value of spii is used to represent the compound drought i in the month ii2 iii the absolute value of ssii minus the absolute value of spii during the compound drought is less than 0 thus ssii is used to represent the compound drought i in the month ii3 the three corresponding formulas are as follows 3 i i 1 ss i i o r sp i i ss i i sp i i 0 4 i i 2 sp i i ss i i sp i i 0 5 i i 3 ss i i ss i i sp i i 0 the compound drought s was obtained using the following equation 6 s cd c d st c d tt i i 1 i i 2 i i 3 where scd is the severity of compound drought and i is a certain month during compound drought cd st and cd tt represent the start and end of compound drought respectively the relationship between d and s was characterized using a simple linear kernel density model yao and zhao 2013 the violin plots for the kernel probability density distribution for the compound drought d and s were also used hintze and nelson 1998 the linear kernel density and violin plots are used here because they can clearly show the frequency distribution features of sample variables lan et al 2018 3 compound drought return periods based on copula functions after identifying the duration and severity of compound drought based on run theory copula functions were used to combine any two variables e g d and s s and i or s or i chang et al 2016 hao et al 2018a tu et al 2018 here the marginal distribution function of compound drought d and s is first determined and the inter dependence between the two characteristics is estimated tu et al 2018 we evaluated five common three parameter distribution functions i e exponential gamma log normal pareto and weibull for the data for compound drought d and s the kolmogorov smirnov k s test method chakravarti et al 1968 was used to determine the optimal marginal distribution function if the k s test was significant the distribution function with the optimal goodness of fit was used as the marginal distribution type for the compound drought variables here maximum likelihood was used to estimate the parameters of the univariate and bivariate distribution functions we compared common bivariate theoretical copula functions including gaussian copula clayton copula frank copula and gumbel copula the copula function with the highest goodness of fit was determined based on the akaike information criterion aic the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse between the theoretical and empirical distribution functions borgomeo et al 2015 the goodness of fit was higher when the values of aic and rmse were lowest and the nse value was highest the steps for calculating the return periods of drought events using the copula function are based on chang et al 2016 2 3 study area and data processing 2 3 1 study area the dongjiang river basin fig 2 is located in south china and experiences distinct wet and dry seasons approximately 70 80 of the annual precipitation occurs between april and september tu et al 2018 three headwater sub basins of the dongjiang river basin the xinfengjiang qiuxiangjiang and andunshui rivers which experience limited human impacts i e no reservoirs and minimal land use cover changes were selected for this study lin et al 2014 wu et al 2021 the hydrometric control stations for the three sub basins were the yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou stations and the areas that they control are 547 3 1080 and 404 km2 respectively three major reservoirs xinfengjiang fengshuba and baipenzhu which have a storage capacity of 13 9 1 93 and 1 22 billion m3 have been in operation since 1961 1974 and 1986 respectively these three large reservoirs comprise a multi annual regulation reservoir and play key roles in regulating flood control the drinking water supply power generation and drought mitigation for the downstream basin tu et al 2018 wu et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 the outlet control hydrometric station of the dongjiang river basin was boluo station which controls an area of 25 325 km2 streamflow in the mainstream of the basin e g boluo hydrometric station has been affected by the regulation of the reservoirs based on differences between the inflow and outflow of individual reservoirs on a monthly timescale the regulated streamflow series can be converted to an unregulated series tu et al 2018 2 3 2 data processing the data used in this study included both the unregulated and regulated monthly streamflow from 1960 to 2015 for boluo station and monthly streamflow records from 1960 to 2006 for yuecheng and jiuzhou stations and from 1960 to 2015 for the lantang station the monthly precipitation records from 1960 to 2015 for 22 rain stations were also used the original streamflow and precipitation data were obtained from the water resources department of guangdong province china https gddata gd gov cn opdata base collect deptcode 15 these streamflow and precipitation data were checked to ensurer data quality and homogeneity when they were used in hydro meteorological statistical analyses in previous studies wu et al 2018b wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 we used streamflow and precipitation records from 1960 to 2006 to make the time series uniform among the four hydrometric stations although the final year that we used was 2006 not extending to the present the length of this time series exceeded 40 years when analyzing compound drought at each hydrometric station rain stations within the control range of each hydrometric station were used the unregulated streamflow data from boluo hydrometric station and the three other hydrometric sub basin stations were used to identify compound drought the impact of reservoir regulation on compound drought was evaluated by comparing the differences in compound drought at the boluo hydrometric station under the presence and absence of reservoir regulation i e unregulated vs regulated 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of the timescale fig 3 a shows the correlation between spi n at different timescales from 1 month to 12 months and ssi on a monthly scale the maximum correlation between spi n and ssi 1 was observed for spi 2 at yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations indicating that the response of hydrological processes to rainfall was approximately 2 months in these tributary hydrometric stations however tmax was observed for spi 3 for the boluo station the outlet control hydrometric station of the dongjiang river basin suggesting that the response of the hydrological process to the rainfall process was 3 months this also suggests that the response of the hydrological process at the outlet hydrometric station was slower than that of the tributary basins this result probably stems from the fact that the catchment area controlled by the outlet hydrometric station was larger than that of the tributary hydrometric station that is the size of the basin is positively correlated to the rapidity of the hydrological process response to meteorological processes wu et al 2020 fig 3 b shows the time series of ssi and the corresponding spi n which was selected based on tmax the spi time series was consistent with the monthly ssi time series at the boluo yucheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations 3 2 identification of compound drought using the boluo hydrometric station i e the outlet station as a case study to analyze the evolution of compound drought fig 4 a frequent meteorological and hydrological droughts were concentrated in the 1960s 1990s and after the 2000s the upper sub figure in fig 4a in addition compound droughts were more severe in these periods e g see the periods for january 1963 to october 1963 april 1991 to august 1991 and may 2004 to february 2005 the longest duration d 10 months and the most severe s 10 48 compound drought occurred from may 2004 to february 2005 the lower sub figure in fig 4a compound droughts are more complicated than a single drought i e a single meteorological or hydrological drought fig 4 b shows the temporal evolution of three typical compound drought events in the first compound drought event from january 1963 to october 1963 the meteorological drought began in november 1962 and the hydrological drought began in january 1963 thereafter the compound drought developed the meteorological drought and thus the compound drought ended in october 1963 but the hydrological drought continued for 3 more months and did not end until january 1964 the formation and termination of this compound drought event represent a typical drought evolution process because of the hysteresis effect between the hydrological process and the precipitation process hydrological drought usually lags meteorological drought huang et al 2017 mishra singh 2010 wu et al 2018b in addition hydrological drought recovery is slower compared with meteorological drought recovery this pattern was also observed in the other two compound droughts i e april to august of 1991 and may 2004 to february 2005 fig 5 illustrates the compound drought events based on run theory and the drought threshold the total number of compound droughts at the boluo yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations are 35 56 54 and 53 respectively the duration of most compound drought events was less than 3 months there were fewer compound drought events at yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou stations than the boluo station because hydrological drought events at yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou stations consisted of multiple discontinuous drought events compound drought events occurred almost every year and this response reflects the climate characteristics of the study basin for example approximately 70 80 of the annual precipitation occurs in the wet season i e from april to september in the dry season i e from october to march compound drought can easily develop because of the reduced precipitation tu et al 2018 water shortages caused by seasonal droughts are a major water security issue in these regions he et al 2018 the number of compound drought events with a d greater than 3 months at the boluo hydrometric station was 12 during 1960 2006 although there were 16 12 and 13 compound drought events in yucheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations respectively the difference in the number of compound droughts at different stations reflects the spatial heterogeneity of drought characteristics huang et al 2017 parry et al 2016 wu et al 2018a table 1 lists the characteristics of all compound drought events with a d of more than three months the d and s of each compound drought event including events of less than 3 months in duration were also determined and used in the following analysis 3 3 characteristics of the linear distribution for compound drought duration and severity fig 6 indicates that there is a strong linear relationship between the d and s of compound drought as d increases the corresponding s also increases the coefficient of determination r 2 for the linear relationship at the different hydrometric stations varied which may be related to differences in the catchment attributes as mentioned above based on the kernel density and violin plots smaller d and s for compound droughts corresponded to a denser kernel density distribution indicating that compound droughts in the study area were mainly short in duration i e 1 3 months similar to fig 5 the average d and s in the tributary hydrometric stations i e yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou differed more than the average d and s for the outlet hydrometric station i e boluo suggesting that differences in the characteristics of compound droughts were influenced by differences in hydrometeorological processes the average d and s for compound drought were greater at the outlet hydrometric station compared to the tributary sites the average d at the outlet station was 2 57 months and the average s was 2 36 by contrast the average compound drought d among the three tributaries was 2 03 months range from 2 00 to 2 07 months and the average s was 1 93 range from 1 85 to 2 01 3 4 return periods of compound drought events fig 7 indicates that the theoretical distribution of compound drought d and s fits well with the optimal univariate distribution function all the optimal distributions passed the k s test p less than 0 01 hence both the compound drought d and s were consistent with the optimal distribution among the eight optimal marginal distribution functions i e two variables multiplied by four hydrometric stations five were log normal two were weibull and one was the gamma distribution like the streamflow distribution most of the optimal univariate distribution functions for compound drought d and s were log normal in south china niu et al 2015 in addition the d and s values were highly correlated fig 6 hence a copula function was used to determine the joint distribution function for the compound drought d and s in the dongjiang river basin table 2 shows the goodness of fit of different copula functions in the dongjiang river basin the three goodness of fit indicators for the gaussian function were superior to those of other functions for example the aic and rmse values for the gaussian function were the lowest and the nse was the highest among the four copula functions the optimal copula functions were selected and used to represent the joint distribution functions for the compound drought features i e d and s here the gaussian copula function provided the best fit in the dongjiang river basin fig 8 illustrates the return periods based on the optimal copula function based on the joint distribution probability the most severe compound drought at the boluo hydrometric station occurred from january 1963 to october 1963 which was characterized by a d of 10 months s of 14 47 and return period longer than 20 years but less than 25 years for yuecheng hydrometric station the most severe compound drought event occurred from april 2004 to january 2005 which was characterized by a d of 8 months s of 8 30 and return period close to 20 years for lantang hydrometric station the most severe compound drought occurred from february 1963 to october 1963 which was characterized by a d of 9 months s of 13 74 and return period close to 50 years for jiuzhou hydrometric station the most severe compound drought occurred from january 1963 to june 1963 which was characterized by a d of 6 months s of 8 69 and return period of 50 years the difference in the return period among the different hydrometric stations may result from the difference in joint probability distribution associated with the differences in the compound drought events chang et al 2016 tu et al 2018 3 5 effects of reservoir regulation on compound drought duration and severity we used the unregulated streamflow unregulated and observed streamflow regulated at boluo hydrometric station to compare differences in the characteristics d and s of compound drought fig 9 shows that the average compound drought d and s were lower in the presence of reservoir regulation compared to the absence of reservoir regulation the average d and s of compound drought were 2 57 months and 2 48 under unregulated streamflow respectively however the average d and s decreased to 2 36 months and 2 25 respectively under regulated streamflow the operation of the reservoir reduced the average d and s of compound drought at boluo hydrometric station by 8 17 and 9 27 respectively comparison of the box plots indicates that reservoir regulation has little effect on the duration of severe compound drought events but reduces their severity in general the reservoirs can alleviate compound drought in the study basin 3 6 discussion compound drought features can be characterized by considering the time continuity of drought from a drought propagation perspective previous studies have largely focused on exploring the evolutionary characteristics of a single drought type chang et al 2016 tu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 herein we proposed a framework for identifying and evaluating compound drought although the dongjiang river basin in south china was used as a case study the methods associated with our framework are based on commonly used concepts or functions that have been widely used in regions worldwide thus our framework for identifying and assessing compound drought is widely applicable the proposed framework has two main advantages first we used standardized drought indices to characterize meteorological and hydrological drought events the standardized drought indices represent dimensionless features mishra singh 2010 thus the characteristics of compound drought events are comparable in time and space a standardized drought index that spans multiple timescales permits the re expression of the hydrological drought index timescale such that correlation analysis can be used to identify the meteorological drought index timescale that best alignes with the hydrological drought index timescale fig 3b this approach facilitates the identification of compound drought although composite drought indices have been developed by considering multivariable indicators meteorological agricultural and hydrological variables huang et al 2015 hao et al 2016 waseem et al 2015 a simple drought index is used here to exploreg compound droughts second we extracted several features of compound drought by accounting for the time continuity of drought we classified these features into three different types when extracting compound drought intensity which permitted the identification and evaluation of compound drought previous studies on compound drought and heatwaves have only analyzed compound drought events based on the occurrence probability from an extreme event perspective without considering their time continuity features e g geirinhas et al 2021 hao et al 2018b vogel et al 2021 yu zhai 2020 besides conventional univariate and bivariate copula functions were used to assess the return or recovery periods of compound drought events univariate and bivariate copula functions have been shown to be effective for drought risk assessment in various regions of the world chebana and ouarda 2021 chang et al 2016 huang et al 2021 tu et al 2018 the proposed framework also has some limitations for example the mechanism s underlying the evolution of compound drought cannot be determined from our proposed framework previous studies have proposed that the local atmosphere can play an important role in the formation of drought human activities such as land use and land cover change irrigation and reservoir regulation directly impact the evolution of hydrological drought by altering hydrological processes in the watershed cooley et al 2021 haddeland et al 2014 wu et al 2017 which in turn may affect the evolution of compound drought fig 9 despite the large number of human activities than can affect hydrological processes we only analyzed the impacts of reservoir regulation on compound drought in our case study reservoir regulation basin our study did not evaluate the potential effects of climate change and other human activities on compound drought because there is no reliable method for distinguishing the relative contributions of these factors to the formation of compound drought our previous studies in the dongjiang river basin have shown that reservoir regulation tends to increase water availability during drought periods by decreasing water availability during wet periods which decreases the duration of hydrological drought and reduces drought intensity wu et al 2018b reservoir regulation in the study basin might also reduce the duration and severity of compound drought fig 9 in our proposed framework the evolution of meteorological drought and hydrological drought are the only factors considered in the determination of compound drought however a framework where meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought are all considered should be explored in future studies the evolution of compound drought under the influence of natural and human activities also requires attention 4 conclusions a framework that includes the definition identification and a risk assessment of compound drought was proposed standardized drought indices ssi and spi were used to combine signals associated with hydrological and meteorological drought respectively to estimate compound drought characteristics including the duration severity and intensity after considering the time continuity of drought using run theory and copula functions the joint return recovery period associated with the duration and severity of compound drought was quantitatively determined additionally the effects of large reservoir regulation on the characteristics of compound drought were reported through a case study the characteristics of compound drought can be determined by using a drought propagation perspective and by considering the time continuity of drought there was a strong linear correlation between the duration and severity of compound drought and a gaussian copula function was the best function for characterizing the return periods from compound drought in the study basin reservoirs tended to shorten the duration of compound drought and mitigate the severity of compound drought furthermore there were substantial differences in the characteristics of compound drought in the mainstream i e boluo hydrometric station compared to the tributaries that were associated with spatial heterogeneity in the hydrology of the watershed areas

3833,compared with a single drought event compound drought i e two or more droughts occurring simultaneously has more substantial effects on economic growth water resources and the ecological environment a useful framework for assessing compound drought events from a drought propagation perspective was proposed the framework includes the definition identification and risk assessment of compound drought we defined compound drought as a drought event from a drought propagation perspective when meteorological drought and hydrological drought occur simultaneously the standardized streamflow index ssi and standardized precipitation index spi were used to represent hydrological and meteorological drought respectively by applying a certain truncation threshold of run theory the compound drought events in the time series were identified and characterized according to their duration and severity five univariate distribution functions i e log normal exponential gamma weibull and pareto and four bivariate copula models i e gaussian clayton frank and gumbel were used for fitting both the duration and severity of compound drought and their joint return periods a 40 year monthly streamflow and precipitation dataset from the dongjiang river basin which is located on the southern coast of china was used as a case study the characteristics of compound drought including duration and severity were captured by considering the time continuity of meteorological and hydrological droughts from a drought propagation perspective based on run theory the most severe compound droughts in the study area were observed in 1963 and 2004 2005 the characteristics of compound drought duration and severity were related to the timescale of the drought index i e ssi and spi for the study basin the spi at a 2 3 month timescale better matched the ssi on the monthly timescale compared with other timescales the gaussian copula function better characterized the joint return periods between the duration and severity of compound drought compared with three other copula models although reservoir regulation played an important role in decreasing the duration lower by 8 25 and severity lower by 9 27 of compound drought it had little effect on extreme compound drought events overall the results indicated that the proposed method provides a useful tool for statistical assessments of compound drought from a drought propagation perspective this framework could also be applied to other regions keywords compound drought hydrological drought meteorological drought drought propagation reservoir dongjiang river basin 1 introduction droughts have threatened economic growth ecological health and the security of water resources throughout human history liu et al 2018 schubert et al 2016 zeng et al 2021 in recent decades severe drought events including the 2009 2010 southwest china drought yang et al 2012 2012 2015 california drought aghakouchak et al 2014 and 2016 extreme drought in the horn of africa qu et al 2019 have resulted in considerable losses to agriculture ecosystems and water resources the extensive impacts of recent droughts at regional and global scales highlight the urgent need to improve drought diagnosis and identification in order to mitigate the impacts of drought aghakouchak et al 2020 yu zhai 2020 the main factor causing drought is a lack of precipitation where the lack of precipitation propagates through the hydrological cycle and causes different types of drought including meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought mishra singh 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological drought is characterized by a precipitation deficit during a particular period and is closely related to other types of droughts the occurrence of agricultural or forest drought depends on prevailing soil moisture conditions which might delay the onset of meteorological drought hydrological drought occurs when a precipitation shortage affects surface runoff and results in river streamflow deficits which affect water usage by society hydrological drought is usually referred to as the most severe type of drought linsley et al 1982 socio economic drought refers to the imbalance between incoming water and social water use shi et al 2018 propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought is typically referred to as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 eltahir yeh 1999 several previous studies have examined the propagation process or the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought using various statistical analyses e g correlation analysis non linear relationship and run theory jehanzaib et al 2020a lorenzo moreno et al 2013 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 these studies have shown that propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought is a crucial feature for drought prevention and mitigation especially given anticipated changes associated with climate warming jehanzaib et al 2020a jehanzaib kim 2020 for example jehanzaib et al 2020a evaluated the impact of climate warming on drought propagation using multi model ensemble projections across south korea and found that the propagation probability increased significantly under climate change wu et al 2021a wu et al 2021b showed that drought propagation is related not only to the drought index timescale but also to the conversion of rainfall into effective streamflow magnitude in addition some researchers have studied propagation dynamics after the formation of hydrological drought hydrological drought propagation has been separated into development and recovery processes parry et al 2016 for example wu et al 2018a assessed the dynamic evolution of hydrological drought propagation and noted that factors affecting hydrological drought propagation are complex and include not only meteorological and basin properties but also human water regulation activities huang et al 2021 explored drought recovery patterns over the yangtze river basin china and found seasonal differences in drought recovery patterns they suggested thatforests in the yangtze river basin require near normal precipitation to achieve full recovery from drought whereas grasslands recover after receiving approximately 50 of the long term average precipitation a number of studies have provided important insights into drought propagation and its effects huang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020b however these studies have focused on meteorological drought and hydrological drought separately or hydrological drought formed following meteorological drought e g the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the simultaneous occurrence of meteorological drought and hydrological drought i e compound drought has received less attention by comparison after meteorological drought transitions to hydrological drought meteorological drought is likely still present van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2018a hence compound drought occurs when both meteorological drought and hydrological drought co exist during a particular period in natural situations meteorological drought is the external driving force of hydrological drought mishra singh 2010 that is hydrological drought is often triggered because of meteorological drought which leads to compound drought consequently compound droughts are inevitable and may cause serious water shortages that negatively affect the ecological environment to a greater extent than a single drought type i e meteorological or hydrological drought aghakouchak et al 2020 vogel et al 2021 yu zhai 2020 thus the assessment of compound drought is important for drought prevention and mitigation and for ensuring the safety of water resources the health of the ecological environment and sustainable economic development despite the fact that the adverse effects of compound drought may be more significant than those of a single drought type few studies have examined the evolution of compound drought drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al l 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are typically used to identify meteorological drought the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2012 and standardized runoff index sri shukla wood 2008 are derived from the spi and they are typically used to indicate hydrological drought the sri focuses on the surface runoff of catchments whereas the ssi is calculated using streamflow for river channels wu et al 2019 these standardized drought indexes are more widely used than other indexes because they require fewer input data and can be applied at multiple timescales mishra singh 2010 however timescale is key for the ability of drought indexes to identify compound drought for example hydrological drought typically lags meteorological drought van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2018a wu et al 2021a consequently selecting an appropriate timescale where the meteorological drought index matches the timescale of the hydrological drought index is particularly important for identifying compound drought in addition droughts are characterized by multiple features such as duration d severity s and intensity i which can be extracted from a continuous or discrete drought index time series by considering a particular truncation level tl of run theory mishra singh 2010 the drought properties of the truncated events are not only individual random processes but they also affect each other tu et al 2018 that is a sequence of events is a multivariate random process with multivariate dependence chang et al 2016 consequently copula functions which can model random variables and their dependence and multivariate joint distributions as well as their joint return periods have been widely used in multivariate drought studies chebana and ouarda 2021 chang et al 2016 huang et al 2021 tu et al 2018 given the ubiquity of human impacts on the terrestrial hydrosphere it is difficult to find a watershed that is not affected by human activities haddeland et al 2014 that is human activities such as land use change the construction and operation of reservoirs or water extraction for irrigation intensify or adjust the complicated response of the hydrological process to climatic conditions cooley et al 2021 jehanzaib et al 2020b wu et al 2017 in particular the construction and operation of large reservoirs i e total capacity 100 million m3 have been shown to significantly affect hydrological processes cooley et al 2021 rottler et al 2020 and modify the propagation of drought from meteorological to hydrological drought aghakouchak et al 2021 van loon et al 2016 because meteorological drought and hydrological drought can occur simultaneously compound drought may strain the water supply there is thus a need to examine the relationship between compound drought and the regulation of large reservoirs this study was initiated to develop a framework for assessing compound drought events from a drought propagation perspective by considering the temporal continuity of drought the components of the framework are as follows i definition of compound drought and identification of its characteristics d s and i from a drought propagation perspective ii assessment of the multivariate joint distributions as well as their joint return periods and iii determination of the effect of the regulation of large reservoirs on compound drought this framework enhances our knowledge of drought especially compound drought and could be used to aid the timely warning of drought and the need for drought relief 2 methodology 2 1 overview our methodological framework includes three steps fig 1 step 1 define compound drought from a drought propagation perspective step 2 identify compound drought based on hydrometeorological variables this step includes two parts the first is to select the timescale of hydrological and meteorological drought indices because hydrological drought responds to meteorological drought in a specific manner lorenzo moreno et al 2013 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the timescale for meteorological drought needs to match the timescale for hydrological drought wu et al 2021a after selecting timescales for the drought indices hydrological and meteorological drought are identified and the characteristics of compound drought are extracted for use in subsequent analysis step 3 evaluate the evolution of compound drought characteristics including d s and i as well as their joint return periods with copula functions e g gaussian clayton frank and gumbel finally we use a comparative analysisto analyze the impact of reservoir regulation on compound drought fig 1 shows the schematic flowchart for the proposed methodological framework that is described below 2 2 definition and identification of compound drought 2 2 1 definition of compound drought we define compound drought from a drought propagation perspective that is the continuous process underlying the simultaneous occurrence of hydrological drought and meteorological drought because the onset time of hydrological drought usually lags the onset of meteorological drought and meteorological drought ends before the end of hydrological drought huang et al 2017 mishra singh 2010 wu et al 2018b we use the start time of hydrological drought i e hd st in step 1 of fig 1 to define the onset time of compound drought i e cd st in step 1 of fig 1 and the end of meteorological drought i e md tt in step 1 of fig 1 as the end time of compound drought i e cd tt in step 1 of fig 1 as not all meteorological droughts will lead to hydrological drought sometimes hydrological drought and meteorological drought are independent mishra singh 2010 for example more than one independent meteorological drought might occur within a hydrological drought here we refer to overlapping hydrological drought and meteorological drought events as compound drought 2 2 2 identifying the characteristics of compound drought 1 standardized drought indices ssi and spi were calculated by fitting a specific cumulative probability density function to long term monthly streamflow and precipitation records 30 years the monthly streamflow and precipitation data were then transformed into a standard normal distribution for the actual ssi and spi series mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 here the log normal probability density functions were used to calculate the ssi and spi series because previous studies in southern china e g jinjiang dongjiang and xijiang river basins have indicated that the log normal distribution function is a better fit for both the monthly precipitation and streamflow records for calculating spi and ssi compared with other functions wu et al 2018b niu et al 2015 the dryness wetness levels from spi and ssi were 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 0 1 5 0 5 1 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 1 0 1 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 which correspond to extreme wet severe wet moderate wet mild wet normal mild dry moderate dry severe dry and extreme dry respectively mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 the start and end times of meteorological drought and hydrological drought were identified by the 0 thresholds of ssi and spi the 0 threshold of spi or ssi was used because it is used to indicate the precipitation or streamflow anomalies for a region mishra singh 2010 the start and end times of compound drought were identified based on the definition of compound drought we do not present details of the ssi and spi calculations as they are described in detail elsewhere mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 1 selection of the timescale for drought indices ssi and spi can be calculated at different timescales or time units such as 1 month 3 month and 12 month values mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2012 the different timescales reflect different hydrological and meteorological events and thus different drought characteristics wu et al 2018b to clearly describe the characteristics of compound droughts we examined the monthly timescale of ssi i e ssi 1 and used the pearson correlation coefficient pcc analysis method to identify the spi timescale with the maximum correlation tmax with the ssi 1 time series fig 1 we then used these timescales to extract the compound droughts barker et al 2016 hellwig et al 2020 this approach was motivated by the fact that anomalies in the monthly streamflow and the accumulation of the precipitation anomaly significantly differ among timescales hellwig et al 2020 thus an appropriate timescale for the accumulation of precipitation anomaly is needed to calculate meteorological drought to calculate tmax by the pcc method streamflow and the precipitation time series were standardized using the standardization procedure of ssi and spi the spi precipitation time series was standardized for different accumulation periods spi n where n stands for the accumulation period in months e g ranging from 1 to 12 the ssi time series was correlated with each of the spi n time series the n with the largest pcc value was selected as tmax and the appropriate timescale for the meteorological drought was determined 2 identification of compound drought characteristics based on run theory the characteristics of compound drought including d s and i were extracted by run theory yevjevich 1967 according to run theory if the drought index in a certain month falls below the drought threshold the month is considered a possible drought month if the drought index series i e ssi or spi less than 0 for a certain period remains below the threshold i e for at least 3 months this period is considered a drought event thus the d of compound drought was defined as the period from the start of hydrological drought to the end of meteorological drought in addition the negative value of the difference between the drought indices and drought threshold at each time point was referred to as the drought i of each month the cumulative i during drought d is defined as drought s the equation of s is as follows 1 s hd h d st h d tt ss i i 2 s md m d st m d tt sp i i where shd and smd represent the severity of hydrological and meteorological drought respectively i is a certain month during drought d hdst and hdtt represent the start and end of hydrological drought respectively and mdst and hdtt represent the start and end of meteorological drought respectively the s of compound drought is the sum of drought i within the compound drought according to the definition of compound drought the i of compound drought can be divided into the following three types i the absolute value of ssii minus the absolute value of spii during the compound drought is equal to 0 that is ssii and spii are equal thus ssii or spii are used to represent the compound drought i in the month ii1 ii the absolute value of ssii minus the absolute value of spii during the compound drought is greater than 0 which means that the hydrological drought i in the month is more severe than that of meteorological drought hence the value of spii is used to represent the compound drought i in the month ii2 iii the absolute value of ssii minus the absolute value of spii during the compound drought is less than 0 thus ssii is used to represent the compound drought i in the month ii3 the three corresponding formulas are as follows 3 i i 1 ss i i o r sp i i ss i i sp i i 0 4 i i 2 sp i i ss i i sp i i 0 5 i i 3 ss i i ss i i sp i i 0 the compound drought s was obtained using the following equation 6 s cd c d st c d tt i i 1 i i 2 i i 3 where scd is the severity of compound drought and i is a certain month during compound drought cd st and cd tt represent the start and end of compound drought respectively the relationship between d and s was characterized using a simple linear kernel density model yao and zhao 2013 the violin plots for the kernel probability density distribution for the compound drought d and s were also used hintze and nelson 1998 the linear kernel density and violin plots are used here because they can clearly show the frequency distribution features of sample variables lan et al 2018 3 compound drought return periods based on copula functions after identifying the duration and severity of compound drought based on run theory copula functions were used to combine any two variables e g d and s s and i or s or i chang et al 2016 hao et al 2018a tu et al 2018 here the marginal distribution function of compound drought d and s is first determined and the inter dependence between the two characteristics is estimated tu et al 2018 we evaluated five common three parameter distribution functions i e exponential gamma log normal pareto and weibull for the data for compound drought d and s the kolmogorov smirnov k s test method chakravarti et al 1968 was used to determine the optimal marginal distribution function if the k s test was significant the distribution function with the optimal goodness of fit was used as the marginal distribution type for the compound drought variables here maximum likelihood was used to estimate the parameters of the univariate and bivariate distribution functions we compared common bivariate theoretical copula functions including gaussian copula clayton copula frank copula and gumbel copula the copula function with the highest goodness of fit was determined based on the akaike information criterion aic the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse between the theoretical and empirical distribution functions borgomeo et al 2015 the goodness of fit was higher when the values of aic and rmse were lowest and the nse value was highest the steps for calculating the return periods of drought events using the copula function are based on chang et al 2016 2 3 study area and data processing 2 3 1 study area the dongjiang river basin fig 2 is located in south china and experiences distinct wet and dry seasons approximately 70 80 of the annual precipitation occurs between april and september tu et al 2018 three headwater sub basins of the dongjiang river basin the xinfengjiang qiuxiangjiang and andunshui rivers which experience limited human impacts i e no reservoirs and minimal land use cover changes were selected for this study lin et al 2014 wu et al 2021 the hydrometric control stations for the three sub basins were the yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou stations and the areas that they control are 547 3 1080 and 404 km2 respectively three major reservoirs xinfengjiang fengshuba and baipenzhu which have a storage capacity of 13 9 1 93 and 1 22 billion m3 have been in operation since 1961 1974 and 1986 respectively these three large reservoirs comprise a multi annual regulation reservoir and play key roles in regulating flood control the drinking water supply power generation and drought mitigation for the downstream basin tu et al 2018 wu et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 the outlet control hydrometric station of the dongjiang river basin was boluo station which controls an area of 25 325 km2 streamflow in the mainstream of the basin e g boluo hydrometric station has been affected by the regulation of the reservoirs based on differences between the inflow and outflow of individual reservoirs on a monthly timescale the regulated streamflow series can be converted to an unregulated series tu et al 2018 2 3 2 data processing the data used in this study included both the unregulated and regulated monthly streamflow from 1960 to 2015 for boluo station and monthly streamflow records from 1960 to 2006 for yuecheng and jiuzhou stations and from 1960 to 2015 for the lantang station the monthly precipitation records from 1960 to 2015 for 22 rain stations were also used the original streamflow and precipitation data were obtained from the water resources department of guangdong province china https gddata gd gov cn opdata base collect deptcode 15 these streamflow and precipitation data were checked to ensurer data quality and homogeneity when they were used in hydro meteorological statistical analyses in previous studies wu et al 2018b wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 we used streamflow and precipitation records from 1960 to 2006 to make the time series uniform among the four hydrometric stations although the final year that we used was 2006 not extending to the present the length of this time series exceeded 40 years when analyzing compound drought at each hydrometric station rain stations within the control range of each hydrometric station were used the unregulated streamflow data from boluo hydrometric station and the three other hydrometric sub basin stations were used to identify compound drought the impact of reservoir regulation on compound drought was evaluated by comparing the differences in compound drought at the boluo hydrometric station under the presence and absence of reservoir regulation i e unregulated vs regulated 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of the timescale fig 3 a shows the correlation between spi n at different timescales from 1 month to 12 months and ssi on a monthly scale the maximum correlation between spi n and ssi 1 was observed for spi 2 at yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations indicating that the response of hydrological processes to rainfall was approximately 2 months in these tributary hydrometric stations however tmax was observed for spi 3 for the boluo station the outlet control hydrometric station of the dongjiang river basin suggesting that the response of the hydrological process to the rainfall process was 3 months this also suggests that the response of the hydrological process at the outlet hydrometric station was slower than that of the tributary basins this result probably stems from the fact that the catchment area controlled by the outlet hydrometric station was larger than that of the tributary hydrometric station that is the size of the basin is positively correlated to the rapidity of the hydrological process response to meteorological processes wu et al 2020 fig 3 b shows the time series of ssi and the corresponding spi n which was selected based on tmax the spi time series was consistent with the monthly ssi time series at the boluo yucheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations 3 2 identification of compound drought using the boluo hydrometric station i e the outlet station as a case study to analyze the evolution of compound drought fig 4 a frequent meteorological and hydrological droughts were concentrated in the 1960s 1990s and after the 2000s the upper sub figure in fig 4a in addition compound droughts were more severe in these periods e g see the periods for january 1963 to october 1963 april 1991 to august 1991 and may 2004 to february 2005 the longest duration d 10 months and the most severe s 10 48 compound drought occurred from may 2004 to february 2005 the lower sub figure in fig 4a compound droughts are more complicated than a single drought i e a single meteorological or hydrological drought fig 4 b shows the temporal evolution of three typical compound drought events in the first compound drought event from january 1963 to october 1963 the meteorological drought began in november 1962 and the hydrological drought began in january 1963 thereafter the compound drought developed the meteorological drought and thus the compound drought ended in october 1963 but the hydrological drought continued for 3 more months and did not end until january 1964 the formation and termination of this compound drought event represent a typical drought evolution process because of the hysteresis effect between the hydrological process and the precipitation process hydrological drought usually lags meteorological drought huang et al 2017 mishra singh 2010 wu et al 2018b in addition hydrological drought recovery is slower compared with meteorological drought recovery this pattern was also observed in the other two compound droughts i e april to august of 1991 and may 2004 to february 2005 fig 5 illustrates the compound drought events based on run theory and the drought threshold the total number of compound droughts at the boluo yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations are 35 56 54 and 53 respectively the duration of most compound drought events was less than 3 months there were fewer compound drought events at yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou stations than the boluo station because hydrological drought events at yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou stations consisted of multiple discontinuous drought events compound drought events occurred almost every year and this response reflects the climate characteristics of the study basin for example approximately 70 80 of the annual precipitation occurs in the wet season i e from april to september in the dry season i e from october to march compound drought can easily develop because of the reduced precipitation tu et al 2018 water shortages caused by seasonal droughts are a major water security issue in these regions he et al 2018 the number of compound drought events with a d greater than 3 months at the boluo hydrometric station was 12 during 1960 2006 although there were 16 12 and 13 compound drought events in yucheng lantang and jiuzhou hydrometric stations respectively the difference in the number of compound droughts at different stations reflects the spatial heterogeneity of drought characteristics huang et al 2017 parry et al 2016 wu et al 2018a table 1 lists the characteristics of all compound drought events with a d of more than three months the d and s of each compound drought event including events of less than 3 months in duration were also determined and used in the following analysis 3 3 characteristics of the linear distribution for compound drought duration and severity fig 6 indicates that there is a strong linear relationship between the d and s of compound drought as d increases the corresponding s also increases the coefficient of determination r 2 for the linear relationship at the different hydrometric stations varied which may be related to differences in the catchment attributes as mentioned above based on the kernel density and violin plots smaller d and s for compound droughts corresponded to a denser kernel density distribution indicating that compound droughts in the study area were mainly short in duration i e 1 3 months similar to fig 5 the average d and s in the tributary hydrometric stations i e yuecheng lantang and jiuzhou differed more than the average d and s for the outlet hydrometric station i e boluo suggesting that differences in the characteristics of compound droughts were influenced by differences in hydrometeorological processes the average d and s for compound drought were greater at the outlet hydrometric station compared to the tributary sites the average d at the outlet station was 2 57 months and the average s was 2 36 by contrast the average compound drought d among the three tributaries was 2 03 months range from 2 00 to 2 07 months and the average s was 1 93 range from 1 85 to 2 01 3 4 return periods of compound drought events fig 7 indicates that the theoretical distribution of compound drought d and s fits well with the optimal univariate distribution function all the optimal distributions passed the k s test p less than 0 01 hence both the compound drought d and s were consistent with the optimal distribution among the eight optimal marginal distribution functions i e two variables multiplied by four hydrometric stations five were log normal two were weibull and one was the gamma distribution like the streamflow distribution most of the optimal univariate distribution functions for compound drought d and s were log normal in south china niu et al 2015 in addition the d and s values were highly correlated fig 6 hence a copula function was used to determine the joint distribution function for the compound drought d and s in the dongjiang river basin table 2 shows the goodness of fit of different copula functions in the dongjiang river basin the three goodness of fit indicators for the gaussian function were superior to those of other functions for example the aic and rmse values for the gaussian function were the lowest and the nse was the highest among the four copula functions the optimal copula functions were selected and used to represent the joint distribution functions for the compound drought features i e d and s here the gaussian copula function provided the best fit in the dongjiang river basin fig 8 illustrates the return periods based on the optimal copula function based on the joint distribution probability the most severe compound drought at the boluo hydrometric station occurred from january 1963 to october 1963 which was characterized by a d of 10 months s of 14 47 and return period longer than 20 years but less than 25 years for yuecheng hydrometric station the most severe compound drought event occurred from april 2004 to january 2005 which was characterized by a d of 8 months s of 8 30 and return period close to 20 years for lantang hydrometric station the most severe compound drought occurred from february 1963 to october 1963 which was characterized by a d of 9 months s of 13 74 and return period close to 50 years for jiuzhou hydrometric station the most severe compound drought occurred from january 1963 to june 1963 which was characterized by a d of 6 months s of 8 69 and return period of 50 years the difference in the return period among the different hydrometric stations may result from the difference in joint probability distribution associated with the differences in the compound drought events chang et al 2016 tu et al 2018 3 5 effects of reservoir regulation on compound drought duration and severity we used the unregulated streamflow unregulated and observed streamflow regulated at boluo hydrometric station to compare differences in the characteristics d and s of compound drought fig 9 shows that the average compound drought d and s were lower in the presence of reservoir regulation compared to the absence of reservoir regulation the average d and s of compound drought were 2 57 months and 2 48 under unregulated streamflow respectively however the average d and s decreased to 2 36 months and 2 25 respectively under regulated streamflow the operation of the reservoir reduced the average d and s of compound drought at boluo hydrometric station by 8 17 and 9 27 respectively comparison of the box plots indicates that reservoir regulation has little effect on the duration of severe compound drought events but reduces their severity in general the reservoirs can alleviate compound drought in the study basin 3 6 discussion compound drought features can be characterized by considering the time continuity of drought from a drought propagation perspective previous studies have largely focused on exploring the evolutionary characteristics of a single drought type chang et al 2016 tu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 herein we proposed a framework for identifying and evaluating compound drought although the dongjiang river basin in south china was used as a case study the methods associated with our framework are based on commonly used concepts or functions that have been widely used in regions worldwide thus our framework for identifying and assessing compound drought is widely applicable the proposed framework has two main advantages first we used standardized drought indices to characterize meteorological and hydrological drought events the standardized drought indices represent dimensionless features mishra singh 2010 thus the characteristics of compound drought events are comparable in time and space a standardized drought index that spans multiple timescales permits the re expression of the hydrological drought index timescale such that correlation analysis can be used to identify the meteorological drought index timescale that best alignes with the hydrological drought index timescale fig 3b this approach facilitates the identification of compound drought although composite drought indices have been developed by considering multivariable indicators meteorological agricultural and hydrological variables huang et al 2015 hao et al 2016 waseem et al 2015 a simple drought index is used here to exploreg compound droughts second we extracted several features of compound drought by accounting for the time continuity of drought we classified these features into three different types when extracting compound drought intensity which permitted the identification and evaluation of compound drought previous studies on compound drought and heatwaves have only analyzed compound drought events based on the occurrence probability from an extreme event perspective without considering their time continuity features e g geirinhas et al 2021 hao et al 2018b vogel et al 2021 yu zhai 2020 besides conventional univariate and bivariate copula functions were used to assess the return or recovery periods of compound drought events univariate and bivariate copula functions have been shown to be effective for drought risk assessment in various regions of the world chebana and ouarda 2021 chang et al 2016 huang et al 2021 tu et al 2018 the proposed framework also has some limitations for example the mechanism s underlying the evolution of compound drought cannot be determined from our proposed framework previous studies have proposed that the local atmosphere can play an important role in the formation of drought human activities such as land use and land cover change irrigation and reservoir regulation directly impact the evolution of hydrological drought by altering hydrological processes in the watershed cooley et al 2021 haddeland et al 2014 wu et al 2017 which in turn may affect the evolution of compound drought fig 9 despite the large number of human activities than can affect hydrological processes we only analyzed the impacts of reservoir regulation on compound drought in our case study reservoir regulation basin our study did not evaluate the potential effects of climate change and other human activities on compound drought because there is no reliable method for distinguishing the relative contributions of these factors to the formation of compound drought our previous studies in the dongjiang river basin have shown that reservoir regulation tends to increase water availability during drought periods by decreasing water availability during wet periods which decreases the duration of hydrological drought and reduces drought intensity wu et al 2018b reservoir regulation in the study basin might also reduce the duration and severity of compound drought fig 9 in our proposed framework the evolution of meteorological drought and hydrological drought are the only factors considered in the determination of compound drought however a framework where meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought are all considered should be explored in future studies the evolution of compound drought under the influence of natural and human activities also requires attention 4 conclusions a framework that includes the definition identification and a risk assessment of compound drought was proposed standardized drought indices ssi and spi were used to combine signals associated with hydrological and meteorological drought respectively to estimate compound drought characteristics including the duration severity and intensity after considering the time continuity of drought using run theory and copula functions the joint return recovery period associated with the duration and severity of compound drought was quantitatively determined additionally the effects of large reservoir regulation on the characteristics of compound drought were reported through a case study the characteristics of compound drought can be determined by using a drought propagation perspective and by considering the time continuity of drought there was a strong linear correlation between the duration and severity of compound drought and a gaussian copula function was the best function for characterizing the return periods from compound drought in the study basin reservoirs tended to shorten the duration of compound drought and mitigate the severity of compound drought furthermore there were substantial differences in the characteristics of compound drought in the mainstream i e boluo hydrometric station compared to the tributaries that were associated with spatial heterogeneity in the hydrology of the watershed areas

3900 μs cm intermediate layer 35 24 m bgl of 1800 μs cm and top layer 16 3 m bgl of 300 μs cm the first transition zone at depths of 43 35 m bgl was attributed to co2 exsolution in the open system and the subsequent physicochemical changes of wellbore water while the second transition zone at depths of 24 16 m bgl was formed by the precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides with consequent sorption of remaining ions due to a sudden change toward the oxidizing environment the monitoring probe installed at a depth of 20 m bgl was found to be located within the upper transition zone which caused ec peaks when the well was purged at a depth of 25 m bgl for well maintenance twice a year this study shows that automated groundwater monitoring systems may misguide one about the groundwater quality if an unexpected physicochemical variation such as stratification occurs in a monitoring well therefore the presence of interface zones caused by abrupt changes in ec must be carefully considered when an automated monitoring well is designed the screened zone is a suitable location for installing an automated monitoring probe to measure the representative water quality i e ec in particular in an

iron oxy hydroxides precipitation automated monitoring 1 introduction advances in data acquisition and transmission technologies enable one to monitor the physicochemical changes in groundwater in real time jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 with the help of the real time monitoring data e g water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec through wells the water resources managements become cost and labor effective given that collecting water samples and analyzing their hydrochemical and or isotopic compositions in the laboratory is costly time consuming and discontinuous moreover the high resolution and long term monitoring data are used to identify temporal and spatial changing patterns and to plan a sustainable water management strategy giacomoni et al 2013 glasgow et al 2004 the real time automated monitoring is globally applied for the national groundwater monitoring network ngmn jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 which is occasionally complemented with the classical method of collecting groundwater samples and determining their water quality through laboratory analysis in general it is recommended to install well screens at depths that are connected to a target aquifer and to install an automated monitoring probe at depths that represent the aquifer quality these depths are determined by vertical logging of physicochemical parameters through a monitoring well and geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity survey mathany et al 2019 polemio et al 2009 however at many cases the monitoring probes are installed at a depth where maintenance and management are easy which often causes erratic observations bhatti et al 2017 polemio et al 2009 ryuh et al 2017 automated monitoring systems with well screens and monitoring instruments installed at fixed depths also may provide erroneous information about the physicochemical characteristics in groundwater since data is collected at a depth of the monitoring probe while the physicochemical characteristics may vary with depth in a well in particular when distinct water bodies e g brackish water geothermal water acid mine drainage and co2 rich water are irregularly introduced to the well through well screens for instance polemio et al 2009 observed at coastal karstic aquifers in italy that ec fluctuated in a range of 4000 μs cm for a year at the zone where fresh and brackish groundwater were mixed similarly ryuh et al 2017 observed that the ec data fluctuated to a fairly large extent in one of the ngmn wells of south korea fig 1 right after purging for well management and groundwater sampling the daily average ec values rapidly increased from 1116 μs cm up to 2861 μs cm and then dropped to 1309 μs cm within 2 days in october 2013 fig 2 a the purpose of this study is to identify the causes and processes of remarkable physicochemical changes at an automated monitoring well and to suggest an improved practical guide for the automated geochemical monitoring using physicochemical parameters such as ec based on the lesson obtained from a groundwater well of the ngmn in south korea specifically we scrutinized the vertical distribution of physicochemical characteristics including ec in the monitoring well using well logging and imaging analysis identified the causes of physicochemical stratification and then addressed the processes and mechanisms for the perturbation and re stabilization of the stratification with time note that the wellbore water is often considered not to represent the formation water barcelona et al 1983 barcelona and helfrich 1986 powell and puls 1993 representative groundwater samples are collected after sufficient purging the water standing in the well u s osmre 2012 however automated real time monitoring of the wellbore water has been increasingly applied for water resources management with assuming that the wellbore water is representative of the groundwater at least ec and temperature glasgow et al 2004 jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 mathany et al 2019 wagner et al 2006 we compared the groundwater in the monitoring well and the naturally seeping springs near the well to discuss the representativeness of wellbore waters in the automated monitoring system in relation to ec fluctuations see section 5 3 2 study area two monitoring wells are installed in the andong giran station fig 1 one for monitoring a shallow aquifer down to a depth of 10 5 m bgl and the other for monitoring a deep bedrock aquifer down to a depth of 70 m bgl in this study we carefully examined the monitoring data collected from the deep bedrock monitoring well fig 3 a to evaluate the causes and processes of momentary and sharp ec fluctuations e g fig 2 which are not observed at the shallow monitoring well 2 1 geology the andong giran groundwater monitoring station is located in giran myeon county of andong city at the northern part of the cretaceous gyeongsang sedimentary basin gsb of south korea fig 1a sedimentary rocks of the gsb were formed in rivers ephemeral lakes and marshes that had experienced seasonal repetition of drying and wetting events accordingly the basin mainly comprises cretaceous fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary rocks that were ubiquitously intruded by cretaceous to early tertiary intrusive rocks chough et al 2000 triassic to jurassic granitoids also occur in the northern part of the basin based on topographic and depositional environments including tectonic events climate and volcanic activity the sedimentary rocks of the gsb consist of the following four major lithostratigraphic units in ascending order the lower sindong group the middle hayang group the upper yucheon group and the bulguksa granites paik et al 2000 um et al 1983 the geology around the andong giran station is dominated by the hayang group sedimentary rocks fig 1d that represent clastic sandstones and shales deposited in the fluvial and lacustrine environments core logging data of the two monitoring wells for shallow and deep aquifer respectively in the station see www gims go kr show that the aquifer geology consists of sand 0 1 m below ground level bgl gravel 1 5 5 m bgl weathered rock 5 5 10 7 m bgl and shale as bedrock 10 7 m bgl the mineralogy of shale consists of quartz albite kaolinite chlorite illite calcite dolomite and hematite chang 1975 the andong giran station lies on a nw trending strike slip fault called the giran fault co2 rich springs naturally occur near the andong giran station fig 1d in particular along faults or geologic boundaries which may act as conduits to transport deep seated co2 to the shallow subsurface jung et al 2015 kampman et al 2012 lee et al 2019 lewicki et al 2003 specifically co2 rich springs flow out along the fissures of the valley floor at g5 and g10 which are located at the geologic boundary between the hayang group and the triassic granites and between the hayang group and the jurassic granites respectively fig 1d the boreholes drilled to produce co2 rich waters in the g6 region are known to be located along a fault jeong et al 2005 although g6 does not show any direct relationship with faults on fig 1d according to lee et al 2019 strike slip faults penetrate into the mantle through ductile shearing causing mantle derived co2 in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula 2 2 andong giran monitoring station the andong giran monitoring station is one of the ngmn monitoring stations installed and operated by korea water resources corporation kowaco to manage the regional groundwater system based on the monitoring of the overall status of both quantity and quality of groundwater kim et al 1995 the automated real time monitoring system at each monitoring station consists of a monitoring probe at depths of 10 and 20 m bgl respectively for the shallow and deep monitoring well connected to a data logger a remote terminal unit and a solar energy system to supply the electricity for data acquisition and transfer lee and hahn 2006 the groundwater wells and monitoring devices are protected by an outer building fig 1b the screened zone in the shallow well is located at depths between 6 and 10 5 m bgl while those in the deep well are placed at depths of 50 54 58 62 and 66 70 m bgl fig 3a which coincide with the depths of highly fractured zones see www gims go kr three parameters groundwater level temperature and ec are hourly measured by the monitoring probe made up of stainless steels watermate 4100 baytech korea inc the wells are purged for an hour twice a year for well management by kowaco groundwater is sampled during the well purging and its water quality is analyzed to complement automated monitoring data as in other ngmn wells of south korea kim et al 1995 lee et al 2007 a sufficient quantity of water is supplied to the deep monitoring well from the aquifer as the fracture zones are well developed below ca 10 m depth the results of the constant pumping test with all the contributions from the three screened sections showed that hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity of the bedrock aquifer are 0 65 m day and 32 5 m3 day respectively see www gims go kr the daily average groundwater levels in 2013 2016 and 2017 showed small fluctuations 1 6 m in each year with a tendency to slightly increase after heavy rainfall events 20 mm per day with a time lapse of about 1 to 3 days depending on the amount of rainfall fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 physicochemical analyses temporal changes of water temperature and ec at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl in 2013 2016 and 2017 were obtained from the national groundwater information center of south korea www gims go kr in addition vertical well logging was conducted using a multi parameter water quality meter prodss ysi in may july and october 2016 to understand the vertical distribution of physicochemical characteristics in the monitoring well and its temporal variation in relation to momentary ec fluctuations e g fig 2a water temperature depth ph oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do and ec were automatically measured and stored once per second using prodss to cover the whole depth within the 70 m deep well we prepared an 80 m connecting cable customized by ysi and measured physicochemical data along the entire water column by slowly dropping it down into the well in october 2016 the vertical well logging was conducted on the day of purging for well management and performed before and 30 min after purging to assess the effect of purging to the vertical distribution of physicochemical parameters water temperature ph orp do and ec were also measured for the water pumped out from a depth of 25 m to the surface while purging for an hour between 11 40 am to 12 40 pm using the same instrument prodss ysi the pumped water was collected in a bucket letting the water overflow and the physicochemical parameters in the bucket were measured every second to reliably interpret the observed physicochemical change with depth wellbore water samples were collected in july 2016 from five depths in the well table 1 which were set to include three layers bottom intermediate and top and two transition zones dashed squares in fig 4 b based on the well logging and ryuh et al 2017 note that a sample gr 60 m was taken at a depth of 60 m to collect and analyze all the water from the three screened zones given the similar physicochemical properties of water outflowing from the three zones fig 4 the sample represents groundwater inflowing from the same fractured aquifer instead of well purging sampling was performed using a sampling pump ss geosub pump geotech and a separate sampling tube for each sampling depth to avoid mixing of water bodies that may occur during the purging process alkalinity was determined by titration with hno3 solution 0 5 n and 0 05 n in the field concentrations of major cations na k ca2 mg2 sr2 and trace elements al mn fe as ni zn mo u cu were analyzed in filtered and acidified samples at the korea basic science institute kbsi seoul center using icp aes ultima 2 jobin yvon horiba and icp ms elan drcii perkin elmer respectively anions cl and so4 2 were analyzed using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific at the center for mineral resources research of korea university carbon isotope ratios δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in samples were analyzed after precipitation of baco3 by adding bacl2 and naoh the analysis was carried out using a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific at the kbsi daejeon center 3 2 imaging methods and geophysical survey the video record of borehole imaging in the bedrock aquifer monitoring well was obtained in july 2016 with a 3 4 inch borehole video inspection camera geovisiontm nano camera allegheny instruments to confirm unexpected inlets such as fractures or cracks in the wellbore for freshwater influx the camera was mounted on an electric winch with a cable and lowered along the borehole at a speed of 2 22 m min a groundwater sample 2 l was collected from a depth of 23 m and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter to separate suspended materials at the first transition zone for detailed observation of the suspended particles the filter pieces were coated with platinum and then images of the filtered particles were acquired using a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 250 feg fei at the green manufacturing research center gmrc of korea university with the images using sem the chemical composition of the suspended particles was qualitatively analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds electrical resistivity was investigated in march 2016 along the two survey lines fig 1c to identify the geological and hydrogeological setting around the monitoring well and to find out the relationship between geology and hydrochemistry the resistivity data acquisition system used in this survey was a set of terrameter sas 4000 abem sweden and es 10 64c which automatically recorded data using a 41 channel cable 10 m and electrodes i type and t type steel sticks a dipole dipole array was used because of its high resolution the survey lines were 1 km ert 1 and 800 m ert 2 long and used 100 and 80 electrodes respectively the apparent resistivity data were processed with res2dinv geotomo usa electrical resistivity survey analysis software and the active constraint balancing approach for inversion 3 3 computation of thermodynamics the chemical speciation and partial pressure of co2 pco2 were calculated using the computer code phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibrium the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl database was used in addition the stability diagram of fe bearing minerals was constructed by act2 module of the geochemist s workbench release 8 0 bethke and yeakel 2009 the solution density ρ s k g m 3 was also calculated as a function of temperature t c and salinity s g kg to determine the density stratification caused by the vertical distribution of temperature and dissolved solids the density of pure water was determined as a function of temperature t using the thiesen scheel diesselhorst equation maidment 1993 then an empirical relationship between the density of solution containing dissolved solids ρ s and salinity s were used to estimate ρ s maidment 1993 since salinity s was not measured in the present study the ec measured in the vertical logging process was converted to s through an empirical equation between s and a conductivity ratio rt apha 1998 which is valid for s between 2 and 42 g kg here rt is a ratio of the conductivity of a sample at specific temperature t to the conductivity of kcl solution containing a mass of 32 4356 g kcl in a mass of 1 kg of solution 4 results 4 1 fluctuations of automated monitoring data ec data measured at a depth of 20 m bgl in the well to monitor the deep bedrock aquifer showed two stiff peaks every year fig 2 see the real time monitored data at www gims go kr given the ec values in co2 rich springs near the study area table 1 these momentary high ec values did not indicate a device error besides the irregular fluctuations were also shown in water temperature data at similar times fig 2 it is clear that the unusual change in automated ec monitoring of groundwater was arising from the physicochemical changes at the point where the monitoring probe was installed i e 20 m bgl as in fig 3a the high ec peaks were consistent with the dates of groundwater purging at a depth of 25 m for well maintenance molit and kowaco 2014 2017 2018 for instance the ec value at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl increased abruptly from 1450 to 3505 μs cm on the day of purging in april 14 2016 and decreased back to the base level close to 1250 μs cm around 36 h later fig 3b and c a similar pattern was observed at the purging event in oct 13 2016 fig 3d and e the ec value jumped from 443 before purging to 3350 μs cm about 1 h after purging and decreased back to the pre purging level 1265 μs cm 46 h later two ec peaks were also shown in 2017 fig 2c while only a noticeable ec peak was observed in 2013 fig 2a because the purging event in may 2013 was conducted with other studies by ryuh et al 2017 and consequently showed a relatively small ec increase at the monitoring probe it should be noted that the data logger is turned off and thus the monitoring data are missing several hours before and after purging in particular 7 h in fig 3d and 3e for vertical logging in fig 4 thus ryuh et al 2017 personally recorded the ec values at the monitoring depth during purging in may 2013 for an hour and found that the ec values at the monitoring depth 20 m decreased down to below 500 μs cm for 16 min since the purging began and then increased and reached up to 726 μs cm at the end of one hour purging ryuh et al 2017 which will be discussed with the vertical logging data in section 5 2 3 meanwhile the groundwater pumped out at a depth of 25 m showed the continuous increase in ec and temperature for an hour during the purging event in oct 13 2016 fig 5 in addition the ec in fig 5 showed two stepwise increases which will be discussed with the help of the vertical logging result in section 5 2 3 ec increased from below 500 μs cm up to 2500 μs cm 35 min later and the maximum value was maintained similar to that observed by ryuh et al 2017 who measured the ec values of the water pumped out to the surface as well as the ec values of the wellbore water at the monitoring depth during purging in may 2013 the maximum ec 2500 μs cm in fig 5 was smaller than the peak 3350 μs cm one hour after purging at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl in fig 3e probably due to the mixing of water bodies pumped out because the physicochemical parameters were measured in a bucket where pumped water was collected meanwhile ph and orp and do showed sharp increases within 10 min since the purging began and then decreased with time ph and do showed another peak 45 min later these will be discussed based on the vertical well logging result in section 5 2 3 4 2 vertical well logging the vertical distributions of ec ph and orp in the bedrock groundwater monitoring well showed identical stepwise stratifications in all three observations conducted in may july and october before purging of 2016 fig 4 while the water temperature showed different distributions at depths down to about 15 m depending on the observation time indicating the influence by atmospheric temperature however at a depth of about 20 m bgl or deeper the water temperature generally increased up to 16 3 c for the screened zone groundwater in the bottom with increasing depth about 27 c km within the local and global geothermal gradients kim and lee 2007 pollack et al 1993 regardless of observation time fig 4a interestingly the monitoring parameters showed stepwise variations at almost the same depths the monitoring parameter showing the most obvious stepwise distribution was ec fig 4b which divided the groundwater column in the monitoring well into three distinct layers separated by two transition zones based on the vertical profile observed in july 2016 the ec values showed stratification from 300 μs cm for the top layer 3 16 m bgl through between 1700 and 1800 μs cm in the intermediate layer 24 35 m bgl up to 3900 μs cm for the bottom layer 43 70 m bgl starting from the bottom where the screened zone is the first sharp drop in ec was observed at 40 m bgl with 8 m thickness called the first transition zone around that depth ec values decreased quickly to 2000 μs cm the second sudden drop at depths of 24 to 16 m bgl called the second transition zone showed a significant decrease in ec from 1700 to 400 μs cm fig 4b the ph profiles showed an analogous stratified distribution to ec with the opposite trend of increasing ph upward with decreasing ec fig 4c the average ph values of groundwater were 6 27 6 36 and 6 48 in the bottom intermediate and top layer respectively noticeable changes of ph were also observed in the two transition zones as with ec the orp tended to increase gradually from the bottom layer to the intermediate layer and increased abruptly at depths around 25 m bgl i e the second transition zone to 190 mv fig 4d similarly the do began to increase with decreasing depth around 25 m bgl the depths of the two transition zones were observed almost the same in may july and october before purging of 2016 in contrast the vertical logging 30 min after purging in october 2016 showed that the vertical profile was shifted upward causing high ec and temperature but low orp and do at a depth of 20 m bgl fig 4 it is noticeable that the large variation in ec and orp appeared between the two transition zones insignificant ec variations were observed below the first transition while the sudden ec drop was observed around the depth of 15 m bgl above the second transition zone implying the uprising of high ec water to this depth the water at the top showed low ec values even after purging implying the little effect of pumping 4 3 borehole imaging using nano camera and sem the video record of the borehole wall and the wellbore water in it in july 2016 showed that there were no noticeable incoming groundwater points e g borehole cracks other than screens throughout the well however visible changes in wellbore water with depth were observed supplementary fig 1 in the screened zone the incoming groundwater looked clean with no particles or bubbles see 58 m in supplementary fig 1 however after the first drop in ec at a depth of around 40 m bgl we could find the generation of gas bubbles and the formation of greenish precipitates at depths around 35 m bgl see 30 and 40 m in supplementary fig 1 toward the top of the well red to orange colored precipitates were started to appear at the depth around 20 m bgl see 23 m in supplementary fig 1 just after the inflection point of orp in fig 4d in the top layer there were no gas bubbles and colored precipitates see 5 and 15 m in supplementary fig 1 the sem analysis of filtered and dried samples of red colored suspended solids from a depth of 23 m bgl showed a number of aggregates consisting of nano size spherical particles fig 6 such spherical particles with a quite small size are typical of freshly precipitated hydrous ferric oxides hfo particles dzombak and morel 1990 ferris et al 2000 søgaard et al 2000 the results of eds analysis also showed the dominance of iron in these materials fig 6 greenish particles observed at depths around 35 m bgl were not determined by sem eds because the sediments were oxidized as soon as we collected and turned into reddish brown colored particles as the suspended sediments in fig 6 4 4 hydrochemical analysis of wellbore water and electrical resistivity tomography table 1 shows the major ions and trace elements in wellbore water samples collected from five depths in july 2016 as shown in the ec of vertical well logging fig 4b concentrations of dissolved constituents decreased toward the surface notable changes in hydrochemistry occurred between gr 60 m i e the groundwater collected at a depth of 60 m and gr 35 m and between gr 35 m and gr 22 m specifically the concentration of na decreased by about 11 mm from 17 99 to 7 09 mm and those of ca2 mg2 and k also decreased between gr 60 m and gr 35 m as passing through the depth of the first ec drop table 1 fig 4b among trace elements the concentration of fe decreased by 22 41 μm from 43 95 to 21 54 μm because of the huge decrease in dissolved constituents the tds values of wellbore water significantly decreased from 2315 mg l at gr 60 m to 1235 mg l at gr 35 m table 1 the decreases in concentrations of most elements were smaller between gr 35 m and gr 22 m than those between gr 60 m and gr 35 m while the decreases of ca2 total fe and total mn were similar or larger table 1 probably due to their adsorption during the precipitation of hfo see section 5 2 2 the major ions in wellbore water collected from the monitoring well were plotted on the piper diagram fig 7 which characterized the wellbore water between co2 rich springs and deep groundwater nearby the co2 rich springs showed the ca hco3 type while the deep groundwater showed the ca so4 type consistent with previous studies choi et al 2012 showed that deep groundwater in the cretaceous gsb was sulfate rich due to gypsum dissolution and had moderately high pco2 values 10 1 1 to 10 2 4 atm on the other hand most of the co2 rich water belonged to the ca hco3 type in the study area and some were plotted on the area of ca na hco3 type according to jeong et al 2005 the cross sectional electrical resistivity showed the distribution of low resistivity around the screened zones of the deep monitoring well fig 8 implying fractured zones around 20 85 m above sea level which was consistent with the depths of highly fractured zones see section 2 2 the high electrical resistivity on the surface seemed to address the road pavement see fig 1c 5 discussion sources of high ec values and gas bubbles in the wellbore water are discussed section 5 1 and then the hydrochemical processes with depth of groundwater entering through the screened zones are identified section 5 2 in addition the wellbore water quality is compared to the co2 rich spring waters nearby section 5 3 finally an improved guide for the automated regulatory groundwater monitoring system that is often under non ideal geometries is provided based on the learnings from this study section 5 4 5 1 origin of gas bubbles the deep monitoring well was connected to a co2 rich aquifer given the high pco2 of gr 60 m near the screened zones table 1 because co2 should be supplied to the groundwater to show the pco2 of 0 46 atm at 60 m depth carroll et al 1991 marques et al 2006 besides co2 rich springs were observed near the well fig 1d table 1 and relatively high ec values average 1027 μs cm for 2 years from 2016 to 2017 were detected at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl the low resistivity 63 ω m around the screened zones of the deep well fig 8 also supported that the monitoring well was linked to the high ec and co2 rich aquifer that appears locally within the study area because electrical resistivity becomes lower as the ec of a water reservoir is higher carruthers and smith 1992 coscia et al 2011 menció et al 2016 and the dissolution of co2 decreases ph and enhances water rock interactions increasing the ec assayag et al 2009 kharaka et al 2006 the plausible sources of co2 affecting the groundwater chemistry in the subsurface environment could be diverse including organic carbon decomposition dissolution of carbonate minerals and deep seated co2 hutcheon et al 1990 hutcheon and abercrombie 1990 lambrakis and kallergis 2005 marques et al 2006 mayo and muller 1997 previous studies of co2 rich springs in the gsb suggested that the co2 in these springs originated from the dissolution of carbonate minerals and or ascent of deep seated magmatic co2 do et al 2017 2020 jeong 2002 jeong et al 2012 yun and kim 2000 the high δ13c of dic and the high pco2 of gr 60 m and the co2 rich springs near the monitoring station in table 1 indicated a deep seated magmatic source of co2 in the aquifer the occurrence of faults and fractures near the monitoring station fig 1d implied that deep seated magmatic co2 was ascending through geologic structures based on this conclusion the gas bubbles observed around 40 m bgl in the monitoring well must be co2 decreases in pco2 down to 0 25 atm at gr 35 m also supported the co2 degassing below 35 m bgl table 1 in general natural gases that can be observed in groundwater includes h2s and ch4 as well as co2 however sulfate and or sulfide minerals were not reported in the bedrock see section 2 1 that can be a source of h2s and the concentration of sulfate in groundwater was low table 1 in addition there was no plume with a high biomass content or petroleum to form biotic ch4 and ultramafic rocks were not rich enough to produce abiotic ch4 in the study area etiope and sherwood lollar 2013 kietäväinen and purkamo 2015 5 2 hydrochemical processes at each transition zone and the stability from the study results we could determine four findings 1 physicochemical stratification existed with two transition zones in the well cased down to 50 m bgl 2 the ec sensor at 20 m bgl happened to be placed around the second upper transition zone 3 the high ec co2 rich groundwater in the lower part was pulled up to the pumping depth 25 m bgl during well purging and 4 such upward pulling events could affect and destabilize the physicochemistry of groundwater in the well causing the episodic changes of logged data for a certain time the hydrochemical processes at each transition zone and their stability are discussed in this section 5 2 1 first transition zone at depths of 43 35 m bgl attributed to co2 exsolution groundwater collected in the screened zone gr 60 m had high solute concentrations and pco2 with decreasing depth along the borehole the hydrostatic pressure decreases and subsequently the solubility of co2 decreases under the isothermal condition carroll et al 1991 specifically the calculated solubility of co2 in groundwater decreased from 12 2 mm at a depth of 60 m gr 60 m to 6 5 mm at a depth of 35 m gr 35 m which were much smaller than dissolved co2 co2 g in table 2 at each depth the exsolution of co2 caused by the solubility decrease in the well was confirmed by the decrease in pco2 and alkalinity between gr 35 m and gr 60 m table 1 and co2 bubbles beginning to be observed around a depth of 40 m bgl supplementary fig 1 the noticeable decrease in groundwater temperature along the first transition zone in fig 4a also suggested co2 degassing since co2 exsolution is an endothermic process carroll et al 1991 duan and sun 2003 in addition the co2 degassing resulted in a ph increase fig 4c and subsequent precipitation of minerals in the first transition zone based on the fact that the total fe content of groundwater was reduced by 20 μm passing through the first transition zone see gr 35 m and gr 60 m in table 1 in addition yellowish to pale green colored precipitates were observed by the borehole imaging at depths around 35 m bgl the ph orp condition of groundwater at depths between 60 m and 35 m bgl was close to the iron transition boundary fig 9 together with low orp values about 60 76 mv and do values close to zero of groundwater below depths of 35 m table 1 and fig 4 these results indicate the precipitation of dissolved iron in an anoxic or suboxic environment although the suspended sediment was not confirmed by sem eds because of the difficulty in obtaining unaltered greenish particles previous experimental results showed that mixed valent fe ii fe iii compounds such as green rust fougerite are formed at the fe ii fe iii transition boundary i e the upper boundary of siderite in fig 9 christiansen et al 2009a 2009b refait et al 1997 russell and hall 2006 green rust is an unstable compound composed of fe ii fe iii hydroxide layers where the interlayers are filled with water anions such as co3 2 so4 2 and cl and cations such as na and has a positive surface charge at ph 8 3 therefore based on the ph in the first transition zone in addition to the interlayer filling anions both various anions and trace elements of oxyanion forms can be adsorbed on the surface of green rust and removed from the solution guilbaud et al 2013 reducing the concentrations of dissolved ions our data showed that as mo and u potentially in the form of oxyanions were reduced in concentration at a depth 35 m bgl where greenish particles were observed supplementary fig 1 and the tds and ec of groundwater decreased table 1 it should be noted that the δ13c of dic decreased with decreasing water depth table 1 although the δ13c in solution is expected to become heavier as the lighter carbon isotope 12c is preferred when the co2 is degassed from solution which can be explained by the effect of atmospheric co2 with about 8 hare et al 2018 5 2 2 second transition zone at depths of 24 16 m caused by the precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides the physicochemical parameters showed the second transition zone above a depth of 25 m fig 4 with decreasing depth through this transition zone the orp value increased from about 80 mv to 180 mv and the do began to show positive values the increase of orp and do was undoubtedly caused by mixing with oxidized water from the upper layer located close to the water table which is open to atmosphere the rapid change in δ13c from 3 to 8 1 between gr 22 m and gr 5 m table 1 and the density calculation result also suggested the convection due to density reversal in the second transition zone fig 10 see section 5 2 4 the change to the oxidizing environment caused the almost complete removal of dissolved irons through precipitation as hfo as indicated by the significant decrease in the total fe content from 21 54 at gr 35 m to 0 1 μm above 35 m bgl table 1 in fact in the borehole image yellow to reddish brown precipitates and suspended solids were easily observed inside the well at a depth of 23 m bgl supplementary fig 1 these suspended materials were aggregates of nano sized hfo particles fig 6 the formation of hfo seemed to cause subsequent sorption of remaining ions ferris et al 2000 zhao 2011 given a significant decrease in most dissolved constituents at a depth of 22 m corresponding to the upper part of the second transition zone close to the monitoring probe in table 1 freshly precipitated hfo particles are reported to be approximately spherical and quite small with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 10 nm dzombak and morel 1990 as hfo is aged it coagulates and the resulting aggregates are highly porous and sometimes micro sized as observed in the second transition zone fig 6 these hfo particles provide large reactive surface areas promoting the adsorption of heavy metals in the water and decreasing tds a decline in tds from 448 to 354 mg l table 1 in wellbore water caused a decrease in ec from 942 0 to 392 2 μs cm table 1 which characterized the inflection point as the second transition zone near the depths of 18 to 25 m bgl in figs 4 and 10 sorption to the monitoring probe made up of stainless steels ss 316 was not considered because of little adsorption of metals onto ss 316 hewitt 1992 compared to the reduction in metals observed in the studied well 5 2 3 the effect of purging the vertical logging 30 min after purging in october 2016 showed the disturbance of the vertical stratification by purging in particular ec between the two transition zones including the monitoring depth 20 m bgl in fig 4 however it still showed the decrease in ec and temperature and increasing in orp and do with decreasing depth implying the upward shift without a vertical mixing the ec of the water pumped out during purging in fig 5 also showed the stepwise variation similar to the vertical variation of ec in fig 4 with considering the well radius 4 in and the pumping rate 4000 l hr the one hour purging was enough to pull up all the water volume in the 70 meter well 2269 l which indicates that the different water bodies were pulled up to the surface with time the consistent vertical distribution immediately after purging in fig 4 and the stepwise ec variation in fig 5 imply neither a turbulent flow nor a mixture of all the strata during purging stable ec per second observed at a depth of 20 m bgl by ryuh et al 2017 and from a depth of 25 m bgl in fig 5 also suggest that the purging shifted the vertical distribution upward without a significant vertical mixture around 30 min since the purging started the high ec groundwater in the lower part seemed to be pulled up to the surface the maximum ec 2500 μs cm in fig 5 was lower than the ec at depths of 50 70 m in the well probably due to the water mixing in the bucket as mentioned in section 4 1 while the maximum was higher than the average ec 1957 μs cm over the entire depth before purging implying that the high ec water was more pumped out than the low ec water the low ec wellbore water at the top seemed to cause the sharp increases in ph orp and do in the water pumped out at a depth of 25 m within 10 min since the purging began in fig 5 and possibly to cause the ec values at a depth of 20 m to be decreased below 500 μs cm for 16 min since the purging began in ryuh et al 2017 the effect of low ec wellbore water seemed significant at the monitoring 20 m bgl and purging 25 m bgl depth at the beginning of purging while the portion of high ec water increased with time given the high ec 30 min after purging at a depth of 20 m in fig 4 and the stepwise increase in ec around 30 min since the purging began small peaks in ph and do 45 min later in fig 5 seemed to appear because we emptied the water in the bucket 5 2 4 stability of physicochemically stratified water bodies in the monitoring well water temperature increased with depth although it suddenly rose or decreased due to the effects of atmospheric temperature close to the water table fig 4a if the density of groundwater was only affected by such a temperature distribution it was inevitable that the convective flow caused by the water density distribution would occur and the observed stratification could not be maintained due to vertical mixing thus we included salinity for the water density calculation to explain the consistent vertical distribution of physicochemical parameters all year round may july and october before purging in 2016 in fig 4 given the large difference in ec between water bodies stratified within the monitoring well fig 10 shows changes in the calculated water density with depth in july 2016 according to the water density distribution in the well the interval in which the density reverses is only observed at depths between 10 m and 18 m bgl indicating that the convection caused by the density difference could occur only at these depths from the upper transition zone to the middle of the top layer in other depths the density of wellbore water increased with increasing depth therefore it is likely that once the vertical stratification of well bore water is formed it is difficult to collapse naturally in the monitoring well the well purging at the rate of 4000 l hr did not cause a significant vertical mixing in fig 4 it is noticeable that the ec value was still as high as 3000 μs cm at a depth of 20 m bgl however the ec value decreased to the pre purging value 46 h after the peak in fig 3e given no inflow of other water bodies into the well except the deep co2 rich groundwater through the screened zones relatively fast geochemical reactions and salinity dependent water density may explain the recovery of ec at the monitoring depth within 2 days after purging although the complete recovery over the entire depth may take longer times the precipitation of secondary minerals including green rust and hfo which accompany sorption of dissolved ions are relatively fast geochemical reactions according to dzombak and morel 1990 stable solution conditions during an experiment involving the precipitation of hfo are achieved within a minimum of two and preferably four hours in addition martin 2005 showed that the oxidation of ferric iron is observed at ph 6 with a lifetime of approximately a day in water equilibrated with air at 25 c and ph 6 the author also described that the lifetime rapidly decreases with increasing ph with the value of 30 min at ph 7 considering the ph range at the second upper transition zone 6 38 to 6 48 and the previous study results fe ii can be oxidized to hfo within a day in the water that had risen during purging we acknowledge that the decrease of ec at the monitoring probe after purging in fig 3 might be attributed to the mixing with freshwater if the borehole is fully screened and groundwater can enter the borehole at all depths however no fractures or cracks except the well screens were observed in the video record of borehole imaging suggesting the only inflow of high tds co2 rich water to the monitoring well besides water temperature was maintained within 14 16 5 c figs 2 and 4 which also excluded the mixing scenario with other water bodies 5 3 representativeness of wellbore water for automated monitoring gr 60 m near the screened zones can be concluded to reflect the hydrochemical characteristics of deep groundwater affected by deep seated co2 in the target aquifer with the following reasons the water inflowing though the screened zone from the bedrock aquifer showed the similar physicochemical characteristics high ec and low do throughout the year and did not change esp ec and temperature even after purging in fig 4 the ec 3833 μs cm of gr 60 m was slightly higher than the ec of co2 rich springs surveyed in the surrounding area at similar times while the ph and tds were similar the δ13c 1 1 of gr 60 m also was similar to those of surrounding co2 rich springs within the ranges known as the magmatic source clark and fritz 2013 deines et al 1974 however the gr 60 m showed lower pco2 alkalinity concentrations of ca and trace metals than co2 rich springs while higher na and sio2 on the other hand the gr 60 m had lower ph but higher pco2 alkalinity and δ13c than deep groundwater nearby table 1 and was plotted between co2 rich springs and deep groundwater on the piper diagram fig 7 however the automated monitoring probe is installed at a depth of 20 m fig 3a to monitor deep groundwater while the wellbore water is hydrochemically stratified because the co2 rich water experiences co2 exsolution in the open system and hydroxide precipitation in oxidizing conditions with decreasing depth in the borehole these situations caused the monitoring data at a depth of 20 m not to represent the deep groundwater but present much lower ec than gr 60 m and ec peaks during well purging figs 2 and 3 the rapid increases in ec for a moment at the monitoring probe were due to the physicochemical stratification of co2 rich groundwater in the monitoring well and its upward shift during well purging for maintenance that caused the upwell of deep groundwater to the monitoring probe at a depth of 20 m bgl as summarized in fig 10 in fact the ec peaks in figs 2 and 3 were as high as the ec of gr 60 m and co2 rich waters in the study area table 1 moreover small ups and downs of ec were observed excluding the peaks associated with purging probably because the monitoring probe was installed within the upper transition zone where the sudden drop in ec by 500 μs cm occurred within 1 m depth around 20 m bgl fig 4b 5 4 guide for geochemical monitoring using a real time data logger although this study only describes the geochemical stratification of co2 rich water in a cased well while the hydro stratigraphy in the aquifer probably do not occur based on the similar physicochemical properties along the three screened zones fig 4 hydrochemical stratification can occur in aquifers as well as in wells whenever a water body with high concentrations of ions and or salinity or a plume with different redox conditions flows in barrez and mania 2009 cotecchia et al 2005 elliot and younger 2014 marković et al 2013 neidhardt et al 2013 němeček et al 2017 rapantova et al 2013 mainly by the density difference also the vertical stratification of water bodies occurs in aquifers with different hydrogeologic conditions including aquitards giambastiani et al 2013 koh et al 2012 stenger et al 2018 xing et al 2018 the stratification in the aquifer can be exaggerated in a well which is open to the atmosphere in fact stratification has been reported in pumping wells for geothermal energy production and for artificial recharge due to redox condition changes depending on pumping rates or pumping depths burnside et al 2016 bustos medina et al 2013 despite the possibility of vertical stratification however automated monitoring probes have been installed at a fixed depth e g 20 m bgl in ngmn of south korea until recently with assuming that the wellbore filling groundwater coming through the screen intervals represents the groundwater quality of the aquifer and all depths have the same chemical composition throughout the well bhatti et al 2017 ryuh et al 2017 in addition the efficiency of costs and ease of maintenance make the water level ec or temperature measured at a depth regardless of the screen intervals or the stratification of water bodies in a well which may cause irregular fluctuations of the observations as in this study so far few issues have been reported lee et al 2005 2008 unlike the station we studied or the unusual episodic measurements may be ignored as device errors the study results emphasize that if automated monitoring with in situ instrumentation is considered the monitoring well must be properly designed to avoid artifacts introduced by stratified aquifer and wellbore processes we suggest to first determine the vertically distributed physicochemical layers in an aquifer and or wellbore by performing vertical logging if there is a potential of the physicochemical stratification due to the changes in orp and or ph in a monitoring well e g the groundwater influenced by co2 leakage or acid mine drainage with low ph and high concentrations of dissolved solutes the impact of purging on the vertical distribution as in fig 4 also needs to be assessed to understand the wellbore processes then depending on the purpose it is advisable to install monitoring probes in a target layer or multi layers according to this study the screened zone is a suitable location for installing an automated monitoring probe because it is unaffected by the hydrogeochemical processes in a cased well it is suggested to avoid physicochemical transition zones when installing the monitoring probes similarly polemio et al 2009 recommended to perform periodic logging to determine the location of transition zones and to optimize the depths for monitoring probes recently usgs recommended to obtain a vertical water quality profile through wellbore logging and to install an automated monitoring probe at a representative depth determined by the profile mathany et al 2019 6 conclusion automated groundwater monitoring systems have been widely applied for water resources management based on real time and high resolution information however an improper well design or an unexpected physicochemical variation in a well may cause artifacts which misguides one about the groundwater quality this study presents such a case that the groundwater inflowing through the screened zones reflects the hydrochemical characteristics of deep groundwater affected by deep seated co2 in the target aquifer while the monitoring data at a depth of 20 m does not because the co2 rich groundwater at depths below 50 m bgl experiences the hydrochemical processes esp co2 exsolution and precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides in the open system with decreasing depth causing a vertical stratification of physicochemical parameters such as ph ec and orp in the monitoring well meanwhile an automated monitoring probe is installed at a depth of 20 m bgl which turns out to be located within the transition zone these situations all together cause unusual high ec peaks during purging because the high ec groundwater in the lower part is pulled up to the monitoring depth the ec increased by purging is fast recovered at the monitoring depth probably due to relatively fast geochemical reactions and salinity dependent water density although we did not consider the gas volume when calculating the water density dissolution exsolution of co2 gas in groundwater is quite common in co2 water interaction processes in the subsurface environment however the physicochemical stratification has not been reported in a monitoring well before this study probably because of different well designs and insufficient monitoring data in this study we detected high ec fluctuations twice a year in the high resolution and long term automated monitoring data and conducted the repeated well logging to understand the physicochemical characteristics of stratified layers and to identify the mechanism for the stratification which led us to point out the issue about the monitoring depth in the automated monitoring system there would be other automated monitoring wells providing erroneous data caused by the similar or wrong design of monitoring wells given that the automated monitoring wells have been widely used to build a national groundwater monitoring network without detailed information about local aquifers the study result suggests that the screen installation interval where acidic co2 rich or high tds groundwater flows directly into the well is the best monitoring depth the study result confirms that measuring ec is an efficient in situ indicator prior to pricy and time consuming hydrochemical and isotopic analysis meeting the conditions for proper monitoring techniques 1 cost and labor effective for long term observation and 2 sensitively responsive to subtle groundwater changes ec can be automatically measured using relatively inexpensive devices moreover a change in ec in groundwater directly indicates the variation of dissolved solutes resulting from physicochemical changes with depth in the monitoring well the study result also suggests that physicochemical stratification of groundwater should be carefully considered for appropriate automated groundwater monitoring because the representative groundwater coming through the screened zones may experience the hydrochemical change with depth in a well causing non representative water quality at a monitoring probe particularly the presence of interface zones with a dramatic change in ec must be carefully considered to determine the depths of monitoring apparatus and sampling for various chemical analyses credit

3834,unusual episodic fluctuations of electrical conductivity ec were observed twice a year in a national groundwater monitoring network well in south korea where ec was automatically monitored at a depth of 20 m below ground level bgl to address the causes of the observed ec fluctuations this study examined the depth profile of wellbore water in the 70 meter deep monitoring well screened between 50 and 70 m bgl and cased down to 50 m bgl the results of well logging borehole video recording and hydrochemical analysis of wellbore water indicated that the co2 rich groundwater entering through the screened zones below 50 m bgl was physicochemically stratified into three layers with distinct ec that were separated by two transition zones in the well a bottom layer 70 43 m bgl with an ec of 3900 μs cm intermediate layer 35 24 m bgl of 1800 μs cm and top layer 16 3 m bgl of 300 μs cm the first transition zone at depths of 43 35 m bgl was attributed to co2 exsolution in the open system and the subsequent physicochemical changes of wellbore water while the second transition zone at depths of 24 16 m bgl was formed by the precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides with consequent sorption of remaining ions due to a sudden change toward the oxidizing environment the monitoring probe installed at a depth of 20 m bgl was found to be located within the upper transition zone which caused ec peaks when the well was purged at a depth of 25 m bgl for well maintenance twice a year this study shows that automated groundwater monitoring systems may misguide one about the groundwater quality if an unexpected physicochemical variation such as stratification occurs in a monitoring well therefore the presence of interface zones caused by abrupt changes in ec must be carefully considered when an automated monitoring well is designed the screened zone is a suitable location for installing an automated monitoring probe to measure the representative water quality i e ec in particular in an

real time jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 with the help of the real time monitoring data e g water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec through wells the water resources managements become cost and labor effective given that collecting water samples and analyzing their hydrochemical and or isotopic compositions in the laboratory is costly time consuming and discontinuous moreover the high resolution and long term monitoring data are used to identify temporal and spatial changing patterns and to plan a sustainable water management strategy giacomoni et al 2013 glasgow et al 2004 the real time automated monitoring is globally applied for the national groundwater monitoring network ngmn jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 which is occasionally complemented with the classical method of collecting groundwater samples and determining their water quality through laboratory analysis in general it is recommended to install well screens at depths that are connected to a target aquifer and to install an automated monitoring probe at depths that represent the aquifer quality these depths are determined by vertical logging of physicochemical parameters through a monitoring well and geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity survey mathany et al 2019 polemio et al 2009 however at many cases the monitoring probes are installed at a depth where maintenance and management are easy which often causes erratic observations bhatti et al 2017 polemio et al 2009 ryuh et al 2017 automated monitoring systems with well screens and monitoring instruments installed at fixed depths also may provide erroneous information about the physicochemical characteristics in groundwater since data is collected at a depth of the monitoring probe while the physicochemical characteristics may vary with depth in a well in particular when distinct water bodies e g brackish water geothermal water acid mine drainage and co2 rich water are irregularly introduced to the well through well screens for instance polemio et al 2009 observed at coastal karstic aquifers in italy that ec fluctuated in a range of 4000 μs cm for a year at the zone where fresh and brackish groundwater were mixed similarly ryuh et al 2017 observed that the ec data fluctuated to a fairly large extent in one of the ngmn wells of south korea fig 1 right after purging for well management and groundwater sampling the daily average ec values rapidly increased from 1116 μs cm up to 2861 μs cm and then dropped to 1309 μs cm within 2 days in october 2013 fig 2 a the purpose of this study is to identify the causes and processes of remarkable physicochemical changes at an automated monitoring well and to suggest an improved practical guide for the automated geochemical monitoring using physicochemical parameters such as ec based on the lesson obtained from a groundwater well of the ngmn in south korea specifically we scrutinized the vertical distribution of physicochemical characteristics including ec in the monitoring well using well logging and imaging analysis identified the causes of physicochemical stratification and then addressed the processes and mechanisms for the perturbation and re stabilization of the stratification with time note that the wellbore water is often considered not to represent the formation water barcelona et al 1983 barcelona and helfrich

water has been increasingly applied for water resources management with assuming that the wellbore water is representative of the groundwater at least ec and temperature glasgow et al 2004 jørgensen and stockmarr 2009 mathany et al 2019 wagner et al 2006 we compared the groundwater in the monitoring well and the naturally seeping springs near the well to discuss the representativeness of wellbore waters in the automated monitoring system in relation to ec fluctuations see section 5 3 2 study area two monitoring wells are installed in the andong giran station fig 1 one for monitoring a shallow aquifer down to a depth of 10 5 m bgl and the other for monitoring a deep bedrock aquifer down to a depth of 70 m bgl in this study we carefully examined the monitoring data collected from the deep bedrock monitoring well fig 3 a to evaluate the causes and processes of momentary and sharp ec fluctuations e g fig 2 which are not observed at the shallow monitoring well 2 1 geology the andong giran groundwater monitoring station is located in giran myeon county of andong city at the northern part of the cretaceous gyeongsang sedimentary basin gsb of south korea fig 1a sedimentary rocks of the gsb were formed in rivers ephemeral lakes and marshes that had experienced seasonal repetition of drying and wetting events accordingly the basin mainly comprises cretaceous fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary rocks that were ubiquitously intruded by cretaceous to early tertiary intrusive rocks chough et al 2000 triassic to jurassic granitoids also occur in the northern part of the basin based on topographic and depositional environments including tectonic events climate and volcanic activity the sedimentary rocks of the gsb consist of the following four major lithostratigraphic units in ascending order the lower sindong group the middle hayang group the upper yucheon group and the bulguksa granites paik et al 2000 um et al 1983 the geology around the andong giran station is dominated by the hayang group sedimentary rocks fig 1d that represent clastic sandstones and shales deposited in the fluvial and lacustrine environments core logging data of the two monitoring wells for shallow and deep aquifer respectively in the station see www gims go kr show that the aquifer geology consists of sand 0 1 m below ground level bgl gravel 1 5 5 m bgl weathered rock 5 5 10 7 m bgl and shale as bedrock 10 7 m bgl the mineralogy of shale consists of quartz albite kaolinite chlorite illite calcite dolomite and hematite chang 1975 the andong giran station lies on a nw trending strike slip fault called the giran fault co2 rich springs naturally occur near the andong giran station fig 1d in particular along faults or geologic boundaries which may act as conduits to transport deep seated co2 to the shallow subsurface jung et al 2015 kampman et al 2012 lee et al 2019 lewicki et al 2003 specifically co2 rich springs flow out along the fissures of the valley floor at g5 and g10 which are located at the geologic boundary between the hayang group and the triassic granites and between the hayang group and the jurassic granites respectively fig 1d the boreholes drilled to produce co2 rich waters in the g6 region are known to be located along a fault jeong et al 2005 although g6 does not show any direct relationship with faults on fig 1d according to lee et al 2019 strike slip faults penetrate into the mantle through ductile shearing causing mantle derived co2 in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula 2 2 andong giran monitoring station the andong giran monitoring station is one of the ngmn monitoring stations installed and operated by korea water resources corporation kowaco to manage the regional groundwater system based on the monitoring of the overall status of both quantity and quality of groundwater kim et al 1995 the automated real time monitoring system at each monitoring station consists of a monitoring probe at depths of 10 and 20 m bgl respectively

groundwater wells and monitoring devices are protected by an outer building fig 1b the screened zone in the shallow well is located at depths between 6 and 10 5 m bgl while those in the deep well are placed at depths of 50 54 58 62 and 66 70 m bgl fig 3a which coincide with the depths of highly fractured zones see www gims go kr three parameters groundwater level temperature and ec are hourly measured by the monitoring probe made up of stainless steels watermate 4100 baytech korea inc the wells are purged for an hour twice a year for well management by kowaco groundwater is sampled during the well purging and its water quality is analyzed to complement automated monitoring data as in other ngmn wells of south korea kim et al 1995 lee et al 2007 a sufficient quantity of water is supplied to the deep monitoring well from the aquifer as the fracture zones are well developed below ca 10 m depth the results of the constant pumping test with all the contributions from the three screened sections showed that hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity of the bedrock aquifer are 0 65 m day and 32 5 m3 day respectively see www gims go kr the daily average groundwater levels in 2013 2016 and 2017 showed small fluctuations 1 6 m in each year with a tendency to slightly increase after heavy rainfall events 20 mm per day with a time lapse of about 1 to 3 days depending on the amount of rainfall fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 physicochemical analyses temporal changes of water temperature and ec at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl in 2013 2016 and 2017 were obtained from the national groundwater information center of south korea www gims go kr in addition vertical well logging was conducted using a multi parameter water quality meter prodss ysi in may july and october 2016 to understand the vertical distribution of physicochemical characteristics in the monitoring well and its temporal variation in relation to momentary ec fluctuations e g fig 2a water temperature depth ph oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do and ec were automatically measured and stored once per second using prodss to cover the whole depth within the 70 m deep well we prepared an 80 m connecting cable customized by ysi and measured physicochemical data along the entire water column by slowly dropping it down into the well in october 2016 the vertical well logging was conducted on the day of purging for well management and performed before and 30 min after purging to assess the effect of purging to the vertical distribution of physicochemical parameters water temperature ph orp do and ec were also measured for the water pumped out from a depth of 25 m to the surface while purging for an hour between 11 40 am to 12 40 pm using the same instrument prodss ysi the pumped water was collected in a bucket letting the water overflow and the physicochemical parameters in the bucket were measured every second to reliably interpret the observed physicochemical change with depth wellbore water samples were collected in july 2016 from five depths in the well table 1 which were set to include three layers bottom intermediate and top and two transition zones dashed squares in fig 4 b based on the well logging and ryuh et al 2017 note that a sample gr 60 m was taken at a depth of 60 m to collect and analyze all the water from the three screened zones given the similar physicochemical properties of water outflowing from the three zones fig 4 the sample represents groundwater inflowing from the same fractured aquifer instead of well purging sampling was performed using a sampling pump ss geosub pump geotech and a separate sampling tube for each sampling depth to avoid mixing of water bodies that may occur during the purging process alkalinity was determined by

inspection camera geovisiontm nano camera allegheny instruments to confirm unexpected inlets such as fractures or cracks in the wellbore for freshwater influx the camera was mounted on an electric winch with a cable and lowered along the borehole at a speed of 2 22 m min a groundwater sample 2 l was collected from a depth of 23 m and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter to separate suspended materials at the first transition zone for detailed observation of the suspended particles the filter pieces were coated with platinum and then images of the filtered particles were acquired using a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 250 feg fei at the green manufacturing research center gmrc of korea university with the images using sem the chemical composition of the suspended particles was qualitatively analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds electrical resistivity was investigated in march 2016 along the two survey lines fig 1c to identify the geological and hydrogeological setting around the monitoring well and to find out the relationship between geology and hydrochemistry the resistivity data acquisition system used in this survey was a set of terrameter sas 4000 abem sweden and es 10 64c which automatically recorded data using a 41 channel cable 10 m and electrodes i type and t type steel sticks a dipole dipole array was used because of its high resolution the survey lines were 1 km ert 1 and 800 m ert 2 long and used 100 and 80 electrodes respectively the apparent resistivity data were processed with res2dinv geotomo usa electrical resistivity survey analysis software and the active constraint balancing approach for inversion 3 3 computation of thermodynamics the chemical speciation and partial pressure of co2 pco2 were calculated using the computer code phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibrium the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl database was used in addition the stability diagram of fe bearing minerals was constructed by act2 module of the geochemist s workbench release 8 0 bethke and yeakel 2009 the solution density ρ s k g m 3 was also calculated as a function of temperature t c and salinity s g kg to determine the density stratification caused by the vertical distribution of temperature and dissolved solids the density of pure water was determined as a function of temperature t using the thiesen scheel diesselhorst equation maidment 1993 then an empirical relationship between the density of solution containing dissolved solids ρ s and salinity s were used to estimate ρ s maidment 1993 since salinity s was not measured in the present study the ec measured in the vertical logging process was converted to s through an empirical equation between s and a conductivity ratio rt apha 1998 which is valid for s between 2 and 42 g kg here rt is a ratio of the conductivity of a sample at specific temperature t to the conductivity of kcl solution containing a mass of 32 4356 g kcl in a mass of 1 kg of solution 4 results 4 1 fluctuations of automated monitoring data ec data measured at a depth of 20 m bgl in the well to monitor the deep bedrock aquifer showed two stiff peaks every year fig 2 see the real time monitored data at www gims go kr given the ec values in co2 rich springs near the study area table 1 these momentary high ec values did not indicate a device error besides the irregular fluctuations were also shown in water temperature data at similar times fig 2 it is clear that the unusual change in automated ec monitoring of groundwater was arising from the physicochemical changes at the point where the monitoring probe was installed i e 20 m bgl as in fig 3a the high ec peaks were consistent with the dates of groundwater purging at a depth of 25 m for well maintenance molit and kowaco 2014 2017 2018 for instance the ec value at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl increased abruptly from 1450 to 3505 μs cm on the day of purging in april 14 2016 and decreased back to the base level close to 1250 μs cm around 36 h later fig 3b and c a similar pattern was observed at the purging event in oct 13 2016 fig 3d and e the ec value jumped from 443 before purging to 3350 μs cm about 1 h after purging and decreased back to the pre purging level 1265 μs cm 46 h later two ec peaks were also shown in 2017 fig 2c while only a noticeable ec peak was observed in 2013 fig 2a because the purging event in may 2013 was conducted with other studies by ryuh et al 2017 and consequently showed a relatively small ec increase at the monitoring probe it should be noted that the data logger is turned off and thus the monitoring data are missing several hours before and after purging in particular 7 h in fig 3d and 3e for vertical logging in fig 4 thus ryuh et al 2017 personally recorded the ec values at the monitoring depth during purging in may 2013 for an hour and found that the ec values at the monitoring depth 20 m decreased down to below 500 μs cm for 16 min since the purging began and then increased and reached up to 726 μs cm at the end of one hour purging ryuh et al 2017 which will be discussed with the vertical logging data in section 5 2 3 meanwhile the groundwater pumped out at a depth of 25 m showed the continuous increase in ec and temperature for an hour during the purging event in oct 13 2016 fig 5 in addition the ec in fig 5 showed two stepwise increases which will be discussed with the help of the vertical logging result in section 5 2 3 ec increased from below 500 μs cm up to 2500 μs cm 35 min later and the maximum value was maintained similar to that observed by ryuh et al 2017 who measured the ec values of the water pumped out to the surface as well as the ec values of the wellbore water at the monitoring depth during purging in may 2013 the maximum ec 2500 μs cm in fig 5 was smaller than the peak 3350 μs cm one hour after purging at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl in fig 3e probably due to the mixing of water bodies pumped out because the physicochemical parameters were measured in a bucket where pumped water was collected meanwhile ph and orp and do showed sharp increases within 10 min since the purging began and then decreased with time ph and do showed another peak 45 min later these will be discussed based on the vertical well logging result in section 5 2 3 4 2 vertical well logging the vertical distributions of ec ph and orp in the bedrock groundwater monitoring well showed identical stepwise stratifications in all three observations conducted in may july and october before purging of 2016 fig 4 while the water temperature showed different distributions at depths down to about 15 m depending on the observation time indicating the influence by atmospheric temperature however at a depth of about 20 m bgl or deeper the water temperature generally increased up to 16 3 c for the screened zone groundwater in the bottom with increasing depth about 27 c km within the local and global geothermal gradients kim and lee 2007 pollack et al 1993 regardless of observation time fig 4a interestingly the monitoring parameters showed stepwise variations at almost the same depths the monitoring parameter showing the most obvious stepwise distribution was ec fig 4b which divided the groundwater column in the monitoring well into three distinct layers separated by two transition zones based on the vertical profile observed in july 2016 the ec values showed stratification from 300 μs cm for the top layer 3 16 m bgl through between 1700 and 1800 μs cm in the intermediate layer 24 35 m bgl up to 3900 μs cm for the bottom layer 43 70 m bgl starting from the bottom where the screened zone is the first sharp drop in ec was observed at 40 m bgl with 8 m thickness called the first transition zone around that depth ec values decreased quickly to 2000 μs cm the second sudden drop at depths of 24 to 16 m bgl called the second transition zone showed a significant decrease in ec from 1700 to 400 μs cm fig 4b the ph profiles showed an analogous stratified distribution to ec with the opposite trend of increasing ph upward with decreasing ec fig 4c the average ph values of groundwater were 6 27 6 36 and 6 48 in the bottom intermediate and top layer respectively noticeable changes of ph were also observed in the two transition zones as with ec the orp tended to increase gradually from the bottom layer to the intermediate layer and increased abruptly at depths around 25 m bgl i e the second transition zone to 190 mv fig 4d similarly the do began to increase with decreasing depth around 25 m bgl the depths of the two transition zones were observed almost the same in may july and october before purging of 2016 in contrast the vertical logging 30 min after purging in october 2016 showed that the vertical profile was shifted upward causing high ec and temperature but low orp and do at a depth of 20 m bgl fig 4 it is noticeable that the large variation in ec and orp appeared between the two transition zones insignificant ec variations were observed below the first transition while the sudden ec drop was observed around the depth of 15 m bgl above the second transition zone implying the uprising of high ec water to this depth the water at the top showed low ec values even after purging implying the little effect of pumping 4 3 borehole imaging using nano camera and sem the video record of the borehole wall and the wellbore water in it in july 2016 showed that there were no noticeable incoming groundwater points e g borehole cracks other than screens throughout the well however visible changes in wellbore water with depth were observed supplementary fig 1 in the screened zone the incoming groundwater looked clean with no particles or bubbles see 58 m in supplementary fig 1 however after the first drop in ec at a depth of around 40 m bgl we could find the generation of gas bubbles and the formation of greenish precipitates at depths around 35 m bgl see 30 and 40 m in supplementary fig 1 toward the top of the well red to orange colored precipitates were started to appear at the depth around 20 m bgl see 23 m in supplementary fig 1 just after the inflection point of orp in fig 4d in the top layer there were no gas bubbles and colored precipitates see 5 and 15 m in supplementary fig 1 the sem analysis of filtered and dried samples of red colored suspended solids from a depth of 23 m bgl showed a number of aggregates consisting of nano size spherical particles fig 6 such spherical particles with a quite small size are typical of freshly precipitated hydrous ferric oxides hfo particles dzombak and morel 1990 ferris et al 2000 søgaard et al 2000 the results of eds analysis also showed the dominance of iron in these materials fig 6 greenish particles observed at depths around 35 m bgl were not determined by sem eds because the sediments were oxidized as soon as we collected and turned into reddish brown colored particles as the suspended sediments in fig 6 4 4 hydrochemical analysis of wellbore water and electrical resistivity tomography table 1 shows the major ions and trace elements in wellbore water samples collected from five depths in july 2016 as shown in the ec of vertical well logging fig 4b concentrations of dissolved constituents decreased toward the surface notable changes in hydrochemistry occurred between gr 60 m i e the groundwater collected at a depth of 60 m and gr 35 m and between gr 35 m and gr 22 m specifically the concentration of na decreased by about 11 mm from 17 99 to 7 09 mm and those of ca2 mg2 and k also decreased between gr 60 m and gr 35 m as passing through the depth of the first ec drop table 1 fig 4b among trace elements the concentration of fe decreased by 22 41 μm from 43 95 to 21 54 μm because of the huge decrease in dissolved constituents the tds values of wellbore water significantly decreased from 2315 mg l at gr 60 m to 1235 mg l at gr 35 m table 1 the decreases in concentrations of most elements were smaller between gr 35 m and gr 22 m than those between gr 60 m and gr 35 m while the decreases of ca2 total fe and total mn were similar or larger table 1 probably due to their adsorption during the precipitation of hfo see section 5 2 2 the major ions in wellbore water collected from the monitoring well were plotted on the piper diagram fig 7 which characterized the wellbore water between co2 rich springs and deep groundwater nearby the co2 rich springs showed the ca hco3 type while the deep groundwater showed the ca so4 type consistent with previous studies choi et al 2012 showed that deep groundwater in the cretaceous gsb was sulfate rich due to gypsum dissolution and had moderately high pco2 values 10 1 1 to 10 2 4 atm on the other hand most of the co2 rich water belonged to the ca hco3 type in the study area and some were plotted on the area of ca na hco3 type according to jeong et al 2005 the cross sectional electrical resistivity showed the distribution of low resistivity around the screened zones of the deep monitoring well fig 8 implying fractured zones around 20 85 m above sea level which was consistent with the depths of highly fractured zones see section 2 2 the high electrical resistivity on the surface seemed to address the road pavement see fig 1c 5 discussion sources of high ec values and gas bubbles in the wellbore water are discussed section 5 1 and then the hydrochemical processes with depth of groundwater entering through the screened zones are identified section 5 2 in addition the wellbore water quality is compared to the co2 rich spring waters nearby section 5 3 finally an improved guide for the automated regulatory groundwater monitoring system that is often under non ideal geometries is provided based on the learnings from this study section 5 4 5 1 origin of gas bubbles the deep monitoring well was connected to a co2 rich aquifer given the high pco2 of gr 60 m near the screened zones table 1 because co2 should be supplied to the groundwater to show the pco2 of 0 46 atm at 60 m depth carroll et al 1991 marques et al 2006 besides co2 rich springs were observed near the well fig 1d table 1 and relatively high ec values average 1027 μs cm for 2 years from 2016 to 2017 were detected at the monitoring depth 20 m bgl the low resistivity 63 ω m around the screened zones of the deep well fig 8 also supported that the monitoring well was linked to the high ec and co2 rich aquifer that appears locally within the study area because electrical resistivity becomes lower as the ec of a water reservoir is higher carruthers and smith 1992 coscia et al 2011 menció et al 2016 and the dissolution of co2 decreases ph and enhances water rock interactions increasing the ec assayag et al 2009 kharaka et al 2006 the plausible sources of co2 affecting the groundwater chemistry in the subsurface environment could be diverse including organic carbon decomposition dissolution of carbonate minerals and deep seated co2 hutcheon et al 1990 hutcheon and abercrombie 1990 lambrakis and kallergis 2005 marques et al 2006 mayo and muller 1997 previous studies of co2 rich springs in the gsb suggested that the co2 in these springs originated from the dissolution of carbonate minerals and or ascent of deep seated magmatic co2 do et al 2017 2020 jeong 2002 jeong et al 2012 yun and kim 2000 the high δ13c of dic and the high pco2 of gr 60 m and the co2 rich springs near the monitoring station in table 1 indicated a deep seated magmatic source of co2 in the aquifer the occurrence of faults and fractures near the monitoring station fig 1d implied that deep seated magmatic co2 was ascending through geologic structures based on this conclusion the gas bubbles observed around 40 m bgl in the monitoring well must be co2 decreases in pco2 down to 0 25 atm at gr 35 m also supported the co2 degassing below 35 m bgl table 1 in general natural gases that can be observed in groundwater includes h2s and ch4 as well as co2 however sulfate and or sulfide minerals were not reported in the bedrock see section 2 1 that can be a source of h2s and the concentration of sulfate in groundwater was low table 1 in addition there was no plume with a high biomass content or petroleum to form biotic ch4 and ultramafic rocks were not rich enough to produce abiotic ch4 in the study area etiope and sherwood lollar 2013 kietäväinen and purkamo 2015 5 2 hydrochemical processes at each transition zone and the stability from the study results we could determine four findings 1 physicochemical stratification existed with two transition zones in the well cased down to 50 m bgl 2 the ec sensor at 20 m bgl happened to be placed around the second upper transition zone 3 the high ec co2 rich groundwater in the lower part was pulled up to the pumping depth 25 m bgl during well purging and 4 such upward pulling events could affect and destabilize the physicochemistry of groundwater in the well causing the episodic changes of logged data for a certain time the hydrochemical processes at each transition zone and their stability are discussed in this section 5 2 1 first transition zone at depths of 43 35 m bgl attributed to co2 exsolution groundwater collected in the screened zone gr 60 m had high solute concentrations and pco2 with decreasing depth along the borehole the hydrostatic pressure decreases and subsequently the solubility of co2 decreases under the isothermal condition carroll et al 1991 specifically the calculated solubility of co2 in groundwater decreased from 12 2 mm at a depth of 60 m gr 60 m to 6 5 mm at a depth of 35 m gr 35 m which were much smaller than dissolved co2 co2 g in table 2 at each depth the exsolution of co2 caused by the solubility decrease in the well was confirmed by the decrease in pco2 and alkalinity between gr 35 m and gr 60 m table 1 and co2 bubbles beginning to be observed around a depth of 40 m bgl supplementary fig 1 the noticeable decrease in groundwater temperature along the first transition zone in fig 4a also suggested co2 degassing since co2 exsolution is an endothermic process carroll et al 1991 duan and sun 2003 in addition the co2 degassing resulted in a ph increase fig 4c and subsequent precipitation of minerals in the first transition zone based on the fact that the total fe content of groundwater was reduced by 20 μm passing through the first transition zone see gr 35 m and gr 60 m in table 1 in addition yellowish to pale green colored precipitates were observed by the borehole imaging at depths around 35 m bgl the ph orp condition of groundwater at depths between 60 m and 35 m bgl was close to the iron transition boundary fig 9 together with low orp values about 60 76 mv and do values close to zero of groundwater below depths of 35 m table 1 and fig 4 these results indicate the precipitation of dissolved iron in an anoxic or suboxic environment although the suspended sediment was not confirmed by sem eds because of the difficulty in obtaining unaltered greenish particles previous experimental results showed that mixed valent fe ii fe iii compounds such as green rust fougerite are formed at the fe ii fe iii transition boundary i e the upper boundary of siderite in fig 9 christiansen et al 2009a 2009b refait et al 1997 russell and hall 2006 green rust is an unstable compound composed of fe ii fe iii hydroxide layers where the interlayers are filled with water anions such as co3 2 so4 2 and cl and cations such as na and has a positive surface charge at ph 8 3 therefore based on the ph in the first transition zone in addition to the interlayer filling anions both various anions and trace elements of oxyanion forms can be adsorbed on the surface of green rust and removed from the solution guilbaud et al 2013 reducing the concentrations of dissolved ions our data showed that as mo and u potentially in the form of oxyanions were reduced in concentration at a depth 35 m bgl where greenish particles were observed supplementary fig 1 and the tds and ec of groundwater decreased table 1 it should be noted that the δ13c of dic decreased with decreasing water depth table 1 although the δ13c in solution is expected to become heavier as the lighter carbon isotope 12c is preferred when the co2 is degassed from solution which can be explained by the effect of atmospheric co2 with about 8 hare et al 2018 5 2 2 second transition zone at depths of 24 16 m caused by the precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides the physicochemical parameters showed the second transition zone above a depth of 25 m fig 4 with decreasing depth through this transition zone the orp value increased from about 80 mv to 180 mv and the do began to show positive values the increase of orp and do was undoubtedly caused by mixing with oxidized water from the upper layer located close to the water table which is open to atmosphere the rapid change in δ13c from 3 to 8 1 between gr 22 m and gr 5 m table 1 and the density calculation result also suggested the convection due to density reversal in the second transition zone fig 10 see section 5 2 4 the change to the oxidizing environment caused the almost complete removal of dissolved irons through precipitation as hfo as indicated by the significant decrease in the total fe content from 21 54 at gr 35 m to 0 1 μm above 35 m bgl table 1 in fact in the borehole image yellow to reddish brown precipitates and suspended solids were easily observed inside the well at a depth of 23 m bgl supplementary fig 1 these suspended materials were aggregates of nano sized hfo particles fig 6 the formation of hfo seemed to cause subsequent sorption of remaining ions ferris et al 2000 zhao 2011 given a significant decrease in most dissolved constituents at a depth of 22 m corresponding to the upper part of the second transition zone close to the monitoring probe in table 1 freshly precipitated hfo particles are reported to be approximately spherical and quite small with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 10 nm dzombak and morel 1990 as hfo is aged it coagulates and the resulting aggregates are highly porous and sometimes micro sized as observed in the second transition zone fig 6 these hfo particles provide large reactive surface areas promoting the adsorption of heavy metals in the water and decreasing tds a decline in tds from 448 to 354 mg l table 1 in wellbore water caused a decrease in ec from 942 0 to 392 2 μs cm table 1 which characterized the inflection point as the second transition zone near the depths of 18 to 25 m bgl in figs 4 and 10 sorption to the monitoring probe made up of stainless steels ss 316 was not considered because of little adsorption of metals onto ss 316 hewitt 1992 compared to the reduction in metals observed in the studied well 5 2 3 the effect of purging the vertical logging 30 min after purging in october 2016 showed the disturbance of the vertical stratification by purging in particular ec between the two transition zones including the monitoring depth 20 m bgl in fig 4 however it still showed the decrease in ec and temperature and increasing in orp and do with decreasing depth implying the upward shift without a vertical mixing the ec of the water pumped out during purging in fig 5 also showed the stepwise variation similar to the vertical variation of ec in fig 4 with considering the well radius 4 in and the pumping rate 4000 l hr the one hour purging was enough to pull up all the water volume in the 70 meter well 2269 l which indicates that the different water bodies were pulled up to the surface with time the consistent vertical distribution immediately after purging in fig 4 and the stepwise ec variation in fig 5 imply neither a turbulent flow nor a mixture of all the strata during purging stable ec per second observed at a depth of 20 m bgl by ryuh et al 2017 and from a depth of 25 m bgl in fig 5 also suggest that the purging shifted the vertical distribution upward without a significant vertical mixture around 30 min since the purging started the high ec groundwater in the lower part seemed to be pulled up to the surface the maximum ec 2500 μs cm in fig 5 was lower than the ec at depths of 50 70 m in the well probably due to the water mixing in the bucket as mentioned in section 4 1 while the maximum was higher than the average ec 1957 μs cm over the entire depth before purging implying that the high ec water was more pumped out than the low ec water the low ec wellbore water at the top seemed to cause the sharp increases in ph orp and do in the water pumped out at a depth of 25 m within 10 min since the purging began in fig 5 and possibly to cause the ec values at a depth of 20 m to be decreased below 500 μs cm for 16 min since the purging began in ryuh et al 2017 the effect of low ec wellbore water seemed significant at the monitoring 20 m bgl and purging 25 m bgl depth at the beginning of purging while the portion of high ec water increased with time given the high ec 30 min after purging at a depth of 20 m in fig 4 and the stepwise increase in ec around 30 min since the purging began small peaks in ph and do 45 min later in fig 5 seemed to appear because we emptied the water in the bucket 5 2 4 stability of physicochemically stratified water bodies in the monitoring well water temperature increased with depth although it suddenly rose or decreased due to the effects of atmospheric temperature close to the water table fig 4a if the density of groundwater was only affected by such a temperature distribution it was inevitable that the convective flow caused by the water density distribution would occur and the observed stratification could not be maintained due to vertical mixing thus we included salinity for the water density calculation to explain the consistent vertical distribution of physicochemical parameters all year round may july and october before purging in 2016 in fig 4 given the large difference in ec between water bodies stratified within the monitoring well fig 10 shows changes in the calculated water density with depth in july 2016 according to the water density distribution in the well the interval in which the density reverses is only observed at depths between 10 m and 18 m bgl indicating that the convection caused by the density difference could occur only at these depths from the upper transition zone to the middle of the top layer in other depths the density of wellbore water increased with increasing depth therefore it is likely that once the vertical stratification of well bore water is formed it is difficult to collapse naturally in the monitoring well the well purging at the rate of 4000 l hr did not cause a significant vertical mixing in fig 4 it is noticeable that the ec value was still as high as 3000 μs cm at a depth of 20 m bgl however the ec value decreased to the pre purging value 46 h after the peak in fig 3e given no inflow of other water bodies into the well except the deep co2 rich groundwater through the screened zones relatively fast geochemical reactions and salinity dependent water density may explain the recovery of ec at the monitoring depth within 2 days after purging although the complete recovery over the entire depth may take longer times the precipitation of secondary minerals including green rust and hfo which accompany sorption of dissolved ions are relatively fast geochemical reactions according to dzombak and morel 1990 stable solution conditions during an experiment involving the precipitation of hfo are achieved within a minimum of two and preferably four hours in addition martin 2005 showed that the oxidation of ferric iron is observed at ph 6 with a lifetime of approximately a day in water equilibrated with air at 25 c and ph 6 the author also described that the lifetime rapidly decreases with increasing ph with the value of 30 min at ph 7 considering the ph range at the second upper transition zone 6 38 to 6 48 and the previous study results fe ii can be oxidized to hfo within a day in the water that had risen during purging we acknowledge that the decrease of ec at the monitoring probe after purging in fig 3 might be attributed to the mixing with freshwater if the borehole is fully screened and groundwater can enter the borehole at all depths however no fractures or cracks except the well screens were observed in the video record of borehole imaging suggesting the only inflow of high tds co2 rich water to the monitoring well besides water temperature was maintained within 14 16 5 c figs 2 and 4 which also excluded the mixing scenario with other water bodies 5 3 representativeness of wellbore water for automated monitoring gr 60 m near the screened zones can be concluded to reflect the hydrochemical characteristics of deep groundwater affected by deep seated co2 in the target aquifer with the following reasons the water inflowing though the screened zone from the bedrock aquifer showed the similar physicochemical characteristics high ec and low do throughout the year and did not change esp ec and temperature even after purging in fig 4 the ec 3833 μs cm of gr 60 m was slightly higher than the ec of co2 rich springs surveyed in the surrounding area at similar times while the ph and tds were similar the δ13c 1 1 of gr 60 m also was similar to those of surrounding co2 rich springs within the ranges known as the magmatic source clark and fritz 2013 deines et al 1974 however the gr 60 m showed lower pco2 alkalinity concentrations of ca and trace metals than co2 rich springs while higher na and sio2 on the other hand the gr 60 m had lower ph but higher pco2 alkalinity and δ13c than deep groundwater nearby table 1 and was plotted between co2 rich springs and deep groundwater on the piper diagram fig 7 however the automated monitoring probe is installed at a depth of 20 m fig 3a to monitor deep groundwater while the wellbore water is hydrochemically stratified because the co2 rich water experiences co2 exsolution in the open system and hydroxide precipitation in oxidizing conditions with decreasing depth in the borehole these situations caused the monitoring data at a depth of 20 m not to represent the deep groundwater but present much lower ec than gr 60 m and ec peaks during well purging figs 2 and 3 the rapid increases in ec for a moment at the monitoring probe were due to the physicochemical stratification of co2 rich groundwater in the monitoring well and its upward shift during well purging for maintenance that caused the upwell of deep groundwater to the monitoring probe at a depth of 20 m bgl as summarized in fig 10 in fact the ec peaks in figs 2 and 3 were as high as the ec of gr 60 m and co2 rich waters in the study area table 1 moreover small ups and downs of ec were observed excluding the peaks associated with purging probably because the monitoring probe was installed within the upper transition zone where the sudden drop in ec by 500 μs cm occurred within 1 m depth around 20 m bgl fig 4b 5 4 guide for geochemical monitoring using a real time data logger although this study only describes the geochemical stratification of co2 rich water in a cased well while the hydro stratigraphy in the aquifer probably do not occur based on the similar physicochemical properties along the three screened zones fig 4 hydrochemical stratification can occur in aquifers as well as in wells whenever a water body with high concentrations of ions and or salinity or a plume with different redox conditions flows in barrez and mania 2009 cotecchia et al 2005 elliot and younger 2014 marković et al 2013 neidhardt et al 2013 němeček et al 2017 rapantova et al 2013 mainly by the density difference also the vertical stratification of water bodies occurs in aquifers with different hydrogeologic conditions including aquitards giambastiani et al 2013 koh et al 2012 stenger et al 2018 xing et al 2018 the stratification in the aquifer can be exaggerated in a well which is open to the atmosphere in fact stratification has been reported in pumping wells for geothermal energy production and for artificial recharge due to redox condition changes depending on pumping rates or pumping depths burnside et al 2016 bustos medina et al 2013 despite the possibility of vertical stratification however automated monitoring probes have been installed at a fixed depth e g 20 m bgl in ngmn of south korea until recently with assuming that the wellbore filling groundwater coming through the screen intervals represents the groundwater quality of the aquifer and all depths have the same chemical composition throughout the well bhatti et al 2017 ryuh et al 2017 in addition the efficiency of costs and ease of maintenance make the water level ec or temperature measured at a depth regardless of the screen intervals or the stratification of water bodies in a well which may cause irregular fluctuations of the observations as in this study so far few issues have been reported lee et al 2005 2008 unlike the station we studied or the unusual episodic measurements may be ignored as device errors the study results emphasize that if automated monitoring with in situ instrumentation is considered the monitoring well must be properly designed to avoid artifacts introduced by stratified aquifer and wellbore processes we suggest to first determine the vertically distributed physicochemical layers in an aquifer and or wellbore by performing vertical logging if there is a potential of the physicochemical stratification due to the changes in orp and or ph in a monitoring well e g the groundwater influenced by co2 leakage or acid mine drainage with low ph and high concentrations of dissolved solutes the impact of purging on the vertical distribution as in fig 4 also needs to be assessed to understand the wellbore processes then depending on the purpose it is advisable to install monitoring probes in a target layer or multi layers according to this study the screened zone is a suitable location for installing an automated monitoring probe because it is unaffected by the hydrogeochemical processes in a cased well it is suggested to avoid physicochemical transition zones when installing the monitoring probes similarly polemio et al 2009 recommended to perform periodic logging to determine the location of transition zones and to optimize the depths for monitoring probes recently usgs recommended to obtain a vertical water quality profile through wellbore logging and to install an automated monitoring probe at a representative depth determined by the profile mathany et al 2019 6 conclusion automated groundwater monitoring systems have been widely applied for water resources management based on real time and high resolution information however an improper well design or an unexpected physicochemical variation in a well may cause artifacts which misguides one about the groundwater quality this study presents such a case that the groundwater inflowing through the screened zones reflects the hydrochemical characteristics of deep groundwater affected by deep seated co2 in the target aquifer while the monitoring data at a depth of 20 m does not because the co2 rich groundwater at depths below 50 m bgl experiences the hydrochemical processes esp co2 exsolution and precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides in the open system with decreasing depth causing a vertical stratification of physicochemical parameters such as ph ec and orp in the monitoring well meanwhile an automated monitoring probe is installed at a depth of 20 m bgl which turns out to be located within the transition zone these situations all together cause unusual high ec peaks during purging because the high ec groundwater in the lower part is pulled up to the monitoring depth the ec increased by purging is fast recovered at the monitoring depth probably due to relatively fast geochemical reactions and salinity dependent water density although we did not consider the gas volume when calculating the water density dissolution exsolution of co2 gas in groundwater is quite common in co2 water interaction processes in the subsurface environment however the physicochemical stratification has not been reported in a monitoring well before this study probably because of different well designs and insufficient monitoring data in this study we detected high ec fluctuations twice a year in the high resolution and long term automated monitoring data and conducted the repeated well logging to understand the physicochemical characteristics of stratified layers and to identify the mechanism for the stratification which led us to point out the issue about the monitoring depth in the automated monitoring system there would be other automated monitoring wells providing erroneous data caused by the similar or wrong design of monitoring wells given that the automated monitoring wells have been widely used to build a national groundwater monitoring network without detailed information about local aquifers the study result suggests that the screen installation interval where acidic co2 rich or high tds groundwater flows directly into the well is the best monitoring depth the study result confirms that measuring ec is an efficient in situ indicator prior to pricy and time consuming hydrochemical and isotopic analysis meeting the conditions for proper monitoring techniques 1 cost and labor effective for long term observation and 2 sensitively responsive to subtle groundwater changes ec can be automatically measured using relatively inexpensive devices moreover a change in ec in groundwater directly indicates the variation of dissolved solutes resulting from physicochemical changes with depth in the monitoring well the study result also suggests that physicochemical stratification of groundwater should be carefully considered for appropriate automated groundwater monitoring because the representative groundwater coming through the screened zones may experience the hydrochemical change with depth in a well causing non representative water quality at a monitoring probe particularly the presence of interface zones with a dramatic change in ec must be carefully considered to determine the depths of monitoring apparatus and sampling for various chemical analyses credit
