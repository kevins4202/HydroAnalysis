7990,study region southern africa study focus we assessed quantile mapping strengths and weaknesses in climate downscaling based on global climate models projections an ensemble of methods is used six methods using parametric transformations three methods with non parametric transformations and one method with theoretical distributions transformations seventeen climate indices related to precipitation are applied to the locations of 15 unesco biosphere reserves the methods are validated using a cross validation procedure the results of the projections for two different future scenarios from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 are analysed and their contribution to the overall uncertainty in the climate indices is quantified quantile mapping stationary assumptions are also investigated new hydrological insights on the region the relative error from the cross validation shows that both the non parametric methods and the parametric methods using an exponential type transformation have in general a good skill in correcting the biases the method using theoretical distributions shows a good skill for low extremes the analysis of the methods uncertainty contribution reveals that the largest contributors to the overall uncertainty are the climate models whereas in some cases the methods have the highest uncertainty share the uncertainty contribution from the methods is higher for the high extremes compared to the low extremes the stationary assumptions seem robust the projections indicate a tendency of the region towards dryer conditions and intensified precipitation events however this trend contains strong intra regional variations graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change statistical downscaling quantile mapping

due to the contribution of anthropogenic activities to climate change in this the regions in the world that are in the development stage present higher vulnerabilities compared to the developed regions as the former have a low response capacity to disasters many studies demonstrated that there are regions that will suffer higher impacts compared to others for example africa will suffer from higher temperatures compared to the global warning levels gwls thus even if the temperature increase is limited according to the roof from the paris agreement below 2 c africa is still going to have temperatures of more than 2 c dosio 2017 maúre et al 2018 nikulin et al 2018 in this study the southern african region which is one of the regions with target priority for climate change impact studies is considered a literature review on the changes in the rainfall amounts in southern africa reveals that no clear trend is found especially for the wet season dosio et al 2019 laprise et al 2013 however when the studies focus on a specific area more clear trends emerge for instance a decrease increase in most of south africa botswana lesotho eswatini and the south of mozambique and zimbabwe malawi zambia and north of mozambique and zimbabwe is projected for summer precipitation shongwe et al 2009 the occurrence of rainfall tends to agree more between studies and areas in southern africa most of the studies agree that there will be an increase in the consecutive dry days déqué et al 2017 giorgi et al 2014 maúre et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 and in the dry spell length abiodun et al 2017 pinto et al 2016 together with decreases in the wet day frequency abiodun et al 2017 in fact the climate change signals of the dry and wet day frequencies are more clear and dominant compared to the signal of precipitation amount déqué et al 2017 dosio et al 2019 dosio and panitz 2016 however weber et al 2018 concluded that the signal of the number of dry days in the wet season is uncertain for the region as a whole most studies agree that the high extremes in precipitation will increase abiodun et al 2017 déqué et al 2017 giorgi et al 2014 nikulin et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 weber et al 2018 some of the studies noted that this increase is regional dependent pinto et al 2016 weber et al 2018 for instance the western cape region is projected to have no change while other coastal regions e g mozambique madagascar will suffer from an intensification of the precipitation extremes pinto et al 2016 the features from the annual cycle of precipitation are also strongly regional dependent for zambia malawi north mozambique and north zimbabwe some studies déqué et al 2017 shongwe et al 2009 concluded that the rainy season might have a later onset and a later cessation in the future thus suggesting a shift of the season for other areas lesotho eswatini most of south africa and botswana and southern mozambique and zimbabwe the studies project a delayed onset and early cessation mariotti et al 2014 shongwe et al 2009 hence a shortening of the season is suggested additionally mariotti et al 2014 found increasing rainfall in december february indirectly suggesting a narrowing intertropical convergence zone itcz with an increasing intensity passing over africa most of the mentioned studies used information at global and regional scales from the coupled model intercomparison project phases 3 and 5 cmip3 and cmip5 these generations of models are outdated since the outputs from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 have become available in recent years eyring et al 2016 gidden et al 2019 o neill et al 2016 therefore to address the impacts of climate change new studies should be performed in the region since the local response capacity to cope with climate change is important the solutions to face the common problems in southern africa e g flooding severe droughts highly depend also on local conditions in this the unesco biosphere reserves brs are meant for studying the effects of climate change adaptation and mitigation in the region these biospheres will function as pilot projects toward climate change adaptation so the findings can be applied in other regions more effectively it is here that we find the importance of studying the local impacts of climate change on the brs given the coarse resolution of the available global climate models gcms downscaling is required to bridge the gap with the local scale of the brs this downscaling can be based on dynamic or statistical methods dynamical downscaling requires regional climate models to be available with a resolution similar or smaller to the brs an ensemble of such models is however not available for the southern africa region hence we must rely on statistical downscaling for studying the local impacts of climate change the study of these impacts at local scale requires robust statistical downscaling methods sdms to be applied to the gcm outputs among the different types of methods quantile mapping methods have been widely applied for bias correction and statistical downscaling the application of these methods for bias correction e g boé et al 2007 piani et al 2010b 2010a räty et al 2014 schmith et al 2021 teutschbein and seibert 2013 2012 and statistical downscaling e g gutiérrez et al 2018 hertig et al 2018 is broad moreover most of the quantile mapping applications in the statistical downscaling context are assessed through the analysis of their errors gudmundsson et al 2012 but the analysis of their assumptions and their contribution to the overall uncertainties remain weakly targeted thus to obtain confident projections for future climate at the local scale the strengths and weaknesses of the methods must be analysed in this sense this work evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of different quantile mapping methods through the analysis of local projections for southern africa for the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 an ensemble of 24 different gcms and two future scenarios namely ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 are downscaled to local stations obtained from the global historical climatology network ghcn for a focussed analysis different impact related research indicators are calculated the validation of the calibrated relations is based on a cross validation procedure moreover the relative errors derived from the cross validation procedure are also used to analyse the strengths weaknesses and assumptions of the methods furthermore the variance decomposition procedure is applied to the results to better understand the sdms contribution to the overall uncertainties in addition the significance of the climate change signal is analysed through an ensemble of different realisations from the canesm5 gcm the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the data the research indicators the methodologies and all the downscaling methods used in this work in section 3 the results are presented and discussed section 4 presents the concluding remarks 2 data and methods 2 1 global climate models this study considers the daily outputs of 24 different gcms obtained from cmip6 dataset earth system grid federation esgf 2021 which are the state of art climate models table 4 the previous generation of models cmip5 considered different radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century these possible future realisations with different levels of greenhouse gas concentrations are known as representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2008 the main difference with the new generation is that the new models use the shared socio economic pathways ssps together with their radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century the ssps describe a combination of possible futures of global society that take into account changes in demographics human development economy and lifestyle policies and institutions technology environment and natural resources o neill et al 2017 from these models the historical simulations in the period 1961 1990 and two future scenarios in the period 2070 2099 are considered namely ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 o neill et al 2017 ssp1 2 6 positive human development with investments in education and health economic growth strong institutions and cooperation there is a sustainable shift towards a more sustainable relationship with natural resources a peak in radiative forcing at 2 6 w m2 before 2100 and decline ssp5 8 5 same positive human development as ssp1 instead of a sustainable relationship with natural resources ssp5 develops a strong and energy intensive economy based on fossil fuels innovation is highly valued rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8 5 w m2 in 2100 this makes up an ensemble of 48 different simulations in this study 1961 1990 is the control period and 2070 2099 is the future period the projections are calculated based on the ensemble mean which is known to be more accurate than single projections diallo et al 2012 kalognomou et al 2013 kim et al 2014 2 2 extreme indices in this study we used the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi indices to address the analysis of the climate change signal ccs the indices are known worldwide and are commonly applied in the community table 1 presents a summary of the climate indices also referred to as research indicators for a detailed analysis of precipitation extremes high rainfall extremes and low rainfall extremes are linked to the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 and the maximum length of the dry spells r7 respectively 2 3 observations to perform the downscaling at the local scale local stations are needed to correct the biases derived from the large scale climate data gcms in this sense daily precipitation datasets for a total of 15 stations from the databases of the world meteorological organization wmo are considered dataset national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and national centers for environmental information ncei 2021 more specifically these datasets belong to the global historical climatology network ghcn the motivation of this choice is because the ghcn datasets were developed for scientific applications one of them being climate analysis and also due to their quality and quantity most of the stations used in this work contain more than 30 years of data a detailed description of the datasets can be found in menne et al 2012 the names of the brs and the stations used in this study are shown in table 2 the closest station to each br is chosen as representative of the local scale precipitation the stations are used to calibrate the quantile mapping methods in the control period 1961 1990 later these relations are applied to the gcm daily outputs in the future period 2070 2099 to obtain precipitation projections at the station scale 2 4 statistical downscaling methods the methods used in this study belong to the family of quantile mapping methods each method contains its methodology hence a closer look will help to understand the possible outcomes from them quantile mapping methods are considered advanced bias correction methods but they can also be used to downscale precipitation the bias correction is quantile based and the outcomes are the downscaled future series for local analysis the relations are derived by a comparison between the coarse climate and the local observations from a control period and then applied to the future period quantile mapping is not bound to a specific statistical relation and different relations can be constructed table 3 therefore this work sub classifies them into three different types of quantile mapping methods i methods that make use of parametric transformations ii methods with non parametric transformations and iii methods with theoretical distribution transformations the transformations used are explained in the work of gudmundsson et al 2012 and implemented in the qmap package in r programming language the parametric approaches make use of parametric transformations to calculate the quantile quantile relation of observed and gcm data the transformation functions are calibrated with observed and gcm data in the control period 1961 1990 the non parametric approaches aim to approximate the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of observed and gcm data this process is done by using tables of empirical percentiles in the control period 1961 1990 the theoretical distribution approaches assume that the transformation function of the gcm and observed data in the control period 1961 1990 can be achieved by a combination of two different theoretical distributions for precipitation intensity and occurrence for more details of the methods the reader is referred to gudmundsson et al 2012 and piani et al 2010a it is important to stress that quantile mapping methods are subjected to different assumptions for the context of this work two of them are of importance the methods assume time invariance of the bias and that the bias is similar under different forcing conditions many authors have suggested that sdms might violate these assumptions dixon et al 2016 lanzante et al 2018 maraun 2012 maraun and widmann 2018 however some authors showed that advanced methods such as quantile mapping e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 perform better than the simpler ones under non stationary climate conditions thus the debate is still open and it is important to analyse to which extent these assumptions hold 2 4 1 quantile mapping using parametric transformations this set of methods makes direct use of parametric transformations and the correction is only applied to the intensities of wet days a threshold selection is done to equalise the fraction of days with precipitation between observed and modelled values and each method sets to zero all the modelled values below this threshold however biases in precipitation occurrence might still exist after the correction if the modelled data has less wet days compared to the observed the transformations can be simple or complex since there is no clear consensus on which relation can best bias correct the modelled values six relations are implemented in the qmap package in r programing language and all of them are considered in this work the simplest ones power relation linear relation and simple scaling contain less than three free parameters to calibrate while the most complex ones exponential power with initial threshold and exponential with initial threshold contain at least three free parameters note that the power and exponential relations naturally tend to an asymptote making them interesting relations for high extreme rainfall power transformation sd pt 1 1 p ˆ obs b p mod c linear transformation sd pt 2 2 p ˆ obs a b p mod exponential transformation sd pt 3 3 p ˆ obs a b p mod 1 e p mod τ simple scaling transformation sd pt 4 4 p ˆ obs b p mod power transformation with initial value sd pt 5 5 p ˆ obs b p mod x 0 c exponential transformation with initial value sd pt 6 6 p ˆ obs a b p mod 1 e p mod x 0 τ where p ˆ obs and p mod are the corrected gcm value and the non corrected gcm value respectively and a b c x 0 and τ are free parameters that need to be optimised note that eqs 5 and 6 are more complex versions of eqs 1 and 3 respectively in which an initial value for the function is also considered also the shown notation and relations are the same as the implementation in the qmap package so it is easy to follow up for r users 2 4 2 non parametric quantile mapping the non parametric quantile mapping makes direct use of the empirical quantiles to perform the bias correction here three non parametric quantile mapping methods are considered all of them are considered similar in complexity 2 4 2 1 non parametric quantile mapping using empirical quantiles sd np 1 this method utilises the empirical distributions of the observed and gcm values the corrections are done using the empirical percentiles this imposes an extra assumption if the climate projections are larger than the ones from the training period the largest value in the projections is corrected by the highest quantile of the training period note that the highest quantiles from the future projections are assumed to have the same bias as the highest quantiles in the present period thus the use of this method in extremes might bring limitations moreover there is a threshold selection to equalise the fraction of days with precipitation between observed and modelled values in this method modelled values below this threshold are set to zero the implementation of this method in qmap follows the procedure of boé et al 2007 2 4 2 2 non parametric quantile mapping using robust empirical quantiles sd np 2 this method is similar to the previous sd np 1 with the difference that for the estimation of the quantiles a linear regression model is used instead of empirical quantiles similar to sd np 1 using this method for extreme analysis might bring limitations moreover the values below a selected threshold are set to zero by the method 2 4 2 3 quantile mapping using a smoothing spline sd np 3 this method makes use of non parametric transformations more specifically cubic smoothing splines the correction is only applied to the intensities of wet days similar to the previous methods a threshold is considered for the daily rainfall amount when bias correcting the fraction of days with precipitation it should be noted that because the non parametric approaches do not rely on a predetermined function they have more flexibility for the quantile quantile relation hence the high extremes might be better described by these methods however it has also been demonstrated that the complex parametric transformations with many free parameters may be as good as the non parametric approaches gudmundsson et al 2012 regarding the very low precipitation values caution should be exerted the tables of empirical percentiles considered in the non parametric approaches might show notorious differences in the magnitude of the rainfall values for the same ranking position resulting in a potential overestimation of the factors to correct the bias in very low precipitation values therefore modelled values with the non parametric approaches might show some artefacts in very low precipitation values or the estimation of indices related to wet dry day frequencies 2 4 3 quantile mapping using distribution derived transformations this method uses theoretical distributions to perform the corrections sd td 1 the implementation here assumes that the transformation function for the gcm and observed values can be achieved by a combination of the bernoulli and the gamma distributions the bernoulli component applies to the rainfall occurrence process with wet day 1 and dry day 0 occurrences empirical cumulative distribution functions are calculated for both the observed and modelled values in which the probability of the first non zero observation is taken then the modelled value equivalent to that probability is chosen as a threshold and all the values below are set to 0 however it assumes a wet bias in the precipitation occurrence of the modelled values and that this bias is similar in the future hence the change in the wet dry day frequencies might not be accurate the gamma distribution applies to the rainfall values on the wet days cannon 2008 cawley et al 2006 gudmundsson et al 2012 haylock et al 2006 ines and hansen 2006 piani et al 2010a thom 1968 williams 1998 in the procedure one first fits the observed values only wet days to a gamma distribution 7 f x α β γ α β x γ α x wdt where wdt is the precipitation threshold x is a precipitation value α the shape parameter β the scale parameter γ α the gamma function γ α β x the lower incomplete gamma function f the cumulative distribution function the shape and scale parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method then the gcm values are fitted to the same distribution that later is mapped onto the distribution that was fitted to the observed values 8 x gcm corr f obs 1 f gcm x x wdt 0 x wdt where f 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function the subscripts obs and gcm denote the observations and the gcm values respectively and corr denotes corrected values gudmundsson et al 2012 ines and hansen 2006 2 5 validation of the downscaling methods the methods are validated by employing a cross validation procedure räty et al 2014 schmith et al 2021 tabari et al 2021 in this the 24 gcms are considered pseudo observations in which each time one gcm is used to develop the relations to correct the biases of the other 23 in the control period 1961 1990 the outputs of the gcm considered as pseudo observations gcm pseudo observations are used to calibrate bias correct the relations for the remaining gcms considered as climate projections gcm projections in the scenario period 2070 2099 the research indicators are calculated with the gcm pseudo observations and used to validate the ones obtained with the bias corrected gcm projections fig 1 for that the relative mean error en for each indicator is calculated as the absolute difference between the projected indicator from the corrected future gcm projections and the indicator from the future gcm pseudo observations divided by the future gcm pseudo observations the cross validation procedure is applied independently to the two future scenarios note that the methods are analysed in 15 different locations and two different climatic regimes the brs near the southwest coast and the brs in the east with 24 gcms n 24 15 different locations nl 15 and ten sdms nsdm 10 82 800 nsdm nl n n 1 10 15 24 24 1 combinations are possible a robust analysis of the methods performances and assumptions is done by analysing the relative errors with all the combinations these relative errors will represent the skill of the models 2 6 analysis of uncertainties to study the contribution of the methods to the overall uncertainty variance decomposition is applied in this procedure the different contributors are assessed and also the contribution of their interactions this is done by quantifying the variance associated to the total uncertainty and by splitting this variance into the fractions associated to the gcms ssp scenarios and sdms 9 var t var g var s var d var gs var gd var sd var gsd where var t is the total variance var g is the variance associated to the gcm ensemble var s to the different future ssp scenarios var d to the different downscaling methods and var gs var gd var sd and var gsd to the interactions between the three contributors note that if the full variability of all the contributors is summed the actual result will be larger than the total variance because each of the contributors contains interactions in this study we are interested in the total contribution from the different downscaling methods 10 var total d v ar d var gd var sd var gsd the variance that corresponds to each of the terms is obtained by the analysis of variance anova the procedure is valid for all the research indicators first we obtain the variance due to only each term s variability 11 var g 1 24 i 1 24 x i x 2 12 var s 1 2 j 1 2 x j x 2 13 var d 1 10 k 1 10 x k x 2 then we obtain the variance due to the interaction between two contributors 14 var gs 1 24 i 1 24 1 2 j 1 2 x ij x i x j x 2 15 var gd 1 24 i 1 24 1 10 k 1 10 x i k x i x k x 2 16 var sd 1 2 j 1 2 1 10 k 1 10 x jk x j x k x 2 lastly we obtain the variance due to the interaction between the three contributors 17 var gsd 1 24 i 1 24 1 2 j 1 2 1 10 k 1 10 x ijk x ij x i k x jk x i x j x k x 2 where the dots represent the averages with respect to the indices they are substituting i represents the gcms 24 models j represents the ssp scenarios two scenarios and k represents the downscaling methods ten methods for more information about the procedure the reader is referred to déqué et al 2012 2007 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 2 7 significance of the signal a procedure similar to tabari et al 2019 is adopted to define when the signal is significant for that 25 different runs from canesm5 r1i1f1p1 r2 i1f1p1 r3 i1f1p1 r25 i1f1p1 see table 4 are considered to account for the analysis of natural variability signal to noise ratio s2nr the cmip6 model simulations include several historical experiments these simulations can be regarded as the historical ensemble they are specified by the following four types of conditions realisation index initialisation index physics index and forcing index the 25 simulations taken into account in this work contain the same initialisation index physics index and forcing index these simulations vary only the realisation index and because the other components remain the same they represent the internal variability of one model canesm5 the difference between these gcm runs is that they are initialised using different starting conditions i e points in the preindustrial control run considering the previous information we then can calculate the research indicators with all the runs in the control period and then check for the differences between the runs these differences can thus be attributed to the internal variability in the climate system of one model which is regarded as noise the latter is considered here as natural variability consequently a significant test z score is performed tabari et al 2019 in this procedure the climate change signal ccs ensemble calculated for each research indicator rn as r n proj divided by r n obs is said to be significant if it is sufficiently large compared to the natural variability s2nr for that the null hypothesis h0 of the z test considers no significant change or that the s2nr is greater than the change i e the mean of ccs is equal to one accepting the null hypothesis will mean that the change is not significant while rejecting it accepting the alternative hypothesis h1 will mean that the change is significant the critical value z from a standard normal distribution corresponding to a significance level of 5 95 of confidence is used to test the hypothesis hence if a z ccs ensemble 1 stdev 25 runscanesm 5 is greater than 1 96 critical z value the null hypothesis is rejected 3 results and discussions the different strengths and weaknesses of the statistical downscaling methods applied in this work can be uncovered by the analysis of their relative errors skill and their contribution to the overall uncertainties in the downscaling context for robust conclusions the results should also be linked to the assumptions of the methods as mentioned in section 2 2 the results for the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 and the maximum length of the dry spells r7 are linked with high and low rainfall extremes 3 1 analysis of the errors the performance of the methods is analysed and validated prior to their application for climate projections the largest deviations are expected to appear in the ssp5 8 5 scenario as it contains the strongest forcing conditions therefore the relative error is presented with the results from the ssp5 8 5 scenario as future pseudo observations figs 2 4 for validation in order to derive more information from this analysis a summary of the relative error computed from both scenarios as future pseudo observations ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 is presented in table 5 while the first analysis aids in the validation the second does it in the analysis of the stationary assumptions of the quantile mapping methods i the time invariance of the bias and ii the independence of the bias of the forcing conditions 3 1 1 spatial distribution of the errors the validation is done through inter model cross validation applied to the 15 different sites in each location the 17 research indicators are calculated with the bias corrected data later the errors are computed and presented in spatially distributed maps figs 2 and 3 in each map the performance of the methods can be analysed note that the locations from the southwest area have different climatic characteristics than the ones from the east the most important difference is the opposite rainy season pattern more specifically in the southwest locations the rainy season is situated around march to september while in the east locations it is from october to march for the sake of the analysis only the results for the maximum length of the dry spells r7 and the maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period r9 are presented the mentioned indicators are considered for the analysis of low and high extreme precipitation the rainfall extremes low or high are important in southern africa because they are the main drivers of droughts or floods in the region the results show that the errors of the sdms for the maximum length of the dry spells r7 are generally higher in the coastal areas to analyse whether there is a spatial trend in the errors fig 2 is presented a clustering to either the left or the right will show where the biggest errors tend to be located a trend into a specific direction means regional worse performance however no clear clustering was found in any of the cases by analysing the error graph of fig 2 bottom centre we can conclude that there is no method outperforming the others nevertheless if we analyse the performance of the methods in specific locations fig 4 the median of their errors might not deviate too much from each other but the variability in the methods can be high compared to each other the errors in r9 maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period which represent the high extremes in the region show some interesting features fig 3 first to uncover these features we need to understand the complexity of southern africa s climate in a broad view the plateaus and the narrow coastal belt of southern africa lead to strong topographic gradients this topography is able to influence the track and the development of many weather systems and the austral winter precipitation that develops due to temperate frontal systems from the westerlies daron et al 2019 and the references therein moreover the austral summer rainfall in the east is highly influenced by the warm agulhas and cold benguela currents and the moist winds coming from the indian ocean which are partially trapped by the island of madagascar daron et al 2019 and the references therein second note that in most of the methods the biggest errors do not show a specific location they are random but in the most simple methods of the parametric transformations sd pt 2 and sd pt 4 the biggest errors tend to cluster in the east region where the wet season is on the austral summer this means that these methods represent better the extreme rainfall in the wet season of the southwest coast austral winter compared to the extreme rainfall in the eastern region the reason might be that the locations in the southwest are mainly coastal in which the plateaus are not yet an important factor for the development of the precipitation extremes nor the austral summer rainfall moreover due to the coastal location the extremes might be more influenced by large scale weather in which gcms are known to be robust therefore for the most simple methods of the parametric transformations which use linear functions and simple scaling it is less difficult to establish proper relations in the southwest compared to the east even though there are no outperforming methods sd td 1 and sd np 3 have a bigger error area see fig 3 compared to the other methods in the rainfall extremes for a 30 year return period r9 thus the use in high extremes of these two methods might bring drawbacks however the latter is not true when it comes to the analysis for low extremes r7 as the methods have more or less similar areas compared to the others see fig 2 to summarise the results indicate that the non parametric methods perform better than the rest in low extremes r7 also the method that uses mixed theoretical distributions gamma for intensities and bernoulli for occurrences performs similar to the non parametric methods the methods that make use of parametric transformations perform better in high extremes r9 but worse in r7 this is especially true for sd pt 3 and sd pt 6 that compared to the rest show a smaller median error in r9 and a shorter range of variability additionally note that sd pt 6 is a variation from sd pt 3 it uses the same concept but with an initial value sd pt 3 uses a more complex parametric transformation compared to the other parametric methods and sd pt 6 is the method with the highest number of free parameters 3 1 2 the skill of the sdms sd pt 3 and sd pt 6 showed the best skill lowest average error in the maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period in both scenarios this is similar to the findings of gudmundsson et al 2012 who showed that the best performing methods for the norwegian region were the ones that used non parametric transformations and noted that the parametric transformations methods with many free parameters e g sd pt 6 performed similarly however in this work the non parametric transformations did not yield the best performance though it was close to the skill of the sd pt 6 and sd pt 3 methods maraun and widmann 2018 noted that the extrapolations from the quantile mapping methods using theoretical distributions might be substantially biased for severe events even though that sd td 1 uses a gamma distribution the presence of this bias was confirmed previously by gudmundsson et al 2012 and was also verified in this study hence sd td 1 must be used with precaution for the projections in high extremes in low rainfall extremes sd td 1 has a good skill together with sd np 1 sd np 2 and sd np 3 3 1 3 the assumptions of the sdms the statistical downscaling methods used in this work contain two specific assumptions namely the time invariance of the bias and that the bias is independent of the forcing conditions first as pointed out by maraun and widmann 2018 biases might not be time invariant this assumption is partially tested with the cross validation procedure because the calibration period is far enough from the future period during which the validation procedure cross validation is applied second the procedure was applied independently for two future scenarios with different forcing conditions ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 hence the validation also assessed whether the bias remains the same under different forcing conditions these assumptions are tested by comparing the average of the sdms relative errors derived from both future scenarios table 5 the comparison presented is restricted to two research indicators representative of the low and high rainfall extremes the results indicate that the methods tend to enlarge their relative errors when the forcing is higher ssp5 8 5 error higher than ssp1 2 6 error however regardless of the larger geographical differences in relative error e g 40 56 and 10 95 for lubombo and cape west coast respectively in r7 ssp1 2 6 the average performance of the methods under different forcing conditions is similar hence the results point out that the errors do not vary substantially from one scenario to the other even for the maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period which contains the highest error and contribution to the uncertainties the differences in errors of the different future scenarios are low 3 2 sources of uncertainty this sub section presents the quantification of all the sources of uncertainty see eq 9 in 15 different sites together with a spatially distributed summary of the sdms contribution figs 5 and 6 fig 5 shows clear evidence that in general the major source of uncertainty is the gcm ensemble moreover interesting features emerge in the uncertainty share of the sdms especially for the high and low extremes fig 6 in addition the overall analysis of the uncertainties indicates that the contribution from the future scenarios tends to be small 3 2 1 uncertainty contribution of the gcms regardless of the climatic characteristics the gcm ensemble seems to be the higher contributor to the overall uncertainties with the average of the gcms contribution to the overall uncertainties through the region we found in all the research indicators that the average contribution is higher compared to the other sources for instance the highest contribution from the sdms see eq 10 is in the r9 indicator with around 45 spatial average while for the same indicator the contribution by the gcms is around 83 the highest contribution of the gcms is for the low extremes more specifically the maximum length of the dry spells r7 has a contribution of 92 however in some cases in the high low extremes the contribution to the uncertainties from the sdms is equal to or higher compared to the gcms for instance for r9 in kogelberg br1 the contribution from the sdms reaches 76 while in the gcms is around 61 3 2 2 uncertainty contribution of the sdms as suggested by räty et al 2014 we analysed the sdms uncertainty contribution with daily precipitation and many downscaling methods in all locations the contribution in high and low extremes r9 r13 and r7 respectively tends to be higher compared to the average climate indicators e g r5 or r1 fig 5 for instance in kogelberg br1 the total contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainty is r5 precipitation during the rainy season 18 r7 max length of the dry spells 49 r9 daily precipitation for a 30 year return period 76 r13 occurrence of extreme precipitation 68 and r17 average daily precipitation intensity on the wet season 83 far from the south coast in mount mulanje br2 the contribution from the sdms is r1 precipitation during the rainy season 13 r7 max length of the dry spells 33 r9 daily precipitation for a 30 year return period 53 r13 occurrence of extreme precipitation 37 and r16 average daily precipitation intensity on the wet season 32 by averaging the contributions in all the locations we found that the highest percentage of contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainty is on the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 by around 45 of contribution also the average daily rainfall in the wet and dry periods denoted by the indicators r16 and r17 is the second highest around 44 in both moreover the average contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainties in the maximum length of the dry spells r7 is lower compared to the previous indicators around 20 section 3 2 1 showed that the biggest contributor to the uncertainties was the gcm ensemble however when looking at the results for high extremes one can find cases in which the biggest contributors to the uncertainties were the sdms e g r9 r13 in kogelberg or that the contribution of the sdms was comparable to the gcms e g r9 r13 in mount mulanje this finding means that in high extremes the contribution is large e g r9 or r13 and in average indicators such as the amounts of rainfall per season e g r2 or r5 the contribution is small typically with regard to the results from the high extremes indicators e g r10 r12 r13 r14 or r15 the contribution to the overall uncertainties is higher compared to the non extreme indicators thus similar to piani et al 2010a we found that the largest sdms uncertainty share is located where large corrections in the intensity of precipitation events are applied the uncertainty in high rainfall extremes not only has a high percentage of contribution from the sdms the highest within the sdms contribution in the indicators but it is also random no spatial clustering or pattern and more or less equally big in all the locations see fig 6 therefore we must take precaution with the quantile mapping projections for high extreme rainfall in all the locations in low extremes r7 the highest contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainty is clustered near the south and north coastal regions see fig 6 this pattern might be partially explained by the differences in the gcm simulations first note the gcm as the highest uncertainty contributor then since the coastal areas are more influenced by large scale weather compared to other areas in the study domain the uncertainty contributions from the sdms might be largely influenced by the gcm simulations increasing their contribution due to the sdm gcm interaction term for example fig 5 shows that the indicator r7 contains a larger uncertainty contribution associated with the gcm sdm interaction in br1 and br13 kogelberg and quirimbas compared to br9 and br4 middle zambezi and waterberg 3 3 overall projections the future scenario projections are presented as change factors tables 6 and 7 the change factors were obtained by dividing the future projections with the present observed climate indicators a change factor greater lower than one means an increase decrease significant changes are denoted in bold italic as expected there are more significant changes in the ssp5 8 5 scenario compared to the ssp1 2 6 scenario for ssp1 2 6 a significant increase was found only for three locations in the daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 with 32 25 and 29 in middle zambezi br9 magaliesberg br11 and quirimbas br13 respectively regarding low extremes r7 significant increases were found in mount mulanje br2 and garden route br12 with 40 and 43 respectively while in middle zambezi br9 there is a significant decrease of 31 moreover the annual rainfall is significantly decreasing in kogelberg br1 cape west coast br3 cape winelands br7 goritz cluster br10 and garden route br12 by 7 8 8 7 and 6 respectively and significantly increasing in quirimbas r13 with 9 note that the daily rainfall for a 10 year return period r10 is significantly decreasing in all locations and together with the increase in r9 and r13 and the decrease in r11 this indicates an intensification of the extreme events in ssp5 8 5 scenario there are 7 locations with significant increases for r9 kruger to canyons br5 lake chillwa wetland br6 vhembe br8 middle zambezi br9 magaliesberg br11 quirimbas r13 and lubombo br15 of 47 35 61 63 61 47 and 31 respectively in low extremes r7 there are significant increases in mount mulanje br2 goritz cluster br10 and garden route br12 of 37 32 and 50 respectively and significant decreases in lake chillwa wetland br6 and middle zambezi br9 by about 29 and 50 respectively moreover the region is moving towards dryer conditions because the projections in most of the locations show a decrease in annual rainfall r8 an overall significant decrease in r3 and an overall increase in r6 note that the daily rainfall for a 10 year return period r10 and the wet days of the rainy dry season r3 1 1 note that the research indicator r3 is defined as the wet day frequency from october to april thus it might mean wet dry season depending on the location are significantly decreasing in all locations r9 and r13 are increasing and r11 is decreasing indicating an intensification of the extreme events the overall decrease in r3 wet day frequency in the region was also found in abiodun et al 2017 similarly the increase in r9 high rainfall extremes was found in many studies e g abiodun et al 2017 déqué et al 2017 giorgi et al 2014 nikulin et al 2018 hence in this future scenario the region might be negatively affected by climate change in the sense that the countries will have to cope with dryer conditions e g drought and more intense high extreme events e g flooding we want to stress that the projections from both future scenarios ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 contain similar features compared to other studies although the future scenarios analysed in these studies rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 or 1 5 2 and 3 of gwl from cmip5 are different in the sense that they present different future realisations the analysis was done for the end of the 21st century allowing for comparison in the trend of the projections for that future period similar to weber et al 2018 who found uncertain the projections of the number of wet days for the region as a whole most of the results from ssp1 2 6 table 6 show no significant change and depending on the location either a decrease or an increase pinto et al 2016 and weber et al 2018 projected an intensification of the rainfall events but they showed that the change was dependent on the geographical location similarly some locations in this study e g cape west coast show no significant changes in r9 extreme rainfall for the ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios while on other locations e g lake chillwa wetland or quirimbas there are significant increases intensification of extremes note that lake chillwa wetland and quirimbas are located in mozambique an area in which pinto et al 2016 found an increase in the 20 year return period rainfall 4 conclusions to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the sdms we performed an analysis with impact related research indicators and not directly with the properties linked to the statistical distributions of the meteorological variables e g mean variance values from extreme quantiles because the methods are designed to correct the probability density function pdf of the gcms in order to match the pdf of the observations boé et al 2007 thus the properties linked to the statistical distribution will tend to be well reproduced and this will give biased confidence to all of the methods the validation with the cross validation procedure aids in the estimation of the methods errors for a period completely independent from the calibration period for deeper insights the stationary assumptions of the sdms were also investigated moreover the variance decomposition allowed a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the contribution of the sdms to the overall uncertainties in the future indicator values the projections were analysed based on the significance and the direction of change we conclude for high extremes that the parametric and the non parametric approaches might be more adequate than the approaches with theoretical distributions however it should be stressed that even the best skilled methods of quantile mapping used in this study have drawbacks in the projections for very rare events the methods with non parametric transformations sd np 1 sd np 2 and sd np 3 and with theoretical distributions sd td 1 performed better than the rest for the maximum length of the dry spells however the equalisation of the gcm and the observed precipitation occurrences with a threshold has limitations the wet dry day correction does not necessarily correct the length of the wet dry spells and they can remain too long or short after the correction also the case when the observed precipitation has more wet days than the models cannot be handled in general the results highlighted the importance of using an ensemble of methods rather than looking for the best performing method the relative errors found in this work suggest that in most of the cases the relations calibrated are able to adequately correct the biases independently of the period or the forcing conditions this indicates that the stationary assumptions of the studied methods might be robust however the relative errors vary substantially between locations hence precaution must be exerted with the projections of high and low extreme rainfall as the results showed that in some locations the time invariance of the relations might have been violated as mentioned in maraun and widmann 2018 it is important to stress that the errors in local extreme events cannot be corrected with quantile mapping as they are inherited from gcms quantile mapping will resolve as best as gcm skill in extremes and it will not enhance the extremes representation hence local extremes will not be represented appropriately unless they can be represented adequately on the large scale in a weather more dominated by large scale circulation the representation of extremes from quantile mapping might be adequate but when the local features become more important e g convection or orography the ensemble of methods used in this study might show drawbacks in the representation of these features the gcms were found to be the largest contributors to the uncertainties this finding seems to hold for other regions as well fatichi et al 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 van uytven and willems 2018 however the sdms might become the largest contributors in high extremes the latter can be attributed to the fact that the sdms largest uncertainty contribution is located where large corrections in the intensity of precipitation happen the uncertainty analysis also revealed that the contribution from the future scenarios tends to be small hence the gcms and the climate variability seem to mask the greenhouse gas sensitivity in the different ssp scenarios in this region in fact similar results for the local scale were found in other regions fatichi et al 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 van uytven and willems 2018 this finding is interesting as one would expect that due to their different forcing conditions the future scenarios will have a strong influence on the behaviour of the different rainfall events therefore a detailed study on the sensitivity of the ssp scenarios to the different greenhouse gas concentrations is advised for this region the future scenario ssp1 2 6 showed less clear changes compared to the ssp5 8 5 scenario on the one hand we can conclude that the change in ssp1 2 6 is rather uncertain than a clear trend on the other hand in the ssp5 8 5 scenario a tendency towards dryer conditions and intensified extreme events in most of the locations was seen the wet days showed a significant decrease in all the locations and there was also a general tendency of an increase in the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period however the signal of this trend is weak as the change was not completely clear for other indicators like the maximum length of the dry spells the increase or decrease in the climate change signal is highly dependent on the location and does not have a clear regional trend several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged first the quantile mapping methods do not correct more than what the control period 1961 1990 shows second is the direct use of gcms as they cannot account for many processes at the local scale e g orographic precipitation third as noted by maraun and widmann 2018 quantile mapping methods are bias correction methods and not formally statistical downscaling methods fourth in this study the temporal variability of the gcms is preserved and not resembled at the station scale data in this matter boé et al 2007 presented an example for quantile mapping applications if the wet spells in the gcms are too short they remain too short after the correction and this also applies to dry spells in addition the mentioned study proved that quantile mapping is not the best in wet dry spells occurrences and lengths an option to overcome this limitation could be the use of quantile perturbation methods fifth as mentioned by maraun and widmann 2018 it should be investigated whether the wet day corrections in quantile mapping methods induce artefacts last the large scale patterns cannot be studied with these methods as the modifications on local precipitation would not take into account the implausible large scale pattern that quantile mapping creates to be able to correct the local precipitation maraun and widmann 2018 funding this research

7990,study region southern africa study focus we assessed quantile mapping strengths and weaknesses in climate downscaling based on global climate models projections an ensemble of methods is used six methods using parametric transformations three methods with non parametric transformations and one method with theoretical distributions transformations seventeen climate indices related to precipitation are applied to the locations of 15 unesco biosphere reserves the methods are validated using a cross validation procedure the results of the projections for two different future scenarios from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 are analysed and their contribution to the overall uncertainty in the climate indices is quantified quantile mapping stationary assumptions are also investigated new hydrological insights on the region the relative error from the cross validation shows that both the non parametric methods and the parametric methods using an exponential type transformation have in general a good skill in correcting the biases the method using theoretical distributions shows a good skill for low extremes the analysis of the methods uncertainty contribution reveals that the largest contributors to the overall uncertainty are the climate models whereas in some cases the methods have the highest uncertainty share the uncertainty contribution from the methods is higher for the high extremes compared to the low extremes the stationary assumptions seem robust the projections indicate a tendency of the region towards dryer conditions and intensified precipitation events however this trend contains strong intra regional variations graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change statistical downscaling quantile mapping

provided at the world meteorological organization wmo website https climexp knmi nl the reader can also refer to https doi org 10 7289 v5d21vhz 1 introduction future climate is gaining much attention due to the contribution of anthropogenic activities to climate change in this the regions in the world that are in the development stage present higher vulnerabilities compared to the developed regions as the former have a low response capacity to disasters many studies demonstrated that there are regions that will suffer higher impacts compared to others for example africa will suffer from higher temperatures compared to the global warning levels gwls thus even if the temperature increase is limited according to the roof from the paris agreement below 2 c africa is still going to have temperatures of more than 2 c dosio 2017 maúre et al 2018 nikulin et al 2018 in this study the southern african region which is one of the regions with target priority for climate change impact studies is considered a literature review on the changes in the rainfall amounts in southern africa reveals that no clear trend is found especially for the wet season dosio et al 2019 laprise et al 2013 however when the studies focus on a specific area more clear trends emerge for instance a decrease increase in most of south africa botswana lesotho eswatini and the south of mozambique and zimbabwe malawi zambia and north of mozambique and zimbabwe is projected for summer precipitation shongwe et al 2009 the occurrence of rainfall tends to agree more between studies and areas in southern africa most of the studies agree that there will be an increase in the consecutive dry days déqué et al 2017 giorgi et al 2014 maúre et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 and in the dry spell length abiodun et al 2017 pinto et al 2016 together with decreases in the wet day frequency abiodun et al 2017 in fact the climate change signals of the dry and wet day frequencies are more clear and dominant compared to the signal of precipitation amount déqué et al 2017 dosio et al 2019 dosio and panitz 2016 however weber et al 2018 concluded that the signal of the number of dry days in the wet season is uncertain for the region as a whole most studies agree that the high extremes in precipitation will increase abiodun et al 2017 déqué et al 2017 giorgi et al 2014 nikulin et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 weber et al 2018 some of the studies noted that this increase is regional dependent pinto et al 2016 weber et al 2018 for instance the western cape region is projected to have no change while other coastal regions e g mozambique madagascar will suffer from an intensification of the precipitation extremes pinto et al 2016 the features from the annual cycle of precipitation are also strongly regional dependent for zambia malawi north mozambique and north zimbabwe some studies déqué et al 2017 shongwe et al 2009 concluded that the rainy season might have a later onset and a later cessation in the future thus suggesting a shift of the season for other areas lesotho eswatini most of south africa and botswana and southern mozambique and zimbabwe the studies project a delayed onset and early cessation mariotti et al 2014 shongwe et al 2009 hence a shortening of the season is suggested additionally mariotti et al 2014 found increasing rainfall in december february indirectly suggesting a narrowing intertropical convergence zone itcz with an increasing intensity passing over africa most of the mentioned studies used information at global and regional scales from the coupled model intercomparison project phases 3 and 5 cmip3 and cmip5 these generations of models are outdated since the outputs from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 have become available in recent years eyring et al 2016 gidden et al 2019 o neill et al 2016 therefore to address the impacts of climate change new studies should be performed in the region since the local response capacity to cope with climate change is important the solutions to face the common problems in southern africa e g flooding severe droughts highly depend also on local conditions in this the unesco biosphere reserves brs are meant for studying the effects of climate change adaptation and mitigation in the region these biospheres will function as pilot projects toward climate change adaptation so the findings can be applied in other regions more effectively it is here that we find the importance of studying the local impacts of climate change on the brs given the coarse resolution of the available global climate models gcms downscaling is required to bridge the gap with the local scale of the brs this downscaling can be based on dynamic or statistical methods dynamical downscaling requires regional climate models to be available with a resolution similar or smaller to the brs an ensemble of such models is however not available for the southern africa region hence we must rely on statistical downscaling for studying the local impacts of climate change the study of these impacts at local scale requires robust statistical downscaling methods sdms to be applied to the gcm outputs among the different types of methods quantile mapping methods have been widely applied for bias correction and statistical downscaling the application of these methods for bias correction e g boé et al 2007 piani et al 2010b 2010a räty et al 2014 schmith et al 2021 teutschbein and seibert 2013 2012 and statistical downscaling e g gutiérrez et al 2018 hertig et al 2018 is broad moreover most of the quantile mapping applications in the statistical downscaling context are assessed through the analysis of their errors gudmundsson et al 2012 but the analysis of their assumptions and their contribution to the overall uncertainties remain weakly targeted thus to obtain confident projections for future climate at the local scale the strengths and weaknesses of the methods must be analysed in this sense this work evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of different quantile mapping methods through the analysis of local projections for southern africa for the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 an ensemble of 24 different gcms and two future scenarios namely ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 are downscaled to local stations obtained from the global historical climatology network ghcn for a focussed analysis different impact related research indicators are calculated the validation of the calibrated relations is based on a cross validation procedure moreover the relative errors derived from the cross validation procedure are also used to analyse the strengths weaknesses and assumptions of the methods furthermore the variance decomposition procedure is applied to the results to better understand the sdms contribution to the overall uncertainties in addition the significance of the climate change signal is analysed through an ensemble of different realisations from the canesm5 gcm the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the data the research indicators the methodologies and all the downscaling methods used in this work in section 3 the results are presented and discussed section 4 presents the concluding remarks 2 data and methods 2 1 global climate models this study considers the daily outputs of 24 different gcms obtained from cmip6 dataset earth system grid federation esgf 2021 which are the state of art climate models table 4 the previous generation of models cmip5 considered different radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century these possible future realisations with different levels of greenhouse gas concentrations are known as representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2008 the main difference with the new generation is that the new models use the shared socio economic pathways ssps together with their radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century the ssps describe a combination of possible futures of global society that take into account changes in demographics human development economy and lifestyle policies and institutions technology environment and natural resources o neill et al 2017 from these models the historical simulations in the period 1961 1990 and two future scenarios in the period 2070 2099 are considered namely ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 o neill et al 2017 ssp1 2 6 positive human development with investments in education and health economic growth strong institutions and cooperation there is a sustainable shift towards a more sustainable relationship with natural resources a peak in radiative forcing at 2 6 w m2 before 2100 and decline ssp5 8 5 same positive human development as ssp1 instead of a sustainable relationship with natural resources ssp5 develops a strong and energy intensive economy based on fossil fuels innovation is highly valued rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8 5 w m2 in 2100 this makes up an ensemble of 48 different simulations in this study 1961 1990 is the control period and 2070 2099 is the future period the projections are calculated based on the ensemble mean which is known to be more accurate than single projections diallo et al 2012 kalognomou et al 2013 kim et al 2014 2 2 extreme indices in this study we used the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi indices to address the analysis of the climate change signal ccs the indices are known worldwide and are commonly applied in the community table 1 presents a summary of the climate indices also referred to as research indicators for a detailed analysis of precipitation extremes high rainfall extremes and low rainfall extremes are linked to the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 and the maximum length of the dry spells r7 respectively 2 3 observations to perform the downscaling at the local scale local stations are needed to correct the biases derived from the large scale climate data gcms in this sense daily precipitation datasets for a total of 15 stations from the databases of the world meteorological organization wmo are considered dataset national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and national centers for environmental information ncei 2021 more specifically these datasets belong to the global historical climatology network ghcn the motivation of this choice is because the ghcn datasets were developed for scientific applications one of them being climate analysis and also due to their quality and quantity most of the stations used in this work contain more than 30 years of data a detailed description of the datasets can be found in menne et al 2012 the names of the brs and the stations used in this study are shown in table 2 the closest station to each br is chosen as representative of the local scale precipitation the stations are used to calibrate the quantile mapping methods in the control period 1961 1990 later these relations are applied to the gcm daily outputs in the future period 2070 2099 to obtain precipitation projections at the station scale 2 4 statistical downscaling methods the methods used in this study belong to the family of quantile mapping methods each method contains its methodology hence a closer look will help to understand the possible outcomes from them quantile mapping methods are considered advanced bias correction methods but they can also be used to downscale precipitation the bias correction is quantile based and the outcomes are the downscaled future series for local analysis the relations are derived by a comparison between the coarse climate and the local observations from a control period and then applied to the future period quantile mapping is not bound to a specific statistical relation and different relations can be constructed table 3 therefore this work sub classifies them into three different types of quantile mapping methods i methods that make use of parametric transformations ii methods with non parametric transformations and iii methods with theoretical distribution transformations the transformations used are explained in the work of gudmundsson et al 2012 and implemented in the qmap package in r programming language the parametric approaches make use of parametric transformations to calculate the quantile quantile relation of observed and gcm data the transformation functions are calibrated with observed and gcm data in the control period 1961 1990 the non parametric approaches aim to approximate the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of observed and gcm data this process is done by using tables of empirical percentiles in the control period 1961 1990 the theoretical distribution approaches assume that the transformation function of the gcm and observed data in the control period 1961 1990 can be achieved by a combination of two different theoretical distributions for precipitation intensity and occurrence for more details of the methods the reader is referred to gudmundsson et al 2012 and piani et al 2010a it is important to stress that quantile mapping methods are subjected to different assumptions for the context of this work two of them are of importance the methods assume time invariance of the bias and that the bias is similar under different forcing conditions many authors have suggested that sdms might violate these assumptions dixon et al 2016 lanzante et al 2018 maraun 2012 maraun and widmann 2018 however some authors showed that advanced methods such as quantile mapping e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 perform better than the simpler ones under non stationary climate conditions thus the debate is still open and it is important to analyse to which extent these assumptions hold 2 4 1 quantile mapping using parametric transformations this set of methods makes direct use of parametric transformations and the correction is only applied to the intensities of wet days a threshold selection is done to equalise the fraction of days with precipitation between observed and modelled values and each method sets to zero all the modelled values below this threshold however biases in precipitation occurrence might still exist after the correction if the modelled data has less wet days compared to the observed the transformations can be simple or complex since there is no clear consensus on which relation can best bias correct the modelled values six relations are implemented in the qmap package in r programing language and all of them are considered in this work the simplest ones power relation linear relation and simple scaling contain less than three free parameters to calibrate while the most complex ones exponential power with initial threshold and exponential with initial threshold contain at least three free parameters note that the power and exponential relations naturally tend to an asymptote making them interesting relations for high extreme rainfall power transformation sd pt 1 1 p ˆ obs b p mod c linear transformation sd pt 2 2 p ˆ obs a b p mod exponential transformation sd pt 3 3 p ˆ obs a b p mod 1 e p mod τ simple scaling transformation sd pt 4 4 p ˆ obs b p mod power transformation with initial value sd pt 5 5 p ˆ obs b p mod x 0 c exponential transformation with initial value sd pt 6 6 p ˆ obs a b p mod 1 e p mod x 0 τ where p ˆ obs and p mod are the corrected gcm value and the non corrected gcm value respectively and a b c x 0 and τ are free parameters that need to be optimised note that eqs 5 and 6 are more complex versions of eqs 1 and 3 respectively in which an initial value for the function is also considered also the shown notation and relations are the same as the implementation in the qmap package so it is easy to follow up for r users 2 4 2 non parametric quantile mapping the non parametric quantile mapping makes direct use of the empirical quantiles to perform the bias correction here three non parametric quantile mapping methods are considered all of them are considered similar in complexity 2 4 2 1 non parametric quantile mapping using empirical quantiles sd np 1 this method utilises the empirical distributions of the observed and gcm values the corrections are done using the empirical percentiles this imposes an extra assumption if the climate projections are larger than the ones from the training period the largest value in the projections is corrected by the highest quantile of the training period note that the highest quantiles from the future projections are assumed to have the same bias as the highest quantiles in the present period thus the use of this method in extremes might bring limitations moreover there is a threshold selection to equalise the fraction of days with precipitation between observed and modelled values in this method modelled values below this threshold are set to zero the implementation of this method in qmap follows the procedure of boé et al 2007 2 4 2 2 non parametric quantile mapping using robust empirical quantiles sd np 2 this method is similar to the previous sd np 1 with the difference that for the estimation of the quantiles a linear regression model is used instead of empirical quantiles similar to sd np 1 using this method for extreme analysis might bring limitations moreover the values below a selected threshold are set to zero by the method 2 4 2 3 quantile mapping using a smoothing spline sd np 3 this method makes use of non parametric transformations more specifically cubic smoothing splines the correction is only applied to the intensities of wet days similar to the previous methods a threshold is considered for the daily rainfall amount when bias correcting the fraction of days with precipitation it should be noted that because the non parametric approaches do not rely on a predetermined function they have more flexibility for the quantile quantile relation hence the high extremes might be better described by these methods however it has also been demonstrated that the complex parametric transformations with many free parameters may be as good as the non parametric approaches gudmundsson et al 2012 regarding the very low precipitation values caution should be exerted the tables of empirical percentiles considered in the non parametric approaches might show notorious differences in the magnitude of the rainfall values for the same ranking position resulting in a potential overestimation of the factors to correct the bias in very low precipitation values therefore modelled values with the non parametric approaches might show some artefacts in very low precipitation values or the estimation of indices related to wet dry day frequencies 2 4 3 quantile mapping using distribution derived transformations this method uses theoretical distributions to perform the corrections sd td 1 the implementation here assumes that the transformation function for the gcm and observed values can be achieved by a combination of the bernoulli and the gamma distributions the bernoulli component applies to the rainfall occurrence process with wet day 1 and dry day 0 occurrences empirical cumulative distribution functions are calculated for both the observed and modelled values in which the probability of the first non zero observation is taken then the modelled value equivalent to that probability is chosen as a threshold and all the values below are set to 0 however it assumes a wet bias in the precipitation occurrence of the modelled values and that this bias is similar in the future hence the change in the wet dry day frequencies might not be accurate the gamma distribution applies to the rainfall values on the wet days cannon 2008 cawley et al 2006 gudmundsson et al 2012 haylock et al 2006 ines and hansen 2006 piani et al 2010a thom 1968 williams 1998 in the procedure one first fits the observed values only wet days to a gamma distribution 7 f x α β γ α β x γ α x wdt where wdt is the precipitation threshold x is a precipitation value α the shape parameter β the scale parameter γ α the gamma function γ α β x the lower incomplete gamma function f the cumulative distribution function the shape and scale parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method then the gcm values are fitted to the same distribution that later is mapped onto the distribution that was fitted to the observed values 8 x gcm corr f obs 1 f gcm x x wdt 0 x wdt where f 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function the subscripts obs and gcm denote the observations and the gcm values respectively and corr denotes corrected values gudmundsson et al 2012 ines and hansen 2006 2 5 validation of the downscaling methods the methods are validated by employing a cross validation procedure räty et al 2014 schmith et al 2021 tabari et al 2021 in this the 24 gcms are considered pseudo observations in which each time one gcm is used to develop the relations to correct the biases of the other 23 in the control period 1961 1990 the outputs of the gcm considered as pseudo observations gcm pseudo observations are used to calibrate bias correct the relations for the remaining gcms considered as climate projections gcm projections in the scenario period 2070 2099 the research indicators are calculated with the gcm pseudo observations and used to validate the ones obtained with the bias corrected gcm projections fig 1 for that the relative mean error en for each indicator is calculated as the absolute difference between the projected indicator from the corrected future gcm projections and the indicator from the future gcm pseudo observations divided by the future gcm pseudo observations the cross validation procedure is applied independently to the two future scenarios note that the methods are analysed in 15 different locations and two different climatic regimes the brs near the southwest coast and the brs in the east with 24 gcms n 24 15 different locations nl 15 and ten sdms nsdm 10 82 800 nsdm nl n n 1 10 15 24 24 1 combinations are possible a robust analysis of the methods performances and assumptions is done by analysing the relative errors with all the combinations these relative errors will represent the skill of the models 2 6 analysis of uncertainties to study the contribution of the methods to the overall uncertainty variance decomposition is applied in this procedure the different contributors are assessed and also the contribution of their interactions this is done by quantifying the variance associated to the total uncertainty and by splitting this variance into the fractions associated to the gcms ssp scenarios and sdms 9 var t var g var s var d var gs var gd var sd var gsd where var t is the total variance var g is the variance associated to the gcm ensemble var s to the different future ssp scenarios var d to the different downscaling methods and var gs var gd var sd and var gsd to the interactions between the three contributors note that if the full variability of all the contributors is summed the actual result will be larger than the total variance because each of the contributors contains interactions in this study we are interested in the total contribution from the different downscaling methods 10 var total d v ar d var gd var sd var gsd the variance that corresponds to each of the terms is obtained by the analysis of variance anova the procedure is valid for all the research indicators first we obtain the variance due to only each term s variability 11 var g 1 24 i 1 24 x i x 2 12 var s 1 2 j 1 2 x j x 2 13 var d 1 10 k 1 10 x k x 2 then we obtain the variance due to the interaction between two contributors 14 var gs 1 24 i 1 24 1 2 j 1 2 x ij x

var gsd 1 24 i 1 24 1 2 j 1 2 1 10 k 1 10 x ijk x ij x i k x jk x i x j x k x 2 where the dots represent the averages with respect to the indices they are substituting i represents the gcms 24 models j represents the ssp scenarios two scenarios and k represents the downscaling methods ten methods for more information about the procedure the reader is referred to déqué et al 2012 2007 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 2 7 significance of the signal a procedure similar to tabari et al 2019 is adopted to define when the signal is significant for that 25 different runs from canesm5 r1i1f1p1 r2 i1f1p1 r3 i1f1p1 r25 i1f1p1 see table 4 are considered to account for the analysis of natural variability signal to noise ratio s2nr the cmip6 model simulations include several historical experiments these simulations can be regarded as the historical ensemble they are specified by the following four types of conditions realisation index initialisation index physics index and forcing index the 25 simulations taken into account in this work contain the same initialisation index physics index and forcing index these simulations vary only the realisation index and because the other components remain the same they represent the internal variability of one model canesm5 the difference between these gcm runs is that they are initialised using different starting conditions i e points in the preindustrial control run considering the previous information we then can calculate the research indicators with all the runs in the control period and then check for the differences between the runs these differences can thus be attributed to the internal variability in the climate system of one model which is regarded as noise the latter is considered here as natural variability consequently a significant test z score is performed tabari et al 2019 in this procedure the climate change signal ccs ensemble calculated for each research indicator rn as r n proj divided by r n obs is said to be significant if it is sufficiently large compared to the natural variability s2nr for that the null hypothesis h0 of the z test considers no significant change or that the s2nr is greater than the change i e the mean of ccs is equal to one accepting the null hypothesis will mean that the change is not significant while rejecting it accepting the alternative hypothesis h1 will mean that the change is significant the critical value z from a standard normal distribution corresponding to a significance level of 5 95 of confidence is used to test the hypothesis hence if a z ccs ensemble 1 stdev 25 runscanesm 5 is greater than 1 96 critical z value the null hypothesis is rejected 3 results and discussions the different strengths and weaknesses of the statistical downscaling methods applied in this work can be uncovered by the analysis of their relative errors skill and their contribution to the overall uncertainties in the downscaling context for robust conclusions the results should also be linked to the assumptions of the methods as mentioned in section 2 2 the results for the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 and the maximum length of the dry spells r7 are linked with high and low rainfall extremes 3 1 analysis of the errors the performance of the methods is analysed and validated prior to their application for climate projections the largest deviations are expected to appear in the ssp5 8 5 scenario as it contains the strongest forcing conditions therefore the relative error is presented with the results from the ssp5 8 5 scenario as future pseudo observations figs 2 4 for validation in order to derive more information from this analysis a summary of the relative error computed from both scenarios as future pseudo observations ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 is presented in table 5 while the first analysis aids in the validation the second does it in the analysis of the stationary assumptions of the quantile mapping methods i the time invariance of the bias and ii the independence of the bias of the forcing conditions 3 1 1 spatial distribution of the errors the validation is done through inter model cross validation applied to the 15 different sites in each location the 17 research indicators are calculated with the bias corrected data later the errors are computed and presented in spatially distributed maps figs 2 and 3 in each map the performance of the methods can be analysed note that the locations from the southwest area have different climatic characteristics than the ones from the east the most important difference is the opposite rainy season pattern more specifically in the southwest locations the rainy season is situated around march to september while in the east locations it is from october to march for the sake of the analysis only the results for the maximum length of the dry spells r7 and the maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period r9 are presented the mentioned indicators are considered for the analysis of low and high extreme precipitation the rainfall extremes low or high are important in southern africa because they are the main drivers of droughts or floods in the region the results show that the errors of the sdms for the maximum length of the dry spells r7 are generally higher in the coastal areas to analyse whether there is a spatial trend in the errors fig 2 is presented a clustering to either the left or the right will show where the biggest errors tend to be located a trend into a specific direction means regional worse performance however no clear clustering was found in any of the cases by analysing the error graph of fig 2 bottom centre we can conclude that there is no method outperforming the others nevertheless if we analyse the performance of the methods in specific locations fig 4 the median of their errors might not deviate too much from each other but the variability in the methods can be high compared to each other the errors in r9 maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period which represent the high extremes in the region show some interesting features fig 3 first to uncover these features we need to understand the complexity of southern africa s climate in a broad view the plateaus and the narrow coastal belt of southern africa lead to strong topographic gradients this topography is able to influence the track and the development of many weather systems and the austral winter precipitation that develops due to temperate frontal systems from the westerlies daron et al 2019 and the references therein moreover the austral summer rainfall in the east is highly influenced by the warm agulhas and cold benguela currents and the moist winds coming from the indian ocean which are partially trapped by the island of madagascar daron et al 2019 and the references therein second note that in most of the methods the biggest errors do not show a specific location they are random but in the most simple methods of the parametric transformations sd pt 2 and sd pt 4 the biggest errors tend to cluster in the east region where the wet season is on the austral summer this means that these methods represent better the extreme rainfall in the wet season of the southwest coast austral winter compared to the extreme rainfall in the eastern region the reason might be that the locations in the southwest are mainly coastal in which the plateaus are not yet an important factor for the development of the precipitation extremes nor the austral summer rainfall moreover due to the coastal location the extremes might be more influenced by large scale weather in which gcms are known to be robust therefore for the most simple methods of the parametric transformations which use linear functions and simple scaling it is less difficult to establish proper relations in the southwest compared to the east even though there are no outperforming methods sd td 1 and sd np 3 have a bigger error area see fig 3 compared to the other methods in the rainfall extremes for a 30 year return period r9 thus the use in high extremes of these two methods might bring drawbacks however the latter is not true when it comes to the analysis for low extremes r7 as the methods have more or less similar areas compared to the others see fig 2 to summarise the results indicate that the non parametric methods perform better than the rest in low extremes r7 also the method that uses mixed theoretical distributions gamma for intensities and bernoulli for occurrences performs similar to the non parametric methods the methods that make use of parametric transformations perform better in high extremes r9 but worse in r7 this is especially true for sd pt 3 and sd pt 6 that compared to the rest show a smaller median error in r9 and a shorter range of variability additionally note that sd pt 6 is a variation from sd pt 3 it uses the same concept but with an initial value sd pt 3 uses a more complex parametric transformation compared to the other parametric methods and sd pt 6 is the method with the highest number of free parameters 3 1 2 the skill of the sdms sd pt 3 and sd pt 6 showed the best skill lowest average error in the maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period in both scenarios this is similar to the findings of gudmundsson et al 2012 who showed that the best performing methods for the norwegian region were the ones that used non parametric transformations and noted that the parametric transformations methods with many free parameters e g sd pt 6 performed similarly however in this work the non parametric transformations did not yield the best performance though it was close to the skill of the sd pt 6 and sd pt 3 methods maraun and widmann 2018 noted that the extrapolations from the quantile mapping methods using theoretical distributions might be substantially biased for severe events even though that sd td 1 uses a gamma distribution the presence of this bias was confirmed previously by gudmundsson et al 2012 and was also verified in this study hence sd td 1 must be used with precaution for the projections in high extremes in low rainfall extremes sd td 1 has a good skill together with sd np 1 sd np 2 and sd np 3 3 1 3 the assumptions of the sdms the statistical downscaling methods used in this work contain two specific assumptions namely the time invariance of the bias and that the bias is independent of the forcing conditions first as pointed out by maraun and widmann 2018 biases might not be time invariant this assumption is partially tested with the cross validation procedure because the calibration period is far enough from the future period during which the validation procedure cross validation is applied second the procedure was applied independently for two future scenarios with different forcing conditions ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 hence the validation also assessed whether the bias remains the same under different forcing conditions these assumptions are tested by comparing the average of the sdms relative errors derived from both future scenarios table 5 the comparison presented is restricted to two research indicators representative of the low and high rainfall extremes the results indicate that the methods tend to enlarge their relative errors when the forcing is higher ssp5 8 5 error higher than ssp1 2 6 error however regardless of the larger geographical differences in relative error e g 40 56 and 10 95 for lubombo and cape west coast respectively in r7 ssp1 2 6 the average performance of the methods under different forcing conditions is similar hence the results point out that the errors do not vary substantially from one scenario to the other even for the maximum daily precipitation for a 30 year return period which contains the highest error and contribution to the uncertainties the differences in errors of the different future scenarios are low 3 2 sources of uncertainty this sub section presents the quantification of all the sources of uncertainty see eq 9 in 15 different sites together with a spatially distributed summary of the sdms contribution figs 5 and 6 fig 5 shows clear evidence that in general the major source of uncertainty is the gcm ensemble moreover interesting features emerge in the uncertainty share of the sdms especially for the high and low extremes fig 6 in addition the overall analysis of the uncertainties indicates that the contribution from the future scenarios tends to be small 3 2 1 uncertainty contribution of the gcms regardless of the climatic characteristics the gcm ensemble seems to be the higher contributor to the overall uncertainties with the average of the gcms contribution to the overall uncertainties through the region we found in all the research indicators that the average contribution is higher compared to the other sources for instance the highest contribution from the sdms see eq 10 is in the r9 indicator with around 45 spatial average while for the same indicator the contribution by the gcms is around 83 the highest contribution of the gcms is for the low extremes more specifically the maximum length of the dry spells r7 has a contribution of 92 however in some cases in the high low extremes the contribution to the uncertainties from the sdms is equal to or higher compared to the gcms for instance for r9 in kogelberg br1 the contribution from the sdms reaches 76 while in the gcms is around 61 3 2 2 uncertainty contribution of the sdms as suggested by räty et al 2014 we analysed the sdms uncertainty contribution with daily precipitation and many downscaling methods in all locations the contribution in high and low extremes r9 r13 and r7 respectively tends to be higher compared to the average climate indicators e g r5 or r1 fig 5 for instance in kogelberg br1 the total contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainty is r5 precipitation during the rainy season 18 r7 max length of the dry spells 49 r9 daily precipitation for a 30 year return period 76 r13 occurrence of extreme precipitation 68 and r17 average daily precipitation intensity on the wet season 83 far from the south coast in mount mulanje br2 the contribution from the sdms is r1 precipitation during the rainy season 13 r7 max length of the dry spells 33 r9 daily precipitation for a 30 year return period 53 r13 occurrence of extreme precipitation 37 and r16 average daily precipitation intensity on the wet season 32 by averaging the contributions in all the locations we found that the highest percentage of contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainty is on the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 by around 45 of contribution also the average daily rainfall in the wet and dry periods denoted by the indicators r16 and r17 is the second highest around 44 in both moreover the average contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainties in the maximum length of the dry spells r7 is lower compared to the previous indicators around 20 section 3 2 1 showed that the biggest contributor to the uncertainties was the gcm ensemble however when looking at the results for high extremes one can find cases in which the biggest contributors to the uncertainties were the sdms e g r9 r13 in kogelberg or that the contribution of the sdms was comparable to the gcms e g r9 r13 in mount mulanje this finding means that in high extremes the contribution is large e g r9 or r13 and in average indicators such as the amounts of rainfall per season e g r2 or r5 the contribution is small typically with regard to the results from the high extremes indicators e g r10 r12 r13 r14 or r15 the contribution to the overall uncertainties is higher compared to the non extreme indicators thus similar to piani et al 2010a we found that the largest sdms uncertainty share is located where large corrections in the intensity of precipitation events are applied the uncertainty in high rainfall extremes not only has a high percentage of contribution from the sdms the highest within the sdms contribution in the indicators but it is also random no spatial clustering or pattern and more or less equally big in all the locations see fig 6 therefore we must take precaution with the quantile mapping projections for high extreme rainfall in all the locations in low extremes r7 the highest contribution from the sdms to the overall uncertainty is clustered near the south and north coastal regions see fig 6 this pattern might be partially explained by the differences in the gcm simulations first note the gcm as the highest uncertainty contributor then since the coastal areas are more influenced by large scale weather compared to other areas in the study domain the uncertainty contributions from the sdms might be largely influenced by the gcm simulations increasing their contribution due to the sdm gcm interaction term for example fig 5 shows that the indicator r7 contains a larger uncertainty contribution associated with the gcm sdm interaction in br1 and br13 kogelberg and quirimbas compared to br9 and br4 middle zambezi and waterberg 3 3 overall projections the future scenario projections are presented as change factors tables 6 and 7 the change factors were obtained by dividing the future projections with the present observed climate indicators a change factor greater lower than one means an increase decrease significant changes are denoted in bold italic as expected there are more significant changes in the ssp5 8 5 scenario compared to the ssp1 2 6 scenario for ssp1 2 6 a significant increase was found only for three locations in the daily rainfall for a 30 year return period r9 with 32 25 and 29 in middle zambezi br9 magaliesberg br11 and quirimbas br13 respectively regarding low extremes r7 significant increases were found in mount mulanje br2 and garden route br12 with 40 and 43 respectively while in middle zambezi br9 there is a significant decrease of 31 moreover the annual rainfall is significantly decreasing in kogelberg br1 cape west coast br3 cape winelands br7 goritz cluster br10 and garden route br12 by 7 8 8 7 and 6 respectively and significantly increasing in quirimbas r13 with 9 note that the daily rainfall for a 10 year return period r10 is significantly decreasing in all locations and together with the increase in r9 and r13 and the decrease in r11 this indicates an intensification of the extreme events in ssp5 8 5 scenario there are 7 locations with significant increases for r9 kruger to canyons br5 lake chillwa wetland br6 vhembe br8 middle zambezi br9 magaliesberg br11 quirimbas r13 and lubombo br15 of 47 35 61 63 61 47 and 31 respectively in low extremes r7 there are significant increases in mount mulanje br2 goritz cluster br10 and garden route br12 of 37 32 and 50 respectively and significant decreases in lake chillwa wetland br6 and middle zambezi br9 by about 29 and 50 respectively moreover the region is moving towards dryer conditions because the projections in most of the locations show a decrease in annual rainfall r8 an overall significant decrease in r3 and an overall increase in r6 note that the daily rainfall for a 10 year return period r10 and the wet days of the rainy dry season r3 1 1 note that the research indicator r3 is defined as the wet day frequency from october to april thus it might mean wet dry season depending on the location are significantly decreasing in all locations r9 and r13 are increasing and r11 is decreasing indicating an intensification of the extreme events the overall decrease in r3 wet day frequency in the region was also found in abiodun et al 2017 similarly the increase in r9 high rainfall extremes was found in many studies e g abiodun et al 2017 déqué et al 2017 giorgi et al 2014 nikulin et al 2018 hence in this future scenario the region might be negatively affected by climate change in the sense that the countries will have to cope with dryer conditions e g drought and more intense high extreme events e g flooding we want to stress that the projections from both future scenarios ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 contain similar features compared to other studies although the future scenarios analysed in these studies rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 or 1 5 2 and 3 of gwl from cmip5 are different in the sense that they present different future realisations the analysis was done for the end of the 21st century allowing for comparison in the trend of the projections for that future period similar to weber et al 2018 who found uncertain the projections of the number of wet days for the region as a whole most of the results from ssp1 2 6 table 6 show no significant change and depending on the location either a decrease or an increase pinto et al 2016 and weber et al 2018 projected an intensification of the rainfall events but they showed that the change was dependent on the geographical location similarly some locations in this study e g cape west coast show no significant changes in r9 extreme rainfall for the ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios while on other locations e g lake chillwa wetland or quirimbas there are significant increases intensification of extremes note that lake chillwa wetland and quirimbas are located in mozambique an area in which pinto et al 2016 found an increase in the 20 year return period rainfall 4 conclusions to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the sdms we performed an analysis with impact related research indicators and not directly with the properties linked to the statistical distributions of the meteorological variables e g mean variance values from extreme quantiles because the methods are designed to correct the probability density function pdf of the gcms in order to match the pdf of the observations boé et al 2007 thus the properties linked to the statistical distribution will tend to be well reproduced and this will give biased confidence to all of the methods the validation with the cross validation procedure aids in the estimation of the methods errors for a period completely independent from the calibration period for deeper insights the stationary assumptions of the sdms were also investigated moreover the variance decomposition allowed a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the contribution of the sdms to the overall uncertainties in the future indicator values the projections were analysed based on the significance and the direction of change we conclude for high extremes that the parametric and the non parametric approaches might be more adequate than the approaches with theoretical distributions however it should be stressed that even the best skilled methods of quantile mapping used in this study have drawbacks in the projections for very rare events the methods with non parametric transformations sd np 1 sd np 2 and sd np 3 and with theoretical distributions sd td 1 performed better than the rest for the maximum length of the dry spells however the equalisation of the gcm and the observed precipitation occurrences with a threshold has limitations the wet dry day correction does not necessarily correct the length of the wet dry spells and they can remain too long or short after the correction also the case when the observed precipitation has more wet days than the models cannot be handled in general the results highlighted the importance of using an ensemble of methods rather than looking for the best performing method the relative errors found in this work suggest that in most of the cases the relations calibrated are able to adequately correct the biases independently of the period or the forcing conditions this indicates that the stationary assumptions of the studied methods might be robust however the relative errors vary substantially between locations hence precaution must be exerted with the projections of high and low extreme rainfall as the results showed that in some locations the time invariance of the relations might have been violated as mentioned in maraun and widmann 2018 it is important to stress that the errors in local extreme events cannot be corrected with quantile mapping as they are inherited from gcms quantile mapping will resolve as best as gcm skill in extremes and it will not enhance the extremes representation hence local extremes will not be represented appropriately unless they can be represented adequately on the large scale in a weather more dominated by large scale circulation the representation of extremes from quantile mapping might be adequate but when the local features become more important e g convection or orography the ensemble of methods used in this study might show drawbacks in the representation of these features the gcms were found to be the largest contributors to the uncertainties this finding seems to hold for other regions as well fatichi et al 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 van uytven and willems 2018 however the sdms might become the largest contributors in high extremes the latter can be attributed to the fact that the sdms largest uncertainty contribution is located where large corrections in the intensity of precipitation happen the uncertainty analysis also revealed that the contribution from the future scenarios tends to be small hence the gcms and the climate variability seem to mask the greenhouse gas sensitivity in the different ssp scenarios in this region in fact similar results for the local scale were found in other regions fatichi et al 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 van uytven and willems 2018 this finding is interesting as one would expect that due to their different forcing conditions the future scenarios will have a strong influence on the behaviour of the different rainfall events therefore a detailed study on the sensitivity of the ssp scenarios to the different greenhouse gas concentrations is advised for this region the future scenario ssp1 2 6 showed less clear changes compared to the ssp5 8 5 scenario on the one hand we can conclude that the change in ssp1 2 6 is rather uncertain than a clear trend on the other hand in the ssp5 8 5 scenario a tendency towards dryer conditions and intensified extreme events in most of the locations was seen the wet days showed a significant decrease in all the locations and there was also a general tendency of an increase in the maximum daily rainfall for a 30 year return period however the signal of this trend is weak as the change was not completely clear for other indicators like the maximum length of the dry spells the increase or decrease in the climate change signal is highly dependent on the location and does not have a clear regional trend several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged first the quantile mapping methods do not correct more than what the control period 1961 1990 shows second is the direct use of gcms as they cannot account for many processes at the local scale e g orographic precipitation third as noted by maraun and widmann 2018 quantile mapping methods are bias correction methods and not formally statistical downscaling methods fourth in this study the temporal variability of the gcms is preserved and not resembled at the station scale data in this matter boé et al 2007 presented an example for quantile mapping applications if the wet spells in the gcms are too short they remain too short after the correction and this also applies to dry spells in addition the mentioned study proved that quantile mapping is not the best in wet dry spells occurrences and lengths an option to overcome this limitation could be the use of quantile perturbation methods fifth as mentioned by maraun and widmann 2018 it should be investigated whether the wet day corrections in quantile mapping methods induce artefacts last the large scale patterns cannot be studied with these methods as the modifications on local precipitation would not take into account the implausible large scale pattern that quantile mapping creates to be able to correct the local precipitation maraun and widmann 2018 funding this research

the newly released global precipitation measurement gpm data provide a high precision precipitation input data source for snowmelt runoff simulations in such areas however the resolution 10 km 10 km

to downscale the gpm dataset and drive the snowmelt runoff model srm in this study new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the average r 2 values of daily runoff simulated by observed precipitation data and the downscaled gpm dataset 1 km 1 km are 0 869 and 0 847 respectively and the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values are 0 795 and 0 715 respectively the accuracy of the runoff data simulated by the downscaled gpm dataset is 2 5 lower than that simulated based on the observed data and good results are obtained this study shows that the downscaled gpm dataset can be regarded as an effective alternative product in areas lacking observed data the gpm dataset has good application prospects as substitute data in mountainous areas and the gpm dataset resolves

introduction snow is one of the main forms of solid atmospheric precipitation and is composed of air ice liquid water and water vapor snow is an extremely important freshwater resource and can directly affect runoff and the surface water cycle it is an important component of surface hydrological process simulations and is also the most sensitive indicator of global climate change tan et al

and hbv model energy balance model require many parameters such as the vic model and she model the difference between energy balance models and degree day models is that the former pay more attention to the physical details of the snow melting process so they need enough accurate measured data and a wide range of parameters snowmelt runoff mainly occurs in upstream areas these areas are generally located in mountainous areas with more snow high elevations and complex terrain there are few observation stations in alpine mountainous areas resulting in a lack of observed data required by the model however most hydrological models do not yield satisfactory results for daily flow simulations and predictions in high elevation basins martinec et al 2008 therefore a conceptual model with low data requirements has obvious advantages among many snowmelt models the snowmelt runoff model srm is the most representative and widely used snowmelt model khadka et al 2014 tahir et al 2011 2019 the srm established by swiss scientists in 1975 in a small watershed of 2 65 km2 in france was the first semiphysical model of snowmelt runoff in the world initially it was applied only to some small watersheds in europe the srm has been improved and optimized many times through the application of srm in mountain runoff the problem of the improper extraction of the degree day factor was corrected liston 1995 and the uncertain parameters of the model were calibrated franz et al 2008 adding the temperature interpolation method and radiation factor to the srm greatly improved the accuracy of the model frey and holzmann 2015 at present the srm has been tested and applied to hundreds of watersheds in more than 20 countries worldwide lee et al 2005 to make the srm more suitable for california peel and bloeschl 2011 revised the main parameters of the model according to the input conditions of its parameter variables georgievsky 2009 and tahir et al 2011 used the srm to predict runoff in the hunza river basin and kuban river basin showing that the srm can effectively simulate the daily discharge in alpine areas immerzeel et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 applied the srm to the himalayan and qinghai lake basins and found that the model performed well in these areas xinjiang is located inland and far from the sea detecting snow variation and snowmelt runoff is very important to water resource management in the area taking the jingou river basin jrb in xinjiang as an example this study selects the snowmelt period from 2006 to 2019 and uses the srm to simulate snowmelt runoff in this basin the purpose of this study is as follows a to evaluate the applicability of the srm in simulating snowmelt runoff in the jrb and b to study the reliability of global precipitation measurement gpm data in simulating snowmelt runoff in high elevation river catchments to compensate for the scarcity of observed data 2 study area xinjiang is located in the hinterland of eurasia far from the sea and has a typical continental arid climate the tianshan mountains tsm are part of a large high elevation mountain range that stretches across central xinjiang china and these mountains are the main areas of runoff formation in xinjiang xinjiang contains three mountain ranges and two basins which combined with its climate result in dry conditions little rain and a lack of surface water resources guo et al 2016 the jingou river basin 85 03 e 85 44 e 43 30 n 44 50 n has scarce precipitation and is located in central and western xinjiang china the basin is located in the middle part of the northern foot of the tsm and the southern edge of the junggar basin the river originates from the north side of yilianhabirga mountain flows onto the alluvial plain from south to north and finally flows into the manas river which is its first tributary chen et al 2017 the terrain of the jingou river is high in the south and low in the north and the highest elevation is 5152 m the jrb is a typical glacial and snowmelt river with an average annual runoff of 3 197 108 m3 at the bajiahu hydrological station the average annual temperature is 5 2 c and the average annual precipitation is 284 5 mm snowmelt water is an important water resource in the basin the profile of the section above the bajiahu hydrological station in the jrb is shown in fig 1 3 data and methodology 3 1 data

and predict snowmelt runoff in mountainous watersheds martinec et al 2008 the degree day factor method is used to calculate snowmelt runoff and the daily temperature t precipitation p and snow cover fraction scf of the basin are taken as the basic input variables the main principle is to calculate the amount of water formed by daily snowmelt and precipitation and then add it to the calculated recession flow to obtain the daily runoff the formula is as follows 1 q n 1 c sn α n t n δ t n s n c rn p n a 10000 86400 1 k n 1 q n k n 1 where q is the average daily runoff m3 s c s is the snowmelt runoff coefficient c r is the rainfall runoff coefficient α is the degree day factor cm 1 d 1 t is the number of degree days d t is the degree day adjustment by the temperature lapse rate s is the ratio of the snow covered area to the basin area p is the runoff depth formed by precipitation cm a is the area of the basin or zone km2 and k is the recession coefficient and n is the daily series 3 2 1 srm input variables 3 2 1 1 temperature and degree days in the srm the temperature is expressed in degree days degree days are generally calculated through an observation value of air temperature and the formula is described as follows 2 t t min t max 2 where t is the average daily temperature and t max and t min are the daily maximum and minimum air temperature values respectively the temperature value is calculated based on the mean elevation of each elevation zone according to the temperature lapse rate 3 δ t γ h s t h p 1 100 where γ is the temperature lapse rate of the basin a global average temperature lapse rate of 0 65 100 m is adopted in this study h st is the elevation of the meteorological station h p is the mean elevation of each zone and the temperature of the observation station is interpolated to each zone according to the temperature lapse rate 3 2 1 2 precipitation there are also precipitation differences at different elevations the precipitation in the basin increases with elevation and the vertical change is obvious in this study some experiments are carried out on the north slope of the tsm and precipitation at different elevations is observed according to the observed precipitation the precipitation in the basin is calculated to increase by 1 07 mm 100 m 4 p p p s t β h p h s t 1 100 where β is the increasing precipitation rate in the jrb p st is the precipitation at the meteorological station and p p is the precipitation in the elevation zone in addition the input variables from the observed precipitation are replaced by the downscaled gpm dataset to evaluate the applicability of the gpm in high elevation mountainous areas 3 2 1 3 snow cover fraction scf the daily snow cover fraction scf of the basin is derived from the declining scf curve based on the mod10a2 and myd10a2 datasets the maximum synthesis method is used to fuse the two groups of images in the same period which can reduce the interference of clouds ma et al 2019 paudel and andersen 2011 the declining scf curve is drawn according to the time series and then the linear interpolation method is used to interpolate the daily snow cover 3 2 2 srm parameters 3 2 2 1 time lag time lags are determined by the model user s manual and selected by the basin area as shown in table 2 the total area of the jrb is 1175 67 km2 so the time lag is 12 4 h 3 2 2 2 recession coefficient the recession coefficient refers to the decrease in runoff during the period without snowmelt or rainfall and is an important parameter in the srm the formula is as follows 5 k n 1 q n 1 q n where q n is the runoff of the nth day and k is a recession coefficient and a variable that can be calculated from the observed runoff as follows 6 k n 1 x q n y where x and y are constants combining eqs 5 and 6 we can conclude that 7 q n 1 x q n 1 y logarithms are taken on both sides of eq 7 to obtain 8 lg q n 1 1 y lg q n lg x the observed daily runoff during the snowmelt period from 2006 to 2019 is presented as a double logarithmic scatter diagram as shown in fig 3 taking 2006 as an example the recession coefficient is calculated without snowmelt or rainfall so the data of q n 1 q n are excluded the x and y values of each year are calculated and the average value is taken to obtain x 0 9862 y 0 0327 and the recession coefficient k n 1 0 9862 q n 0 0327 3 2 2 3 runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient represents the amount of precipitation flowing out through the outlet section of the basin after flowing into the river and includes the snowmelt runoff coefficient c s and rainfall runoff coefficient c r due to data limitations the runoff coefficient in this study is obtained based on experience and the specific parameters are adjusted according to the simulation results 3 3 model uncertainty reduction generally model uncertainty includes three parts 1 the uncertainty of the model structure 2 the uncertainty of the input data and 3 the uncertainty of the model parameters to improve the simulation accuracy of the srm in the study area this study mainly reduces the uncertainty of the model by improving the input data and parameters of the model 3 3 1 improvement of the input data there are few meteorological stations in alpine mountainous areas especially those higher than 2500 m it is difficult to obtain grid temperature and precipitation data and simulate snowmelt runoff to obtain high precision grid input data for a watershed scale snowmelt runoff model a geographic weighted regression gwr model is used to reduce the spatial scale of the gpm dataset from 10 km 10 km 1 km 1 km considering the spatial heterogeneity between variables the gwr model establishes a regression model by estimating the parameters of each location brunsdon et al 1998 this study selects the ndvi and dem as independent variables to construct the gwr model which mainly includes the following three steps 1 data preparation the bilinear interpolation method is used to resample the dem data with resolutions of 90 m to 1 km and 10 km and the ndvi data with resolutions of 1 km 10 km 2 construction of the gwr model the gwr model is constructed by using the dem ndvi and gpm datasets with a resolution of 10 km to obtain coefficients constant terms and residuals as shown in eq 9 zhan et al 2018 then the coefficients and constant terms are resampled to 1 km and the residuals are resampled to 1 km using inverse distance weighting idw 9 p i β n d v i u i v i n d v i i β d e m u i v i d e m i β 0 u i v i ε i where pi is the precipitation at point i u i v i represents the longitude and latitude coordinates of the ith position point β 0 u i v i is the corresponding coefficient term and ε i is the residual 3 extrapolation of the gpm dataset based on the coefficients auxiliary variables constant terms and residuals at a resolution of 1 km obtained above the downscaled gpm dataset at 1 km is obtained according to eq 9 3 3 2 improvement of the model parameter the degree day model assumes that there is a significant linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature and the main purpose is to calculate the amount of snow melting the general form of the degree day model is as follows van den broeke et al 2010 10 m α t t t t t t 0 t t t where m is snowmelt mm d 1 α is the degree day factor cm c 1 d 1 t is the air temperature c and t t is the critical temperature for snow melting c the srm is also called the degree day model the degree day factor α is the most sensitive parameter in the snowmelt model and directly affects the snowmelt rate a large number of scholars have suggested that α 1 1ρ s ρ w where ρ s is the snow density and ρ w is the water density for a basin water density is a fixed value but snow density is a time dependent variable that is difficult to obtain based on long term observations at meteorological stations it is found that the degree day factor is significantly linearly correlated with the air temperature therefore the linear model between the degree day factor and air temperature is modified to improve the simulation accuracy in this study a snowmelt model is constructed with air temperature as the independent variable and snowmelt as the dependent variable through the linear fitting between the long time series air temperature and snowmelt by the least square method the following model is obtained 11 m 0 232 t t t 3 4659 t t t 0 t t t after the improvement of the above degree day factor appropriate adjustments are made in combination with the simulation results 3 4 evaluation methods to evaluate the accuracy of the downscaled gpm dataset we calculated the correlation coefficient r bias and root mean square error rmse between the observed data and the downscaled gpm dataset 12 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 13 b i a s 1 n i 1 n x i y i 14 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x i is the downscaled gpm dataset y i is the observed data and n is the number of samples to quantitatively evaluate the simulation results the model uses four indicators including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r 2 bias

bias and d v are used to analyze the consistency between the simulated and observed values r 2 reflects the goodness of fit when bias 0 and nse r 2 1 the fitting effect is the best 4 results the srm is used to simulate the daily snowmelt runoff of the jrb this study uses scf as the input data the snow melting season from 2006 to 2015 as the calibration period and the snow melting season from 2016 to 2019 as the validation period to verify the applicability of the srm in the study area and the reliability of gpm downscaling precipitation data in simulating snowmelt runoff in high elevation basins 4 1 downscaled gpm dataset evaluation to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of the downscaled gpm dataset in the jrb we select the observed precipitation data of the bajiahu hydrological station in the basin and four meteorological stations around the basin shawan fort wusu and wulan wusu meteorological stations to compare with the downscaled gpm dataset and draw scatter plots fig 4 for the five meteorological stations the average correlation coefficient r value is greater than 0 66 the bias is close to 0 and the rmse is also relatively low overall the gpm dataset after downscaling meets the accuracy requirements then we further verify the applicability of the downscaled gpm dataset in the study area by comparing the simulation results obtained using downscaled gpm dataset and observed data 4 2 application of the srm in the jrb using the observed precipitation data the simulation results of the srm in the jrb are shown in figs 5 and 6 the model can effectively simulate runoff during the annual snowmelt period april to september in the jrb overall the observed and simulated runoff values in the calibration period and validation period fit well and the trend is consistent however for the peak runoff value the simulated and observed peak values deviate during the calibration period the peak was lower than the observed peaks in 2006 2012 and 2014 and higher than the observed peak in 2008 during the validation period the peak was lower than the observed peak in 2016 and higher than the observed peak in 2019 this may be due to the following reasons 1 the daily snow cover fraction adopted in the model is the linear interpolation of the 8 day average snow cover fraction which cannot truly reflect the change in the daily snow cover rate 2 there are scarce meteorological stations in the basin although no precipitation might be observed at the bajiahu station there may be precipitation in other parts of the basin resulting in an increase in actual runoff 3 there may be instantaneous snowfall in the basin the rapid rise in temperature in the flood season leads to the rapid melting of this part of snow in addition rainfall is frequent and the source of runoff supply is complex in the flood season but the precipitation form in the non flood season is relatively singular therefore the simulation effect in the non flood season is better than that in the flood season the evaluation results of the srm in the jrb are shown in fig 7 and table 3 overall the srm performs well in the calibration and validation periods from 2006 to 2019 in the jingou river basin the average nse and r 2 values were 0 844 and 0 871 respectively in the calibration period which were greater than 0 8 during the validation period the average nse and r 2 values were 0 795 and 0 869 respectively which were slightly lower than those in calibration period but within the acceptable range the bias performance was the best it was less than 0 5 and close to 0 in the calibration period and validation period the mean d v values in the calibration period and validation period were 1 292 and 0 309 respectively the model performed well in 2017 and 2018 with nse and r 2 values above 0 8 and bias and d v values close to 0 overall the application of the srm in the study area meets the accuracy requirements 4 3 application of the srm in the jrb using the downscaled gpm dataset the input variable precipitation data of the srm are switched from the observed precipitation to the downscaled gpm dataset to verify the reliability of the gpm precipitation data in simulating snowmelt runoff in high elevation mountainous areas as shown in figs 8 and 9 the results show that the srm can still effectively simulate runoff in the snowmelt period after replacing the precipitation data overall the trend is consistent and the fitting effect is good the evaluation results of the srm in the jrb are shown in fig 10 and table 4 the average nse and r 2 values are 0 834 and 0 855 respectively which are higher than 0 8 among these values the nse from 2009 to 2013 was lower than the runoff simulated by the observed data and the nse in the other five years was higher the average nse and r 2 values in the validation period were 0 715 and 0 847 respectively which were slightly lower than those in the calibration period the srm performed best in 2018 with nse and r 2 values greater than 0 8 and bias and d v values close to 0 overall the performance of the gpm dataset simulation is slightly lower than that of the observed precipitation simulation which is only 2 5 lower on r 2 the results show that the downscaled gpm dataset can be used as the input variable for the srm to simulate snowmelt runoff in high elevation mountainous areas with few precipitation rain gauges the overall effect of the srm simulation is satisfactory the underestimation at some peaks may be related to the contribution of glacier melt in this period 5 discussion on model sensitivity in this study the srm is used to simulate snowmelt runoff in the jrb the model has been used in many watersheds especially in alpine mountainous areas and it has achieved good results senzeba et al 2016 tahir et al 2011 it can be seen that the structure of the model is reasonable however because there are many parameters and variables to input to the srm to improve the simulation accuracy of the model in the jrb it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the model to these parameters and variables 5 1 sensitivity of the model to input parameters except that the time lag and regression coefficient which are calculated according to the observation data many other parameters are obtained by adjusting the parameters according to previous research due to the lack of observed data in this paper the following four parameters are selected for sensitivity analysis degree day factor α critical temperature t crit and the runoff coefficients c s c r taking 2019 as an example we kept other parameters and input data unchanged increased α t crit c s and c r by 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 times respectively and analyzed the sensitivity of snowmelt runoff to these four parameters the calculation results are shown in fig 11 and table 5 as shown in fig 11 when α and c s increase by 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 times the increase in snowmelt runoff is large and similar when t crit and c r increase by 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 times the increase in snowmelt runoff is small it can be seen that c s and α have a great influence on snowmelt runoff and the critical temperature t crit has the least impact the order of their influence is c s α c r t crit 5 2 sensitivity of the model to input variables the input variables of the model include temperature t precipitation p and snow cover s we keep the other parameters and input data unchanged and increase t p and s by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times respectively the calculation results are shown in fig 12 and table 6 fig 12 shows that when t increases by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times the snowmelt runoff increases by 3 217 9 743 and 16 417 respectively when p increases by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times the increase in snowmelt runoff is small when s increases by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times the snowmelt runoff increases by 0 644 1 933 and 3 223 respectively overall t has the greatest impact on the change in snowmelt runoff while p has the least impact the order of their influence is t s p 5 3 uncertainty analysis there are many sources of model uncertainty and different parts will affect each other it is difficult to consider the uncertainty of each part before the sensitivity analysis we assume that when one parameter changes other parameters and variables remain unchanged which only reflects the influence of a single parameter or variable on the simulation results however the parameters and variables of the model interact and influence each other for the above problems we will adopt new methods for further analysis in future research 6 conclusion the jrb is located in an alpine mountainous area in xinjiang with complex terrain and a lack of observation data it is very important to estimate the snowmelt runoff in this basin for water resource management the newly released gpm dataset have higher resolution than the previous precipitation data trmm and can cover the whole world but the resolution is still not sufficient for small and medium watersheds in this study the gwr model was used to reduce the spatial scale of the gpm dataset from 10 km 10 km 1 km 1 km by comparing these data with the simulation results based on observed data the efficiency of the downscaled gpm dataset in snowmelt runoff simulation is evaluated the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 based on the improved srm this study simulates snowmelt runoff in the snowmelt season of the jrb from 2006 to 2019 the simulation results meet the accuracy requirements the average value of r 2 was 0 869 in the calibration period which was slightly lower than that in the validation period but within the acceptable range this value shows that the improved srm model can effectively simulate snowmelt runoff in the jrb 2 after substituting the downscaled gpm dataset into the model and comparing the simulation results with the observed data the efficiency of the downscaled gpm dataset simulation is slightly lower than that of the observed precipitation data simulation for which the r 2 value is only 2 5 lower the product after downscaling can be applied to snowmelt runoff simulations in alpine mountains with a lack of observation data 3 the sensitivity analysis of the model shows that among many factors temperature has the greatest impact on the variation in snowmelt runoff the runoff in summer increases with increasing temperature which leads to the retreat of snow lines and glaciers if the assumption that the temperature will rise in the future occurs more runoff will be generated and new reservoirs need to be established to meet future flood control needs in conclusion the improved srm provides an effective tool for simulating watershed snowmelt runoff it is of great significance for monitoring snowmelt runoff runoff prediction and water resource management in alpine areas moreover the sensitivity results show that the model is more sensitive to temperature and less sensitive to precipitation to overcome the problem of insufficient precipitation data the srm uses the scf as an input when calculating runoff the results of this study show that the downscaled gpm dataset can completely replace the observed data for runoff simulations in alpine mountainous areas which solves the problem of the scarcity of precipitation data in high elevation mountainous areas and provides

7991,study region the jingou river basin located in central xinjiang china study focus estimating snowmelt runoff in alpine areas lacking monitoring stations is essential for water resource management the newly released global precipitation measurement gpm data provide a high precision precipitation input data source for snowmelt runoff simulations in such areas however the resolution 10 km 10 km is still insufficient for small and medium watersheds which reduces the application efficiency of the gpm dataset in runoff simulations therefore the geographic weighted regression model gwr is used to downscale the gpm dataset and drive the snowmelt runoff model srm in this study new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the average r 2 values of daily runoff simulated by observed precipitation data and the downscaled gpm dataset 1 km 1 km are 0 869 and 0 847 respectively and the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values are 0 795 and 0 715 respectively the accuracy of the runoff data simulated by the downscaled gpm dataset is 2 5 lower than that simulated based on the observed data and good results are obtained this study shows that the downscaled gpm dataset can be regarded as an effective alternative product in areas lacking observed data the gpm dataset has good application prospects as substitute data in mountainous areas and the gpm dataset resolves the precipitation data scarcity in high elevation mountainous areas without stations and provides a rare data source for modeling graphical abstract the snowmelt runoff model srm combined with modis

introduction snow is one of the main forms of solid atmospheric precipitation and is composed of air ice liquid water and water vapor snow is an extremely important freshwater resource and can directly affect runoff and the surface water cycle it is an important component of surface hydrological process simulations and is also the most sensitive indicator of global climate change tan et al 2019 the fifth assessment report ar5 of the ipcc pointed out that compared with the reference period from 1986 to 2005 the global average temperature will increase by 0 3 4 8 c by the end of the 21st century resulting in large scale melting of snow and glaciers ipcc 2013 since the late 20th century the regional temperature in china has increased significantly piao et al 2010 zhou et al 2020 recent studies have shown that arid areas are greatly affected by global warming bai et al 2011 rangecroft et al 2013 in recent years contrary to the climate in most arid areas of the world the climate in northwest china has become warmer and wetter chen et al 2015 qin et al 2021 shi et al 2007 due to global warming the precipitation in xinjiang has been higher than that in previous years snowmelt runoff is the main water resource in xinjiang xia et al 2017 to study snowmelt many models have been developed snowmelt models are physical equations that simulate and quantitatively describe the snowmelt process in watersheds snowmelt models can generally be divided into degree day models and energy balance models liu et al 2019 degree day models have low data requirements and include the srm and hbv model energy balance model require many parameters such as the vic model and she model the difference between energy balance models and degree day models is that the former pay more attention to the physical details of the snow melting process so they need enough accurate measured data and a wide range of parameters snowmelt runoff mainly occurs in upstream areas these areas are generally located in mountainous areas with more snow high elevations and complex terrain there are few observation stations in alpine mountainous areas resulting in a lack of observed data required by the model however most hydrological models do not yield satisfactory results for daily flow simulations and predictions in high elevation basins martinec et al 2008 therefore a conceptual model with low data requirements has obvious advantages among many snowmelt models the snowmelt runoff model srm is the most representative and widely used snowmelt model khadka et al 2014 tahir et al 2011 2019 the srm established by swiss scientists in 1975 in a small watershed of 2 65 km2 in france was the first semiphysical model of snowmelt runoff in the world initially it was applied only to some small watersheds in europe the srm has been improved and optimized many times through the application of srm in mountain runoff the problem of the improper extraction of the degree day factor was corrected liston 1995 and the uncertain parameters of the model were calibrated franz et al 2008 adding the temperature interpolation method and radiation factor to the srm greatly improved the accuracy of the model frey and holzmann 2015 at present the srm has been tested and applied to hundreds of watersheds in more than 20 countries worldwide lee et al 2005 to make the srm more suitable for california peel and bloeschl 2011 revised the main parameters of the model according to the input conditions of its parameter variables georgievsky 2009 and tahir et al 2011 used the srm to predict runoff in the hunza river basin and kuban river basin showing that the srm can effectively simulate the daily discharge in alpine areas immerzeel et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 applied the srm to the himalayan and qinghai lake basins and found that the model performed well in these areas xinjiang is located inland and far from the sea detecting snow variation and snowmelt runoff is very important to water resource management in the area taking the jingou river basin jrb in xinjiang as an example this study selects the snowmelt period from 2006 to 2019 and uses the srm to simulate snowmelt runoff in this basin the purpose of this study is as follows a to evaluate the applicability of the srm in simulating snowmelt runoff in the jrb and b to study the reliability of global precipitation measurement gpm data in simulating snowmelt runoff in high elevation river catchments to compensate for the scarcity of observed data 2 study area xinjiang is located in the hinterland of eurasia far from the sea and has a typical continental arid climate the tianshan mountains tsm are part of a large high elevation mountain range that stretches across central xinjiang china and these mountains are the main areas of runoff formation in xinjiang xinjiang contains three mountain ranges and two basins which combined with its climate result in dry conditions little rain and a lack of surface water resources guo et al 2016 the jingou river basin 85 03 e 85 44 e 43 30 n 44 50 n has scarce precipitation and is located in central and western xinjiang china the basin is located in the middle part of the northern foot of the tsm and the southern edge of the junggar basin the river originates from the north side of yilianhabirga mountain flows onto the alluvial plain from south to north and finally flows into the manas river which is its first tributary chen et al 2017 the terrain of the jingou river is high in the south and low in the north and the highest elevation is 5152 m the jrb is a typical glacial and snowmelt river with an average annual runoff of 3 197 108 m3 at the bajiahu hydrological station the average annual temperature is 5 2 c and the average annual precipitation is

and predict snowmelt runoff in mountainous watersheds martinec et al 2008 the degree day factor method is used to calculate snowmelt runoff and the daily temperature t precipitation p and snow cover fraction scf of the basin are taken as the basic input variables the main principle is to calculate the amount of water formed by daily snowmelt and precipitation and then add it to the calculated recession flow to obtain the daily runoff the formula is as follows 1 q n 1 c sn α n t n δ t n s n c rn p n a 10000 86400 1 k n 1 q n k n 1 where q is the average daily runoff m3 s c s is the snowmelt runoff coefficient c r is the rainfall runoff coefficient α is the degree day factor cm 1 d 1 t is the number of degree days d t is the degree day adjustment by the temperature lapse rate s is the ratio of the snow covered area to the basin area p is the runoff depth formed by precipitation cm a is the area of the basin or zone km2 and k is the recession coefficient and n is the daily series 3 2 1 srm input variables 3 2 1 1 temperature and degree days in the srm the temperature is expressed in degree days degree days are generally calculated through an observation value of air temperature and the formula is described as follows 2 t t min t max 2 where t is the average daily temperature and t max and t min are the daily maximum and minimum air temperature values respectively the temperature value is calculated based on the mean elevation of each elevation zone according to the temperature lapse rate 3 δ t γ h s t h p 1 100 where γ is the temperature lapse rate of the basin a global average temperature lapse rate of 0 65 100 m is adopted in this study h st is the elevation of the meteorological station h p is the mean elevation of each zone and the temperature of the observation station is interpolated to each zone according to the temperature lapse rate 3 2 1 2 precipitation there are also precipitation differences at different elevations the precipitation in the basin increases with elevation and the vertical change is obvious in this study some experiments are carried out on the north slope of the tsm and precipitation at different elevations is observed according to the observed precipitation the precipitation in the basin is calculated to increase by 1 07 mm 100 m 4 p p p s t β h p h s t 1 100 where β is the increasing precipitation rate in the jrb p st is the precipitation at the meteorological station and p p is the precipitation in the elevation zone in addition the input variables from the observed precipitation are replaced by the downscaled gpm dataset to evaluate the applicability of the gpm in high elevation mountainous areas 3 2 1 3 snow cover fraction scf the daily snow cover fraction scf of the basin is derived from the declining scf curve based on the mod10a2 and myd10a2 datasets the maximum synthesis method is used to fuse the two groups of images in the same period which can reduce the interference of clouds ma et al 2019 paudel and andersen 2011 the declining scf curve is drawn according to the time series and then the linear interpolation method is used to interpolate the daily snow cover 3 2 2 srm parameters 3 2 2 1 time lag time lags are determined by the model user s manual and selected by the basin area as shown in table 2 the total area of the jrb is 1175 67 km2 so the time lag is 12 4 h 3 2 2 2 recession coefficient the recession coefficient refers to the decrease in runoff during the period without snowmelt or rainfall and is an important parameter in the srm the formula is as follows 5 k n 1 q n 1 q n where q n is the runoff of the nth day and k is a recession coefficient and a variable that can be calculated from the observed runoff as follows 6 k n 1 x q n y where x and y are constants combining eqs 5 and 6 we can conclude that 7 q n 1 x q n 1 y logarithms are taken on both sides of eq 7 to obtain 8 lg q n 1 1 y lg q n lg x the observed daily runoff during the snowmelt period from 2006 to 2019 is presented as a double logarithmic scatter diagram as shown in fig 3 taking 2006 as an example the recession coefficient is calculated without snowmelt or rainfall so the data of q n 1 q n are excluded the x and y values of each year are calculated and the average value is taken to obtain x 0 9862 y 0 0327 and the recession coefficient k n 1 0 9862 q n 0 0327 3 2 2 3 runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient represents the amount of precipitation flowing out through the outlet section of the basin after flowing into the river and includes the snowmelt runoff coefficient c s and rainfall runoff coefficient c r due to data limitations the runoff coefficient in this study is obtained based on experience and the specific parameters are adjusted according to the simulation results 3 3 model uncertainty reduction generally model uncertainty includes three parts 1 the uncertainty of the model structure 2 the uncertainty of the input data and 3 the uncertainty of the model parameters to improve the simulation accuracy of the srm in the study area this study mainly reduces the uncertainty of the model by improving the input data and parameters of the model 3 3 1 improvement of the input data there are few meteorological stations in alpine mountainous areas especially those higher than 2500 m it is difficult to obtain grid temperature and precipitation data and simulate snowmelt runoff to obtain high precision grid input data for a watershed scale snowmelt runoff model a geographic weighted regression gwr model is used to reduce the spatial scale of the gpm dataset from 10 km 10 km 1 km 1 km considering the spatial heterogeneity between variables the gwr model establishes a regression model by estimating the parameters of each location brunsdon et al 1998 this study selects the ndvi and dem as independent variables to construct the gwr model which mainly includes the following three steps 1 data preparation the bilinear interpolation method is used to resample the dem data with resolutions of 90 m to 1 km and 10 km and the ndvi data with resolutions of 1 km 10 km 2 construction of the gwr model the gwr model is constructed by using the dem ndvi and gpm datasets with a resolution of 10 km to obtain coefficients constant terms and residuals as shown in eq 9 zhan et al 2018 then the coefficients and constant terms are resampled to 1 km and the residuals are resampled to 1 km using inverse distance weighting idw 9 p i β n d v i u i v i n d v i i β d e m u i v i d e m i β 0 u i v i ε i where pi is the precipitation at point i u i v i represents the longitude and latitude coordinates of the ith position point β 0 u i v i is the corresponding coefficient term and ε i is the residual 3 extrapolation of the gpm dataset based on the coefficients auxiliary variables constant terms and residuals at a resolution of 1 km obtained above the downscaled gpm dataset at 1 km is obtained according to eq 9 3 3 2 improvement of the model parameter the degree day model assumes that there is a significant linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature and the main purpose is to calculate the amount of snow melting the general form of the degree day model is as follows van den broeke et al 2010 10 m α t t t t t t 0 t t t where m is snowmelt mm d 1 α is the degree day factor cm c 1 d 1 t is the air temperature c and t t is the critical temperature for snow melting c the srm is also called the degree day model the degree day factor α is the most sensitive parameter in the snowmelt model and directly affects the snowmelt rate a large number of scholars have suggested that α 1 1ρ s ρ w where ρ s is the snow density and ρ w is the water density for a basin water density is a fixed value but snow density is a time dependent variable that is difficult to obtain based on long term observations at meteorological stations it is found that the degree day factor is significantly linearly correlated with the air temperature therefore the linear model between the degree day factor and air temperature is modified to improve the simulation accuracy in this study a snowmelt model is constructed with air temperature as the independent variable and snowmelt as the dependent variable through the linear fitting between the long time series air temperature and snowmelt by the least square method the following model is obtained 11 m 0 232 t t t 3 4659 t t t 0 t t t after the improvement of the above degree day factor appropriate adjustments are made in combination with the simulation results 3 4 evaluation methods to evaluate the accuracy of the downscaled gpm dataset we calculated the correlation coefficient r bias and root mean square error rmse between the observed data and the downscaled gpm dataset 12 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 13 b i a s 1 n i 1 n x i y i 14 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x i is the downscaled gpm dataset y i is the observed data and n is the number of samples to quantitatively evaluate the simulation results the model uses four indicators including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r 2 bias and volume difference d v the calculation formulas are 15 n s e 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 16 r 2 i 1 n q i q i q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q i 2 17 b i a s 1 n i 1 n q i q i 18 d v v i v

bias and d v are used to analyze the consistency between the simulated and observed values r 2 reflects the goodness of fit when bias 0 and nse r 2 1 the fitting effect is the best 4 results the srm is used to simulate the daily snowmelt runoff of the jrb this study uses scf as the input data the snow melting season from 2006 to 2015 as the calibration period and the snow melting season from 2016 to 2019 as the validation period to verify the applicability of the srm in the study area and the reliability of gpm downscaling precipitation data in simulating snowmelt runoff in high elevation basins 4 1 downscaled gpm dataset evaluation to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of the downscaled gpm dataset in the jrb we select the observed precipitation data of the bajiahu hydrological station in the basin and four meteorological stations around the basin shawan fort wusu and wulan wusu meteorological stations to compare with the downscaled gpm dataset and draw scatter plots fig 4 for the five meteorological stations the average correlation coefficient r value is greater than 0 66 the bias is close to 0 and the rmse is also relatively low overall the gpm dataset after downscaling meets the accuracy requirements then we further verify the applicability of the downscaled gpm dataset in the study area by comparing the simulation results obtained using downscaled gpm dataset and observed data 4 2 application of the srm in the jrb using the observed precipitation data the simulation results of the srm in the jrb are shown in figs 5 and 6 the model can effectively simulate runoff during the annual snowmelt period april to september in the jrb overall the observed and simulated runoff values in the calibration period and validation period fit well and the trend is consistent however for the peak runoff value the simulated and observed peak values deviate during the calibration period the peak was lower than the observed peaks in 2006 2012 and 2014 and higher than the observed peak in 2008 during the validation period the peak was lower than the observed peak in 2016 and higher than the observed peak in 2019 this may be due to the following reasons 1 the daily snow cover fraction adopted in the model is the linear interpolation of the 8 day average snow cover fraction which cannot truly reflect the change in the daily snow cover rate 2 there are scarce meteorological stations in the basin although no precipitation might be observed at the bajiahu station there may be precipitation in other parts of the basin resulting in an increase in actual runoff 3 there may be instantaneous snowfall in the basin the rapid rise in temperature in the flood season leads to the rapid melting of this part of snow in addition rainfall is frequent and the source of runoff supply is complex in the flood season but the precipitation form in the non flood season is relatively singular therefore the simulation effect in the non flood season is better than that in the flood season the evaluation results of the srm in the jrb are shown in fig 7 and table 3 overall the srm performs well in the calibration and validation periods from 2006 to 2019 in the jingou river basin the average nse and r 2 values were 0 844 and 0 871 respectively in the calibration period which were greater than 0 8 during the validation period the average nse and r 2 values were 0 795 and 0 869 respectively which were slightly lower than those in calibration period but within the acceptable range the bias performance was the best it was less than 0 5 and close to 0 in the calibration period and validation period the mean d v values in the calibration period and validation period were 1 292 and 0 309 respectively the model performed well in 2017 and 2018 with nse and r 2 values above 0 8 and bias and d v values close to 0 overall the application of the srm in the study area meets the accuracy requirements 4 3 application of the srm in the jrb using the downscaled gpm dataset the input variable precipitation data of the srm are switched from the observed precipitation to the downscaled gpm dataset to verify the reliability of the gpm precipitation data in simulating snowmelt runoff in high elevation mountainous areas as shown in figs 8 and 9 the results show that the srm can still effectively simulate runoff in the snowmelt period after replacing the precipitation data overall the trend is consistent and the fitting effect is good the evaluation results of the srm in the jrb are shown in fig 10 and table 4 the average nse and r 2 values are 0 834 and 0 855 respectively which are higher than 0 8 among these values the nse from 2009 to 2013 was lower than the runoff simulated by the observed data and the nse in the other five years was higher the average nse and r 2 values in the validation period were 0 715 and 0 847 respectively which were slightly lower than those in the calibration period the srm performed best in 2018 with nse and r 2 values greater than 0 8 and bias and d v values close to 0 overall the performance of the gpm dataset simulation is slightly lower than that of the observed precipitation simulation which is only 2 5 lower on r 2 the results show that the downscaled gpm dataset can be used as the input variable for the srm to simulate snowmelt runoff in high elevation mountainous areas with few precipitation rain gauges the overall effect of the srm simulation is satisfactory the underestimation at some peaks may be related to the contribution of glacier melt in this period 5 discussion on model sensitivity in this study the srm is used to simulate snowmelt runoff in the jrb the model has been used in many watersheds especially in alpine mountainous areas and it has achieved good results senzeba et al 2016 tahir et al 2011 it can be seen that the structure of the model is reasonable however because there are many parameters and variables to input to the srm to improve the simulation accuracy of the model in the jrb it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the model to these parameters and variables 5 1 sensitivity of the model to input parameters except that the time lag and regression coefficient which are calculated according to the observation data many other parameters are obtained by adjusting the parameters according to previous research due to the lack of observed data in this paper the following four parameters are selected for sensitivity analysis degree day factor α critical temperature t crit and the runoff coefficients c s c r taking 2019 as an example we kept other parameters and input data unchanged increased α t crit c s and c r by 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 times respectively and analyzed the sensitivity of snowmelt runoff to these four parameters the calculation results are shown in fig 11 and table 5 as shown in fig 11 when α and c s increase by 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 times the increase in snowmelt runoff is large and similar when t crit and c r increase by 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 times the increase in snowmelt runoff is small it can be seen that c s and α have a great influence on snowmelt runoff and the critical temperature t crit has the least impact the order of their influence is c s α c r t crit 5 2 sensitivity of the model to input variables the input variables of the model include temperature t precipitation p and snow cover s we keep the other parameters and input data unchanged and increase t p and s by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times respectively the calculation results are shown in fig 12 and table 6 fig 12 shows that when t increases by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times the snowmelt runoff increases by 3 217 9 743 and 16 417 respectively when p increases by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times the increase in snowmelt runoff is small when s increases by 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 times the snowmelt runoff increases by 0 644 1 933 and 3 223 respectively overall t has the greatest impact on the change in snowmelt runoff while p has the least impact the order of their influence is t s p 5 3 uncertainty analysis there are many sources of model uncertainty and different parts will affect each other it is difficult to consider the uncertainty of each part before the sensitivity analysis we assume that when one parameter changes other parameters and variables remain unchanged which only reflects the influence of a single parameter or variable on the simulation results however the parameters and variables of the model interact and influence each other for the above problems we will adopt new methods for further analysis in future research 6 conclusion the jrb is located in an alpine mountainous area in xinjiang with complex terrain and a lack of observation data it is very important to estimate the snowmelt runoff in this basin for water resource management the newly released gpm dataset have higher resolution than the previous precipitation data trmm and can cover the whole world but the resolution is still not sufficient for small and medium watersheds in this study the gwr model was used to reduce the spatial scale of the gpm dataset from 10 km 10 km 1 km 1 km by comparing these data with the simulation results based on observed data the efficiency of the downscaled gpm dataset in snowmelt runoff simulation is evaluated the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 based on the improved srm this study simulates snowmelt runoff in the snowmelt season of the jrb from 2006 to 2019 the simulation results meet the accuracy requirements the average value of r 2 was 0 869 in the calibration period which was slightly lower than that in the validation period but within the acceptable range this value shows that the improved srm model can effectively simulate snowmelt runoff in the jrb 2 after substituting the downscaled gpm dataset into the model and comparing the simulation results with the observed data the efficiency of the downscaled gpm dataset simulation is slightly lower than that of the observed precipitation data simulation for which the r 2 value is only 2 5 lower the product after downscaling can be applied to snowmelt runoff simulations in alpine mountains with a lack of observation data 3 the sensitivity analysis of the model shows that among many factors temperature has the greatest impact on the variation in snowmelt runoff the runoff in summer increases with increasing temperature which leads to the retreat of snow lines and glaciers if the assumption that the temperature will rise in the future occurs more runoff will be generated and new reservoirs need to be established to meet future flood control needs in conclusion the improved srm provides an effective tool for simulating watershed snowmelt runoff it is of great significance for monitoring snowmelt runoff runoff prediction and water resource management in alpine areas moreover the sensitivity results show that the model is more sensitive to temperature and less sensitive to precipitation to overcome the problem of insufficient precipitation data the srm uses the scf as an input when calculating runoff the results of this study show that the downscaled gpm dataset can completely replace the observed data for runoff simulations in alpine mountainous areas which solves the problem of the scarcity of precipitation data in high elevation mountainous areas and provides an alternative precipitation data source for the model credit authorship contribution statement yin zhang gulimire hanati sulitan danierhan conceptualization yin zhang sulitan danierhan methodology

7992,study region 19 flood prone catchments in kenya eastern africa study focus flooding is a major natural hazard especially in developing countries and the need for timely reliable and actionable hydrological forecasts is paramount hydrological modelling is essential to produce forecasts but is a challenging task especially in poorly gauged catchments because of the inadequate temporal and spatial coverage of hydro meteorological observations open access global meteorological reanalysis datasets can fill in this gap however they have significant errors this study assesses the performance of four reanalysis datasets era5 era interim cfsr and jra55 over kenya for the period 1981 2016 on daily monthly seasonal and annual timescales we firstly evaluate the reanalysis datasets by comparing them against observations from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station secondly we evaluate the ability of these reanalysis datasets to simulate streamflow using gr4j model considering both model performance and parameters sensitivity and identifiability new hydrological insights for the region while era5 is the best performing dataset overall performance varies by season and catchment and therefore there are marked differences in the suitability of reanalysis products for forcing hydrological models overall wetland catchments in the western regions and highlands of kenya obtained relatively better scores compared to those in the semi arid regions this can inform future applications of reanalysis products for setting up hydrological models that can be used for flood forecasting early warning and early action in data scarce regions such as kenya graphical abstract ga1 key words reanalysis data kenyan catchments model calibration model performance sensitivity analysis model suitability index 1 introduction precipitation is arguably the most important driver of catchment hydrological response e g macleod et al 2021 but it is challenging to get accurate information on the amount duration and intensity of rainfall events beck et al 2017a tapiador et al 2012 due to the high spatio temporal variability nicholson et al 2019 vischel et al 2011 this is compounded by a low spatial coverage and a net decline in the number of ground gauge stations in the historical climatological observation network especially in developing countries such as kenya menne et al 2018 tarek et al 2020 2021 zaitchik et al 2011 unreliable or incomplete datasets are unable to correctly identify seasonal or short range temporal patterns e g gosset et al 2013 le et al 2017 other sources of precipitation data such as those from satellite remote sensing are now available but they come with their own errors including random and systematic see beck et al 2021 beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b fortin et al 2015 sun et al 2018 another freely available source of precipitation data are meteorological reanalysis products which are becoming increasingly promising due to upgrades in their spatial resolution and improved representation of atmospheric processes in global models hersbach 2018 reanalysis data combine a wide range of remotely sensed observations with a dynamical physical coupled numerical model to produce the best estimate of the state of the atmosphere reanalysis is not reliant on the density of surface observational networks and can give surface variables in locations with little to no surface coverage as a result they can generate several variables both at the land surface and on vertical atmospheric levels and hence have been applied in several studies both for climatological and hydrological purposes across the world e g beck et al 2017a chen et al 2018 emerton et al 2017 essou et al 2017 several different reanalysis products exist but they are known to vary in quality with recurrent upgrades it is important to evaluate them carefully both to inform the users and the developers of the datasets the developers of these products can only work on improving their updates when there is a complete feedback loop between applications and developments therefore ground validation of reanalysis precipitation is very important but very challenging particularly where the rain gauge networks are sparse several studies attempt to quantify and account for the sampling errors comparing reanalysis data with observations in different parts of the world e g guo et al 2018 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zaitchik et al 2011 at a global scale beck et al 2017a 2017b at regional or basin scale e g acharya et al 2019 nkiaka et al 2017 tarek et al 2020 and at a national scale e g arshad et al 2021 gleixner et al 2020 koukoula et al 2020 lakew et al 2020 shayeghi et al 2020 tesfaye et al 2017 however the findings of these studies were mixed differences in approaches regions and time scales resulted in inconsistency in product performance implying that site specific performance evaluation may be required existing studies also aimed at analysing a single product or a few products for short periods of time thus their estimated errors may not reflect long term behaviour additionally the temporal dynamics of rainfall are very important as they play an important role in the total accumulated rainfall on daily and monthly timescales ficchì et al 2016 thus influencing the bimodal seasonality observed over kenya also the highly variable temporal dynamics are key in explaining the nonlinear nature of infiltration process blöschl and sivapalan 1995 such as the peak discharge value gabellani et al 2007 and runoff volume viglione et al 2010 in hydrological modelling thus the above highlights the need to consider different temporal scales when evaluating the reanalysis precipitation relative to observation in kenya there were 20 major floods from 1964 to 2020 which were driven by precipitation falling in the seasonal rains more than 160 000 people were displaced countrywide by floods in october 2019 reliefweb 2019a 2019b opere 2013 annual average economic loss from flooding is estimated to be 5 5 of gross domestic product njogu 2021 thus understanding the best representation of precipitation in flood models which can be used for forecasting or risk analysis is of great societal importance kenya has a widely varying physical geography resulting in great variability of river catchment characteristics across the country thus it is essential not only to understand the representation of precipitation at a country scale but also on a catchment by catchment basis golian et al 2021 meresa et al 2021 previous evaluation of reanalysis products in capturing kenyan rainfall show varied levels of agreement in spatio temporal variability relative to observations e g alemayehu et al 2018 dile and srinivasan 2014 gleixner et al 2020 khan et al 2011 moreover studies employing hydrological modelling generally used discharge observations from a small number of catchments e g alemayehu et al 2018 bitew et al 2012 langat et al 2017 le et al 2017 worqlul et al 2017 and did not quantify uncertainties associated with each reanalysis e g alemayehu et al 2018 leading to combined rainfall and model uncertainty that is not easily interpreted hence there is a notable gap in the literature associated with evaluating the accuracy of multiple reanalysis products across different catchments accounting for both model and input errors especially in data scarce regions like in kenya and this gap was an important motivation for the present study this paper evaluates four reanalysis precipitation products with respect to observations and assesses their suitability for use in hydrological modelling in 19 kenyan catchments we assess their performance in reproducing the most important features of rainfall events and regimes and in simulating catchment streamflow through answering the following research questions how well do the precipitation datasets compare in terms of temporal dynamics at the basin scale which product is the most accurate compared to observations how well do precipitation datasets compare in terms of spatial patterns which product shows consistency in spatial heterogeneity compared to observations how does the general hydrological model performance vary with different datasets how does the sensitivity of a rainfall runoff model gr4j vary with alternative rainfall forcing we consider both model performance and parameter uncertainty and compute a model suitability index msi by coupling the results of model performance statistics and global sensitivity analysis we compare four reanalysis datasets using the gr4j model across 19 kenyan catchments with varied climate and morphological characteristics to investigate which input data is suitable or require caution when used in the place of observation dataset in different regions this work is a steppingstone and an essential guide for hydrological applications of global reanalysis datasets because it compares several reanalysis products to observations on daily monthly and seasonal scales and unveils the propagation of uncertainty from different reanalysis when used as model inputs all the above reviewed studies looked at the performance of at most one reanalysis dataset in simulating streamflow and only over one catchment but none looked at such a country scale performance to our knowledge this is the very first evaluation of the different reanalysis products over kenya for simulating streamflow coupled with sensitivity analysis 2 study area and catchment characteristics the study is undertaken in 19 kenyan catchments fig 1 with varying characteristics table 1 these were selected due to the frequency and magnitude of the impacts of floods as well as the availability of river flow observations table 1 kenya mainly experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern occurring in the seasons of march april may mam and october november december ond ayugi et al 2016 yang et al 2015 which are commonly known as the long and short rains respectively the rainfall seasonality and the migration of the precipitation zone is mainly

while in the highlands frequent thunderstorms and lightning threaten life 3 data and methodology 3 1 datasets 3 1 1 reanalysis and observational data four reanalysis products namely era5 era interim hereafter erai climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 and a gridded observational dataset the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps were used in this study see table 2 we used the daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature variables from the reanalysis products for the study era5 is the latest global atmospheric reanalysis product from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which spans the modern observing period from 1950 onward hersbach 2018 in this study 3 hourly era5 was obtained from ecmwf on a fixed grid of 0 31 0 31 erai is the previous global reanalysis product created by ecmwf dee et al 2011 daily erai was obtained from ecmwf on a fixed grid of 0 75 0 75 jra55 is a global reanalysis dataset constructed by the japan meteorological agency jma kobayashi et al 2015 daily jra55 was obtained from national center for atmospheric research ncar climate data guide at a fixed gird of 0 56 0 56 cfsr is a global reanalysis dataset of atmosphere fields produced by the national centers for environmental prediction and for atmospheric research ncep ncar saha et al 2010 the chirps dataset was used as a benchmark observation dataset since it has been used in several studies showing good results compared to observations over eastern africa dinku et al 2018 chirps is a quasi global high resolution daily pentad and monthly precipitation dataset funk et al 2015 based on infrared cold cloud duration ccd data chirps has a long enough history of precipitation data the algorithm is based on i a 5 km climatology that uses satellite data to represent sparsely gauged locations ii includes daily pentadal and monthly 5 km ccd based precipitation estimates from 1981 to the present iii combines station data to generate tentative information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks and iv interpolation weights are assigned based on a novel blending method which uses the spatial correlation structure of ccd estimates this makes it comparatively an alternative in data scarce regions we opted for the gridded observations as the daily observed gauge datasets were not available for the catchments of study and are known to be very sparse and present large data gaps dinku et al 2019 2018 le et al 2017 3 1 2 observed river discharge and potential evapotranspiration river discharge datasets at daily time step for the period 1981 2016 were provided by the kenya water resource authority wra for the selected catchments across the country summarized in table 2 the potential evapotranspiration pet required for the catchment modelling was estimated from the average daily temperature of the four reanalysis products and chirts daily data from the climate hazard centre chc as temperature readings were the readily available meteorological data that relates to pet for this study temperature based methods were used to estimate the pet hargreaves and samani 1985 for this study the hamon method hamon 1960 was used to estimate pet daily averages for different datasets 3 2 modelling experiment methodology to obtain the monthly and annual totals for observations and reanalysis datasets the daily values were accumulated the seasonal total precipitation was calculated by summing monthly precipitation for three seasons i the march april may hereafter referred to as mam ii the june july august hereafter jja and iii the october november december hereafter ond all datasets were converted to the same units for consistency e g jra55 and cfsr were converted from kg m2 s to mm d era5 erai jra 55 and cfsr were regridded by first order conservative interpolations to a horizontal grid of 0 5o x 0 5o schulzweida 2019 we first qualitatively evaluate the performance statistics of the reanalysis datasets in terms of temporal dynamics and biases with respect to precipitation observations chirps considering the following metrics pearson linear correlation coefficient cc mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean error me long term relative bias bias and annual number of dry days calculated on monthly annual and seasonal scales we produce spatial maps for the standardized precipitation anomalies bias and annual number of dry days to assess their consistency compared to observations and tabulate the other statistics to show the aggregate performance across the different datasets second we calibrate the gr4j perrin et al 2003 rainfall runoff model in the study we used five different inputs sources for both precipitation and pet into gr4j model from chirps era5 erai cfsr and jra55 we calibrate the model with each of the input source at a time and compute the kge score and compare how this varies across the four different datasets relative to observations the gr4j model is a simple daily lumped rainfall runoff model belonging to the family of soil moisture accounting models there are four main parameters fig 2 to be calibrated in gr4j model namely 1 the maximum capacity of the production store x1 mm 2 the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 mm 3 the maximum capacity of the non linear routing store x3 mm and 4 the time base of the unit hydrograph x4 days there are also a few fixed parameters whose values were set by perrin et al 2003 all four free parameters are real numbers x1 and x3 are positive x4 is greater than 0 5 and x2 can be either positive zero or negative the typical inputs of gr4j are the areal precipitation depth p mm and the potential evapotranspiration pe mm estimate over the catchment most optimization algorithms used to calibrate the model parameters require knowledge of an initial parameter set given the small number of model parameters simple optimization algorithms are generally capable of identifying parameter values yielding satisfactory results the choice of an objective function depends on the objectives of model user the choice and use of the gr4j model is mainly due to its simple and relatively quick to calibrate structure ensuring high levels of performance and robustness ficchì et al 2019 mostafaie et al 2018 oudin et al 2004 van esse et al 2013 pushpalatha et al 2011 the four free parameters of the gr4j model were calibrated using the default optimisation algorithm provided in the airgr package coron et al 2019 delaigue et al 2019 this simple optimization algorithm mainly based on a local optimisation proved to be equally efficient to locate a robust optimum compared to more complex global search algorithms coron et al 2019 and proved effective in terms of the number of model runs required for convergence mathevet et al 2006 the michel method michel 1983 is based on two steps i a systematic inspection of the global parameter space is performed to determine the most likely zone of convergence in our study this is done by direct grid screening ii a steepest descent local search procedure is carried out to find an estimate of the optimum parameter set starting from the best parameter set from step 1 the four free model parameters were calibrated by applying the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as the objective function and the daily observed river discharge data of the selected catchments as reference we use different inputs precipitation datasets from chirps era5 erai cfsr and jra55 to calibrate the gr4j model the kge was used also for evaluating the performance of the gr4j model when forced with different reanalysis data the kge objective function represents a weighting of three components that correspond to bias correlation and variability ensuring that kge is sensitive to errors in the overall distribution of streamflow adeyeri et al 2020 kling et al 2012 we therefore calculated the hydrological model performance statistics for the calibration and validation periods and compared across the different reanalysis datasets to investigate the overall suitability of the different reanalysis as input data to simulate river flows we adopted a threshold of model performance in the range 0 41 kge 1 as reasonable following knoben et al 2019 being 0 41 the kge value corresponding to a mean flow benchmark a split sample validation technique klemeš 1986 was used to test model performance beyond the calibration period for this study 36 years 1981 2016 of streamflow data for each catchment were available so we split into two equal 18 year split sample testing sst periods hereafter referred to as sst1 and sst2 third we perform sensitivity analysis by applying the global sobol sensitivity method for the gr4j model parameters using the kge as our target function and the daily observed data of the 19 catchments as reference we adopt the sobol method because it estimates the relative contribution of individual model parameters and their interactions through the decomposition of model output variance nossent et al 2011 a sensitivity analysis allows a reduction of the number of parameters incorporated in the optimization by determining the most influential parameters of a model and their identifiability saltelli et al 2000 as no prior information is available on the parameters the input parameter values for the sensitivity analysis are sampled from a uniform distribution nossent et al 2011 the different parameter ranges are scaled between 0 and 1 with a linear transformation then we obtain one value of the sensitivity indices si per parameter and we investigate the relative role of each parameter in explaining the output variance and assess possible over parameterization issues by counting the number of sensitive parameters the value of the objective function for the calibration of parameters can be used as the model performance statistics for sensitivity analysis as such we adopted the kge last we assess the overall suitability of the rainfall runoff model when forced with different meteorological inputs by calculating the model suitability index msi we compare the performance of the four reanalysis datasets across the 19 catchments and investigate which of the input dataset is suitable and which require caution because of low model performance and possible parameter identifiability or over parameterization problems the well known problem of over parameterisation due to insensitive parameters in models with large number of parameters van griensven et al 2006 makes sensitivity and performance statistics important this may result in uncertain model simulations arising from equifinality in model calibration but yielding unequifinal model simulations in validation beven 2012 this mostly arises due to application of calibrated multiple optimal parameters sets with significantly variable parameter values shin et al 2015 shin and kim 2017 therefore in most cases the problem arising from prediction uncertainty may pose problems to modellers when it comes to decision making by applying the quantitative method of sobol s sa this enabled us to couple the results with the performance statistics the msi aggregates both sensitivity indices performance statistics shin and kim 2017 providing a clear index to judge the relative global performance of the reanalysis products with respect to observations the computed msi can be used in comparison studies with any catchment data if all the model parameters are sensitive this would yield a msi of 1 and a perfectly matched hydrograph between the simulations and observations we adapt shin and kim 2017 model suitability index msi which is a combined measure of performance statistics and sensitivity analysis results the msi can be expressed as 1 m s i 0 5 1 n i 1 n s r i 0 5 1 m j 1 m p s j where the sr is the sensitivity ratio i e the ratio of the number of sensitive parameters out of the total number of model parameters ranging from 0 1 and ps is the performance statistics n is the number of years over which the sensitivity analysis is run and m is the number of split sample periods in model calibration it is necessary to set a sensitivity threshold to ascertain the sensitive parameters hence we adopted a minimum value of 0 2 for the tsi of a sensitive parameter this value has been suggested and used in some past studies e g van werkhoven 2009 van werkhoven et al 2009 shin et al 2013 it is worth noting that this is an arbitrary value thus we acknowledge the need to practice caution when the parameters tsi values are nearing the threshold ps is computed by obtaining the average value of all the periods considered i e two split sample periods to calculate the average ps we considered the calibration and validation performance statistics kge as both measures are equally important we gave the same averaged weight to ps and sr in calculating the msi 4 results and discussion 4 1 results 4 1 1 overall performance evaluation using observations the performance of era5 erai jra55 and cfsr on monthly seasonal and annual scales is presented in this section we used the monthly scale as a base time scale and calculated cc rmse mae and me for all the four reanalysis products 4 1 1 1 performance on monthly scale era5 erai jra55 and cfsr were first evaluated on a monthly timescale with respect to observations at the country level all the datasets passed the significance test of the correlation coefficient at the 99 confidence level and to eliminate the influence of the seasonal cycle on the values each correlation coefficient was calculated per month as shown in fig 3 era5 shows the highest average correlation coefficient value of 0 71 on monthly timescale compared to observations and is consistently higher across all months fig 3 and table 3 than the other reanalysis products erai and cfsr have good average correlation but show larger drops in some months especially in the drier month of august jra55 obtained a poor correlation coefficient of 0 46 on average in general era5 erai and cfsr show higher correlations to observations in rainy months march april may and october november december and lower in the dry months june july august whereas jra55 shows worst correlations during both rainy seasons the average twelve months evaluation indices for each of the reanalysis product is shown in table 3 overall era5 erai and cfsr show a similar good ability to simulate the precipitation for all the indices under consideration era5 has a better cc bias and rmse whereas jra55 has the lowest cc and the largest bias and rmse suggesting that jra55 is worst performing reanalysis dataset over the kenyan catchments 4 1 1 2 performance on seasonal and annual timescales the overall performance of the four reanalyses era5 erai cfsr and jra55 were evaluated on seasonal and annual timescales to explain the propagation of errors at these timescales the results of the different performance indices are shown in table 4 the overall correlation coefficients on seasonal and annual timescale are shown in fig 4 higher cc across all the datasets were obtained in the wet seasons of mam and ond whereas lower cc were obtained in the dry season of jja with the performance index higher in ond than in mam era5 obtained the highest cc 0 88 in mam whereas cfsr the highest 0 84 in ond jra55 showed lower cc of 0 34 and 0 44 in the two seasons respectively and a cc of 0 52 in the dry season depicting a tendency of a wet bias over the dry months on average the variability in the cc index across the four datasets was relatively lower in the ond season and higher in the mam season the bias across the four datasets was lower in the dry season jja and higher in the wet seasons mam ond with jra55 showing a higher positive bias across all the seasons there are large values in the rmse and the mae across the four datasets in the two wet seasons and this may be linked to the high precipitation concentrations during those seasons across most of the catchments generally it can be noted that jra55 shows the worst performance in comparison to observation especially in the wet seasons of mam and ond but obtained relatively better scores in the dry season of jja era5 shows better agreement with observations across the three seasons thus may be an appropriate option for simulating precipitation over the kenyan catchments on annual timescale the average annual precipitation of cfsr era5 erai and jra55 was computed and compared with the observation chirps fig 5 era5 erai and cfsr show similar trend compared to observations across all the years with cfsr and erai underestimating the precipitation jra55 shows a higher tendency of overestimating the annual precipitation over the study catchments in terms of the performance indices cfsr erai and era5 showed better cc indices of 0 60 0 46 0 52 respectively whereas jra obtained lower cc of 0 25 fig 4 the variability in the cc was higher in jra55 fig 4 era5 and jra55 show a positive bias of 45 and 171 respectively whereas erai and cfsr show negative bias of 26 and 85 era5 has a lower rmse and me whereas jra55 has the highest these results show that era5 is the best performing reanalysis dataset compared to observations on annual timescales whereas jra55 is the worst performing the mean monthly and seasonal standardized precipitation anomalies in the four reanalysis precipitation for a base climatological period 1981 2016 is shown in fig 6 on monthly timescale the observations show a positive anomaly over the central highland and the western parts of kenya fig 6 pan1 the arid and semi arid parts in the eastern and coastal lowlands show a negative anomaly dry bias this pattern is also captured in era5 erai and jra55 although jra55 has too high and widespread negative anomalies compared to the former two on seasonal timescales era5 erai and cfsr show positive anomalies in western and central highland in the three seasons except for jra55 which has a stronger negative and positive anomaly in mam and ond seasons respectively an evaluation of the extreme precipitation in the four reanalysis was also performed fig 7 for this case we focused on the 95th percentile of rainy days for mam jja and ond season during the period 1981 2016 a rainy day represents a day for which the recorded precipitation amount is greater than or equal to 1 mm gudoshava et al 2020 the observed extreme precipitation varied between 60 mm to more than 240 mm across western central highlands and coastal catchments for the rainy seasons mam and ond the observed extreme precipitation during the dry season jja varied between 100 mm and 160 mm across the western catchments only whereas in the rest of the other regions the observed precipitation was less than 60 mm our results show that cfsr and erai show a positive bias for the extreme precipitation across most parts of the country in all the three seasons like results in garibay et al 2021 jra55 has an enhanced negative bias of the extreme precipitation in most parts of the country except for isolated positive bias in the central highlands region in jja and ond season era5 has a positive bias in mam and ond in most parts of the country with some patches of negative bias in the western and central highlands catchments it has an enhanced negative bias in jja season with a positive bias in the western and coastal strip we conclude that era5 outperforms other reanalysis products as it captures the wet extremes over the regions in which observations show enhanced precipitation in the respective seasons the results are consistent with the findings in gleixner et al 2020 which showed both era5 and erai to have the capability to capture wet extremes in the dry seasons with era5 matching more closely to observations than the too wet era interim a promising performance in the era5 to simulate wet extremes can be attributed to improved bias correction method which incorporates aircraft measurements satellite radiances radiosonde measurements and surface pressure probst and mauser 2022 in addition better performance in the central highlands can be attributed to the improved horizontal resolution in era5 which results in better estimates in orographic precipitation 4 1 2 evaluation of the reanalyses as inputs for hydrological modelling 4 1 2 1 assessment of the overall model performance using different reanalysis the performance of the four reanalysis datasets were evaluated using the gr4j model in the 19 catchments for the period spanning 1981 2016 the kge in calibration top panel and validation bottom panel scores obtained using different datasets for each of the catchments are represented in fig 8 overall wetland catchments in the western and highlands of kenya obtained relatively better calibration scores compared to those in the semi arid regions with yala sio nzioa and gucha wetland catchments performing best and perkerra ndo tsavo thiba and tana semi arid catchments performing worst for each of the catchments era5 showed better calibrated kge scores compared to observations while cfsr and jra55 obtained poorer kge scores however we take caution in the interpretation of our results in terms of performance criteria because these catchments have a high influence of human activities such as irrigation schemes and dams as such the low performance in some catchments may not be solely due to uncertainty in the input data the overall variability in gr4j model kge scores across the four reanalyses are shown in figure10 there are overall high performance scores kge 0 5 in calibration mode in about half of the catchments for all datasets except cfsr which suggests problems in using cfsr as hydrological model inputs in the region that cannot be solved or compensated by calibration in fig 9a era5 erai and jra55 show similar overall performance compared to observation the range for the performance statistic is narrower in the era5 erai and jra55 indicating a more stable model performance in the region while is wider in the cfsr data fig 9a in validation mode the performance markedly decreases as expected for all datasets fig 9b erai era5 and jra55 have the highest median kge value just above or about 0 whereas cfsr has the lowest median values kge 0 5 the range of kge values is relatively larger compared to observations thus a relatively unstable prediction ability is expected for streamflow in reanalysis in the region the range of performances is more variable in era5 and jra55 and less variable in erai overall the variability in kge values is highest in validation than in calibration across all the reanalysis compared to observations as expected fig 10 shows the percentage bias of the kge component in each catchment in calibration top panel and in validation bottom panel the bias in all the four reanalysis is higher in calibration whereas in validation most catchments exhibit lower biases except for perkerra 4 1 3 sensitivity analysis results 4 1 3 1 variability in sensitivity of model parameters the gr4j s model maximum and minimum tsis for the four reanalysis datasets is illustrated in fig 11 the maximum and minimum tsis represent the variability of parameter sensitivity within the catchment with respect to kge over the sampling periods and the variation across the four reanalysis relative to observations if the maximum and minimum tsis for a parameter are equal on the one to one line that parameter has the same tsi for the sampling period implying that the parameter is more stable across time and would be expected to vary depending on the catchment characteristics and input data as well in all the four datasets the routing parameter x4 related to the unit hydrograph is evidently the least sensitive as it is way below the threshold followed by the capacity of the routing store x3 whereas the two parameters governing the water balance i e the soil moisture accounting store x1 and the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 are the most sensitive across the datasets in most of the catchments except for cfsr where x1 is less sensitive observations show more stability for the parameters for all catchments except six munyu thiba ndo ewaso ngiro perkerra and tsavo with respect to reanalysis datasets fig 11 in era5 most of the catchments showed stability in parameters except in thiba tsavo large nzioa and ewaso ngiro catchments fig 11b in erai there is high variability in model parameter stability with less stability for some catchments such as thiba munyu mutonga and tsavo catchments fig 11c in jra55 and cfsr figs 11d and 11e respectively the departure in sensitivity of model parameters from the diagonal is pronounced across most of the catchments overall the variability in sensitivity of model parameters is high in thiba munyu pekerra and ewaso ngiro across all the datasets thus we can conclude that the reanalysis datasets are not suitable for model calibration is these catchments of kenya characterized by arid and semi arid conditions however the catchment s water balance may highly be affected by the dams constructed in the upstream areas and the massive irrigation schemes which results in water attenuation 4 1 3 2 overall sensitivity of gr4j model parameters the parameters related to water balance i e the soil moisture accounting store x1 and ground water exchange x2 show higher sensitivity across all the four datasets except for cfsr in which the production accounting store is less sensitive and falls below the threshold value of 0 2 from the model tsis fig 12 the first parameter responsible for water routing x3 is less sensitive for most datasets except cfsr whereas the unit hydrograph parameter x4 is the least sensitive across all the catchments in all datasets in comparison to observations era5 erai and jra55 show similar parameter sensitivities of model parameters while cfsr show distinct higher variability and a difference in the parameters sensitivity which points to high uncertainty in the cfsr dataset this result shows that the sensitivity of the model parameters can change with the input datasets having very different hydrological characteristics 4 1 4 comparison of reanalysis datasets using model suitability index when the sensitivity indices and performance statistics are considered it is difficult to determine which dataset is more appropriate era5 and erai datasets for example had good and clear parameter sensitivities that captured their purposes and the model performance score median values were higher than in cfsr and jra55 however the range of the performance statistics across the catchments was sometimes wider than in the other datasets resulting in higher simulation uncertainty when compared to the other two methods the msi which considers both sensitivity indices and performance statistics has the advantage of being easier and clearer to judge the superiority and inferiority of the datasets in terms of both model performance and parameter identifiability we determined that a value of 0 5 for the msi is a good msi threshold moriasi et al 2007 we give the same weight to model performance and sensitivity as described in the subsection msi thus the threshold value for good msi is 0 5 combining the model performance and sensitivity indices discussed in the preceding subsections fig 13 shows the msis for all the reanalysis datasets the era5 has the highest msi compared to observations across the nineteen catchments followed by the erai reanalysis as a result the era5 and erai reanalysis are appropriate at least for the selected sample of kenyan catchments whereas cfsr and jra55 are least appropriate as they show lower msi values across most of the catchments cfsr shows negative msi values for amala migori mutonga narok ewaso ngiro and sio catchments meaning it is not appropriate for application in these kenyan catchments overall the four reanalysis datasets obtained relatively lower msi values in mara ndo ewasi ngiro and tana garsen catchments these catchments are mainly in arid and semi arid areas of kenya like results in section 5 2 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 overall performance of reanalysis precipitation products in this study we assessed four reanalysis precipitation products relative to observations for the period 1981 2016 on monthly seasonal and annual timescales we also assessed how best they simulate streamflow using the gr4j model and sensitivity analysis for 19 catchments located in distinct geographical and climatic environments results show that the era5 reanalysis outperforms the other reanalysis products on monthly and seasonal scales whereas cfsr outperforms era5 on annual and seasonal timescales in general era5 data were often closer to observations than other reanalysis data which corresponds with earlier research on the datasets in different regions e g betts et al 2019 gleixner et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 even though these studies considered different evaluation period spatiotemporal resolution hydrologic models climates however the performance scores for the reanalysis products over the kenyan catchments were lower which contrasts some of the studies carried out in other parts of the world with varying climates e g dhanya et al 2017 harada et al 2016 mahto et al 2019 wang et al 2019 which obtained higher scores for their study areas the low performance scores may be due to variations in the initial resolution of the datasets chen et al 2018 lemma et al 2019 and the interpolation approach is likely to have some influence on the evaluation of various reanalysis data rapaić et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 it is also worth noting that while the observed precipitation data are the best estimates available they are likely to be subject to errors too beck at al 2017a dinku et al 2019 in addition the seasonality of rainfall over kenya is greatly influenced by weather phenomena such as el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod ayugi et al 2020 ojara et al 2021 onyutha 2016 and play a major role in extreme rainfall events and inter annual variability ongoma et al 2015 for example the warm phase of enso el niño results in unusually heavy rainfall causing rare floods like as the 1997 1998 occurrence takaoka 2005 era5 erai and jra55 picked the enhanced annual precipitation totals of the strong el niño years such as 1997 98 and 2015 however relative to observations era5 and erai underestimated the rainfall and this may be attributed to incorrect configuration in the reanalysis products for example era5 precipitation is not customized to pick up the perturbations caused by the changes in the ocean atmosphere interactions and the mountainous regions and so may miss picking up the extremes caused by events such as enso thus the low performance scores standardized precipitation anomalies in era5 erai and cfsr show a positive anomaly over the central highland and the western parts of kenya fig 6a pan1 and a negative anomaly in arid and semi arid parts in eastern and coastal lowlands in the three seasons mam ond jja except for jra55 which has a stronger negative and positive anomaly in mam and ond seasons respectively this is consistent with study by ongoma et al 2018 which indicates a rise in the severity of severe precipitation events shown by a positive standardized rainfall anomaly over east africa including the mentioned regions in kenya with the changing climate temperatures in the region are projected to rise by the end of the twenty first century leading to an increase in rainfall extreme occurrences ongoma and chen 2017 thus exacerbating flood risk our analysis of the accuracy of precipitation reanalysis with respect to observations over different timescales from monthly to annual showed a positive but relatively small bias in cfsr era5 and erai and a larger negative bias in jra55 in mam and ond seasons moreover the first three reanalysis datasets showed a good average correlation at the monthly and seasonal scales therefore the three reanalysis products have the potential to capture the rainfall seasonality and events in the study area recent worldwide research show that the frequency severity geographical range length and timing of climatic severe events are changing wainwright at al 2021 a rise in rainfall severe events such as very wet days r95p and very wet days r99p anticipated for the future 2021 2100 gudoshava et al 2020 is likely to cause the loss of life and property devastation owing to an increase in flood intensity finney 2020 therefore further work should assess the capacity of the reanalysis datasets in capturing extreme rainfall event characteristics such as timing and daily peaks performance of reanalysis as inputs into a hydrological model using a hydrological model as integrator to compare simulated and observed streamflow which can operate as an independent validation variable is one approach to assess the quality of observation and reanalysis precipitation data each of the reanalysis precipitation and estimated potential evapotranspiration was supplied to the gr4j model which were subsequently calibrated for each combination using consistently precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from the same dataset to independently analyze the quality of input data for each dataset relative to the observed streamflow gauge data streamflow gauges of course are subject to a variety of inaccuracies baldassarre and montanari 2009 but they represent the best available estimates for this study results of kge scores show that era5 is better than erai jra55 and cfsr but on overage all the reanalyses are less skillful relative to observations across the catchments in this study and this is entirely due to the precipitation data quality however there is a marked improvement in the kge scores for the catchments in the central highlands and western wet catchments which agrees with some studies on the datasets in other regions e g tarek et al 2020 essou et al 2017 lakew et al 2020 pointing to the fact that reanalysis data can be used as a replacement for observations there are overall high performance scores kge 0 5 in calibration mode in about half of the catchments for all datasets except cfsr which suggests problems in using cfsr to reproduce the hydrological water balance in the region that cannot be solved or compensated by calibration diro et al 2009 4 2 2 sensitivity analysis of model parameters sensitivity analysis is useful in identification of the parameters that have a strong impact on the model outputs which in turn influences the effectiveness of the model the greater the sensitivity of the model response to a parameter the closer and sooner will that parameter be optimized so a high sensitivity is good such an in depth analysis of a hydrological model may i help to identify any potential deficiencies in model structure and formulation ii provide guidance for model parameterization and iii provide the information content of available input data based on provision of information content of the input data different reanalyses show different sensitivities of model parameters and one that provides a higher sensitivity of model response means that it has less uncertainty and may be a lot easier to parameterize the values but then this in practical sense does not reach the real value and the dataset with low sensitivity has got high uncertainty and model parameterization may be a lot difficult zeng et al 2019 in comparison to observations era5 erai and jra55 show similar parameter sensitivities of model parameters while cfsr show distinct higher variability and a difference in the sensitive parameters which points to high uncertainty in the cfsr dataset this result shows that the sensitivity of the model parameters can change with the input datasets having very different hydrological characteristics overall the variability in sensitivity of model parameters is high in thiba munyu pekerra and ewaso ngiro across all the datasets thus we can conclude that the reanalysis datasets are not suitable for model calibration is these catchments of kenya characterized by arid and semi arid conditions msi considers both model performance and uncertainty quantitatively therefore it can be used to compare any catchment the era5 has the highest msi compared to observations across the nineteen catchments followed by the erai and jra55 whereas cfsr has least msi values msi s dependability may be increased by including more sensitivity indices and performance scores as well as assigning weights to the scores 5 summary and conclusion this study addresses a notable gap that was found in the literature for evaluating the accuracy of multiple precipitation reanalysis datasets across data scarce regions like kenya and for assessing their potential to supplement scarce rain gauge observations for hydrological modelling four different state of the art reanalysis datasets were assessed precipitation data from era5 shows the highest average correlation coefficient value 0 71 on monthly timescale compared to observations and is consistently higher across all months than the other reanalysis erai and cfsr have good average correlation but show larger drops in some months especially in the drier month of august jra55 obtained a poor correlation coefficient of 0 46 on average era5 erai and cfsr show higher correlations to observations in rainy months march april may and october november december and lower in the dry months june july august whereas jra55 shows worst correlations during both rainy seasons on annual timescales cfsr erai and era5 showed better cc indices of 0 60 0 46 0 52 respectively whereas jra obtained lower cc of 0 25 era5 and jra55 show a positive bias of 45 and 171 respectively whereas erai and cfsr show negative bias of 26 and 85 spatial rainfall patterns directly affect temporal distribution key in driving runoff and soil erosion processes which is useful in management of hydrological risks and generation of sediments from rainwater monthly standardised anomaly maps in era5 erai and jra55 showed a positive anomaly over the central highland and western parts in the arid and semi arid parts in the eastern and coastal lowlands parts of kenya the three datasets showed enhanced negative anomaly on seasonal timescales era5 erai and cfsr show positive anomalies in western and central highland in the three seasons except for jra55 which has a stronger negative and positive anomaly in mam and ond seasons respectively extreme precipitation showed a positive bias in cfsr era5 and erai in mam and ond seasons whereas jra55 has enhanced negative bias in most parts of the country except for isolated positive bias in the central highlands region in jja and ond seasons the performance of gr4j model when forced with different reanalysis in the 19 catchments reveals a bigger role of localized catchment characteristics and process in model calibration wetland catchments in the western and highlands of kenya obtained relatively better calibration scores compared to those in the semi arid regions with yala sio nzioa and gucha wetland catchments performing best and perkerra ndo tsavo thiba and tana semi arid catchments performing worst for each of the catchments era5 showed better calibrated kge scores compared to observations while cfsr and jra55 obtained poorer kge scores the range of kge values was relatively larger compared to observations thus a relatively unstable prediction ability is expected for streamflow in reanalysis for kenyan catchments the range of performances is more variable in era5 and jra55 and less variable in erai overall the variability in kge values is highest in validation than in calibration across all the reanalysis compared to observations as expected sensitivity analysis allows the reduction of parameters incorporated in optimization by determining the convergence most influential model parameters sensitivity analysis revealed that in all the four datasets the routing parameter x4 related to the unit hydrograph was evidently the least sensitive followed by the capacity of the routing store x3 whereas the two parameters governing the water balance i e the soil moisture accounting store x1 and the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 are the most sensitive across the datasets in most of the catchments except for cfsr where x1 was less sensitive with era5 showing a highest sensitivity in the model parameters however the variability in sensitivity of model parameters was high in thiba munyu pekerra and ewaso ngiro across all the datasets thus we conclude that model calibration in arid and semi arid catchments of kenya does not yield skillful results using the reanalysis data the msi aggregates both sensitivity indices performance statistics providing a clear index to judge the superiority or inferiority of a reanalysis with respect to observations on average era5 erai jra55 have better msi scores across most of the kenyan catchments erai era5 perform better than jra55 cfsr and lead to more robust model parameters using a catchment model and combined sensitivity model performance analysis allows an evaluation of the impact of the variability in the rainfall products throughout the catchment modelling process in conclusion in this study we have demonstrated the usefulness of reanalysis rainfall products as potential alternatives for hydrological applications in kenya we assessed the suitability of reanalysis precipitation datasets for hydrological modelling across kenyan catchments but first assessed the propagation of errors when reanalysis is compared to observations we performed the assessment on monthly seasonal and annual timescales then using a lumped bucket style hydrological model we assessed the model performance via the kge criterion and parameter uncertainty via sobol s sensitivity analysis for four different reanalyses era5 erai jra55 and cfsr across 19 catchments the parametric and model input uncertainty is investigated using the sensitivity indices and the comprehensive model performance analysis is used to examine the model s input strength i e the amount to which the model captures the dynamics of rainfall runoff processes with respect to different forcing we also coupled the results of the performance scores and sensitivity indices to compute msi for the 19 catchments we acknowledge the value and need of additional work if reliable data at higher temporal frequency becomes available and can be used as it contains more information however this is a big limitation for the current study due to high data gaps in the daily data river discharge data used in the current study and the lack of higher temporal resolution hydrological data future work should concentrate on assessing the sub daily performance of hydrological modelling with reanalysis testing its quality on other additional catchments in countries in the region with quality observed gauge data but prior investments in data collection in kenya seem to be needed our approach may be extended to various conceptual rainfall runoff models as well as physically based distributed rainfall runoff models the msi analysis is a practical method for weeding out the appropriate model input on a catchment scale basis however a more robust analysis where weights are assigned would yield some improvements in the results to fully ascertain the potential of alternative model forcing catchments characteristics and human influence such as dams and reservoirs should be modeled finally it is essential to note that this work does not promote the use of products such as reanalysis to replace observed data from weather stations nor can it be understood as giving reason to continue the present trend of retiring additional stations quality controlled ground observations still act as the best data for research the era5 results demonstrate that atmospheric reanalysis has likely reached the stage where they can consistently supplement data from weather stations and offer trustworthy proxies in places with less dense station networks at least across kenya overall reanalysis can be a viable alternative to observations in ungauged catchments but the associated uncertainties need to be carefully communicated for informed choice of hydrological modelling tools

7992,study region 19 flood prone catchments in kenya eastern africa study focus flooding is a major natural hazard especially in developing countries and the need for timely reliable and actionable hydrological forecasts is paramount hydrological modelling is essential to produce forecasts but is a challenging task especially in poorly gauged catchments because of the inadequate temporal and spatial coverage of hydro meteorological observations open access global meteorological reanalysis datasets can fill in this gap however they have significant errors this study assesses the performance of four reanalysis datasets era5 era interim cfsr and jra55 over kenya for the period 1981 2016 on daily monthly seasonal and annual timescales we firstly evaluate the reanalysis datasets by comparing them against observations from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station secondly we evaluate the ability of these reanalysis datasets to simulate streamflow using gr4j model considering both model performance and parameters sensitivity and identifiability new hydrological insights for the region while era5 is the best performing dataset overall performance varies by season and catchment and therefore there are marked differences in the suitability of reanalysis products for forcing hydrological models overall wetland catchments in the western regions and highlands of kenya obtained relatively better scores compared to those in the semi arid regions this can inform future applications of reanalysis products for setting up hydrological models that can be used for flood forecasting early warning and early action in data scarce regions such as kenya graphical abstract ga1 key words reanalysis data kenyan catchments model calibration model performance sensitivity analysis model suitability index 1 introduction precipitation is arguably the most important driver of catchment hydrological response e g macleod et al 2021 but it is challenging to get accurate information on the amount duration and intensity of rainfall events beck et al 2017a tapiador et al 2012 due to the high spatio temporal variability nicholson et al 2019 vischel et al 2011 this is compounded by a low spatial coverage and a net decline in the number of ground gauge stations in the historical climatological observation network especially in developing countries such as kenya menne et al 2018 tarek et al 2020 2021 zaitchik et al 2011 unreliable or incomplete datasets are unable to correctly identify seasonal or short range temporal patterns e g gosset et al 2013 le et al 2017 other sources of precipitation data such as those from satellite remote sensing are now available but they come with their own errors including random and systematic see beck et al 2021 beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b fortin et al 2015 sun et al 2018 another freely available source of precipitation data are meteorological reanalysis products which are becoming increasingly promising due to upgrades in their spatial resolution and improved representation of atmospheric processes in global models hersbach 2018 reanalysis data combine a wide range of remotely sensed observations with a dynamical physical coupled numerical model to produce the best estimate of the state of the atmosphere reanalysis is not reliant on the density of surface observational networks and can give surface variables in locations with little to no surface coverage as a result they can generate several variables both at the land surface and on vertical atmospheric levels and hence have been applied in several studies both for climatological and hydrological purposes across the world e g beck et al 2017a chen et al 2018 emerton et al 2017 essou et al 2017 several different reanalysis products exist but they are known to vary in quality with recurrent upgrades it is important to evaluate them carefully both to inform the users and the developers of the datasets the developers of these products can only work on improving their updates when there is a complete feedback loop between applications and developments therefore ground validation of reanalysis precipitation is very important but very challenging particularly where the rain gauge networks are sparse several studies attempt to quantify and account for the sampling errors comparing reanalysis data with observations in different parts of the world e g guo et al 2018 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zaitchik et al 2011 at a global scale beck et al 2017a 2017b at regional or basin scale e g acharya et al 2019 nkiaka et al 2017 tarek et al 2020 and at a national scale e g arshad et al 2021 gleixner et al 2020 koukoula et al 2020 lakew et al 2020 shayeghi et al 2020 tesfaye et al 2017 however the findings of these studies were mixed differences in approaches regions and time scales resulted in inconsistency in product performance implying that site specific performance evaluation may be required existing studies also aimed at analysing a single product or a few products for short periods of time thus their estimated errors may not reflect long term behaviour additionally the temporal dynamics of rainfall are very important as they play an important role in the total accumulated rainfall on daily and monthly timescales ficchì et al 2016 thus influencing the bimodal seasonality observed over kenya also the highly variable temporal dynamics are key in explaining the nonlinear nature of infiltration process blöschl and sivapalan 1995 such as the peak discharge value gabellani et al 2007 and runoff volume viglione et al 2010 in hydrological modelling thus the above highlights the need to consider different temporal scales when evaluating the reanalysis precipitation relative to observation in kenya there were 20 major floods from 1964 to 2020 which were driven by precipitation falling in the seasonal rains more than 160 000 people were displaced countrywide by floods in october 2019 reliefweb 2019a 2019b opere 2013 annual average economic loss from flooding is estimated to be 5 5 of gross domestic product njogu 2021 thus understanding the best representation of precipitation in flood models which can be used for forecasting or risk analysis is of great societal importance kenya has a widely varying physical geography resulting in great variability of river catchment characteristics across the country thus it is essential not only to understand the representation of precipitation at a country scale but also on a catchment by catchment basis golian et al 2021 meresa et al 2021 previous evaluation of reanalysis products in capturing kenyan rainfall show varied levels of agreement in spatio temporal variability relative to observations e g alemayehu et al 2018 dile and srinivasan 2014 gleixner et al 2020 khan et al 2011 moreover studies employing hydrological modelling generally used discharge observations from a small number of catchments e g alemayehu et al 2018 bitew et al 2012 langat et al 2017 le et al 2017 worqlul et al 2017 and did not quantify uncertainties associated with each reanalysis e g alemayehu et al 2018 leading to combined rainfall and model uncertainty that is not easily interpreted hence there is a notable gap in the literature associated with evaluating the accuracy of multiple reanalysis products across different catchments accounting for both model and input errors especially in data scarce regions like in kenya and this gap was an important motivation for the present study this paper evaluates four reanalysis precipitation products with respect to observations and assesses their suitability for use in hydrological modelling in 19 kenyan catchments we assess their performance in reproducing the most important features of rainfall events and regimes and in simulating catchment streamflow through answering the following research questions how well do the precipitation datasets compare in terms of temporal dynamics at the basin scale which product is the most accurate compared to observations how well do precipitation datasets compare in terms of spatial patterns which product shows consistency in spatial heterogeneity compared to observations how does the general hydrological model performance vary with different datasets how does the sensitivity of a rainfall runoff model gr4j vary with alternative rainfall forcing we consider both model performance and parameter uncertainty and compute a model suitability index msi by coupling the results of model performance statistics and global sensitivity analysis we compare four reanalysis datasets using the gr4j model across 19 kenyan catchments with varied climate and morphological characteristics to investigate which input data is suitable or require caution when used in the place of observation dataset in different regions this work is a steppingstone and an essential guide for hydrological applications of global reanalysis datasets because it compares several reanalysis products to observations on daily monthly and seasonal scales and unveils the propagation of uncertainty from different reanalysis when used as model inputs all the above reviewed studies looked at the performance of at most one reanalysis dataset in simulating streamflow and only over one catchment but none looked at such a country scale performance to our knowledge this is the very first evaluation of the different reanalysis products over kenya for simulating streamflow coupled with sensitivity analysis 2 study area and catchment characteristics the study is undertaken in 19 kenyan catchments fig 1 with varying characteristics table 1 these were selected due to the frequency and magnitude of the impacts of floods as well as the availability of river flow observations table 1 kenya mainly experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern occurring in the seasons of march april may mam and october november december ond ayugi et al 2016 yang et al 2015 which are commonly known as the long and short rains respectively the rainfall seasonality and the migration of the precipitation zone is mainly influenced by the north south movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz black et al 2003 ongoma et al 2015 the rainfall season migrates northward at a slower rate than it migrates southward hence the two different names long rains and short rains respectively nyenzi 1988 the rainfall exhibits high spatiotemporal and interannual variability ongoma and chen 2017 and is strongly influenced by perturbations in global sea surface temperature ssts especially in the pacific and indian oceans with the el niño southern oscillation enso black et al 2003 ogallo 1993 and the indian ocean dipole iod blau et al 2020 owiti et al 2008 being the most important modes other systems that influence rainfall variability include the high pressure systems e g the mascarene and the arabian ogwang et al 2015 the quasi biennial oscillation qbo collier et al 2016 indeje and semazzi 2000 the madden julian oscillation mjo kilavi et al 2018 tropical cyclones finney et al 2020 wainwright et al 2021 and jet streams eg the turkana jet hartman 2018 kinuthia 1992 the country has complex topography with the lowest altitudes along the coastline and lake victoria basin which are particularly prone to floods while in the highlands frequent thunderstorms and lightning threaten life 3 data and methodology 3 1 datasets 3 1 1 reanalysis and observational data four reanalysis products namely era5 era interim hereafter erai climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 and a gridded observational dataset the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps were used in this study see table 2 we used the daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature variables from the reanalysis products for the study era5 is the latest global atmospheric reanalysis product from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf which spans the modern observing period from 1950 onward hersbach 2018 in this study 3 hourly era5 was obtained from ecmwf on a fixed grid of 0 31 0 31 erai is the previous global reanalysis product created by ecmwf dee et al 2011 daily erai was obtained from ecmwf on a fixed grid of 0 75 0 75 jra55 is a global reanalysis dataset constructed by the japan meteorological agency jma kobayashi et al 2015 daily jra55 was obtained from national center for atmospheric research ncar climate data guide at a fixed gird of 0 56 0 56 cfsr is a global reanalysis dataset of atmosphere fields produced by the national centers for environmental prediction and for atmospheric research ncep ncar saha et al 2010 the chirps dataset was used as a benchmark observation dataset since it has been used in several studies showing good results compared to observations over eastern africa dinku et al 2018 chirps is a quasi global high resolution daily pentad and monthly precipitation dataset funk et al 2015 based on infrared cold cloud duration ccd data chirps has a long enough history of precipitation data the algorithm is based on i a 5 km climatology that uses satellite data to represent sparsely gauged locations ii includes daily pentadal and monthly 5 km ccd based precipitation estimates from 1981 to the present iii combines station data to generate tentative information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks and iv interpolation weights are assigned based on a novel blending method which uses the spatial correlation structure of ccd estimates this makes it comparatively an alternative in data scarce regions we opted for the gridded observations as the daily observed gauge datasets were not available for the catchments of study and are known to be very sparse and present large data gaps dinku et al 2019 2018 le et al 2017 3 1 2 observed river discharge and potential evapotranspiration river discharge datasets at daily time step for the period 1981 2016 were provided by the kenya water resource authority wra for the selected catchments across the country summarized in table 2 the potential evapotranspiration pet required for the catchment modelling was estimated from the average daily temperature of the four reanalysis products and chirts daily data from the climate hazard centre chc as temperature readings were the readily available meteorological data that relates to pet for this study temperature based methods were used to estimate the pet hargreaves and samani 1985 for this study the hamon method hamon 1960 was used to estimate pet daily averages for different datasets 3 2 modelling experiment methodology to obtain the monthly and annual totals for observations and reanalysis datasets the daily values were accumulated the seasonal total precipitation was calculated by summing monthly precipitation for three seasons i the march april may hereafter referred to as mam ii the june july august hereafter jja and iii the october november december hereafter ond all datasets were converted to the same units for consistency e g jra55 and cfsr were converted from kg m2 s to mm d era5 erai jra 55 and cfsr were regridded by first order conservative interpolations to a horizontal grid of 0 5o x 0 5o schulzweida 2019 we first qualitatively evaluate the performance statistics of the reanalysis datasets in terms of temporal dynamics and biases with respect to precipitation observations chirps considering the following metrics pearson linear correlation coefficient cc mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean error me long term relative bias bias and annual number of dry days calculated on monthly annual and seasonal scales we produce spatial maps for the standardized precipitation anomalies bias and annual number of dry days to assess their consistency compared to observations and tabulate the other statistics to show the aggregate performance across the different datasets second we calibrate the gr4j perrin et al 2003 rainfall runoff model in the study we used five different inputs sources for both precipitation and pet into gr4j model from chirps era5 erai cfsr and jra55 we calibrate the model with each of the input source at a time and compute the kge score and compare how this varies across the four different datasets relative to observations the gr4j model is a simple daily lumped rainfall runoff model belonging to the family of soil moisture accounting models there are four main parameters fig 2 to be calibrated in gr4j model namely 1 the maximum capacity of the production store x1 mm 2 the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 mm 3 the maximum capacity of the non linear routing store x3 mm and 4 the time base of the unit hydrograph x4 days there are also a few fixed parameters whose values were set by perrin et al 2003 all four free parameters are real numbers x1 and x3 are positive x4 is greater than 0 5 and x2 can be either positive zero or negative the typical inputs of gr4j are the areal precipitation depth p mm and the potential evapotranspiration pe mm estimate over the catchment most optimization algorithms used to calibrate the model parameters require knowledge of an initial parameter set given the small number of model parameters simple optimization algorithms are generally capable of identifying parameter values yielding satisfactory results the choice of an objective function depends on the objectives of model user the choice and use of the gr4j model is mainly due to its simple and relatively quick to calibrate structure ensuring high levels of performance and robustness ficchì et al 2019 mostafaie et al 2018 oudin et al 2004 van esse et al 2013 pushpalatha et al 2011 the four free parameters of the gr4j model were calibrated using the default optimisation algorithm provided in the airgr package coron et al 2019 delaigue et al 2019 this simple optimization algorithm mainly based on a local optimisation proved to be equally efficient to locate a robust optimum compared to more complex global search algorithms coron et al 2019 and proved effective in terms of the number of model runs required for convergence mathevet et al 2006 the michel method michel 1983 is based on two steps i a systematic inspection of the global parameter space is performed to determine the most likely zone of convergence in our study this is done by direct grid screening ii a steepest descent local search procedure is carried out to find an estimate of the optimum parameter set starting from the best parameter set from step 1 the four free model parameters were calibrated by applying the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as the objective function and the daily observed river discharge data of the selected catchments as reference we use different inputs precipitation datasets from chirps era5 erai cfsr and jra55 to calibrate the gr4j model the kge was used also for evaluating the performance of the gr4j model when forced with different reanalysis data the kge objective function represents a weighting of three components that correspond to bias correlation and variability ensuring that kge is sensitive to errors in the overall distribution of streamflow adeyeri et al 2020 kling et al 2012 we therefore calculated the hydrological model performance statistics for the calibration and validation periods and compared across the different reanalysis datasets to investigate the overall suitability of the different reanalysis as input data to simulate river flows we adopted a threshold of model performance in the range 0 41 kge 1 as reasonable following knoben et al 2019 being 0 41 the kge value corresponding to a mean flow benchmark a split sample validation technique klemeš 1986 was used to test model performance beyond the calibration period for this study 36 years 1981 2016 of streamflow data for each catchment were available so we split into two equal 18 year split sample testing sst periods hereafter referred to as sst1 and sst2 third we perform sensitivity analysis by applying the global sobol sensitivity method for the gr4j model parameters using the kge as our target function and the daily observed data of the 19 catchments as reference we adopt the sobol method because it estimates the relative contribution of individual model parameters and their interactions through the decomposition of model output variance nossent et al 2011 a sensitivity analysis allows a reduction of the number of parameters incorporated in the optimization by determining the most influential parameters of a model and their identifiability saltelli et al 2000 as no prior information is available on the parameters the input parameter values for the sensitivity analysis are sampled from a uniform distribution nossent et al 2011 the different parameter ranges are scaled between 0 and 1 with a linear transformation then we obtain one value of the sensitivity indices si per parameter and we investigate the relative role of each parameter in explaining the output variance and assess possible over parameterization issues by counting the number of sensitive parameters the value of the objective function for the calibration of parameters can be used as the model performance statistics for sensitivity analysis as such we adopted the kge last we assess the overall suitability of the rainfall runoff model when forced with different meteorological inputs by calculating the model suitability index msi we compare the performance of the four reanalysis datasets across the 19 catchments and investigate which of the input dataset is suitable and which require caution because of low model performance and possible parameter identifiability or over parameterization problems the well known problem of over parameterisation due to insensitive parameters in models with large number of parameters van griensven et al 2006 makes sensitivity and performance statistics important this may result in uncertain model simulations arising from equifinality in model calibration but yielding unequifinal model simulations in validation beven 2012 this mostly arises due to application of calibrated multiple optimal parameters sets with significantly variable parameter values shin et al 2015 shin and kim 2017 therefore in most cases the problem arising from prediction uncertainty may pose problems to modellers when it comes to decision making by applying the quantitative method of sobol s sa this enabled us to couple the results with the performance statistics the msi aggregates both sensitivity indices performance statistics shin and kim 2017 providing a clear index to judge the relative global performance of the reanalysis products with respect to observations the computed msi can be used in comparison studies with any catchment data if all the model parameters are sensitive this would yield a msi of 1 and a perfectly matched hydrograph between the simulations and observations we adapt shin and kim 2017 model suitability index msi which is a combined measure of performance statistics and sensitivity analysis results the msi can be expressed as 1 m s i 0 5 1 n i 1 n s r i 0 5 1 m j 1 m p s j where the sr is the sensitivity ratio i e the ratio of the number of sensitive parameters out of the total number of model parameters ranging from 0 1 and ps is the performance statistics n is the number of years over which the sensitivity analysis is run and m is the number of split sample periods in model calibration it is necessary to set a sensitivity threshold to ascertain the sensitive parameters hence we adopted a minimum value of 0 2 for the tsi of a sensitive parameter this value has been suggested and used in some past studies e g van werkhoven 2009 van werkhoven et al 2009 shin et al 2013 it is worth noting that this is an arbitrary value thus we acknowledge the need to practice caution when the parameters tsi values are nearing the threshold ps is computed by obtaining the average value of all the periods considered i e two split sample periods to calculate the average ps we considered the calibration and validation performance statistics kge as both measures are equally important we gave the same averaged weight to ps and sr in calculating the msi 4 results and discussion 4 1 results 4 1 1 overall performance evaluation using observations the performance of era5 erai jra55 and cfsr on monthly seasonal and annual scales is presented in this section we used the monthly scale as a base time scale and calculated cc rmse mae and me for all the four reanalysis products 4 1 1 1 performance on monthly scale era5 erai jra55 and cfsr were first evaluated on a monthly timescale with respect to observations at the country level all the datasets passed the significance test of the correlation coefficient at the 99 confidence level and to eliminate the influence of the seasonal cycle on the values each correlation coefficient was calculated per month as shown in fig 3 era5 shows the highest average correlation coefficient value of 0 71 on monthly timescale compared to observations and is consistently higher across all months fig 3 and table 3 than the other reanalysis products erai and cfsr have good average correlation but show larger drops in some months especially in the drier month of august jra55 obtained a poor correlation coefficient of 0 46 on average in general era5 erai and cfsr show higher correlations to observations in rainy months march april may and october november december and lower in the dry months june july august whereas jra55 shows worst correlations during both rainy seasons the average twelve months evaluation indices for each of the reanalysis product is shown in table 3 overall era5 erai and cfsr show a similar good ability to simulate the precipitation for all the indices under consideration era5 has a better cc bias and rmse whereas jra55 has the lowest cc and the largest bias and rmse suggesting that jra55 is worst performing reanalysis dataset over the kenyan catchments 4 1 1 2 performance on seasonal and annual timescales the overall performance of the four reanalyses era5 erai cfsr and jra55 were evaluated on seasonal and annual timescales to explain the propagation of errors at these timescales the results of the different performance indices are shown in table 4 the overall correlation coefficients on seasonal and annual timescale are shown in fig 4 higher cc across all the datasets were obtained in the wet seasons of mam and ond whereas lower cc were obtained in the dry season of jja with the performance index higher in ond than in mam era5 obtained the highest cc 0 88 in mam whereas cfsr the highest 0 84 in ond jra55 showed lower cc of 0 34 and 0 44 in the two seasons respectively and a cc of 0 52 in the dry season depicting a tendency of a wet bias over the dry months on average the variability in the cc index across the four datasets was relatively lower in the ond season and higher in the mam season the bias across the four datasets was lower in the dry season jja and higher in the wet seasons mam ond with jra55 showing a higher positive bias across all the seasons there are large values in the rmse and the mae across the four datasets in the two wet seasons and this may be linked to the high precipitation concentrations during those seasons across most of the catchments generally it can be noted that jra55 shows the worst performance in comparison to observation especially in the wet seasons of mam and ond but obtained relatively better scores in the dry season of jja era5 shows better agreement with observations across the three seasons thus may be an appropriate option for simulating precipitation over the kenyan catchments on annual timescale the average annual precipitation of cfsr era5 erai and jra55 was computed and compared with the observation chirps fig 5 era5 erai and cfsr show similar trend compared to observations across all the years with cfsr and erai underestimating the precipitation jra55 shows a higher tendency of overestimating the annual precipitation over the study catchments in terms of the performance indices cfsr erai and era5 showed better cc indices of 0 60 0 46 0 52 respectively whereas jra obtained lower cc of 0 25 fig 4 the variability in the cc was higher in jra55 fig 4 era5 and jra55 show a positive bias of 45 and 171 respectively whereas erai and cfsr show negative bias of 26 and 85 era5 has a lower rmse and me whereas jra55 has the highest these results show that era5 is the best performing reanalysis dataset compared to observations on annual timescales whereas jra55 is the worst performing the mean monthly and seasonal standardized precipitation anomalies in the four reanalysis precipitation for a base climatological period 1981 2016 is shown in fig 6 on monthly timescale the observations show a positive anomaly over the central highland and the western parts of kenya fig 6 pan1 the arid and semi arid parts in the eastern and coastal lowlands show a negative anomaly dry bias this pattern is also captured in era5 erai and jra55 although jra55 has too high and widespread negative anomalies compared to the former two on seasonal timescales era5 erai and cfsr show positive anomalies in western and central highland in the three seasons except for jra55 which has a stronger negative and positive anomaly in mam and ond seasons respectively an evaluation of the extreme precipitation in the four reanalysis was also performed fig 7 for this case we focused on the 95th percentile of rainy days for mam jja and ond season during the period 1981 2016 a rainy day represents a day for which the recorded precipitation amount is greater than or equal to 1 mm gudoshava et al 2020 the observed extreme precipitation varied between 60 mm to more than 240 mm across western central highlands and coastal catchments for the rainy seasons mam and ond the observed extreme precipitation during the dry season jja varied between 100 mm and 160 mm across the western catchments only whereas in the rest of the other regions the observed precipitation was less than 60 mm our results show that cfsr and erai show a positive bias for the extreme precipitation across most parts of the country in all the three seasons like results in garibay et al 2021 jra55 has an enhanced negative bias of the extreme precipitation in most parts of the country except for isolated positive bias in the central highlands region in jja and ond season era5 has a positive bias in mam and ond in most parts of the country with some patches of negative bias in the western and central highlands catchments it has an enhanced negative bias in jja season with a positive bias in the western and coastal strip we conclude that era5 outperforms other reanalysis products as it captures the wet extremes over the regions in which observations show enhanced precipitation in the respective seasons the results are consistent with the findings in gleixner et al 2020 which showed both era5 and erai to have the capability to capture wet extremes in the dry seasons with era5 matching more closely to observations than the too wet era interim a promising performance in the era5 to simulate wet extremes can be attributed to improved bias correction method which incorporates aircraft measurements satellite radiances radiosonde measurements and surface pressure probst and mauser 2022 in addition better performance in the central highlands can be attributed to the improved horizontal resolution in era5 which results in better estimates in orographic precipitation 4 1 2 evaluation of the reanalyses as inputs for hydrological modelling 4 1 2 1 assessment of the overall model performance using different reanalysis the performance of the four reanalysis datasets were evaluated using the gr4j model in the 19 catchments for the period spanning 1981 2016 the kge in calibration top panel and validation bottom panel scores obtained using different datasets for each of the catchments are represented in fig 8 overall wetland catchments in the western and highlands of kenya obtained relatively better calibration scores compared to those in the semi arid regions with yala sio nzioa and gucha wetland catchments performing best and perkerra ndo tsavo thiba and tana semi arid catchments performing worst for each of the catchments era5 showed better calibrated kge scores compared to observations while cfsr and jra55 obtained poorer kge scores however we take caution in the interpretation of our results in terms of performance criteria because these catchments have a high influence of human activities such as irrigation schemes and dams as such the low performance in some catchments may not be solely due to uncertainty in the input data the overall variability in gr4j model kge scores across the four reanalyses are shown in figure10 there are overall high performance scores kge 0 5 in calibration mode in about half of the catchments for all datasets except cfsr which suggests problems in using cfsr as hydrological model inputs in the region that cannot be solved or compensated by calibration in fig 9a era5 erai and jra55 show similar overall performance compared to observation the range for the performance statistic is narrower in the era5 erai and jra55 indicating a more stable model performance in the region while is wider in the cfsr data fig 9a in validation mode the performance markedly decreases as expected for all datasets fig 9b erai era5 and jra55 have the highest median kge value just above or about 0 whereas cfsr has the lowest median values kge 0 5 the range of kge values is relatively larger compared to observations thus a relatively unstable prediction ability is expected for streamflow in reanalysis in the region the range of performances is more variable in era5 and jra55 and less variable in erai overall the variability in kge values is highest in validation than in calibration across all the reanalysis compared to observations as expected fig 10 shows the percentage bias of the kge component in each catchment in calibration top panel and in validation bottom panel the bias in all the four reanalysis is higher in calibration whereas in validation most catchments exhibit lower biases except for perkerra 4 1 3 sensitivity analysis results 4 1 3 1 variability in sensitivity of model parameters the gr4j s model maximum and minimum tsis for the four reanalysis datasets is illustrated in fig 11 the maximum and minimum tsis represent the variability of parameter sensitivity within the catchment with respect to kge over the sampling periods and the variation across the four reanalysis relative to observations if the maximum and minimum tsis for a parameter are equal on the one to one line that parameter has the same tsi for the sampling period implying that the parameter is more stable across time and would be expected to vary depending on the catchment characteristics and input data as well in all the four datasets the routing parameter x4 related to the unit hydrograph is evidently the least sensitive as it is way below the threshold followed by the capacity of the routing store x3 whereas the two parameters governing the water balance i e the soil moisture accounting store x1 and the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 are the most sensitive across the datasets in most of the catchments except for cfsr where x1 is less sensitive observations show more stability for the parameters for all catchments except six munyu thiba ndo ewaso ngiro perkerra and tsavo with respect to reanalysis datasets fig 11 in era5 most of the catchments showed stability in parameters except in thiba tsavo large nzioa and ewaso ngiro catchments fig 11b in erai there is high variability in model parameter stability with less stability for some catchments such as thiba munyu mutonga and tsavo catchments fig 11c in jra55 and cfsr figs 11d and 11e respectively the departure in sensitivity of model parameters from the diagonal is pronounced across most of the catchments overall the variability in sensitivity of model parameters is high in thiba munyu pekerra and ewaso ngiro across all the datasets thus we can conclude that the reanalysis datasets are not suitable for model calibration is these catchments of kenya characterized by arid and semi arid conditions however the catchment s water balance may highly be affected by the dams constructed in the upstream areas and the massive irrigation schemes which results in water attenuation 4 1 3 2 overall sensitivity of gr4j model parameters the parameters related to water balance i e the soil moisture accounting store x1 and ground water exchange x2 show higher sensitivity across all the four datasets except for cfsr in which the production accounting store is less sensitive and falls below the threshold value of 0 2 from the model tsis fig 12 the first parameter responsible for water routing x3 is less sensitive for most datasets except cfsr whereas the unit hydrograph parameter x4 is the least sensitive across all the catchments in all datasets in comparison to observations era5 erai and jra55 show similar parameter sensitivities of model parameters while cfsr show distinct higher variability and a difference in the parameters sensitivity which points to high uncertainty in the cfsr dataset this result shows that the sensitivity of the model parameters can change with the input datasets having very different hydrological characteristics 4 1 4 comparison of reanalysis datasets using model suitability index when the sensitivity indices and performance statistics are considered it is difficult to determine which dataset is more appropriate era5 and erai datasets for example had good and clear parameter sensitivities that captured their purposes and the model performance score median values were higher than in cfsr and jra55 however the range of the performance statistics across the catchments was sometimes wider than in the other datasets resulting in higher simulation uncertainty when compared to the other two methods the msi which considers both sensitivity indices and performance statistics has the advantage of being easier and clearer to judge the superiority and inferiority of the datasets in terms of both model performance and parameter identifiability we determined that a value of 0 5 for the msi is a good msi threshold moriasi et al 2007 we give the same weight to model performance and sensitivity as described in the subsection msi thus the threshold value for good msi is 0 5 combining the model performance and sensitivity indices discussed in the preceding subsections fig 13 shows the msis for all the reanalysis datasets the era5 has the highest msi compared to observations across the nineteen catchments followed by the erai reanalysis as a result the era5 and erai reanalysis are appropriate at least for the selected sample of kenyan catchments whereas cfsr and jra55 are least appropriate as they show lower msi values across most of the catchments cfsr shows negative msi values for amala migori mutonga narok ewaso ngiro and sio catchments meaning it is not appropriate for application in these kenyan catchments overall the four reanalysis datasets obtained relatively lower msi values in mara ndo ewasi ngiro and tana garsen catchments these catchments are mainly in arid and semi arid areas of kenya like results in section 5 2 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 overall performance of reanalysis precipitation products in this study we assessed four reanalysis precipitation products relative to observations for the period 1981 2016 on monthly seasonal and annual timescales we also assessed how best they simulate streamflow using the gr4j model and sensitivity analysis for 19 catchments located in distinct geographical and climatic environments results show that the era5 reanalysis outperforms the other reanalysis products on monthly and seasonal scales whereas cfsr outperforms era5 on annual and seasonal timescales in general era5 data were often closer to observations than other reanalysis data which corresponds with earlier research on the datasets in different regions e g betts et al 2019 gleixner et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 even though these studies considered different evaluation period spatiotemporal resolution hydrologic models climates however the performance scores for the reanalysis products over the kenyan catchments were lower which contrasts some of the studies carried out in other parts of the world with varying climates e g dhanya et al 2017 harada et al 2016 mahto et al 2019 wang et al 2019 which obtained higher scores for their study areas the low performance scores may be due to variations in the initial resolution of the datasets chen et al 2018 lemma et al 2019 and the interpolation approach is likely to have some influence on the evaluation of various reanalysis data rapaić et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 it is also worth noting that while the observed precipitation data are the best estimates available they are likely to be subject to errors too beck at al 2017a dinku et al 2019 in addition the seasonality of rainfall over kenya is greatly influenced by weather phenomena such as el niño southern oscillation enso and indian ocean dipole iod ayugi et al 2020 ojara et al 2021 onyutha 2016 and play a major role in extreme rainfall events and inter annual variability ongoma et al 2015 for example the warm phase of enso el niño results in unusually heavy rainfall causing rare floods like as the 1997 1998 occurrence takaoka 2005 era5 erai and jra55 picked the enhanced annual precipitation totals of the strong el niño years such as 1997 98 and 2015 however relative to observations era5 and erai underestimated the rainfall and this may be attributed to incorrect configuration in the reanalysis products for example era5 precipitation is not customized to pick up the perturbations caused by the changes in the ocean atmosphere interactions and the mountainous regions and so may miss picking up the extremes caused by events such as enso thus the low performance scores standardized precipitation anomalies in era5 erai and cfsr show a positive anomaly over the central highland and the western parts of kenya fig 6a pan1 and a negative anomaly in arid and semi arid parts in eastern and coastal lowlands in the three seasons mam ond jja except for jra55 which has a stronger negative and positive anomaly in mam and ond seasons respectively this is consistent with study by ongoma et al 2018 which indicates a rise in the severity of severe precipitation events shown by a positive standardized rainfall anomaly over east africa including the mentioned regions in kenya with the changing climate temperatures in the region are projected to rise by the end of the twenty first century leading to an increase in rainfall extreme occurrences ongoma and chen 2017 thus exacerbating flood risk our analysis of the accuracy of precipitation reanalysis with respect to observations over different timescales from monthly to annual showed a positive but relatively small bias in cfsr era5 and erai and a larger negative bias in jra55 in mam and ond seasons moreover the first three reanalysis datasets showed a good average correlation at the monthly and seasonal scales therefore the three reanalysis products have the potential to capture the rainfall seasonality and events in the study area recent worldwide research show that the frequency severity geographical range length and timing of climatic severe events are changing wainwright at al 2021 a rise in rainfall severe events such as very wet days r95p and very wet days r99p anticipated for the future 2021 2100 gudoshava et al 2020 is likely to cause the loss of life and property devastation owing to an increase in flood intensity finney 2020 therefore further work should assess the capacity of the reanalysis datasets in capturing extreme rainfall event characteristics such as timing and daily peaks performance of reanalysis as inputs into a hydrological model using a hydrological model as integrator to compare simulated and observed streamflow which can operate as an independent validation variable is one approach to assess the quality of observation and reanalysis precipitation data each of the reanalysis precipitation and estimated potential evapotranspiration was supplied to the gr4j model which were subsequently calibrated for each combination using consistently precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from the same dataset to independently analyze the quality of input data for each dataset relative to the observed streamflow gauge data streamflow gauges of course are subject to a variety of inaccuracies baldassarre and montanari 2009 but they represent the best available estimates for this study results of kge scores show that era5 is better than erai jra55 and cfsr but on overage all the reanalyses are less skillful relative to observations across the catchments in this study and this is entirely due to the precipitation data quality however there is a marked improvement in the kge scores for the catchments in the central highlands and western wet catchments which agrees with some studies on the datasets in other regions e g tarek et al 2020 essou et al 2017 lakew et al 2020 pointing to the fact that reanalysis data can be used as a replacement for observations there are overall high performance scores kge 0 5 in calibration mode in about half of the catchments for all datasets except cfsr which suggests problems in using cfsr to reproduce the hydrological water balance in the region that cannot be solved or compensated by calibration diro et al 2009 4 2 2 sensitivity analysis of model parameters sensitivity analysis is useful in identification of the parameters that have a strong impact on the model outputs which in turn influences the effectiveness of the model the greater the sensitivity of the model response to a parameter the closer and sooner will that parameter be optimized so a high sensitivity is good such an in depth analysis of a hydrological model may i help to identify any potential deficiencies in model structure and formulation ii provide guidance for model parameterization and iii provide the information content of available input data based on provision of information content of the input data different reanalyses show different sensitivities of model parameters and one that provides a higher sensitivity of model response means that it has less uncertainty and may be a lot easier to parameterize the values but then this in practical sense does not reach the real value and the dataset with low sensitivity has got high uncertainty and model parameterization may be a lot difficult zeng et al 2019 in comparison to observations era5 erai and jra55 show similar parameter sensitivities of model parameters while cfsr show distinct higher variability and a difference in the sensitive parameters which points to high uncertainty in the cfsr dataset this result shows that the sensitivity of the model parameters can change with the input datasets having very different hydrological characteristics overall the variability in sensitivity of model parameters is high in thiba munyu pekerra and ewaso ngiro across all the datasets thus we can conclude that the reanalysis datasets are not suitable for model calibration is these catchments of kenya characterized by arid and semi arid conditions msi considers both model performance and uncertainty quantitatively therefore it can be used to compare any catchment the era5 has the highest msi compared to observations across the nineteen catchments followed by the erai and jra55 whereas cfsr has least msi values msi s dependability may be increased by including more sensitivity indices and performance scores as well as assigning weights to the scores 5 summary and conclusion this study addresses a notable gap that was found in the literature for evaluating the accuracy of multiple precipitation reanalysis datasets across data scarce regions like kenya and for assessing their potential to supplement scarce rain gauge observations for hydrological modelling four different state of the art reanalysis datasets were assessed precipitation data from era5 shows the highest average correlation coefficient value 0 71 on monthly timescale compared to observations and is consistently higher across all months than the other reanalysis erai and cfsr have good average correlation but show larger drops in some months especially in the drier month of august jra55 obtained a poor correlation coefficient of 0 46 on average era5 erai and cfsr show higher correlations to observations in rainy months march april may and october november december and lower in the dry months june july august whereas jra55 shows worst correlations during both rainy seasons on annual timescales cfsr erai and era5 showed better cc indices of 0 60 0 46 0 52 respectively whereas jra obtained lower cc of 0 25 era5 and jra55 show a positive bias of 45 and 171 respectively whereas erai and cfsr show negative bias of 26 and 85 spatial rainfall patterns directly affect temporal distribution key in driving runoff and soil erosion processes which is useful in management of hydrological risks and generation of sediments from rainwater monthly standardised anomaly maps in era5 erai and jra55 showed a positive anomaly over the central highland and western parts in the arid and semi arid parts in the eastern and coastal lowlands parts of kenya the three datasets showed enhanced negative anomaly on seasonal timescales era5 erai and cfsr show positive anomalies in western and central highland in the three seasons except for jra55 which has a stronger negative and positive anomaly in mam and ond seasons respectively extreme precipitation showed a positive bias in cfsr era5 and erai in mam and ond seasons whereas jra55 has enhanced negative bias in most parts of the country except for isolated positive bias in the central highlands region in jja and ond seasons the performance of gr4j model when forced with different reanalysis in the 19 catchments reveals a bigger role of localized catchment characteristics and process in model calibration wetland catchments in the western and highlands of kenya obtained relatively better calibration scores compared to those in the semi arid regions with yala sio nzioa and gucha wetland catchments performing best and perkerra ndo tsavo thiba and tana semi arid catchments performing worst for each of the catchments era5 showed better calibrated kge scores compared to observations while cfsr and jra55 obtained poorer kge scores the range of kge values was relatively larger compared to observations thus a relatively unstable prediction ability is expected for streamflow in reanalysis for kenyan catchments the range of performances is more variable in era5 and jra55 and less variable in erai overall the variability in kge values is highest in validation than in calibration across all the reanalysis compared to observations as expected sensitivity analysis allows the reduction of parameters incorporated in optimization by determining the convergence most influential model parameters sensitivity analysis revealed that in all the four datasets the routing parameter x4 related to the unit hydrograph was evidently the least sensitive followed by the capacity of the routing store x3 whereas the two parameters governing the water balance i e the soil moisture accounting store x1 and the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 are the most sensitive across the datasets in most of the catchments except for cfsr where x1 was less sensitive with era5 showing a highest sensitivity in the model parameters however the variability in sensitivity of model parameters was high in thiba munyu pekerra and ewaso ngiro across all the datasets thus we conclude that model calibration in arid and semi arid catchments of kenya does not yield skillful results using the reanalysis data the msi aggregates both sensitivity indices performance statistics providing a clear index to judge the superiority or inferiority of a reanalysis with respect to observations on average era5 erai jra55 have better msi scores across most of the kenyan catchments erai era5 perform better than jra55 cfsr and lead to more robust model parameters using a catchment model and combined sensitivity model performance analysis allows an evaluation of the impact of the variability in the rainfall products throughout the catchment modelling process in conclusion in this study we have demonstrated the usefulness of reanalysis rainfall products as potential alternatives for hydrological applications in kenya we assessed the suitability of reanalysis precipitation datasets for hydrological modelling across kenyan catchments but first assessed the propagation of errors when reanalysis is compared to observations we performed the assessment on monthly seasonal and annual timescales then using a lumped bucket style hydrological model we assessed the model performance via the kge criterion and parameter uncertainty via sobol s sensitivity analysis for four different reanalyses era5 erai jra55 and cfsr across 19 catchments the parametric and model input uncertainty is investigated using the sensitivity indices and the comprehensive model performance analysis is used to examine the model s input strength i e the amount to which the model captures the dynamics of rainfall runoff processes with respect to different forcing we also coupled the results of the performance scores and sensitivity indices to compute msi for the 19 catchments we acknowledge the value and need of additional work if reliable data at higher temporal frequency becomes available and can be used as it contains more information however this is a big limitation for the current study due to high data gaps in the daily data river discharge data used in the current study and the lack of higher temporal resolution hydrological data future work should concentrate on assessing the sub daily performance of hydrological modelling with reanalysis testing its quality on other additional catchments in countries in the region with quality observed gauge data but prior investments in data collection in kenya seem to be needed our approach may be extended to various conceptual rainfall runoff models as well as physically based distributed rainfall runoff models the msi analysis is a practical method for weeding out the appropriate model input on a catchment scale basis however a more robust analysis where weights are assigned would yield some improvements in the results to fully ascertain the potential of alternative model forcing catchments characteristics and human influence such as dams and reservoirs should be modeled finally it is essential to note that this work does not promote the use of products such as reanalysis to replace observed data from weather stations nor can it be understood as giving reason to continue the present trend of retiring additional stations quality controlled ground observations still act as the best data for research the era5 results demonstrate that atmospheric reanalysis has likely reached the stage where they can consistently supplement data from weather stations and offer trustworthy proxies in places with less dense station networks at least across kenya overall reanalysis can be a viable alternative to observations in ungauged catchments but the associated uncertainties need to be carefully communicated for informed choice of hydrological modelling tools

evaluated in daily steps and seasonal steps against a regional gridded dataset g2dc pl in the period 2003 2019 soil and water assessment tool swat a relatively new eco hydrological model was employed to simulate runoff in daily time steps new hydrological insights for the region our results revealed that persiann family products could accurately detect precipitation events according to pod far and csi indicators persiann cdr has a better correlation in the northern and central parts and shows low accuracy in the southeastern catchment with a higher altitude a similar pattern is observed in pdir now and persiann ccs for r2 moreover the swat results demonstrate that g2dc pl could be a reliable source alternative to gauge data in runoff simulations persiann cdr performed slightly better in runoff simulations compared to other gridded datasets graphical abstract ga1 keywords satellite derived rainfall real time central europe high resolution gridded dataset 1 introduction recent developments in global gridded datasets have facilitated worldwide simulations in hydrology environment crop yield climate change and earth system processes in general for example several gridded climatic parameters namely soil moisture land use cropping systems living species or even sea level fluctuation datasets have been developed and used over the recent decades moreover several products and outputs of models at a global or regional scale have been released and are publicly accessible althoff et al 2020 eini et al 2021 gregor and gruber 2021 gueymard et al 2021 iizumi and sakai 2020 lloyd et al 2017 ndhlovu and woyessa 2021 reichler et al 2003 these datasets cover most of the land surface and atmosphere parameters and each parameter has its own accuracy and characteristics precipitation is the most essential and primary input in several hydrological or ecohydrological models tan et al 2021 tan and yang 2020 the parameter plays the main role in the hydrological process its accuracy in gauge recorded or gridded datasets has a significant effect on model outputs a minimum of 30 years of daily precipitation dataset is suggested to sufficiently capture long term climate conditions such as drought and its effect on parameters within hydrological models qin et al 2014 tan et al 2021 moreover in hydrological evaluation a reliable rainfall database leads to a more precise simulation of runoff flood drought and management decisions auerbach et al 2016 tan et al 2021 the analysis of the characteristics of global precipitation datasets is therefore a crucial stage in applying them in evaluations of water resources at a global or regional scale satge et al 2020 the precision of precipitation gridded data depends on the source of raw data development method and region eini et al 2021 sun et al 2018 tan et al 2021 these datasets are generally categorised into gauge corrected relatively more accurate or non gauge corrected relatively less accurate another classification designates satellite derived gauge interpolated ground based weather radar and reanalysis products sun et al 2018 provide a detailed review of 30 precipitation gridded datasets in recent years satellite derived gridded datasets presenting wider and higher spatial distribution and resolutions up to global scale and 16 km2 cell sizes sadeghi et al 2021 as well as higher temporal resolution sub hour to yearly time steps wang et al 2021 have been considered a reliable alternative to point based network for areas with no suitable point based network coverage in hydrological simulations beck et al 2017 pradhan and indu 2021 tan et al 2021 wang et al 2021 among different satellite derived precipitation gridded datasets persiann family datasets are some of the most commonly

piniewski et al 2017 tan et al 2020 in the swat model point based weather gauge observations are frequently used to drive the model in data scarce regions transboundary basins and large scale or

review of studies combining the swat model and gridded datasets by focusing on persiann family products according to studies mentioned in table 1 the accuracy of the persiann products in runoff simulations is still unknown in most regions and particularly in europe pdir now and persiann ccs cdr are relatively new products that require assessment in hydrological simulations in different regions research evaluating the performing of satellite based precipitation datasets in poland and central europe is scarce this study addresses the gap it has two main objectives namely a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of precipitation acquired from the persiann family of satellite products and b evaluation of the performance of these products in runoff simulations over a watershed in poland using the swat model bieger et al 2017 throughout the study we benchmarked the persiann family of satellite products with reference to a gauge based precipitation dataset namely

of the retreat and melting of glaciers knoben 2013 siniecki 2009 wira 2011 the total catchment size of the wełna river upstream from the flow measuring station is 2611 km2 wełna flows into the warta river the largest tributary of the odra river flowing into the baltic sea the catchment is covered by forest and rainfed agricultural areas with several scattered urban areas three discharge stations

products are developed by the university of california irvine uci sorooshian et al 2000 an online website https chrsdata eng uci edu is provided by developers to download all these datasets for different regions and basins or globally nguyen et al 2019 this family of precipitation datasets covers five different products persiann persiann cdr persiann ccs pdir now and persiann ccs cdr selected for the period 2003 2019 in this study table 2 the location of cell centers is presented in fig 2 in addition the persiann system is based on both geostationary earth orbiting geo satellites and low earth orbiting leo satellites nguyen et al 2018 2 2 1 1 persiann the current operational persiann employs machine learning methods to determine an estimation of the precipitation ratio at each 0 25 0 25 pixel of the ir brightness temperature image the persiann method was built on geostationary ir imagery and later expanded to involve both ir and dvi hsu et al 1997 2 2 1 2 persiann ccs persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs is a real time high resolution 0 04 0 04 satellite based precipitation dataset that enables the classification of cloud patch features based on cloud height areal extent and variability of texture calculated from satellite imagery hong et al 2004 2 2 1 3 persiann cdr persiann cdr provides daily precipitation values at 0 25 over 60n 60s persiann cdr is designed to meet the need for a reliable long term high resolution and global precipitation dataset for analysing variations and trends in daily precipitation and particularly extreme precipitation events persiann cdr is developed based on the persiann method utilizing gridsat b1 data and adjusted by the gpcp product to provide the reliability of the two datasets at 2 5 ashouri et al 2015 2 2 1 4 pdir now pdir now is a real time global high resolution 0 04 0 04 satellite based product relying on high frequency sampled ir imagery the latency of pdir now from the time of precipitation event is

each dataset against g2dc pl in overall and seasonal time frames followed by the evaluation of hydrological modeling finally the accuracy of persiann products was investigated in runoff simulation 3 1 evaluation of persiann products the evaluation of the accuracy of persiann products employed daily datasets over the wełna catchment our evaluation considered the weighted average method where the distance from the given centroids gives the weight 3 1 1 overall evaluation of precipitation estimates we extracted precipitation values for the centroids of each subbasin according to table 3 persiann cdr r2 0 23 and pdir now r2 0 22 show better correlations in comparison to other products lower pbias is observed in persiann ccs 2 38 followed by persiann 12 14 rmse mm shows that these products feature rather low similarities and rmse varies between 3 67 mm persiann ccs and 5 73 mm persiann the nse index sensitive to outliers shows negative values for all products and the best value is 0 24 persiann ccs according to fig 4 persiann cdr shows a better correlation in the northern and central part and has low accuracy in the southeastern catchment with a higher altitude a similar pattern is observed in the case of pdir now and persiann ccs for r2 persiann ccs underestimated precipitation in the southeastern and central parts 6 7 to 1 5 and overestimated 14 8 5 it northwest of the wełna catchment according to the pbias indicator persiann cdr 28 42 pdir now 59 81 and persiann ccs cdr 29 43 overestimated precipitation values fig 4 rmse mm indicator shows a lower error for persiann ccs in the northern and southwestern part of the catchment pdir now shows no uniform or discernible pattern over the catchment the difference between the maximum and the minimum rmse for all products is generally less than 2 mm with no strong pattern the error variations over the catchment are also low for the nse indicator with no distinguishable patterns fig 4 the pod and far statistics describe the core of the inaccuracies by gridded data the detection skills are provided in fig 5 and table 3 pod demonstrates superior performance of pdir now in detecting precipitation in the western parts 0 8 0 82 with a spatial average of 0 93 followed by persiann cdr 0 81 the pod range for other products is between 0 56 and 0 69 it could be considered an acceptable range for all products according to far persiann has better accuracy 0 24 although all products provide good results 0 26 0 34 with no discernible patterns over the catchment area csi performance illustrates average accuracy for these products in events detection by the persiann family 0 47 0 63 pdir now shows the highest performance compared to other datasets 3 1 2 seasonal evaluation precipitation estimates the evaluation of seasonal accuracy employed the taylor diagram according to this diagram in spring mam persiann shows the highest accuracy rmse 2 66 mm followed by persiann ccs rmse 2 95 mm according to fig 6 and table 4 in mam pdir now shows higher correlation r2 0 34 and persiann ccs cdr has the weakest accuracy according to the correlation coefficient similarly in summer jja persiann ccs cdr shows

precipitation more accurately than other son products finally in djf persiann cdr performed relatively better than other products in the current case study the catchment experiences high intensive precipitation during jja the following studies also have shown similar results in similar conditions intense precipitation in summer in this regard li et al 2021 showed the smallest correlation for persiann cdr among four gridded precipitation products in a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone in china over a tropical zone tan et al 2017 revealed that persiann cdr data resulted in a slight underestimation of the observed dataset in a catchment in the north of malaysia and an overestimation of precipitation in the southern parts of malaysia in korea over a humid monsoon climate zone vu et al 2018 showed that trmm and cmads perform better than persiann and persiann cdr when compared to rain gauge measurements which the major part of surface runoff and precipitation 70 occur during the monsoon season june september in a similar monsoon climate zone in the west of china jiang et al 2020 tested five gridded datasets and concluded that persiann cdr has the lowest correlation and detection ability and the highest error compared to the observed dataset in the mekong river basin with diverse climate zones temperate to tropical persiann cdr also had the lowest rank and accuracy among four gridded datasets tang et al 2019 moreover like our study other studies also have shown the insufficient accuracy of persiann products in hydrological simulations and against the observed dataset in different regions gao et al 2018 jimeno saez et al 2021 in most of the aforementioned studies the persiann family has shown good detection ability regarding pod far and csi indicators according to various studies precipitation estimates during summer are less accurate due to convective precipitation which exists in the current case study and the difficulty of measuring these precipitations by radars emmanuel et al 2012 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 jurczyk et al 2020 sokol et al 2021 3 2 evaluation of hydrological modeling using g2dc pl the calibration and validation results demonstrate sufficient accuracy of g2dc pl in runoff simulations according to the kge performance indicator the model at all three discharge stations showed acceptable performance table 5 presents the calibration and validation results fig 7 shows the simulated and observed time series station c table 6 provides selected parameters and the final range 3 3 evaluation of the accuracy of persiann products in runoff simulation after the calibration process for each product the persiann family showed no acceptable results in runoff simulations in our study table 5 the range of kge for these products is from 11 to 0 34 and pbias has shown high errors out of the acceptable range in the simulated runoff fig 7 illustrates the observed and simulated runoff for station c the hydrological model configuration and calibrated parameters as well as the driving data are the three significant sources of uncertainty that can influence the performance of runoff modeling inaccuracies in rainfall input can produce substantial uncertainties in runoff simulations wang et al 2021 similar to our results based on the swat model musie et al 2019 concluded that the persiann cdr product performed poor and unsatisfactory runoff simulations at monthly and daily time steps in a catchment in ethiopia in this study the chirps performed the best among the satellite precipitation products in the statistical assessments and daily and monthly runoff simulations our results also confirm the assumption made by musie et al 2019 and zhu et al 2016 that bias of precipitation products affects the accuracy of runoff simulation in water resources models over a humid area in southern china among the four satellite based precipitation products cmorph and tmpa achieved runoff modeling outputs superior to those of persiann and chirps wang et al 2021 in vietnam persiann cdr did not perform well compared to other gauge corrected datasets in runoff simulations at a daily time step le et al 2020 nonetheless in another study from vietnam persiann cdr performed slightly better than cpc in streamflow modeling employing a hydrological model ilyas et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 explored the role of persiann cdr tmpa and ncep cfsr in forcing runoff simulations employing swat in china they discovered that both persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 are datasets useful in runoff prediction at daily and monthly scales results of another study in china revealed that tmpa outperformed persiann cdr in estimating the precipitation and runoff simulations with swat le et al 2020 in a semi arid catchment in iran persiann cdr also showed low accuracy in runoff simulations at monthly time steps eini et al 2018 several of the aforementioned studies compared satellite based datasets against gauge interpolated datasets and reanalysis regarding the development methods of these different datasets satellite based datasets usually show the weakest performance in precipitation comparisons and runoff simulations persiann cdr and persiann ccs cdr however are gauge corrected datasets and they could show better accuracy than other persiann family products in the current study persiann cdr performed better than others in runoff simulations although the performance level is still unacceptable as mentioned in the seasonal evaluation of persiann products these products have shown less accuracy over regions that have high intensive precipitation during summer during summer this uncertainty in satellite derived products due to brightness temperatures in individual spectral channels and obtained rain rates is less deterministic compared to for instance radar reflectivity and rain intensity leads to higher uncertainty of the precipitation estimates and consequently unrealistic results of hydrological simulation in small catchments sokol et al 2021 3 4 limitations and further study this study evaluated persiann family products in a catchment in poland in daily time steps for all the period and seasonal assessments the datasets were extracted for centroids of each sub basin we therefore suggest that it could be valuable in further studies if researchers compare these datasets at the center of each product in addition a further study for a larger catchment or at the country scale is needed to capture more geographical complexity and girds in the study moreover the comparison is made against a regional gauge interpolated dataset gd2dc pl according to eini et al 2021 this type of comparison could increase the uncertainties of results further research should therefore evaluate these datasets against gauge stations daily comparisons in both accuracy evaluation and runoff simulations in daily steps showed no acceptable accuracy it is recommended that in future studies researchers evaluate these datasets in monthly comparisons because some of the hydrological models can use both daily and monthly time series as the input the results should be useful in water balance and long term studies persiann family products also have sub daily datasets the accuracy of these datasets is still unknown in this part of the world analysing these datasets in flood modeling and sub daily precipitation evaluation would greatly benefit extreme analysis and disaster management assessments finally gd2dc pl has one important limitation it is available for a fixed period with updates occurring every several years in contrast persiann family products are real time or near real time datasets which makes them an attractive data source for some specific hydrological applications however to keep integrity and reliability of results in global studies we suggest applying a bias correction method salmani dehaghi and samani 2021 xiao et al 2021 for the persiann family products in daily time steps over poland this could be done by using g2dc pl over the odra river basin and vistula river basin in central europe or at watershed and catchment levels in poland 4 conclusion this study assesses the performance of persiann family satellite based precipitation datasets against a regional gridded dataset over a catchment in poland it is the first time we used persiann ccs cdr pdir now in runoff simulations using a relatively new model swat this study is composed of two parts 1 the evaluation of persiann family satellite based precipitation products to g2dc pl in the period 2003 2019 and 2 use of the hydrological swat model to simulate daily runoff our conclusions can be summarised as follows a persiann family products could detect the precipitation events accurately according to pod far and csi indicators b persiann cdr and pdir now show better correlations compared to other products c the swat results demonstrate that g2dc pl could be used as a reliable source instead of gauge data in runoff simulations d persiann cdr performed slightly better in runoff simulations compared to other gridded datasets e persiann family products are unreliable

runoff simulations compared to other gridded datasets graphical abstract ga1 keywords satellite derived rainfall real time central europe high resolution gridded dataset 1 introduction recent developments in global gridded datasets have facilitated worldwide simulations in hydrology environment crop yield climate change and earth system processes in general for example several gridded climatic parameters namely soil moisture land use cropping systems living species or even sea level fluctuation datasets have been developed and used over the recent decades moreover several products and outputs of models at a global or regional scale have been released and are publicly accessible althoff et al 2020 eini et al 2021 gregor and gruber 2021 gueymard et al 2021 iizumi and sakai 2020 lloyd et al 2017 ndhlovu and woyessa 2021 reichler et al 2003 these datasets cover most of the land surface and atmosphere parameters and each parameter has its own accuracy and characteristics precipitation is the most essential and primary input in several hydrological or ecohydrological models tan et al 2021 tan and yang 2020 the parameter plays the main role in the hydrological process its accuracy in gauge recorded or gridded datasets has a significant effect on model outputs a minimum of 30 years of daily precipitation dataset is suggested to sufficiently capture long term climate conditions such as drought and its effect on parameters within hydrological models qin et al 2014 tan et al 2021 moreover in hydrological evaluation a reliable rainfall database leads to a more precise simulation of runoff flood drought and management decisions auerbach et al 2016 tan et al 2021 the analysis of the characteristics of global precipitation datasets is therefore a crucial stage

regions research evaluating the performing of satellite based precipitation datasets in poland and central europe is scarce this study addresses the gap it has two main objectives namely a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of precipitation acquired from the persiann family of satellite products and b evaluation of the performance of these products in runoff simulations over a

the lowest correlation it also has the lowest pbias 5 19 the highest correlation r2 0 29 and detection ability pod 0 91 and csi 0 67 in jja is recorded for pdir now persiann ccs has the lowest rmse 4 23 mm but it is not far from persiann cdr rmse 4 68 mm during fall son persiann cdr performed better according to rmse 3 30 mm nse 0 53 and r2 like mam jja in winter djf pdir now detected precipitation more accurately than other son products finally in djf persiann cdr performed relatively better than other products in the current case study the catchment experiences high intensive precipitation during jja the following studies also have shown similar results in similar conditions intense precipitation in summer in this regard li et al 2021 showed the smallest correlation for persiann cdr among four gridded precipitation products in a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone in china over a tropical zone tan et al 2017 revealed that persiann cdr data resulted in a slight underestimation of the observed dataset in a catchment in the north of malaysia and an overestimation of precipitation in the southern parts of malaysia in korea over a humid monsoon climate zone vu et al 2018 showed that trmm and cmads perform better than persiann and persiann cdr when compared to rain gauge measurements which the major part of surface runoff and precipitation 70 occur during the monsoon season june september in a similar monsoon climate zone in the west of china jiang et al 2020 tested five gridded datasets and concluded that persiann cdr has the lowest correlation and detection ability and the highest error compared to the observed dataset in the mekong river basin with diverse climate zones temperate to tropical persiann cdr also had the lowest rank and accuracy among four gridded datasets tang et al 2019 moreover like our study other studies also have shown the insufficient accuracy of persiann products in hydrological simulations and against the observed dataset in different regions gao et al 2018 jimeno saez et al 2021 in most of the aforementioned studies the persiann family has shown good detection ability regarding pod far and csi indicators according to various studies precipitation estimates during summer are less accurate due to convective precipitation which exists in the current case study and the difficulty of measuring these precipitations by radars emmanuel et al 2012 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 jurczyk et al 2020 sokol et al 2021 3 2 evaluation of hydrological modeling using g2dc pl the calibration and validation results demonstrate sufficient accuracy of g2dc pl in runoff simulations according to the kge performance indicator the model at all three discharge stations showed acceptable performance table 5 presents the calibration and validation results fig 7 shows the simulated and observed time series station c table 6 provides selected parameters and the final range 3 3 evaluation of the accuracy of persiann products in runoff simulation after the calibration process for each product the persiann family showed no acceptable results in runoff simulations in our study table 5 the range of kge for these products is from 11 to 0 34 and pbias has shown high errors out of the acceptable range in the simulated runoff fig 7 illustrates the observed and simulated runoff for station c the hydrological model configuration and calibrated parameters as well as the driving data are the three significant sources of uncertainty that can influence the performance of runoff modeling inaccuracies in rainfall input can produce substantial uncertainties in runoff simulations wang et al 2021 similar to our results based on the swat model musie et al 2019 concluded that the persiann cdr product performed poor and unsatisfactory runoff simulations at monthly and daily time steps in a catchment in ethiopia in this study the chirps performed the best among the satellite precipitation products in the statistical assessments and daily and monthly runoff simulations our results also confirm the assumption made by musie et al 2019 and zhu et al 2016 that bias of precipitation products affects the accuracy of runoff simulation in water resources models over a humid area in southern china among the four satellite based precipitation products cmorph and tmpa achieved runoff modeling outputs superior to those of persiann and chirps wang et al 2021 in vietnam persiann cdr did not perform well compared to other gauge corrected datasets in runoff simulations at a daily time step le et al 2020 nonetheless in another study from vietnam persiann cdr performed slightly better than cpc in streamflow modeling employing a hydrological model ilyas et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 explored the role of persiann cdr tmpa and ncep cfsr in forcing runoff simulations employing swat in china they discovered that both persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 are datasets useful in runoff prediction at daily and monthly scales results of another study in china revealed that tmpa outperformed persiann cdr in estimating the precipitation and runoff simulations with swat le et al 2020 in a semi arid catchment in iran persiann cdr also showed low accuracy in runoff simulations at monthly time steps eini et al 2018 several of the aforementioned studies compared satellite based datasets against gauge interpolated datasets and reanalysis regarding the development methods of these different datasets satellite based datasets usually show the weakest performance in precipitation comparisons and runoff simulations persiann cdr and persiann ccs cdr however are gauge corrected datasets and they could show better accuracy than other persiann family products in the current study persiann cdr performed better than others in runoff simulations although the performance level is still unacceptable as mentioned in the seasonal evaluation of persiann products these products have shown less accuracy over regions that have high intensive precipitation during summer during summer this uncertainty in satellite derived products due to brightness temperatures in individual spectral channels and obtained rain rates is less deterministic compared to for instance radar reflectivity and rain intensity leads to higher uncertainty of the precipitation estimates and consequently unrealistic results of hydrological simulation in small catchments sokol et al 2021 3 4 limitations and further study this study evaluated persiann family products in a catchment in poland in daily time steps for all the period and seasonal assessments the datasets were extracted for centroids of each sub basin we therefore suggest that it could be valuable in further studies if researchers compare these datasets at the center of each product in addition a further study for a larger catchment or at the country scale is needed to capture more geographical complexity and girds in the study moreover the comparison is made against a regional gauge interpolated dataset gd2dc pl according to eini et al 2021 this type of comparison could increase the uncertainties of results further research should therefore evaluate these datasets against gauge stations daily comparisons in both accuracy evaluation and runoff simulations in daily steps showed no acceptable accuracy it is recommended that in future studies researchers evaluate these datasets in monthly comparisons because some of the hydrological models can use both daily and monthly time series as the input the results should be useful in water balance and long term studies persiann family products also have sub daily datasets the accuracy of these datasets is still unknown in this part of the world analysing these datasets in flood modeling and sub daily precipitation evaluation would greatly benefit extreme analysis and disaster management assessments finally gd2dc pl has one important limitation it is available for a fixed period with updates occurring every several years in contrast persiann family products are real time or near real time datasets which makes them an attractive data source for some specific hydrological applications however to keep integrity and reliability of results in global studies we suggest applying a bias correction method salmani dehaghi and samani 2021 xiao et al 2021 for the persiann family products in daily time steps over poland this could be done by using g2dc pl over the odra river basin and vistula river basin in central europe or at watershed and catchment levels in poland 4 conclusion this study assesses the performance of persiann family satellite based precipitation datasets against a regional gridded dataset over a catchment in poland it is the first time we used persiann ccs cdr pdir now in runoff simulations using a relatively new model swat this study is composed of two parts 1 the evaluation of persiann family satellite based precipitation products to g2dc pl in the period 2003 2019 and 2 use of the hydrological swat model to simulate daily runoff our conclusions can be summarised as follows a persiann family products could detect the precipitation events accurately according to pod far and csi indicators b persiann cdr and pdir now show better correlations compared to other products c the swat results demonstrate that g2dc pl could be used as a reliable source instead of gauge data in runoff simulations d persiann cdr performed slightly better in runoff simulations compared to other gridded datasets e persiann family products are unreliable

7994,study region china study focus in sponge city construction in china rainfall data is the key to determining the rainwater source control scale however changes in rainfall characteristics can reduce the representativeness of the data to obtain stable volume capture ratios vcrs of the annual rainfall through as little rainfall data as possible this paper compares daily rainfall data from 159 cities in china in recent decades and finds the minimum number of years required to maintain stable vcrs under different design rainfalls finally it gives the recommended observation periods ops for different regions new hydrological insights for the region for the last 35 years the variation of daily rainfall in 75 of cities in china has been less than 0 66 mm and the variation of skewness is less than 0 62 in general the longer the observation period the smaller the calculated vcr anomaly value and variation gradient will be about 10 of cities cannot achieve stable vcrs by increasing the number of years of data the denser urban distributed area needs larger ops to determine the stable vcr with the increase in design rainfall the required ops will also be lowered in most cities the vcr calculation does not require 30 years of rainfall data graphical abstract ga1 keywords rainfall observation period design rainfall source control sponge city 1 introduction the rapid development in many cities has caused many urban rainwater problems such as frequent urban floods severe runoff contamination and water shortages jauregui and romales 1996 ashley et al 2012 jia et al 2015 in response to these problems there have been many rainwater management systems worldwide among which the low impact development lid is the most representative charlesworth et al 2003 liu et al 2015 in recent years many cities in china have encountered similar rainwater problems jia et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 to alleviate the urban waterlogging and control the runoff contamination of rainwater the chinese ministry of housing and urban rural development cmhurd proposed the concept of sponge city based on the lid design concept and vigorously promoted it chan et al 2018 like lid sponge city also emphasizes rainwater source control rsc it achieves a virtuous cycle of rainwater in cities by implementing a combination of various measures villarreal et al 2004 ando and freitas 2011 ahiablame and shakya 2016 many studies confirmed lid facilities significantly enhanced both hydrological cycles and improved water quality lenhart and hunt 2011 brown et al 2012 mayer et al 2012 palla and gnecco 2015 it is found that lids were able to capture 73 of rainfall events and the runoff volume was also reduced by 66 87 jackisch and weiler 2017 and water quality is enhanced dramatically through lid control systems wilson et al 2015 different from the event capture ratio promoted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2009 the technical guide for sponge city construction promulgated by the cmhurd has adopted the volume capture ratio vcr of the annual rainfall as the primary indicator for evaluating the source control effect this kind of management focuses more on the amount of rainwater controlled which helps meet the goal of rainwater resource utilization wang et al 2017 because rsc facilities are usually expensive to build and maintain the corresponding vcr goals were set according to economic and local climate conditions and the historical rainfall monitoring data can be used to estimate the designed rainfall and determine the scale of the source control facilities in different regions of china li et al 2015 rainfall characteristics are an essential factor in the source control effect studies have shown that different rainfall conditions can significantly change the effect of rainfall source control facilities qin et al 2013 stovin et al 2013 the spatial distribution of storm events is the most influential therefore researchers have studied the characteristics of regional rainfall to decide the reasonable size of the rsc facilities for example park et al 2013 studied the historical rainfall distribution characteristics of representative cities in eight various climate zone in south korea and selected appropriate water quality capture volume wqcv azli and rao 2010 analyzed rainfall data from 13 sites in the malay peninsula and used the huff curve to determine the designed rainfall in different regions it should be considered not only the spatial variation of rainfall but also the variation of rainfall with time especially in areas that are vulnerable to climate change or are heavily urbanized rainfall characteristics vary during periods which poses challenges to the representation of historical data in order to make the effectiveness of the rainwater source control facilities more reliable the cmhurd s technical guide for sponge city construction requires the use of rainfall data of not less than 30 years in determining the scale of the facilities in practice however many areas in china did not monitor or record rainfall in the early years and therefore do not have such a long track record of historical rainfall in the construction of sponge cities in these regions only a small number of years of monitored rainfalls can be used and the risk of using fewer years of rainfall data to determine the design rainfall needs to be assessed on the other hand the change in rainfall characteristics in some regions is more obvious owing to china s vast territory liu et al 2018 selecting a different number of years of rainfall data could primarily affect the design rainfall and the rsc s scale thus to reasonably determine the size of rsc facilities in various regions of china assessing the uncertainty caused by changes in rainfall characteristics and determining a reasonable number of years of historical data for selecting the design rainfall are essential steps to improve the stability of rainwater source control this paper analyzes the variation of rainfall characteristics in different regions of china it evaluates the possible impact of using different timespan of rainfall data to determine the design rainfall of rsc facilities finally the reasonable observation period op in years for different regions in mainland china is given cities in the chinese mainland should select rainfall data meeting the requirements of the number of years according to the city s location when carrying out sponge city construction in this way on the one hand the influence of rainfall changes on source control can be reduced to achieve a relatively stable expected effect on the other hand it can also reduce the requirement of rainfall data for sponge city construction in some areas with insufficient historical data 2 data and methodology 2 1 overview of the study area and data collecting the study area for analyzing the daily rainfall data to determine vcr is china fig 1 in east asia regional inhomogeneity and temporal imbalance control the spatial distribution of rainfall in china the annual rainfall rainfall days and intensity increase gradually from the northwest inland to the southeast coast the spatial distribution of annual rainstorm events rainfall depth 50 mm day frequency and intensity of rainfall events share a similar trend and frequent rainstorms are mainly concentrated in the southeast monsoon region the rainstorm rainfall depths days and intensity in the coastal and plain areas are higher than in inland and mountain area at similar latitudes in terms of rainfall distribution the spatial distribution pattern of china s total rainstorm contribution to total rainfall decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland region feng et al 2017 at the same time the proportions of various rainfall patterns in different regions vary significantly in spatial difference shuiqing et al 2014 the rainfall data used in this study come from the ground international exchange stations daily rainfall data were obtained from the meteorological monitoring stations in 159 cities fig 1 in china from 1983 to 2017 35 years based on rainfall characteristics five zones fig 1 were used in china to set the ranges of vcr goals for sponge city development cmhurd 2015 from each zone a representative city was selected to analyze the rainfall change in this study urumqi with a temperate continental arid climate for zone 1 changchun with a temperate continental humid climate for zone 2 beijing with a temperate continental monsoon sub humid climate for zone 3 wuhan with a subtropical monsoon humid climate for zone 4 and haikou with a tropical monsoon climate for zone 5 fig 1 2 2 vcr of annual rainfall and design rainfall depth the vcr of annual rainfall an important indicator that reflects the percent of annual rainfall volume captured by the source control facilities is the ratio of the controlled rainfall volume to the total rainfall volume eq 1 per unit area per year the design rainfall depth is an essential indicator of determining the size of the rainfall source control facilities it is obtained by analyzing the historical rainfall data from a nearby meteorological monitoring station at a specific vcr for the sponge city construction in china the targeted vcrs of annual rainfall were specified and recommended by the cmhurd and plotted in fig 1 including five zones cmhurd 2015 cities in zone 1 should design the source control facilities using a vcr of 85 90 while 60 85 for zone 5 to obtain the corresponding relationship between the vcr of annual rainfall and the design rainfall depth it is necessary to analyze the historical 24 hour or daily rainfall data over many years based on the calculation method in the technical guide for sponge city construction che et al 2015 the entire rainfall data sequence is divided into three groups according to the rainfall depth firstly the daily rainfall data less than 2 mm is removed because it is generally believed that less than 2 mm day of rainfall does not produce runoff second when the daily rainfall is more than the design rainfall depth the rsc facilities are assumed only to capture the design rainfall and the rest of the rainfall will be discharged third when the daily rainfall is between 2 mm and the design rainfall depth the source control facilities are assumed to control store or infiltrate all the rainfall therefore the vcr of annual rainfall for each design rainfall is determined as follows 1 α m n h d e s r f d e s r f i 1 k r f 2 m m h d e s r f i 1 n k r f h 2 m m 100 where α m is the vcr of annual rainfall determined using m years of observed daily rainfall data h is the rainfall depth in 24 hour or daily rainfall in mm desrf is the design rainfall depth in mm n h desrf represents the number of rainy days with daily rainfall h exceeding desrf rf 2 mm h desrf represents the daily rainfall exceeding 2 mm but less than desrf a total of k events rf h 2 mm is all the daily rainfall more than 2 mm a total of n k events from eq 1 when the design rainfall depth is selected the corresponding α m most likely is not constant may increase or decrease when the number of years of rainfall data or m increases this is because n k and rf all change when m changes changes of n k and rf over years are different in different cities α m would vary with geographic locations in china 2 3 analysis of rainfall change climate change and urbanization affect rainfall s original characteristics closely connected with the rsc effect the rainwater captured by the rsc facilities is less than or equal to the design rainfall in an individual event and the design rainfall cannot be very high therefore the proportion captured by the rsc facilities will decrease when heavy rainfall events increase conversely the proportion that the rsc facilities can capture will increase if the light rainfall events increase assuming that the total rainfall amount is fixed the rsc facilities work best with more events and even rainfalls so the certain amount of rainfall from each event can be controlled without overflow which is suitable for playing its full role it can be seen that the vcr of the annual rainfall is not only related to the average rainfall and the design rainfall depth of the facilities but also the statistical distribution of the rainfall data therefore in order to examine the variation of rainfall characteristics in different periods historical data is divided into groups according to different periods and reflects the characteristics of rainfall data based on the mean value and skewness a measure for the degree of symmetry in the variable distribution in eq 2 of rainfall data the mean value reflects the amount of regional rainfall while the skewness reflects the frequency proportion of heavy and light rain that occurs in all rainfalls 2 skewness x e x μ σ 3 to evaluate the changes of vcr to the number of years of rainfall data used the rainfall data were grouped into 35 observation periods op in years table 1 each observation period starts from the most recent year 2017 with the obtained rainfall data and goes back year by year for example when op is 10 years the rainfall data from 2008 to 2017 were used for the analysis the maximum op is 35 years 1983 2017 for the study in this study m is changed from 1 to 35 years to determine α m even we know that when m is only a few years the calculated α m is not representative we want to use all possible observation periods to study how α m varies with m 2 4 methodology of determining the minimum number of years of rainfall data for stable vcr based on eq 1 when m is small vcr could have a relatively large variation when m becomes large more years of rainfall data are used vcr changes with m typically become smaller and smaller to study and examine how the capture ratio changes with m two parameters anomaly variation d m in eq 3 and variation gradient g m in eq 4 are used d m is the difference between α m and the average vcr over 35 observation periods 3 d m α m α 1 α 2 α 35 35 m 1 2 35 the anomaly gives the deviation from the mean vcr if vcr in a certain period has a significant anomaly it indicates that the rainfall data in that period may not represent regional characteristics well if that vcr is used to determine the size of rsc facilities the risk of failure to meet the goal of vcr fig 1 will increase in the long run the gradient g m quantifies the increase or decrease of α m when the number of years of rainfall data increases one more year 4 g m α m α m 1 m 2 35 if g m changes greatly e g m 10 table 1 it indicates that the rainfall data or characteristics in the m th year e g 2008 table 1 are pretty different from the other m 1 years 9 years of 2009 2017 for example the rainfall data greatly alter the vcr and produce a large gradient when a particular year is extremely dry or wet therefore the variation gradient is relatively tiny when rainfall characteristics have relatively small changes year by year additionally the effect of extreme years can be offset to some extent by using enough data i e m or the number of years of daily rainfall data used to determine vcr eq 1 is large enough this study aims to determine these m values for different cities or zones in china fig 1 to have a stable vcr in this study to have a stable and representative vcr with anomaly d m less than 2 and the gradient g m less than 1 0 per year the minimum number of years of rainfall data in a meteorological station was determined we then believe that the years of such monitoring data are sufficient we carried out trial calculations through the matlab program many times to obtain the shortest monitoring years to meet the conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 change in rainfall s mean value and skewness to understand the variations of rainfall characteristics over time a comparison of arithmetic averages of daily rainfalls simply called average rainfall and skewness coefficients of daily rainfall over 10 2008 2017 and 35 1983 2017 years is given in fig 2 for 159 cities in china when the data points are near the red dotted 1 1 line the rainfall characteristics of the past ten years are similar to those of the past 35 years the absolute differences in the average rainfalls or skewness coefficients over the two periods 10 years and 35 years were calculated first and divided the data into two groups using the third quartiles q3 in fig 2 of absolute differences the third quartile is 0 66 mm for average rainfalls and 0 62 for skewness the red dots in fig 2 refer to 40 cities 25 of 159 stations when the absolute differences are more significant than the third quartiles while the blue dots are for 119 cities with fewer changes less than q3 the differences range from 3 45 1 60 mm for average rainfalls and from 1 68 2 74 for skewness the average rainfalls calculated using 35 year data range from 4 37 mm lenghu qinghai province to 25 31 mm yangjiang guangdong province with an average of 11 85 mm and a standard deviation of 4 31 mm in china with a vast territory and diverse climates fig 1 higher average rainfalls occur in the southeast coast region and lower ones in the northwest inland region a similar spatial distribution of total rainfall feng et al 2017 fifty four cities 34 0 have increased average rainfalls from the last 10 years to 35 years which are the data points on the left or upper side of the 1 1 line fig 2a it means that the average rainfall in these cities in the past ten years has decreased while 105 cities on the right or lower side have average rainfall increased all skewness coefficients are positive for 159 cities whether 10 years or 35 years of rainfall data were used for example skewness calculated using 35 years of daily rainfall range from 1 20 hetian xinjiang to 7 27 shijiazhuang hebei province positive skewness depends on an exponential decrease frequency distribution of daily rainfalls wanielista and yousef 1993 because a small number of large rainfall events affects controls skewness even there are many small rainfall events there were 98 cities 61 6 having increased skewness from the last 10 years to 35 years which are the data point on the left or upper side of the 1 1 line fig 2b when skewness changes greatly it indicates that the proportion composition of daily rainfall in this region has apparent changes when the skewness increases it indicates that daily extreme heavy rainfall in the region becomes more intense or the number of events of daily rainfall below the mean becomes more frequent when the skewness decreases it indicates that daily extreme heavy rainfall becomes small or the number of events of daily rainfall less than the mean is reduced fig 2 a shows that 75 or 119 cities have the absolute difference between the average rainfall over the 10 year period 2008 2017 and the one over the 35 year period 1983 2017 is less than q3 0 66 mm these cities are classified as with small changes in fig 3 because the average rainfalls calculated using daily rainfalls of the past decade and the past 35 years are small among the top 25 of cities with relatively greater changes i e q3 most showed an increasing daily rainfall the blue and orange points are roughly evenly distributed on both sides of the y x curve which means that in the cities with great changes the number of cities with increased daily rainfall is basically the same as the number of cities with decreased daily rainfall in terms of skewness as shown in fig 2 b in 75 of cities the absolute difference between the skewness over the 10 year period 2008 2017 and the one over the 35 year period 1983 2017 is less than q3 0 62 most cities with large changes tend i e q3 to show a decreasing trend which means the frequency of more daily rainfall increases while the intensity of extreme rainfall has declined from the point of view of spatial distribution cities with and without more significant changes between 10 years and 35 years in the mean value and skewness of daily rainfall are shown in fig 3 in terms of the mean and skewness most cities with the same change trend show regional clustering in terms of average daily rainfall eastern and northern regions have more changes and present distribution of increasing rainfall areas surrounding rainfall decreasing areas in the two populous provinces of shandong and henan located in eastern china four downward arrows are in fig 3 a which means the average daily rainfall in the past ten years has been obviously reduced this change will have an impact when determining the size of the rsc facilities most of the regions showed a trend of decreasing skewness distributed in various regions of the country only a few cities showed a trend of the apparent increase in skewness and they are basically distributed in the northeast of china fig 4 shows the variations of daily rainfall mean value skewness and corresponding vcr take a design rainfall depth of 20 mm as an example for illustration concerning the observation period m 1 35 years table 1 for five representative cities in china these cities are distributed in five zones with different vcr goals fig 1 and have different typical climate characteristics all three parameters in fig 4 have relatively large variations for all five cities when m is small they become relatively stable after the observation period m reaches a certain number of years in fig 4 when m 3 years the average rainfall curves no longer intersect this is because the climate difference of the five typical cities is quite significant and the statistical difference in daily rainfall is relatively large when m 15 years the average rainfall of the five representative cities reached a stable state moreover in the skewness diagram when m 7 years the skewness of beijing wuhan and haikou has a significant change while that of m 24 years the skewness did not change when m 15 years the regional average daily rainfall value can be accurately obtained while when the m 24 years the skewness of rainfall can be calculated accurately when m 15 years the statistics of average rainfall and skewness are not accurate enough however in the vcr diagram it can be seen that when m 10 years the vcr changes disappear or becomes very small it may require fewer years of data to determine a stable vcr than to estimate long term average daily rainfall and skewness under the design rainfall of 20 mm the vcr is stable at about 93 in urumqi 80 in changchun 70 in beijing 63 in wuhan and 52 in haikou haikou located in the tropical monsoon climate region has an average rainfall of about 20 mm much higher than that of urumqi in the arid region average rainfall is about 7 5 mm therefore for a fixed design rainfall of 20 mm the corresponding vcr at haikou is much lower 3 2 analysis of vcr variations on different ops the effect of rsc depends on comparing the time series of rainfall data and design rainfall depth therefore the selection of historical rainfall data as a reference is crucial in deciding the size of the rsc facilities especially in areas with a dramatic change in rainfall characteristics taking beijing as an example we can see from fig 5 a that with the increase of op the change of vcr tends to be relatively stable but there are still some fluctuations fig 5 b and fig 5 c show the variations of anomalies and gradients of vcr with respect to the observation periods or ops 1 year 35 years respectively it can be seen that both anomalies and gradients tend to zero with the increase of observation period m op should be greater than 11 years for gradient requirement while op should be greater than 24 years for anomaly requirement so taken together it is more appropriate for beijing to use the rainfall data of 24 years to estimate the vcr corresponding to 20 mm design rainfall the relationship between the vcr of annual rainfall and the design rainfall can be obtained using the method mentioned above with the 35 year rainfall data at 159 meteorological stations in china taking 20 mm design rainfall as an example the corresponding anomalies and gradients of vcrs of different ops in 159 cities were calculated and summarized in fig 6 for each m m 2 35 there are 159 anomaly and gradient values for vcr and then 5 25 75 and 95 percentile values and extremes minimum and maximum of them were determined for each op and plotted in fig 6 in fig 6 the cyan areas represent the different percentiles of the anomaly fig 6a and gradient fig 6b of the vcr under 20 mm design rainfall overall the absolute value of anomaly and gradient from 159 stations nationwide show a decreasing trend with the op m increase the dotted lines in fig 6 respectively represent the limits of anomaly and gradient of vcr with the increase of op when op exceeds a specific value the range of anomaly or gradient e g from 25 to 75 percentiles will no longer exceed the boundary formed by the two dotted lines we believe that this op can be used as the minimum op to ensure a relatively stable vcr when the observation period reaches 4 years the 25th and 75th percentiles of the anomaly of the vcr of annual rainfall will no longer exceed 2 0 and the gradient will be controlled by 1 0 which indicates that the adoption of 4 year rainfall data can ensure that half 50 of the cities can obtain relatively reliable vcr under the design rainfall of 20 mm when the number of years of the rainfall data is increased to 13 years the 5th and 95th percentile of the anomaly and gradient are no longer outside the threshold range this means that for 90 of cities only 13 years of data are needed to determine the stable vcr corresponding to a design rainfall of 20 mm due to the high degree of urbanization in beijing the rainfall changes obviously in skewness see fig 3b so the required op is relatively long simultaneously we can also see that the minimum and maximum values covered by the outermost light color have the anomaly value 2 and the gradient 1 when op reaches about 20 years 25 years for about 10 of 159 cities due to the irregular changes in rainfall characteristics it is impossible to increase the number of years of rainfall observation data to meet the conditions of anomaly value less than 2 0 and gradient less than 1 0 in terms of anomaly value when data 30 years ago was used the anomaly value slightly increased indicating that some cities rainfall characteristics 30 years ago were somewhat different from those of recent years the gradient showed some large negative values at observation periods are 13 16 and 22 respectively indicating that a few cities rainfall characteristics changed much in those years which affected the relationship between design rainfall and vcr 3 3 influence of design rainfall on the requirement of minimum op china has a vast territory with distinctive natural social and economic conditions different management preferences may lead to different sizes and costs of rsc facilities various design rainfall depths result in different abilities to adapt to rainfall change which will inevitably influence the vcr of annual rainfall fig 7 takes beijing urumqi and haikou as examples to show the variation trend of vcr with ops under different design rainfalls 10 40 mm it can be seen that the differences are not significant from the vcr s anomaly and gradient trends among the 4 design rainfalls therefore no matter what design rainfall is adopted in beijing the required minimum ops to have stable vcrs are not affected however some cities show some apparent differences in vcr anomaly and gradient among different design rainfalls because of their rainfall characteristics for example urumqi is in an arid area when the designed rainfall is 20 mm or more the corresponding vcrs can reach more than 90 only less than 8 years of data are needed to meet the stable vcr requirements however the design rainfall and vcr are both obviously beyond the standard of sponge city construction actually the design rainfall of about 10 20 mm is more meaningful for designing rsc facilities according to the gradient and anomaly value changes in urumqi it can be seen that it takes about 8 years 12 years of data to estimate a relatively stable vcr when 10 20 mm design rainfall is used in haikou located in a very humid area the design rainfall of 40 mm corresponds to 70 80 of the vcr it needs 14 years to determine a relatively stable vcr because the design rainfall of 10 mm is too low for haikou the vcr is very small therefore it requires fewer years of rainfall data to have a stable vcr than the design rainfall of 40 mm does it can be seen that the required op making vcr stable has a certain relationship or correction with rainfall characteristics and design rainfall when the designed rainfall is too high or too low with respect to mean annual rainfall the corresponding vcr will either be too large near 100 or too small which leads to having rsc facility too large costly or too small discharge too much runoff with pollutants 3 4 spatial variation of minimum op requirement for selected design rainfalls the regional rainfall data the design rainfall and the need for stable vcr anomaly less than or equal to 2 0 and gradient less than or equal to 1 0 per year will jointly determine the required op therefore the required minimum op in different regions will also show regional differences fig 8 shows the required op that can meet the anomaly and gradient requirements for stable vcr respectively the spatial distributions of required minimum op from anomaly and gradient are very similar for four selected design rainfalls 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm regardless of the design rainfall s anomaly or gradient the beijing tianjin hebei region shandong henan shanxi anhui jiangsu and zhejiang required higher op even when the designed rainfall reaches 40 mm a long op m 15 years is still needed to determine the accurate vcr these regions are exactly the regions with the most urban distribution in china therefore the change in vcr may be indirectly related to urbanization in most cities both the anomaly and gradient can approach zero with the increase of op see figure6 the above two results in fig 8 can be maximized and regarded as an op that can simultaneously stabilize the anomaly and gradient fig 9 shows the op recommended values under four different design rainfall conditions of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm overall when design rainfall is low the needed op becomes more extended and as design rainfall increases the needed op becomes shorter when design rainfall is 10 mm the northern china requirements of op are longer than the south because 10 mm is too low for design rainfall to other places except north china with the design rainfall increasing to 20 mm the source control facilities in northwest china arid area can capture a very high proportion of rainwater the difference in rainfall in different years has little impact on the vcr so the op requirement can be shortened to less than 10 years the northeast region has more rainfall than the northwest region so the vcr is not as high as the northwest region under the design rainfall of 20 mm more years about 17 years 23 years are still needed to determine the stable vcr when the design rainfall reaches 30 mm the demand for op in the northeast region decreases less than 17 years due to the large rainfall in the south the proportion of rainfall collected was very low and stable when the design rainfall was 10 mm leading to the south s low op requirement additionally because rainfall is abundant and the difference between average daily rainfall and skewness is not significant see figure3 op requirement in the south area is low regardless of the design rainfall change between 10 mm and 40 mm although the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china recommends that the op should be more than 30 years it is easy to see from fig 9 that for most places the effect of rsc estimation does not need such a long period of rainfall data in fig 9 op requirements generally decrease in mainland china the color becomes bluer as the design rainfall increases from 10 mm to 40 mm especially in areas such as western and northern china however this is not true when the design rainfall is too low for example the design rainfall of 10 mm is too tiny for rainy southern china and the corresponding vcr is stably low no matter how the rainfall changes so the 10 mm design rainfall corresponded op is the shortest there when the designed rainfall reaches 20 mm and above the corresponding vcr varies with rainfall so a more extended op is needed therefore a higher design rainfall can make the vcr of rsc more stable and better cope with rainfall change for some areas impacted by climate change and urbanization a high design rainfall should be adopted as far as possible to ensure the stability of the effect when the city has the conditions for sponge city construction 3 5 spatial variation of op requirement in different zones to determine a reasonable vcr in different zones fig 1 the research results of junqi li et al li et al 2015 were adopted as the official recommendation value in china sponge city construction guidelines published in 2014 as shown in fig 1 this provides a reference for the construction of sponge cities in various regions of china each municipality will formulate a more appropriate vcr according to its zone then choose the proper rsc s size for example in the northwest the construction of larger size rsc facilities is not practical due to very little rainfall in contrast small size rsc facilities are generally ineffective in the rainy south in order to select a more appropriate design rainfall as a reference this paper adopts the following method since the recommended vcr for each zone is a range of variation fig 10 for the sake of simplicity this paper adopts the average value of vcr e g 72 for zone 5 and the rainfall data of each city to calculate the design rainfall of each city check the variation of vcr corresponding to the design rainfall with ops and take the minimum op value that meets the conditions of anomaly value 2 and the gradient 1 the contour lines of the minimum op value are shown in fig 10 unlike the required op corresponding to the fixed design rainfalls shown in fig 9 fig 10 is the recommended op in five zones estimated using the design rainfalls corresponding to the mean value of the recommended vcr goals in the northwest and eastern regions where the urban distribution is dense the op required is mainly 15years 25 years the central and southern regions have the lowest requirements requiring only 10 years 15 years the north part in zone 1 vcr is 85 90 needs more extended op most of the regions need data for more than 20 years the main reason is the low design rainfall and few rainfall events leading to less data representation another area requiring a high number of op years is the east part of zone 4 vcr is 70 85 which is caused by changes in regional rainfall patterns see fig 3 zone 5 vcr is 60 85 does not require a high op with the most extensive rainfall this region s rainfall characteristics do not change significantly and adequate rainfall events provide sufficient representation in a few years only data from 1983 to 2017 were collected in this study so more extended data was not conducted if a very long op e g m 100 years is adopted in the construction of sponge cities the early data may play a negative role in reflecting the current rainfall characteristics however the current data are undoubtedly sufficient to control the anomaly and gradient in a relatively stable state the application of short term data as short as possible while meeting op requirements can ensure the data s representativeness to a certain extent and ensure that the data is up to date and more representative of the current rainfall characteristics 4 conclusions this paper analyzed the variation of rainfall in china in recent decades and discussed the variation of vcr with the different numbers of the year of rainfall data from the perspective of anomaly value and change gradient calculated the minimum number of years required to maintain a stable vcr under different design rainfall conditions furthermore the recommended minimum number of years of data for different regions was given the conclusions are as follows the daily rainfall is mainly reduced in the northwestern china area at the same time the eastern and northern regions have more changes and present distribution of increasing rainfall areas are surrounded by decreasing rainfall areas for 75 of 159 cities studied the average daily rainfall in the past decade 2008 2017 and the past 35 years 1983 2017 are similar difference 0 66 mm for 25 of cities with more significant changes the skewness changed by 0 62 most of which decreased in general the longer the observation period the smaller the calculated vcr anomaly value and variation gradient will be however for about 10 of cities due to the irregular changes in rainfall characteristics it is impossible to increase the number of years of rainfall observation data to meet the conditions of vcr s anomaly value less than 2 0 and gradient less than 1 0 denser urban distributed area in china needs more extended ops to determine the stable vcr the change in rainfall may be indirectly related to urbanization with the increase in design rainfall the required ops will also be lowered therefore when the monitoring data is insufficient a larger design rainfall should be adopted as far as possible to obtain a relatively stable vcr although the cmhurd recommended more than 30 years of rainfall data to be taken into account in the construction of sponge cities to determine vcr in many cities the vcr calculation does not require such a long period of rainfall data fig 10 declaration of competing interest the

7994,study region china study focus in sponge city construction in china rainfall data is the key to determining the rainwater source control scale however changes in rainfall characteristics can reduce the representativeness of the data to obtain stable volume capture ratios vcrs of the annual rainfall through as little rainfall data as possible this paper compares daily rainfall data from 159 cities in china in recent decades and finds the minimum number of years required to maintain stable vcrs under different design rainfalls finally it gives the recommended observation periods ops for different regions new hydrological insights for the region for the last 35 years the variation of daily rainfall in 75 of cities in china has been less than 0 66 mm and the variation of skewness is less than 0 62 in general the longer the observation period the smaller the calculated vcr anomaly value and variation gradient will be about 10 of cities cannot achieve stable vcrs by increasing the number of years of data the denser urban distributed area needs larger ops to determine the stable vcr with the increase in design rainfall the required ops will also be lowered in most cities the vcr calculation does not require 30 years of rainfall data graphical abstract ga1 keywords rainfall observation period design rainfall source control sponge city 1 introduction the rapid development in many cities has caused many urban rainwater problems such as frequent urban floods severe runoff contamination and water shortages jauregui and romales 1996 ashley et al 2012 jia et al 2015 in response to these problems there have been many rainwater management systems worldwide among which the low impact development lid is the most representative charlesworth et al 2003 liu et al 2015 in recent years many cities in china have encountered similar rainwater problems jia et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 to alleviate the urban waterlogging and control the runoff contamination of rainwater the chinese ministry of housing and urban rural development cmhurd proposed the concept of sponge city based on the lid design concept and vigorously promoted it chan et al 2018 like lid sponge city also emphasizes rainwater source control rsc it achieves a virtuous cycle of rainwater in cities by implementing a combination of various measures villarreal et al 2004 ando and freitas 2011 ahiablame and shakya 2016 many studies confirmed lid facilities significantly enhanced both hydrological cycles and improved water quality lenhart and hunt 2011 brown et al 2012 mayer et al 2012 palla and gnecco 2015 it is found that lids were able to capture 73 of rainfall events and the runoff volume was also reduced by 66 87 jackisch and weiler 2017 and water quality is enhanced dramatically through lid control systems wilson et al 2015 different from the event capture ratio promoted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2009 the technical guide for sponge city construction promulgated by the cmhurd has adopted the volume capture ratio vcr of the annual rainfall as the primary indicator for evaluating the source control effect this kind of management focuses more on the amount of rainwater controlled which helps meet the goal of rainwater resource utilization wang et al 2017 because rsc facilities are usually expensive to build and maintain the corresponding vcr goals were set according to economic and local climate conditions and the historical rainfall monitoring data can be used to estimate the designed rainfall and determine the scale of the source control facilities in different regions of china li et al 2015 rainfall characteristics are an essential factor in the source control effect studies have shown that different rainfall conditions can significantly change the effect of rainfall source control facilities qin et al 2013 stovin et al 2013 the spatial distribution of storm events is the most influential therefore researchers have studied the characteristics of regional rainfall to decide the reasonable size of the rsc facilities for example park et al 2013 studied the historical rainfall distribution characteristics of representative cities in eight various climate zone in south korea and selected appropriate water quality capture volume wqcv azli and rao 2010 analyzed rainfall data from 13 sites in the malay peninsula and used the huff curve to determine the designed rainfall in different regions it should be considered not only the spatial variation of rainfall but also the variation of rainfall with time especially in areas that are vulnerable to climate change or are heavily urbanized rainfall characteristics vary during periods which poses challenges to the representation of historical data in order to make the effectiveness of the rainwater source control facilities more reliable the cmhurd s technical guide for sponge city construction requires the use of rainfall data of not less than 30 years in determining the scale of the facilities in practice however many areas in china did not monitor or record rainfall in the early years and therefore do not have such a long track record of historical rainfall in the construction of sponge cities in these regions only a small number of years of monitored rainfalls can be used and the risk of using fewer years of rainfall data to determine the design rainfall needs to be assessed on the other hand the change in rainfall characteristics in some regions is more obvious owing to china s vast territory liu et al 2018 selecting a different number of years of rainfall data could primarily affect the design rainfall and the rsc s scale thus to reasonably determine the size of rsc facilities in various regions of china assessing the uncertainty caused by changes in rainfall characteristics and determining a reasonable number of years of historical data for selecting the design rainfall are essential steps to improve the stability of rainwater source control this paper analyzes the variation of rainfall characteristics in different regions of china it evaluates the possible impact of using different timespan of rainfall data to determine the design rainfall of rsc facilities finally the reasonable observation period op in years for different regions in mainland china is given cities in the chinese mainland should select rainfall data meeting the requirements of the number of years according to the city s location when carrying out sponge city construction in this way on the one hand the influence of rainfall changes on source control can be reduced to achieve a relatively stable expected effect on the other hand it can also reduce the requirement of rainfall data for sponge city construction in some areas with insufficient historical data 2 data and methodology 2 1 overview of the study area and data collecting the study area for analyzing the daily rainfall data to determine vcr is china fig 1 in east asia regional inhomogeneity and temporal imbalance control the spatial distribution of rainfall in china the annual rainfall rainfall days and intensity increase gradually from the northwest inland to the southeast coast the spatial distribution of annual rainstorm events rainfall depth 50 mm day frequency and intensity of rainfall events share a similar trend and frequent rainstorms are mainly concentrated in the southeast monsoon region the rainstorm rainfall depths days and intensity in the coastal and plain areas are higher than in inland and mountain area at similar latitudes in terms of rainfall distribution the spatial distribution pattern of china s total rainstorm contribution to total rainfall decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland region feng et al 2017 at the same time the proportions of various rainfall patterns in different regions vary significantly in spatial difference shuiqing et al 2014 the rainfall data used in this study come from the ground international exchange stations daily rainfall data were obtained from the meteorological monitoring stations in 159 cities fig 1 in china from 1983 to 2017 35 years based on rainfall characteristics five zones fig 1 were used in china to set the ranges of vcr goals for sponge city development cmhurd 2015 from each zone a representative city was selected to analyze the rainfall change in this study urumqi with a temperate continental arid climate for zone 1 changchun with a temperate continental humid climate for zone 2 beijing with a temperate continental monsoon sub humid climate for zone 3 wuhan with a subtropical monsoon humid climate for zone 4 and haikou with a tropical monsoon climate for zone 5 fig 1 2 2 vcr of annual rainfall and design rainfall depth the vcr of annual rainfall an important indicator that reflects the percent of annual rainfall volume captured by the source control facilities is the ratio of the controlled rainfall volume to the total rainfall volume eq 1 per unit area per year the design rainfall depth is an essential indicator of determining the size of the rainfall source control facilities it is obtained by analyzing the historical rainfall data from a nearby meteorological monitoring station at a specific vcr for the sponge city construction in china the targeted vcrs of annual rainfall were specified and recommended by the cmhurd and plotted in fig 1 including five zones cmhurd 2015 cities in zone 1 should design the source control facilities using a vcr of 85 90 while 60 85 for zone 5 to obtain the corresponding relationship between the vcr of annual rainfall and the design rainfall depth it is necessary to analyze the historical 24 hour or daily rainfall data over many years based on the calculation method in the technical guide for sponge city construction che et al 2015 the entire rainfall data sequence is divided into three groups according to the rainfall depth firstly the daily rainfall data less than 2 mm is removed because it is generally believed that less than 2 mm day of rainfall does not produce runoff second when the daily rainfall is more than the design rainfall depth the rsc facilities are assumed only to capture the design rainfall and the rest of the rainfall will be discharged third when the daily rainfall is between 2 mm and the design rainfall depth the source control facilities are assumed to control store or infiltrate all the rainfall therefore the vcr of annual rainfall for each design rainfall is determined as follows 1 α m n h d e s r f d e s r f i 1 k r f 2 m m h d e s r f i 1 n k r f h 2 m m 100 where α m is the vcr of annual rainfall determined using m years of observed daily rainfall data h is the rainfall depth in 24 hour or daily rainfall in mm desrf is the design rainfall depth in mm n h desrf represents the number of rainy days with daily rainfall h exceeding desrf rf 2 mm h desrf represents the daily rainfall exceeding 2 mm but less than desrf a total of k events rf h 2 mm is all the daily rainfall more than 2 mm a total of n k events from eq 1 when the design rainfall depth is selected the corresponding α m most likely is not constant may increase or decrease when the number of years of rainfall data or m increases this is because n k and rf all change when m changes changes of n k and rf over years are different in different cities α m would vary with geographic locations in china 2 3 analysis of rainfall change climate change and urbanization affect rainfall s original characteristics closely connected with the rsc effect the rainwater captured by the rsc facilities is less than or equal to the design rainfall in an individual event and the design rainfall cannot be very high therefore the proportion captured by the rsc facilities will decrease when heavy rainfall events increase conversely the proportion that the rsc facilities can capture will increase if the light rainfall events increase assuming that the total rainfall amount is fixed the rsc facilities work best with more events and even rainfalls so the certain amount of rainfall from each event can be controlled without overflow which is suitable for playing its full role it can be seen that the vcr of the annual rainfall is not only related to the average rainfall and the design rainfall depth of the facilities but also the statistical distribution of the rainfall data therefore in order to examine the variation of rainfall characteristics in different periods historical data is divided into groups according to different periods and reflects the characteristics of rainfall data based on the mean value and skewness a measure for the degree of symmetry in the variable distribution in eq 2 of rainfall data the mean value reflects the amount of regional rainfall while the skewness reflects the frequency proportion of heavy and light rain that occurs in all rainfalls 2 skewness x e x μ σ 3 to evaluate the changes of vcr to the number of years of rainfall data used the rainfall data were grouped into 35 observation periods op in years table 1 each observation period starts from the most recent year 2017 with the obtained rainfall data and goes back year by year for example when op is 10 years the rainfall data from 2008 to 2017 were used for the analysis the maximum op is 35 years 1983 2017 for the study in this study m is changed from 1 to 35 years to determine α m even we know that when m is only a few years the calculated α m is not representative we want to use all possible observation periods to study how α m varies with m 2 4 methodology of determining the minimum number of years of rainfall data for stable vcr based on eq 1 when m is small vcr could have a relatively large variation when m becomes large more years of rainfall data are used vcr changes with m typically become smaller and smaller to study and examine how the capture ratio changes with m two parameters anomaly variation d m in eq 3 and variation gradient g m in eq 4 are used d m is the difference between α m and the average vcr over 35 observation periods 3 d m α m α 1 α 2 α 35 35 m 1 2 35 the anomaly gives the deviation from the mean vcr if vcr in a certain period has a significant anomaly it indicates that the rainfall data in that period may not represent regional characteristics well if that vcr is used to determine the size of rsc facilities the risk of failure to meet the goal of vcr fig 1 will increase in the long run the gradient g m quantifies the increase or decrease of α m when the number of years of rainfall data increases one more year 4 g m α m α m 1 m 2 35 if g m changes greatly e g m 10 table 1 it indicates that the rainfall data or characteristics in the m th year e g 2008 table 1 are pretty different from the other m 1 years 9 years of 2009 2017 for example the rainfall data greatly alter the vcr and produce a large gradient when a particular year is extremely dry or wet therefore the variation gradient is relatively tiny when rainfall characteristics have relatively small changes year by year additionally the effect of extreme years can be offset to some extent by using enough data i e m or the number of years of daily rainfall data used to determine vcr eq 1 is large enough this study aims to determine these m values for different cities or zones in china fig 1 to have a stable vcr in this study to have a stable and representative vcr with anomaly d m less than 2 and the gradient g m less than 1 0 per year the minimum number of years of rainfall data in a meteorological station was determined we then believe that the years of such monitoring data are sufficient we carried out trial calculations through the matlab program many times to obtain the shortest monitoring years to meet the conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 change in rainfall s mean value and skewness to understand the variations of rainfall characteristics over time a comparison of arithmetic averages of daily rainfalls simply called average rainfall and skewness coefficients of daily rainfall over 10 2008 2017 and 35 1983 2017 years is given in fig 2 for 159 cities in china when the data points are near the red dotted 1 1 line the rainfall characteristics of the past ten years are similar to those of the past 35 years the absolute differences in the average rainfalls or skewness coefficients over the two periods 10 years and 35 years were calculated first and divided the data into two groups using the third quartiles q3 in fig 2 of absolute differences the third quartile is 0 66 mm for average rainfalls and 0 62 for skewness the red dots in fig 2 refer to 40 cities 25 of 159 stations when the absolute differences are more significant than the third quartiles while the blue dots are for 119 cities with fewer changes less than q3 the differences range from 3 45 1 60 mm for average rainfalls and from 1 68 2 74 for skewness the average rainfalls calculated using 35 year data range from 4 37 mm lenghu qinghai province to 25 31 mm yangjiang guangdong province with an average of 11 85 mm and a standard deviation of 4 31 mm in china with a vast territory and diverse climates fig 1 higher average rainfalls occur in the southeast coast region and lower ones in the northwest inland region a similar spatial distribution of total rainfall feng et al 2017 fifty four cities 34 0 have increased average rainfalls from the last 10 years to 35 years which are the data points on the left or upper side of the 1 1 line fig 2a it means that the average rainfall in these cities in the past ten years has decreased while 105 cities on the right or lower side have average rainfall increased all skewness coefficients are positive for 159 cities whether 10 years or 35 years of rainfall data were used for example skewness calculated using 35 years of daily rainfall range from 1 20 hetian xinjiang to 7 27 shijiazhuang hebei province positive skewness depends on an exponential decrease frequency distribution of daily rainfalls wanielista and yousef 1993 because a small number of large rainfall events affects controls skewness even there are many small rainfall events there were 98 cities 61 6 having increased skewness from the last 10 years to 35 years which are the data point on the left or upper side of the 1 1 line fig 2b when skewness changes greatly it indicates that the proportion composition of daily rainfall in this region has apparent changes when the skewness increases it indicates that daily extreme heavy rainfall in the region becomes more intense or the number of events of daily rainfall below the mean becomes more frequent when the skewness decreases it indicates that daily extreme heavy rainfall becomes small or the number of events of daily rainfall less than the mean is reduced fig 2 a shows that 75 or 119 cities have the absolute difference between the average rainfall over the 10 year period 2008 2017 and the one over the 35 year period 1983 2017 is less than q3 0 66 mm these cities are classified as with small changes in fig 3 because the average rainfalls calculated using daily rainfalls of the past decade and the past 35 years are small among the top 25 of cities with relatively greater changes i e q3 most showed an increasing daily rainfall the blue and orange points are roughly evenly distributed on both sides of the y x curve which means that in the cities with great changes the number of cities with increased daily rainfall is basically the same as the number of cities with decreased daily rainfall in terms of skewness as shown in fig 2 b in 75 of cities the absolute difference between the skewness over the 10 year period 2008 2017 and the one over the 35 year period 1983 2017 is less than q3 0 62 most cities with large changes tend i e q3 to show a decreasing trend which means the frequency of more daily rainfall increases while the intensity of extreme rainfall has declined from the point of view of spatial distribution cities with and without more significant changes between 10 years and 35 years in the mean value and skewness of daily rainfall are shown in fig 3 in terms of the mean and skewness most cities with the same change trend show regional clustering in terms of average daily rainfall eastern and northern regions have more changes and present distribution of increasing rainfall areas surrounding rainfall decreasing areas in the two populous provinces of shandong and henan located in eastern china four downward arrows are in fig 3 a which means the average daily rainfall in the past ten years has been obviously reduced this change will have an impact when determining the size of the rsc facilities most of the regions showed a trend of decreasing skewness distributed in various regions of the country only a few cities showed a trend of the apparent increase in skewness and they are basically distributed in the northeast of china fig 4 shows the variations of daily rainfall mean value skewness and corresponding vcr take a design rainfall depth of 20 mm as an example for illustration concerning the observation period m 1 35 years table 1 for five representative cities in china these cities are distributed in five zones with different vcr goals fig 1 and have different typical climate characteristics all three parameters in fig 4 have relatively large variations for all five cities when m is small they become relatively stable after the observation period m reaches a certain number of years in fig 4 when m 3 years the average rainfall curves no longer intersect this is because the climate difference of the five typical cities is quite significant and the statistical difference in daily rainfall is relatively large when m 15 years the average rainfall of the five representative cities reached a stable state moreover in the skewness diagram when m 7 years the skewness of beijing wuhan and haikou has a significant change while that of m 24 years the skewness did not change when m 15 years the regional average daily rainfall value can be accurately obtained while when the m 24 years the skewness of rainfall can be calculated accurately when m 15 years the statistics of average rainfall and skewness are not accurate enough however in the vcr diagram it can be seen that when m 10 years the vcr changes disappear or becomes very small it may require fewer years of data to determine a stable vcr than to estimate long term average daily rainfall and skewness under the design rainfall of 20 mm the vcr is stable at about 93 in urumqi 80 in changchun 70 in beijing 63 in wuhan and 52 in haikou haikou located in the tropical monsoon climate region has an average rainfall of about 20 mm much higher than that of urumqi in the arid region average rainfall is about 7 5 mm therefore for a fixed design rainfall of 20 mm the corresponding vcr at haikou is much lower 3 2 analysis of vcr variations on different ops the effect of rsc depends on comparing the time series of rainfall data and design rainfall depth therefore the selection of historical rainfall data as a reference is crucial in deciding the size of the rsc facilities especially in areas with a dramatic change in rainfall characteristics taking beijing as an example we can see from fig 5 a that with the increase of op the change of vcr tends to be relatively stable but there are still some fluctuations fig 5 b and fig 5 c show the variations of anomalies and gradients of vcr with respect to the observation periods or ops 1 year 35 years respectively it can be seen that both anomalies and gradients tend to zero with the increase of observation period m op should be greater than 11 years for gradient requirement while op should be greater than 24 years for anomaly requirement so taken together it is more appropriate for beijing to use the rainfall data of 24 years to estimate the vcr corresponding to 20 mm design rainfall the relationship between the vcr of annual rainfall and the design rainfall can be obtained using the method mentioned above with the 35 year rainfall data at 159 meteorological stations in china taking 20 mm design rainfall as an example the corresponding anomalies and gradients of vcrs of different ops in 159 cities were calculated and summarized in fig 6 for each m m 2 35 there are 159 anomaly and gradient values for vcr and then 5 25 75 and 95 percentile values and extremes minimum and maximum of them were determined for each op and plotted in fig 6 in fig 6 the cyan areas represent the different percentiles of the anomaly fig 6a and gradient fig 6b of the vcr under 20 mm design rainfall overall the absolute value of anomaly and gradient from 159 stations nationwide show a decreasing trend with the op m increase the dotted lines in fig 6 respectively represent the limits of anomaly and gradient of vcr with the increase of op when op exceeds a specific value the range of anomaly or gradient e g from 25 to 75 percentiles will no longer exceed the boundary formed by the two dotted lines we believe that this op can be used as the minimum op to ensure a relatively stable vcr when the observation period reaches 4 years the 25th and 75th percentiles of the anomaly of the vcr of annual rainfall will no longer exceed 2 0 and the gradient will be controlled by 1 0 which indicates that the adoption of 4 year rainfall data can ensure that half 50 of the cities can obtain relatively reliable vcr under the design rainfall of 20 mm when the number of years of the rainfall data is increased to 13 years the 5th and 95th percentile of the anomaly and gradient are no longer outside the threshold range this means that for 90 of cities only 13 years of data are needed to determine the stable vcr corresponding to a design rainfall of 20 mm due to the high degree of urbanization in beijing the rainfall changes obviously in skewness see fig 3b so the required op is relatively long simultaneously we can also see that the minimum and maximum values covered by the outermost light color have the anomaly value 2 and the gradient 1 when op reaches about 20 years 25 years for about 10 of 159 cities due to the irregular changes in rainfall characteristics it is impossible to increase the number of years of rainfall observation data to meet the conditions of anomaly value less than 2 0 and gradient less than 1 0 in terms of anomaly value when data 30 years ago was used the anomaly value slightly increased indicating that some cities rainfall characteristics 30 years ago were somewhat different from those of recent years the gradient showed some large negative values at observation periods are 13 16 and 22 respectively indicating that a few cities rainfall characteristics changed much in those years which affected the relationship between design rainfall and vcr 3 3 influence of design rainfall on the requirement of minimum op china has a vast territory with distinctive natural social and economic conditions different management preferences may lead to different sizes and costs of rsc facilities various design rainfall depths result in different abilities to adapt to rainfall change which will inevitably influence the vcr of annual rainfall fig 7 takes beijing urumqi and haikou as examples to show the variation trend of vcr with ops under different design rainfalls 10 40 mm it can be seen that the differences are not significant from the vcr s anomaly and gradient trends among the 4 design rainfalls therefore no matter what design rainfall is adopted in beijing the required minimum ops to have stable vcrs are not affected however some cities show some apparent differences in vcr anomaly and gradient among different design rainfalls because of their rainfall characteristics for example urumqi is in an arid area when the designed rainfall is 20 mm or more the corresponding vcrs can reach more than 90 only less than 8 years of data are needed to meet the stable vcr requirements however the design rainfall and vcr are both obviously beyond the standard of sponge city construction actually the design rainfall of about 10 20 mm is more meaningful for designing rsc facilities according to the gradient and anomaly value changes in urumqi it can be seen that it takes about 8 years 12 years of data to estimate a relatively stable vcr when 10 20 mm design rainfall is used in haikou located in a very humid area the design rainfall of 40 mm corresponds to 70 80 of the vcr it needs 14 years to determine a relatively stable vcr because the design rainfall of 10 mm is too low for haikou the vcr is very small therefore it requires fewer years of rainfall data to have a stable vcr than the design rainfall of 40 mm does it can be seen that the required op making vcr stable has a certain relationship or correction with rainfall characteristics and design rainfall when the designed rainfall is too high or too low with respect to mean annual rainfall the corresponding vcr will either be too large near 100 or too small which leads to having rsc facility too large costly or too small discharge too much runoff with pollutants 3 4 spatial variation of minimum op requirement for selected design rainfalls the regional rainfall data the design rainfall and the need for stable vcr anomaly less than or equal to 2 0 and gradient less than or equal to 1 0 per year will jointly determine the required op therefore the required minimum op in different regions will also show regional differences fig 8 shows the required op that can meet the anomaly and gradient requirements for stable vcr respectively the spatial distributions of required minimum op from anomaly and gradient are very similar for four selected design rainfalls 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm regardless of the design rainfall s anomaly or gradient the beijing tianjin hebei region shandong henan shanxi anhui jiangsu and zhejiang required higher op even when the designed rainfall reaches 40 mm a long op m 15 years is still needed to determine the accurate vcr these regions are exactly the regions with the most urban distribution in china therefore the change in vcr may be indirectly related to urbanization in most cities both the anomaly and gradient can approach zero with the increase of op see figure6 the above two results in fig 8 can be maximized and regarded as an op that can simultaneously stabilize the anomaly and gradient fig 9 shows the op recommended values under four different design rainfall conditions of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm overall when design rainfall is low the needed op becomes more extended and as design rainfall increases the needed op becomes shorter when design rainfall is 10 mm the northern china requirements of op are longer than the south because 10 mm is too low for design rainfall to other places except north china with the design rainfall increasing to 20 mm the source control facilities in northwest china arid area can capture a very high proportion of rainwater the difference in rainfall in different years has little impact on the vcr so the op requirement can be shortened to less than 10 years the northeast region has more rainfall than the northwest region so the vcr is not as high as the northwest region under the design rainfall of 20 mm more years about 17 years 23 years are still needed to determine the stable vcr when the design rainfall reaches 30 mm the demand for op in the northeast region decreases less than 17 years due to the large rainfall in the south the proportion of rainfall collected was very low and stable when the design rainfall was 10 mm leading to the south s low op requirement additionally because rainfall is abundant and the difference between average daily rainfall and skewness is not significant see figure3 op requirement in the south area is low regardless of the design rainfall change between 10 mm and 40 mm although the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china recommends that the op should be more than 30 years it is easy to see from fig 9 that for most places the effect of rsc estimation does not need such a long period of rainfall data in fig 9 op requirements generally decrease in mainland china the color becomes bluer as the design rainfall increases from 10 mm to 40 mm especially in areas such as western and northern china however this is not true when the design rainfall is too low for example the design rainfall of 10 mm is too tiny for rainy southern china and the corresponding vcr is stably low no matter how the rainfall changes so the 10 mm design rainfall corresponded op is the shortest there when the designed rainfall reaches 20 mm and above the corresponding vcr varies with rainfall so a more extended op is needed therefore a higher design rainfall can make the vcr of rsc more stable and better cope with rainfall change for some areas impacted by climate change and urbanization a high design rainfall should be adopted as far as possible to ensure the stability of the effect when the city has the conditions for sponge city construction 3 5 spatial variation of op requirement in different zones to determine a reasonable vcr in different zones fig 1 the research results of junqi li et al li et al 2015 were adopted as the official recommendation value in china sponge city construction guidelines published in 2014 as shown in fig 1 this provides a reference for the construction of sponge cities in various regions of china each municipality will formulate a more appropriate vcr according to its zone then choose the proper rsc s size for example in the northwest the construction of larger size rsc facilities is not practical due to very little rainfall in contrast small size rsc facilities are generally ineffective in the rainy south in order to select a more appropriate design rainfall as a reference this paper adopts the following method since the recommended vcr for each zone is a range of variation fig 10 for the sake of simplicity this paper adopts the average value of vcr e g 72 for zone 5 and the rainfall data of each city to calculate the design rainfall of each city check the variation of vcr corresponding to the design rainfall with ops and take the minimum op value that meets the conditions of anomaly value 2 and the gradient 1 the contour lines of the minimum op value are shown in fig 10 unlike the required op corresponding to the fixed design rainfalls shown in fig 9 fig 10 is the recommended op in five zones estimated using the design rainfalls corresponding to the mean value of the recommended vcr goals in the northwest and eastern regions where the urban distribution is dense the op required is mainly 15years 25 years the central and southern regions have the lowest requirements requiring only 10 years 15 years the north part in zone 1 vcr is 85 90 needs more extended op most of the regions need data for more than 20 years the main reason is the low design rainfall and few rainfall events leading to less data representation another area requiring a high number of op years is the east part of zone 4 vcr is 70 85 which is caused by changes in regional rainfall patterns see fig 3 zone 5 vcr is 60 85 does not require a high op with the most extensive rainfall this region s rainfall characteristics do not change significantly and adequate rainfall events provide sufficient representation in a few years only data from 1983 to 2017 were collected in this study so more extended data was not conducted if a very long op e g m 100 years is adopted in the construction of sponge cities the early data may play a negative role in reflecting the current rainfall characteristics however the current data are undoubtedly sufficient to control the anomaly and gradient in a relatively stable state the application of short term data as short as possible while meeting op requirements can ensure the data s representativeness to a certain extent and ensure that the data is up to date and more representative of the current rainfall characteristics 4 conclusions this paper analyzed the variation of rainfall in china in recent decades and discussed the variation of vcr with the different numbers of the year of rainfall data from the perspective of anomaly value and change gradient calculated the minimum number of years required to maintain a stable vcr under different design rainfall conditions furthermore the recommended minimum number of years of data for different regions was given the conclusions are as follows the daily rainfall is mainly reduced in the northwestern china area at the same time the eastern and northern regions have more changes and present distribution of increasing rainfall areas are surrounded by decreasing rainfall areas for 75 of 159 cities studied the average daily rainfall in the past decade 2008 2017 and the past 35 years 1983 2017 are similar difference 0 66 mm for 25 of cities with more significant changes the skewness changed by 0 62 most of which decreased in general the longer the observation period the smaller the calculated vcr anomaly value and variation gradient will be however for about 10 of cities due to the irregular changes in rainfall characteristics it is impossible to increase the number of years of rainfall observation data to meet the conditions of vcr s anomaly value less than 2 0 and gradient less than 1 0 denser urban distributed area in china needs more extended ops to determine the stable vcr the change in rainfall may be indirectly related to urbanization with the increase in design rainfall the required ops will also be lowered therefore when the monitoring data is insufficient a larger design rainfall should be adopted as far as possible to obtain a relatively stable vcr although the cmhurd recommended more than 30 years of rainfall data to be taken into account in the construction of sponge cities to determine vcr in many cities the vcr calculation does not require such a long period of rainfall data fig 10 declaration of competing interest the
