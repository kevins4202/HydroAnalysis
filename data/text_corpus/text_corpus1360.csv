6800,the water resources water environment carrying capacity wr wecc is an important indicator for judging the regional macro control ability of water resources the nature based solutions nbs concept is related closely to sustainability harmonious and green development resources rational exploitation coupled human and environment and ecological protection priority participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and or village environmental committees while in the case of water management a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association domestic water committees cooperative societies and various water user groups the wr wecc evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade offs to realize the development and utilization of water resources water ecological conservation and water environment protection in yuetang district we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources water environment and water ecological characteristics applying the principal component analysis pca method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of wr wecc and explore a deep seated reason based on nbs the wr wecc evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource socioeconomic and eco environmental systems we used statistical product and service solutions spss 19 0 software and adopted the improved pca to integrate the urban economic social ecological development of the xiangjiang a tributary of the yangtze river river basin we applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of wr wecc of yuetang district from 2005 to 2015 based on nbs the wr wecc of yuetang district was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate the water use amount per ten thousand yuan gross domestic product gdp and per capita water resources in addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011 the wr wecc in yuetang district was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level regional water environment comprehensive management and awareness of water ecological protection the wr wecc of the yuetang district in 2013 2015 was in a class i excellent condition the temporal variations analysis based on nbs was proposed through a combination of economic social ecological values provided by nature based development and utilization patterns based on the relationship among regional water resources economic society and eco environment protection the paper supplied a wr wecc improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water rich area in south china keywords water resources water environmental carrying capacity evaluation index principal component analysis nature based solutions yuetang district 1 introduction due to population growth and economic development the limited capacity of regional water resources to support social and economic development has become a constraint to the overall coordination and spatial expansion of some regions the concept of the wr wecc is inseparable from the concept of limited load bearing and sustainable development which is an essential metric for measuring macroscopic control and optimized utilization of water resources meadows et al 1972 mori and christodoulou 2012 the current literature on wr wecc is rich and there are many types of concepts but there is no generalized uniform definition coccossis and mexa 2004 lane 2010 mei 2010 navarro et al 2013 wei et al 2014 martire et al 2015 ma et al 2017 researchers generally believe that the definition of wr wecc should focus on the coordinated development of the system with a focus on dealing with the complex contradictions between social development and extensive resource environmental systems shi et al 2013 tehrani and makhdoum 2013 munoz et al 2015 carrying capacity can support the social water cycle with regional scale water resources and environmental conditions and the goal is to maximize the effectiveness of the development and environmental protection of water resources graymore et al 2010 santoso et al 2014 human ecologists park and burgess 1921 proposed the carrying capacity concept and rijsberman and ven 2000 proposed the concept of wr wecc and provided relevant criteria for its determination joardar 1998 studied the connotation of urban water resources carrying capacity based on the diversity of water sources and used them as the basis for urban planning based on the basic supporting role of water resources harris kennedy 1999 used the evaluation results of agricultural production capacity and used the land water resources environmental carrying capacity as a comprehensive measure of land comprehensive utilization china s research on water resources carrying capacity wrcc began in the 1980s and is represented by the results of research on xinjiang water resources zeng et al 1991 ye 1992 the study of wrcc in the 1990s emerged from chinese scholars and was applied by the world fu and ji 1999 the main body of water in the wr wecc is natural water resources including the quality characteristics of water resources bielsa and duarte 2001 presented an economic model for the allocation of water to the agricultural irrigation and hydroelectric sectors to study the multi objective optimization of water resources allocation giuliani and castelletti 2013 used a multi agent simulation to model and analyse different levels of cooperation and information exchange and singh 2014 provided a multi objective algorithm and multi objective evaluation methods nbs encompass existing concepts such as natural capital and ecosystem services in economics and landscape functions in environmental planning fu et al 2018a the criteria of nbs were found in the examples of coastal management and the restoration of floodplains hoang et al 2018 morris et al 2018 nbs could help the recovery of well being and regional natural water resources panno et al 2017 in a narrow sense the object of wr wecc is the supported objects directly linked to water that are directly supported by water resources in a broad sense they are more closely related to water resources and are more affected by changes in water resources zhou and liang 2006 liang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 the water resources environmental coordinating role is the essence of water resources the ultimate supporting role of environmental carrying capacity and its own capacity of the system load are correlated the conventional tools and methodologies e g water resources carrying capacity assessment would then be embedded into such a modelling approach to provide a general sustainability assessment tool schaubroeck 2018 we supplied the relevance of the concept feature representation method based on the concept connotation of the wr wecc and nbs as shown in fig 1 yang et al 2016 ma 2016 lorenz and pusch 2012 the assessment of wr wecc based on nbs has an important impact on the evaluation of regional development space and resource environment coordination at present there are many literatures on wr wecc countermeasures in the arid regions of northwest and north and insufficient research in the water rich area in south china the current research scope is mainly based on dispersive quantity and quality single item evaluation and resource ecological environment diversity comprehensive research is less nbs can be linked to the sustainable use of water resources and water environmental protection the sustainability and health of the basin scale aquatic ecosystem and the design and management of new development balance ec 2015 the nbs can help us remain within a safe operating space for humanity improve local ecological and social sustainability and guarantee long term development the purpose of the wr wecc assessment is to analyse the relationship between limited water resources long term environmental protection and sustainability of ecological health thus trying to regulate inconsistencies in the development and utilization of regional water resources environmental protection the dynamic assessment of wr wecc mainly describes the development and utilization of water resources quantitatively in the region basin the common comprehensive evaluation methods currently include the fussy assessment method system dynamics method principal component analysis pca method and analytic hierarchy process ahp song et al 2011 liu and borthwick 2011 gong and jin 2009 lin et al 2011 in recent years wrcc evaluation methods include the bp neural network algorithm matter element analysis method and a grid search method based on geographic information system wang et al 2017 milstein et al 2018 as the reduced dimension processing method the simplest form of pca takes the linear combination of the original variables and adjusts the combination coefficients appropriately so that the new variables are independent and representative teffera et al 2018 pca not only loses less information but also compensates for the insufficiency of considering only a single wr wecc factor which is conducive to solving the problem that the conclusion is unreasonable because the value of the parameter is difficult to obtain the current research scope is mainly based on the dispersive quantity quality single item evaluation and the resource ecological environment multi integrated research is less studied the index weight calculation is mainly based on regional economy lacking a theoretical basis in the previous literature review of the comprehensive factors of quantity quality and water ecology integrated indicators are used to calculate the weights for evaluation however there is no physical mechanism therefore the current research mainly combines the regional wr wecc evaluation of water quality and water quantity strengthens the real time monitoring of the water quality dynamics of key sections and improves the dynamic evaluation database of the water environment carrying capacity as there is not a general sustainability assessment approach that assesses the impact of both natural and human industrial elements the wr wecc method would be applicable for evaluating human well being water resources and environmental and socioeconomic systems in a water rich region the wr wecc is based on nbs aiming to achieve the healthy and sustainable development of the resource environment social system and use optimized regulation technology to achieve regional social and economic maximization zhang et al 2018 fu et al 2018a countries worldwide have the opportunity and responsibility to apply nbs as a guiding economic strategy towards modifying their use of water resources for the benefit of nature and society maes and jacobs 2015 the nbs approach to we wrcc aims to challenge and reframe new water resource management methods by refocusing solutions from technological strategies to socioecological principles such as human well being development and water resource sustainable utilization therefore the evaluation of the carrying capacity status of the water socioecological environment has become key to achieving the overall coordinated and sustainable development of yuetang district the manuscript supplied a carrying capacity evaluation index system to explore the status of wr wecc in yuetang district using a pca method based on nbs the main components affecting dynamic changes of wr wecc were selected to analyse the data change over a long time series this paper is structured as follows 1 introduction elaborating on the background and theoretical significance of the research subject in this paper 2 materials and methods with subsections on the 1 the characteristics of yuetang district 2 model description based on nbs the pca method line correspondence and spss and 3 data collection economic and social data ecological information 3 results and discussion and 4 conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yuetang district is affiliated with xiangtan city hunan province with a total area of 206 4 km2 yuetang district is located at the northeastern end of xiangtan city where the xiangjiang river and the lianshui river meet fig 2 the surface water flow in yuetang district is sufficient and the water quality is in good condition the total amount of local water resources in yuetang district is limited the maximum availability of local water resources in 2005 2015 is approximately 40 although the water consumption in the xiangjiang river basin is unevenly distributed in time and space the xiangjiang river water resources provide a corresponding supply for production and life along the coast of yuetang district although the total amount of water resources in yuetang district in xiangtan city is rich it is unevenly distributed in time and space there are many problems related to water resource development and utilization water ecological conservation and water environmental protection the water resources in yuetang district are abundant and the annual average precipitation is 1350 mm but the interannual variation is large the per capita water resources in yuetang district are only 50 of the average level in hunan province and water shortages appears in some towns and villages the abundant basin scale passing of water resources from the xiangjiang river can effectively solve the problem of water shortages in yuetang district the utilization of the xiangjiang river passing water resources by yuetang district has increased year by year fig 3 yuetang district was selected as the study area to introduce the regional wr wecc quantitative evaluation and optimized utilization theory into a real world case yuetang district is a developing city lacking water resources seriously water resources per capita is 511 m3 yuetang district is the important industrial zone of xiangtan city it is a typical example of the harmonious development of chang zhu tan urban agglomeration yuetang district has a strong industrial base and a sound industrial system yuetang district has a solid industrial base and a complete modern industrial system the total production value of yuetang district was 50 04 billion yuan in 2015 in 2015 the population of yuetang district was 355 300 and the urbanization rate reached 95 7 the area is rich in precipitation but the amount of water available is small water resources problems has become a main factor of restricting the development of economy and society the problems faced by yuetang district represent the common problems faced by most cities in the yangtze river economic belt although the area of yuetang district is not large water problems are complicated the high water demand from many water users has resulted in low water availability in regional rivers vieira and sandoval solis 2018 the local water yield is insufficient and the interdependency on passing by water is high the studied case could reveal the current situation of wr wecc and offer guidance to water resources exploitation and socio economic development in the water rich area in south china 2 2 principal component analysis method the pca method classifies the original data information into several comprehensive variables with characterization significance by means of correlation coefficients to accurately reflect the core information for the evaluation indicators pca has been extensively used in the literature since its introduction by pearson 1901 and more importantly by hotelling 1933 based on the principle of pca the manuscript first normalized the original data and calculated the correlation coefficient matrix of the normalized data set second the eigenvalues of the correlation coefficient matrix and the corresponding eigenvectors were calculated and the contribution rate and the cumulative value were also calculated finally on the basis of determining the number of principal components accumulated contribution rate is greater than 85 we calculated the principal component score of the evaluation factor to evaluate the wr wecc the wr wecc improved with a higher score in the comprehensive evaluation index van den brink et al 2009 nemeth and rakosa 2018 the principle of pca based on nbs was illustrated in fig 4 the principal component score involves comprehensive data the meaning of the calculation result is not accurate if the index is not monotonous and consistent in this study we proposed an online multilinear principal component analysis algorithm which took full use of the old training samples and sharply reduced the time of dimension reduction han et al 2018 the method to determine the monotonicity and consistency was as follows 1 straight line correspondence assuming a linear relationship between the index value and the evaluation value the larger smaller the index value the better there were three typical transformations extreme value method the transformation of positive linear correlation 1 y i x i max x i max x i min x i where yi is the evaluation value and xi is the original data eigenvalue the transformation of negative linear correlation 2 y i max x i x i max x i min x i z score method 3 y i x i x s where x is the mean of xi s is the variance of x specific gravity method 4 y i x i i 1 n x i or y i x i i 1 n x i 2 2 polyline correspondence staged straight line correspondence it was assumed that the relationship between the eigenvalue and the evaluation value was different within different value domains and linearly correlated within the same value domain the transformation formula was as follows 5 y i 0 x 0 x i x m y m 0 x x m y m x i x m max x i x m 1 y m x x m where xm is the cutoff point value of each segment of straight line and the value of ym could be calculated by the extreme value method 3 curvilinear correspondence it was assumed that the influence of the actual value of the evaluation object on the evaluation value was not proportional the synchronous changes in the index value xi have a greater effect on the evaluation of yi in a certain interval and thus was reflected in the comprehensive evaluation curvilinear correspondences come in many forms the common forms are as follows 6 y 0 0 x a 1 e k x a x a 7 y 0 0 x a 1 e k x a 2 x a 8 y 0 0 x a a x a k 0 x a 1 a k 1 x a 1 a k where formula 6 7 is used in robust pca sparse probabilistic pca and sparse exponential family pca the related explanations are available in the literature smallman et al 2018 kwak 2008 zou et al 2006 assuming that a region observes p indexes the raw data matrix for n regions is 9 x x 11 x 12 x 1 p x 21 x 22 x 2 p x n 1 x 2 n x np x 1 x 2 x p 10 x j x 1 j x 2 j x nj t j 1 2 p the linear combination of p column vectors x 1 x 2 xp of the original data matrix x can be obtained 11 f 1 a 11 x 1 a 12 x 2 a 1 p x p f 2 a 21 x 1 a 22 x 2 a 2 p x p f p a p 1 x 1 a p 2 x 2 a pp x p the above linear equation is abbreviated as 12 f j a j 1 x 1 a j 2 x 2 a jp x p j 1 2 p the linear combination equation satisfies the following conditions simultaneously 13 a j 1 2 a j 2 2 a jp 2 1 j 1 2 p cov f i f j 0 var f 1 v a r f 2 v a r f p f 1 f 2 fn is called the principal component and the principal component data are obtained from the variance result the principal component information amount

contribution rate is 14 a i λ i i 1 p λ i the larger the contribution rate value ai in the formula the stronger the principal component information representativeness ability the manuscript selects n evaluation indicators x 1 x 2 xn and obtains new variables by pca vector transformation and data analysis namely z1 z2 zn p n the calculation process of principal component analysis is as follows 1 the raw data first needs to be standardized to eliminate the influence of dimensional differences 15 z x ij x ij x j σ j i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 n where xij is the original value of the jth indicator of the

the evaluation factor and rk is the selected principal component 2 3 data collection collecting the wr wecc data determines how outstanding local communities and peoples around yuetang district achieve the regional sustainable development goals through nature based actions in the process of the wr wecc evaluation the data of water resources exploration and utilization and available water supply amount are obtained from the runoff and precipitation data of xiangtan hydrological station the water resources bulletin of xiangtan city and the water resources statistical data the basic social and economic status of the region were obtained using the statistical yearbook data of yuetang district the quality of water resources was acquired from the water quality monitoring data of the xiangtan hydrology bureau the water use system is mainly composed of the economic and the social water use activities which supports economic development and life respectively zhou et al 2018 we used the relevant data in economic and social statistical bulletins and regional overall development plans to analyse the sewage treatment and ecological related information fu et al 2018b c 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation index system construction the manuscript comprehensively considered the impact of relevant factors on the regional water resources environment based on the research progress of the wrcc evaluation index system at home and abroad based on the statistical data of water resources social economy environmental protection and ecological system stability and diversity we constructed a wr wecc evaluation index system based on an nbs containing 3 subsystems and 16 evaluation indexes which consisted of social economy and ecological environment systems mei 2010 fang et al 2017 to avoid data distortion caused by different populations and geographical areas in different regions comprehensive indicators such as per capita land average utilization rate percentage and per capita water were used to construct the indicator system by drawing on the existing domestic and foreign achievements the index system for wr wecc should be based on the characteristics of water resources in regional or river basins emphasizing the status and process of operability to deeply study the internal factors that affect water use efficiency the water use subsystem could be further divided into a social water use subsystem and an economic water use subsystem hu et al 2018 the index system also should comprehensive reflect coupling coordination among the socio economic eco environmental benefits and sustainable use of water resources in general the factors affecting wr wecc generally include nature and development natural factors include soil water resources conditions and eco environment background conditions development factors refer to human activities including socio economic development patterns scale structure and speed to fully reflect the interregional differences the water resources endowment water resources development level economic development level urbanization level industrial structure water utilization structure water use efficiency would help objectively reflect the actual meaning of the indicators and facilitate the comparison of data during the series the wr wecc evaluation index system was listed in table 1 indicators with the notation were the general indicators 6 items the rest are regional indicators 10 items the social factors such as per capita education level per capita income level and people s awareness of environmental protection which are important factors affecting regional water consumption and water environment conditions but these factors are not easy to quantify and the index values are greatly affected by subjective factors although rainfall can be calculated on a monthly or 10 day scale regional economic social development indicators water quality changes and water ecological restoration status are usually measured on a yearly time scale and the impact of rainfall on surface runoff and water environment is also a slow process 3 2 comprehensive evaluation nbs use mimics natural processes to enhance water availability improve water quality and reduce risks associated with water related human society and natural environment change the paper selected 16 indexes covering the systems of resources economy and ecology table 2 due to the various types of evaluation indicators we gathered data from multiple departments and statics information from 2005 to 2015 it is so difficult to obtain many continuous data that we only collected limited related water quality data for analysing the socioeconomic development trend in 2005 2015 is obvious and the data series are continuous 3 2 1 standardization of raw data we used spss 19 0 statistical analysis software to perform principal component analysis on the raw data we used the correlation coefficient matrix to standardize the original data and eliminate the influence of magnitude and dimension on the correlation coefficient the correlation coefficient matrix of 16 evaluation indexes of wr wecc in yuetang district are shown in table 3 3 2 2 eigenvalue and contribution rates calculation of raw data there was a certain degree of correlation between the 16 evaluation indexes according to the correlation coefficient matrix among them i2 and i4 i8 and i14 i11 and i12 and i14 and i16 had strong correlations table 4 and the correlation coefficients were 0 998 0 992 0 992 and 0 991 respectively the calculation results were in accordance with the necessary conditions of pca indicating that there was overlap between the index information and it was suitable to use the pca method for correlation calculation zhao 2016 vajda et al 1985 flury 1986 we used spss 19 0 to calculate the eigenvalue contribution rate and cumulative contribution rate of the correlation coefficient matrix as listed in table 5 based on the principal component eigenvalue and contribution rate the eigenvalues were λ 1 8 956 λ 2 4 275 and λ 3 1 496 and the cumulative variance contribution rate of the first three principal components was 92 04 according to the principle that the cumulative contribution rate was greater than 85 to determine the number of principal components it was indicated that the first three principal components could represent the initial 16 indexes to analyse the wr wecc level of yuetang district boente and fraiman 1999 the variance contribution rate demonstrated that the contribution rate of the first principal component variance was 55 974 which was much larger than the contribution rate of the second and third principal components of 26 718 and 9 348 respectively ingredient analysis is shown in fig 5 the wr wecc of yuetang district mainly was controlled by the first principal component 3 2 3 principal component matrix and score principal component loading refers to the correlation coefficient between the three principal components and the variables the principal component matrix of yuetang district is shown in table 6 there was a strong positive correlation between the first principal component and i7 i8 i13 i14 i15 and i16 and there was a strong negative correlation between i9 i11 and i12 these indexes reflected the socioeconomic and ecological development of yuetang district there was a strong positive correlation between the second principal component and i1 i2 i3 and i4 reflecting the existing forms and supply features of water resources in yuetang district the third principal component was positively correlated with i6 the three principal components include water resources socio economy and eco environment which comprehensively cover the evaluation index of the wr wecc in yuetang district we classified the above three principal components as c1 c2 and c3 we used the percentages of the variance contribution rate total variance contribution rate as the principal component weight we calculated the comprehensive score of wr wecc of the yuetang district from 2005 to 2015 on the basis of addition the formula is as follows 21 c 0 55974 c 1 0 26718 c 2 0 09348 c 3 where c represents the comprehensive score of wr wecc in yuetang district the wr wecc improves with a higher score the relationship between the c1 c2 and c3 values and the unrotated initial factor score values are as follows 22 c i f a c n s q r λ i i 1 2 n where ci is the principal component score value fac n is the score value of nth initial factor and sqr λi is the square root of the ith principal component eigenvalue we obtained the fac n value by factor analysis of the normalized data we obtained the comprehensive score of wr wecc in yuetang district from 2005 to 2015 by a weighted and comprehensive analysis as shown in fig 6 we draw on the relevant classification method song et al 2009 jia et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 to divide the wr wecc into three grades from the highest score 4 52 to the lowest score 2 02 the endpoint values were 1 5 and 0 5 respectively the wr wecc was divided into excellent grade i good grade ii and poor grade iii based on the calculation result the criteria for determining the wr wecc of yuetang district are shown in table 7 the calculation results of wr wecc in yuetang district are shown in table 8 the results show that the wr wecc of yuetang district gradually increased from 2005 to 2015 3 3 analysis of evaluation results 3 3 1 overall trend we provided the characteristic of nbs theories and methods by collecting and analysing ecological and social datasets developing a dynamic comprehensive model and presenting the research results at the regional scale in addition to small fluctuations in 2007 and 2011 the wr wecc of yuetang district generally increased year to year fig 5 fig 5 clearly shows the changing trend of wr wecc in yuetang district the change trend of the main component c1 score was basically consistent with the change trend of comprehensive score c the overall trend was increasing year by year which was mainly affected by socioeconomic level regional water environment governance and the increasing awareness of water ecological protection year by year the change in principal component c2 scores underwent two successive declines and then rose alternately which may be related to precipitation and water instability in the upper reaches of xiangjiang river years with a large decline occurred in 2007 and 2011 the annual average of precipitation decreased by approximately 20 in these two years especially in 2011 there was a provincewide drought in spring and summer in hunan province in 2011 for yuetang district where drought emergency engineering and measures are imperfect annual precipitation has an important impact on alleviating water shortage pressure and improving the wr wecc this can effectively alleviate the imbalance of water resources allocation and improve wr wecc during socioeconomic development the wr wecc of yuetang district has obvious differences under different time horizons and different levels of socioeconomic and eco environment development the comprehensive principal component score of wr wecc increased from 2 02 to 4 52 from 2005 to 2015 and the wr wecc level upgraded from grade iii poor to grade i excellent the utilization rate of reclaimed water in yuetang district has increased year to year the water saving level gradually improved and the water resource utility efficiency improved which effectively reduced the water intake of raw water therefore the demand for raw water resources for socioeconomic development was not high the water ecosystem quality in yuetang district is improving day by day and the amount of raw water used for environmental management and ecological improvement is reduced the wr wecc of yuetang district has shown an upward trend with the increasing level of socioeconomic development between 68 and 80 of the total water consumption in yuetang district comes from the xiangjiang river the passing water of the xiangjiang river is subject to changes in the amount of water from the upstream tributaries and the precipitation in the watershed the rhythm of the high low change is complicated although the wr wecc of yuetang district improved from 2005 to 2015 the risk of relying solely on the xiangjiang river as a water supply source to support regional socioeconomic development is extremely great and developing a diversified water supply system is an urgent need 3 3 2 the change trend of principal component the social development status and eco environmental protection of yuetang district are the main influencing factors of wr wecc the specific impact indexes of c1 include i7 i8 i9 i11 i12 i13 i14 i15 and i16 which are negatively correlated with c1 this information can be seen in table 2 1 the per capita gdp of yuetang district increased from 7 306 yuan usd 936 in 2005 to 142 770 yuan usd 22 922 in 2015 with the adjustment of regional industrial structure and the rise of modern high tech and ecological industries i8 increased from 20 87 in 2005 to 37 93 in 2015 with the change in resident living standards and living habits i9 increased from 621 48 m3 in 2005 to 901 58 m3 in 2015 2 yuetang district actively made plans for pollution prevention and control and environmental protection in key areas that provide drinking water sources participating in the organization and implementation of environmentally friendly society increases efforts to restrict discharging pollutants in the main stream of the xiangjiang river and its tributaries i13 i14 i15 and i16 increased year by year 3 with the strengthening of economic and technological promotion in yuetang district the exploration of new economic growth points and the improvement of water conservation for socioeconomic development the wr wecc has gradually expanded and the unit output value and water consumption of product decreased year by year the i11 decreased from 851 m3 in 2005 to 63 m3 in 2015 and water resource utility efficiency improved yuetang district actively adapted to the new normal of economic development and actively implemented a series of policy measures to promote economic development the overall economic operation was stable the i12 showed a downward trend from 1345 m3 in 2005 to 75 m3 in 2015 a drop of 17 percentage points regarding the second principal component c2 the total water resources and precipitation in yuetang district are unstable under the condition that the water conservancy project and flood control and drought resistance system are incomplete the wr wecc is subject to the natural water resources conservation amount and distribution to some extent regarding the third principal component c3 there is no significant correlation between urbanization level and economic and social development water consumption but it has the same variability trend as i9 in the second principal component c2 and there is a positive correlation between them the per capita water consumption mentioned in the paper mainly referred to the per capita water consumption of urban residents in recent years yuetang district has improved its water supply capacity and eco environmental water use rate with the implementation of water saving projects and green heart measures guo and hou 2010 3 4 management policy water management remains heavily dominated by traditional human built infrastructure and the enormous potential for nbs remains underutilized the participatory process for water management consisted of public consultation of draft documents plus informative discussion participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and or village environmental committees while in the case of water management a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association domestic water committees cooperative societies and various water user groups yuetang district has the opportunity and responsibility to apply nbs as a guiding economic strategy geared towards shifting water resource use the paper drew on the wr wecc grading evaluation standard which was combined with the pca method to evaluate the carrying capacity of yuetang district the wr wecc sub indexes of yuetang district in 2015 were all loadable within the scope of the indicator there was no overloading situation the future economic and social development model of yuetang district should target different regions and adopt different water resources water environment and water ecological regulation strategies lin et al 2011 according to the evaluation of wr wecc in yuetang district the water resources in yuetang district were still abundant and there was no shortage of resources but the domestic water yield was limited and the basin scale passing by water was highly dependent water environment improvement and comprehensive treatment of sewage are urgent due to the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization in yuetang district and water quality problems are increasingly important based on the relationship between humans and sustainable development of water resources the management policy includes strengthening integrated water management water demand management and water quality management to achieve the multifunctional value of water resources and improve the wr wecc meanwhile strengthening the construction of urban water resources comprehensive regulation such as by vigorously developing highly efficient water saving and green industry promotes the construction and management of sustainable development systems 4 conclusions the wr wecc evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate development and utilization methods for water resources to achieve the trade offs among the benefits system efficiency and costs based on relevant theories of water resource sustainable utilization evaluation system of improvement of water environment and assessment of the ecological maintenance functions the paper deeply analysed the interactions between various indicators and combined the long term data series of water resources water environment and water ecology to analyse the feasibility of regional water resources sustainable utilization the principles of operability and quantification based on nbs were used to construct a regional diversified wr wecc evaluation index system covering 3 subsystems and 16 indicators there was a strong positive correlation between the first principal component and i7 i8 i13 i14 i15 and i16 and a strong negative correlation between i9 i11 and i12 there was a strong positive correlation between the second principal component and i1 i2 i3 and i4 the third principal component was positively correlated with i6 the comprehensive principal component score of wr wecc increased from 2 02 to 4 52 from 2005 to 2015 and the wr wecc level upgraded from grade iii poor to grade i excellent the comprehensive analysis method was used to evaluate the temporal variation in wr wecc combined with

6800,the water resources water environment carrying capacity wr wecc is an important indicator for judging the regional macro control ability of water resources the nature based solutions nbs concept is related closely to sustainability harmonious and green development resources rational exploitation coupled human and environment and ecological protection priority participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and or village environmental committees while in the case of water management a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association domestic water committees cooperative societies and various water user groups the wr wecc evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade offs to realize the development and utilization of water resources water ecological conservation and water environment protection in yuetang district we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources water environment and water ecological characteristics applying the principal component analysis pca method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of wr wecc and explore a deep seated reason based on nbs the wr wecc evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource socioeconomic and eco environmental systems we used statistical product and service solutions spss 19 0 software and adopted the improved pca to integrate the urban economic social ecological development of the xiangjiang a tributary of the yangtze river river basin we applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of wr wecc of yuetang district from 2005 to 2015 based on nbs the wr wecc of yuetang district was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate the water use amount per ten thousand yuan gross domestic product gdp and per capita water resources in addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011 the wr wecc in yuetang district was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level regional water environment comprehensive management and awareness of water ecological protection the wr wecc of the yuetang district in 2013 2015 was in a class i excellent condition the temporal variations analysis based on nbs was proposed through a combination of economic social ecological values provided by nature based development and utilization patterns based on the relationship among regional water resources economic society and eco environment protection the paper supplied a wr wecc improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water rich area in south china keywords water resources water environmental carrying capacity evaluation index principal component analysis nature based solutions yuetang district 1 introduction due to population growth and economic development the limited capacity of regional water resources to support social and economic development has become a constraint to the overall coordination and spatial expansion of some regions the concept of the wr wecc is inseparable from the concept of limited load bearing and sustainable development which is an essential metric for measuring macroscopic control and optimized utilization of water resources meadows et al 1972 mori and christodoulou 2012 the current literature on wr wecc is rich and there are many types of concepts but there is no generalized uniform definition coccossis and mexa 2004 lane 2010 mei 2010 navarro et al 2013 wei et al 2014 martire et al 2015 ma et al 2017 researchers generally believe that the definition of wr wecc should focus on the coordinated development of the system with a focus on dealing with the complex contradictions between social development and extensive resource environmental systems shi et al 2013 tehrani and makhdoum 2013 munoz et al 2015 carrying capacity can support the social water cycle with regional scale water resources and environmental conditions and the goal is to maximize the effectiveness of the development and environmental protection of water resources graymore et al 2010 santoso et al 2014 human ecologists park and burgess 1921 proposed the carrying capacity concept and rijsberman and ven 2000 proposed the concept of wr wecc and provided relevant criteria for its determination joardar 1998 studied the connotation of urban water resources carrying capacity based on the diversity of water sources and used them as the basis for urban planning based on the basic supporting role of water resources harris kennedy 1999 used the evaluation results of agricultural production capacity and used the land water resources environmental carrying capacity as a comprehensive measure of land comprehensive utilization china s research on water resources carrying capacity wrcc began in the 1980s and is represented by the results of research on xinjiang water resources zeng et al 1991 ye 1992 the study of wrcc in the 1990s emerged from chinese scholars and was applied by the world fu and ji 1999 the main body of water in the wr wecc is natural water resources including the quality characteristics of water resources bielsa and duarte 2001 presented an economic model for the allocation of water to the agricultural irrigation and hydroelectric sectors to study the multi objective optimization of water resources allocation giuliani and castelletti 2013 used a multi agent simulation to model and analyse different levels of cooperation and information exchange and singh 2014 provided a multi objective algorithm and multi objective evaluation methods nbs encompass existing concepts such as natural capital and ecosystem services in economics and landscape functions in environmental planning fu et al 2018a the criteria of nbs were found in the examples of coastal management and the restoration of floodplains hoang et al 2018 morris et al 2018 nbs could help the recovery of well being and regional natural water resources panno et al 2017 in a narrow sense the object of wr wecc is the supported objects directly linked to water that are directly supported by water resources in a broad sense they are more closely related to water resources and are more affected by changes in water resources zhou and liang 2006 liang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 the water resources environmental coordinating role is the essence of water resources the ultimate supporting role of environmental carrying capacity and its own capacity of the system load are correlated the conventional tools and methodologies e g water resources carrying capacity assessment would then be embedded into such a modelling approach to provide a general sustainability assessment tool schaubroeck 2018 we supplied the relevance of the concept feature representation method based on the concept connotation of the wr wecc and nbs as shown in fig 1 yang et al 2016 ma 2016 lorenz and pusch 2012 the assessment of wr wecc based on nbs has an important impact on the evaluation of regional development space and resource environment coordination at present there are many literatures on wr wecc countermeasures in the arid regions of northwest and north and insufficient research in the water rich area in south china the current research scope is mainly based on dispersive quantity and quality single item evaluation and resource ecological environment diversity comprehensive research is less nbs can be linked to the sustainable use of water resources and water environmental protection the sustainability and health of the basin scale aquatic ecosystem and the design and management of new development balance ec 2015 the nbs can help us remain within a safe operating space for humanity improve local ecological and social sustainability and guarantee long term development the purpose of the wr wecc assessment is to analyse the relationship between limited water resources long term environmental protection and sustainability of ecological health thus trying to regulate inconsistencies in the development and utilization of regional water resources environmental protection the dynamic assessment of wr wecc mainly describes the development and utilization of water resources quantitatively in the region basin the common comprehensive evaluation methods currently include the fussy assessment method system dynamics method principal component analysis pca method and analytic hierarchy process ahp song et al 2011 liu and borthwick 2011 gong and jin 2009 lin et al 2011 in recent years wrcc evaluation methods include the bp neural network algorithm matter element analysis method and a grid search method based on geographic information system wang et al 2017 milstein et al 2018 as the reduced dimension processing method the simplest form of pca takes the linear combination of the original variables and adjusts the combination coefficients appropriately so that the new variables are independent and representative teffera et al 2018 pca not only loses less information but also compensates for the insufficiency of considering only a single wr wecc factor which is conducive to solving the problem that the conclusion is unreasonable because the value of the parameter is difficult to obtain the current research scope is mainly based on the dispersive quantity quality single item evaluation and the resource ecological environment multi integrated research is less studied the index weight calculation is mainly based on regional economy lacking a theoretical basis in the previous literature review of the comprehensive factors of quantity quality and water ecology integrated indicators are used to calculate the weights for evaluation however there is no physical mechanism therefore the current research mainly combines the regional wr wecc evaluation of water quality and water quantity strengthens the real time monitoring of the water quality dynamics of key sections and improves the dynamic evaluation database of the water environment carrying capacity as there is not a general sustainability assessment approach that assesses the impact of both natural and human industrial elements the wr wecc method would be applicable for evaluating human well being water resources and environmental and socioeconomic systems in a water rich region the wr wecc is based on nbs aiming to achieve the healthy and sustainable development of the resource environment social system and use optimized regulation technology to achieve regional social and economic maximization zhang et al 2018 fu et al 2018a countries worldwide have the opportunity and responsibility to apply nbs as a guiding economic strategy towards modifying their use of water resources for the benefit of nature and society maes and jacobs 2015 the nbs approach to we wrcc aims to challenge and reframe new water resource management methods by refocusing solutions from technological strategies to socioecological principles such as human well being development and water resource sustainable utilization therefore the evaluation of the carrying capacity status of the water socioecological environment has become key to achieving the overall coordinated and sustainable development of yuetang district the manuscript supplied a carrying capacity evaluation index system to explore the status of wr wecc in yuetang district using a pca method based on nbs the main components affecting dynamic changes of wr wecc were selected to analyse the data change over a long time series this paper is structured as follows 1 introduction elaborating on the background and theoretical significance of the research subject in this paper 2 materials and methods with subsections on the 1 the characteristics of yuetang district 2 model description based on nbs the pca method line correspondence and spss and 3 data collection economic and social data ecological information 3 results and discussion and 4 conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yuetang district is affiliated with xiangtan city hunan province with a total area of 206 4 km2 yuetang district is located at the northeastern end of xiangtan city where the xiangjiang river and the lianshui river meet fig 2 the surface water flow in yuetang district is sufficient and the water quality is in good condition the total amount of local water resources in yuetang district is limited the maximum availability of local water resources in 2005 2015 is approximately 40 although the water consumption in the xiangjiang river basin is unevenly distributed in time and space the xiangjiang river water resources provide a corresponding supply for production and life along the coast of yuetang district although the total amount of water resources in yuetang district in xiangtan city is rich it is unevenly distributed in time and space there are many problems related to water resource development and utilization water ecological conservation and water environmental protection the water resources in yuetang district are abundant and the annual average precipitation is 1350 mm but the interannual variation is large the per capita water resources in yuetang district are only 50 of the average level in hunan province and water shortages appears in some towns and villages the abundant basin scale passing of water resources from the xiangjiang river can effectively solve the problem of water shortages in yuetang district the utilization of the xiangjiang river passing water resources by yuetang district has increased year by year fig 3 yuetang district was selected as the study area to introduce the regional wr wecc quantitative evaluation and optimized utilization theory into a real world case yuetang district is a developing city lacking water resources seriously water resources per capita is 511 m3 yuetang district is the important industrial zone of xiangtan city it is a typical example of the harmonious development of chang zhu tan urban agglomeration yuetang district has a strong industrial base and a sound industrial system yuetang district has a solid industrial base and a complete modern industrial system the total production value of yuetang district was 50 04 billion yuan in 2015 in 2015 the population of yuetang district was 355 300 and the urbanization rate reached 95 7 the area is rich in precipitation but the amount of water available is small water resources problems has become a main factor of restricting the development of economy and society the problems faced by yuetang district represent the common problems faced by most cities in the yangtze river economic belt although the area of yuetang district is not large water problems are complicated the high water demand from many water users has resulted in low water availability in regional rivers vieira and sandoval solis 2018 the local water yield is insufficient and the interdependency on passing by water is high the studied case could reveal the current situation of wr wecc and offer guidance to water resources exploitation and socio economic development in the water rich area in south china 2 2 principal component analysis method the pca method classifies the original data information into several comprehensive variables with characterization significance by means of correlation coefficients to accurately reflect the core information for the evaluation indicators pca has been extensively used in the literature since its introduction by pearson 1901 and more importantly by hotelling 1933 based on the principle of pca the manuscript first normalized the original data and calculated the correlation coefficient matrix of the normalized data set second the eigenvalues of the correlation coefficient matrix and the corresponding eigenvectors were calculated and the contribution rate and the cumulative value were also calculated finally on the basis of determining the number of principal components accumulated contribution rate is greater than 85 we calculated the principal component score of the evaluation factor to evaluate the wr wecc the wr wecc improved with a higher score in the comprehensive evaluation index van den brink et al 2009 nemeth and rakosa 2018 the principle of pca based on nbs was illustrated in fig 4 the principal component score involves comprehensive data the meaning of the calculation result is not accurate if the index is not monotonous and consistent in this study we proposed an online multilinear principal component analysis algorithm which took full use of the old training samples and sharply reduced the time of dimension reduction han et al 2018 the method to determine the monotonicity and consistency was as follows 1 straight line correspondence assuming a linear relationship between the index value and the evaluation value the larger smaller the index value the better there were three typical transformations extreme value method the transformation of positive linear correlation 1 y i x i max x i max x i min x i where yi is the evaluation value and xi is the original data eigenvalue the transformation of negative linear correlation 2 y i max x i x i max x i min x i z score method 3 y i x i x s where x is the mean of xi s is the variance of x specific gravity method 4 y i x i i 1 n x i or y i x i i 1 n x i 2 2 polyline correspondence staged straight line correspondence it was assumed that the relationship between the eigenvalue and the evaluation value was different within different value domains and linearly correlated within the same value domain the transformation formula was as follows 5 y i 0 x 0 x i x m y m 0 x x m y m x i x m max x i x m 1 y m x x m where xm is the cutoff point value of each segment of straight line and the value of ym could be calculated by the extreme value method 3 curvilinear correspondence it was assumed that the influence of the actual value of the evaluation object on the evaluation value was not proportional the synchronous changes in the index value xi have a greater effect on the evaluation of yi in a certain interval and thus was reflected in the comprehensive evaluation curvilinear correspondences come in many forms the common forms are as follows 6 y 0 0 x a 1 e k x a x a 7 y 0 0 x a 1 e k x a 2 x a 8 y 0 0 x a a x a k 0 x a 1 a k 1 x a 1 a k where formula 6 7 is used in robust pca sparse probabilistic pca and sparse exponential family pca the related explanations are available in the literature smallman et al 2018 kwak 2008 zou et al 2006 assuming that a region observes p indexes the raw data matrix for n regions is 9 x x 11 x 12 x 1 p x 21 x 22 x 2 p x n 1 x 2 n x np x 1 x 2 x p 10 x j x 1 j x 2 j x nj t j 1 2 p the linear combination of p column vectors x 1 x 2 xp of the original data matrix x can be obtained 11 f 1 a 11 x 1 a 12 x 2 a 1 p x p f 2 a 21 x 1 a 22 x 2 a 2 p x p f p a p 1 x 1 a p 2 x 2 a pp x p the above linear equation is abbreviated as 12 f j a j 1 x 1 a j 2 x 2 a jp x p j 1 2 p the linear combination equation satisfies the following conditions simultaneously 13 a j 1 2 a j 2 2 a jp 2 1 j 1 2 p cov f i f j 0 var f 1 v a r f 2 v a r f p f 1 f 2 fn is called the principal component and the principal component data are obtained from the variance result the principal component information amount

contribution rate is 14 a i λ i i 1 p λ i the larger the contribution rate value ai in the formula the stronger the principal component information representativeness ability the manuscript selects n evaluation indicators x 1 x 2 xn and obtains new variables by pca vector transformation and data analysis namely z1 z2 zn p n the calculation process of principal component analysis is as follows 1 the raw data first needs to be standardized to eliminate the influence of dimensional differences 15 z x ij x ij x j σ j i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 n where xij is the original value of the jth indicator of the

the evaluation factor and rk is the selected principal component 2 3 data collection collecting the wr wecc data determines how outstanding local communities and peoples around yuetang district achieve the regional sustainable development goals through nature based actions in the process of the wr wecc evaluation the data of water resources exploration and utilization and available water supply amount are obtained from the runoff and precipitation data of xiangtan hydrological station the water resources bulletin of xiangtan city and the water resources statistical data the basic social and economic status of the region were obtained using the statistical yearbook data of yuetang district the quality of water resources was acquired from the water quality monitoring data of the xiangtan hydrology bureau the water use system is mainly composed of the economic and the social water use activities which supports economic development and life respectively zhou et al 2018 we used the relevant data in economic and social statistical bulletins and regional overall development plans to analyse the sewage treatment and ecological related information fu et al 2018b c 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation index system construction the manuscript comprehensively considered the impact of relevant factors on the regional water resources environment based on the research progress of the wrcc evaluation index system at home and abroad based on the statistical data of water resources social economy environmental protection and ecological system stability and diversity we constructed a wr wecc evaluation index system based on an nbs containing 3 subsystems and 16 evaluation indexes which consisted of social economy and ecological environment systems mei 2010 fang et al 2017 to avoid data distortion caused by different populations and geographical areas in different regions comprehensive indicators such as per capita land average utilization rate percentage and per capita water were used to construct the indicator system by drawing on the existing domestic and foreign achievements the index system for wr wecc should be based on the characteristics of water resources in regional or river basins emphasizing the status and process of operability to deeply study the internal factors that affect water use efficiency the water use subsystem could be further divided into a social water use subsystem and an economic water use subsystem hu et al 2018 the index system also should comprehensive reflect coupling coordination among the socio economic eco environmental benefits and sustainable use of water resources in general the factors affecting wr wecc generally include nature and development natural factors include soil water resources conditions and eco environment background conditions development factors refer to human activities including socio economic development patterns scale structure and speed to fully reflect the interregional differences the water resources endowment water resources development level economic development level urbanization level industrial structure water utilization structure water use efficiency would help objectively reflect the actual meaning of the indicators and facilitate the comparison of data during the series the wr wecc evaluation index system was listed in table 1 indicators with the notation were the general indicators 6 items the rest are regional indicators 10 items the social factors such as per capita education level per capita income level and people s awareness of environmental protection which are important factors affecting regional water consumption and water environment conditions but these factors are not easy to quantify and the index values are greatly affected by subjective factors although rainfall can be calculated on a monthly or 10 day scale regional economic social development indicators water quality changes and water ecological restoration status are usually measured on a yearly time scale and the impact of rainfall on surface runoff and water environment is also a slow process 3 2 comprehensive evaluation nbs use mimics natural processes to enhance water availability improve water quality and reduce risks associated with water related human society and natural environment change the paper selected 16 indexes covering the systems of resources economy and ecology table 2 due to the various types of evaluation indicators we gathered data from multiple departments and statics information from 2005 to 2015 it is so difficult to obtain many continuous data that we only collected limited related water quality data for analysing the socioeconomic development trend in 2005 2015 is obvious and the data series are continuous 3 2 1 standardization of raw data we used spss 19 0 statistical analysis software to perform principal component analysis on the raw data we used the correlation coefficient matrix to standardize the original data and eliminate the influence of magnitude and dimension on the correlation coefficient the correlation coefficient matrix of 16 evaluation indexes of wr wecc in yuetang district are shown in table 3 3 2 2 eigenvalue and contribution rates calculation of raw data there was a certain degree of correlation between the 16 evaluation indexes according to the correlation coefficient matrix among them i2 and i4 i8 and i14 i11 and i12 and i14 and i16 had strong correlations table 4 and the correlation coefficients were 0 998 0 992 0 992 and 0 991 respectively the calculation results were in accordance with the necessary conditions of pca indicating that there was overlap between the index information and it was suitable to use the pca method for correlation calculation zhao 2016 vajda et al 1985 flury 1986 we used spss 19 0 to calculate the eigenvalue contribution rate and cumulative contribution rate of the correlation coefficient matrix as listed in table 5 based on the principal component eigenvalue and contribution rate the eigenvalues were λ 1 8 956 λ 2 4 275 and λ 3 1 496 and the cumulative variance contribution rate of the first three principal components was 92 04 according to the principle that the cumulative contribution rate was greater than 85 to determine the number of principal components it was indicated that the first three principal components could represent the initial 16 indexes to analyse the wr wecc level of yuetang district boente and fraiman 1999 the variance contribution rate demonstrated that the contribution rate of the first principal component variance was 55 974 which was much larger than the contribution rate of the second and third principal components of 26 718 and 9 348 respectively ingredient analysis is shown in fig 5 the wr wecc of yuetang district mainly was controlled by the first principal component 3 2 3 principal component matrix and score principal component loading refers to the correlation coefficient between the three principal components and the variables the principal component matrix of yuetang district is shown in table 6 there was a strong positive correlation between the first principal component and i7 i8 i13 i14 i15 and i16 and there was a strong negative correlation between i9 i11 and i12 these indexes reflected the socioeconomic and ecological development of yuetang district there was a strong positive correlation between the second principal component and i1 i2 i3 and i4 reflecting the existing forms and supply features of water resources in yuetang district the third principal component was positively correlated with i6 the three principal components include water resources socio economy and eco environment which comprehensively cover the evaluation index of the wr wecc in yuetang district we classified the above three principal components as c1 c2 and c3 we used the percentages of the variance contribution rate total variance contribution rate as the principal component weight we calculated the comprehensive score of wr wecc of the yuetang district from 2005 to 2015 on the basis of addition the formula is as follows 21 c 0 55974 c 1 0 26718 c 2 0 09348 c 3 where c represents the comprehensive score of wr wecc in yuetang district the wr wecc improves with a higher score the relationship between the c1 c2 and c3 values and the unrotated initial factor score values are as follows 22 c i f a c n s q r λ i i 1 2 n where ci is the principal component score value fac n is the score value of nth initial factor and sqr λi is the square root of the ith principal component eigenvalue we obtained the fac n value by factor analysis of the normalized data we obtained the comprehensive score of wr wecc in yuetang district from 2005 to 2015 by a weighted and comprehensive analysis as shown in fig 6 we draw on the relevant classification method song et al 2009 jia et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 to divide the wr wecc into three grades from the highest score 4 52 to the lowest score 2 02 the endpoint values were 1 5 and 0 5 respectively the wr wecc was divided into excellent grade i good grade ii and poor grade iii based on the calculation result the criteria for determining the wr wecc of yuetang district are shown in table 7 the calculation results of wr wecc in yuetang district are shown in table 8 the results show that the wr wecc of yuetang district gradually increased from 2005 to 2015 3 3 analysis of evaluation results 3 3 1 overall trend we provided the characteristic of nbs theories and methods by collecting and analysing ecological and social datasets developing a dynamic comprehensive model and presenting the research results at the regional scale in addition to small fluctuations in 2007 and 2011 the wr wecc of yuetang district generally increased year to year fig 5 fig 5 clearly shows the changing trend of wr wecc in yuetang district the change trend of the main component c1 score was basically consistent with the change trend of comprehensive score c the overall trend was increasing year by year which was mainly affected by socioeconomic level regional water environment governance and the increasing awareness of water ecological protection year by year the change in principal component c2 scores underwent two successive declines and then rose alternately which may be related to precipitation and water instability in the upper reaches of xiangjiang river years with a large decline occurred in 2007 and 2011 the annual average of precipitation decreased by approximately 20 in these two years especially in 2011 there was a provincewide drought in spring and summer in hunan province in 2011 for yuetang district where drought emergency engineering and measures are imperfect annual precipitation has an important impact on alleviating water shortage pressure and improving the wr wecc this can effectively alleviate the imbalance of water resources allocation and improve wr wecc during socioeconomic development the wr wecc of yuetang district has obvious differences under different time horizons and different levels of socioeconomic and eco environment development the comprehensive principal component score of wr wecc increased from 2 02 to 4 52 from 2005 to 2015 and the wr wecc level upgraded from grade iii poor to grade i excellent the utilization rate of reclaimed water in yuetang district has increased year to year the water saving level gradually improved and the water resource utility efficiency improved which effectively reduced the water intake of raw water therefore the demand for raw water resources for socioeconomic development was not high the water ecosystem quality in yuetang district is improving day by day and the amount of raw water used for environmental management and ecological improvement is reduced the wr wecc of yuetang district has shown an upward trend with the increasing level of socioeconomic development between 68 and 80 of the total water consumption in yuetang district comes from the xiangjiang river the passing water of the xiangjiang river is subject to changes in the amount of water from the upstream tributaries and the precipitation in the watershed the rhythm of the high low change is complicated although the wr wecc of yuetang district improved from 2005 to 2015 the risk of relying solely on the xiangjiang river as a water supply source to support regional socioeconomic development is extremely great and developing a diversified water supply system is an urgent need 3 3 2 the change trend of principal component the social development status and eco environmental protection of yuetang district are the main influencing factors of wr wecc the specific impact indexes of c1 include i7 i8 i9 i11 i12 i13 i14 i15 and i16 which are negatively correlated with c1 this information can be seen in table 2 1 the per capita gdp of yuetang district increased from 7 306 yuan usd 936 in 2005 to 142 770 yuan usd 22 922 in 2015 with the adjustment of regional industrial structure and the rise of modern high tech and ecological industries i8 increased from 20 87 in 2005 to 37 93 in 2015 with the change in resident living standards and living habits i9 increased from 621 48 m3 in 2005 to 901 58 m3 in 2015 2 yuetang district actively made plans for pollution prevention and control and environmental protection in key areas that provide drinking water sources participating in the organization and implementation of environmentally friendly society increases efforts to restrict discharging pollutants in the main stream of the xiangjiang river and its tributaries i13 i14 i15 and i16 increased year by year 3 with the strengthening of economic and technological promotion in yuetang district the exploration of new economic growth points and the improvement of water conservation for socioeconomic development the wr wecc has gradually expanded and the unit output value and water consumption of product decreased year by year the i11 decreased from 851 m3 in 2005 to 63 m3 in 2015 and water resource utility efficiency improved yuetang district actively adapted to the new normal of economic development and actively implemented a series of policy measures to promote economic development the overall economic operation was stable the i12 showed a downward trend from 1345 m3 in 2005 to 75 m3 in 2015 a drop of 17 percentage points regarding the second principal component c2 the total water resources and precipitation in yuetang district are unstable under the condition that the water conservancy project and flood control and drought resistance system are incomplete the wr wecc is subject to the natural water resources conservation amount and distribution to some extent regarding the third principal component c3 there is no significant correlation between urbanization level and economic and social development water consumption but it has the same variability trend as i9 in the second principal component c2 and there is a positive correlation between them the per capita water consumption mentioned in the paper mainly referred to the per capita water consumption of urban residents in recent years yuetang district has improved its water supply capacity and eco environmental water use rate with the implementation of water saving projects and green heart measures guo and hou 2010 3 4 management policy water management remains heavily dominated by traditional human built infrastructure and the enormous potential for nbs remains underutilized the participatory process for water management consisted of public consultation of draft documents plus informative discussion participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and or village environmental committees while in the case of water management a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association domestic water committees cooperative societies and various water user groups yuetang district has the opportunity and responsibility to apply nbs as a guiding economic strategy geared towards shifting water resource use the paper drew on the wr wecc grading evaluation standard which was combined with the pca method to evaluate the carrying capacity of yuetang district the wr wecc sub indexes of yuetang district in 2015 were all loadable within the scope of the indicator there was no overloading situation the future economic and social development model of yuetang district should target different regions and adopt different water resources water environment and water ecological regulation strategies lin et al 2011 according to the evaluation of wr wecc in yuetang district the water resources in yuetang district were still abundant and there was no shortage of resources but the domestic water yield was limited and the basin scale passing by water was highly dependent water environment improvement and comprehensive treatment of sewage are urgent due to the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization in yuetang district and water quality problems are increasingly important based on the relationship between humans and sustainable development of water resources the management policy includes strengthening integrated water management water demand management and water quality management to achieve the multifunctional value of water resources and improve the wr wecc meanwhile strengthening the construction of urban water resources comprehensive regulation such as by vigorously developing highly efficient water saving and green industry promotes the construction and management of sustainable development systems 4 conclusions the wr wecc evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate development and utilization methods for water resources to achieve the trade offs among the benefits system efficiency and costs based on relevant theories of water resource sustainable utilization evaluation system of improvement of water environment and assessment of the ecological maintenance functions the paper deeply analysed the interactions between various indicators and combined the long term data series of water resources water environment and water ecology to analyse the feasibility of regional water resources sustainable utilization the principles of operability and quantification based on nbs were used to construct a regional diversified wr wecc evaluation index system covering 3 subsystems and 16 indicators there

between the second principal component and i1 i2 i3 and i4 the third principal component was positively correlated with i6 the comprehensive principal component score of wr wecc increased from 2 02 to 4 52 from 2005 to 2015 and the wr wecc level upgraded from grade iii poor to grade i excellent the comprehensive analysis method was used to evaluate the temporal variation in wr wecc combined with the evaluation results of wr wecc the development trend of wr wecc in yuetang district was evaluated and the main factors affecting regional wr wecc change were sought finally improvements and improvement strategies were proposed the nbs proved to be an effective tool to facilitate an understanding of local water resources in the environmental system and prioritize solutions for resource allocation and environmental protection however there was still some uncertainty when integrating the method of wr wecc index standardization the method of principal component determination and the weights of contribution rates developing integrated quantitative methods for dynamic evaluation of wr wecc would be worthwhile limited by a lack of information the paper uses the principal component analysis method to evaluate the time difference of the water resources carrying capacity of yuetang from 2005 to 2015 the analysis of the evaluation results of the regional spatial level should be

6801,pumping stations pss are common regulation facilities in a water distribution system with complex hydraulic characteristics and hydraulic parameters in this study a data assimilation based approach was proposed for the correction of ps parameters in which a 1d hydrodynamic model with ps inner boundary was established and then the ensemble kalman filter enkf framework was used to correct ps parameters in enkf framework the combination of the ps parameters was considered as the state vector and water levels and discharge as observation vectors the 1d hydrodynamic model was taken as the observation operator that constructs the mapping relationship between the state and the observation vector the method s reliability was demonstrated through the case of niantou ps in the middle route of south north water transfer project verification results show that the proposed method can accurately inverse ps parameters compared with the simulation results using ps parameters based on physical model experiments the ps parameters corrected by the data assimilation method can greatly improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic simulation this data assimilation based method can be used for parameter inversion of other complex hydraulic structures keywords parameter correction pumping station hydrodynamic model data assimilation ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction the 1d open channel hydrodynamic models have been extensively used in the large scale regional simulation of various water bodies lian et al 2007 remo and pinter 2007 biancamaria et al 2009 paz et al 2010 paiva et al 2011 and flood forecast mark et al 2004 liu et al 2010 neal et al 2012 liu and chung 2014 li et al 2016 because of their high computational efficiency however the accuracy of these models can be compromised by many factors such as initial conditions desmarais and kuerten 2014 boundary conditions pappenberger et al 2006 liu et al 2016 and geometry data pramanik et al 2010 safazadeh maleki and khan 2015 podhoranyi and fedorcak 2015 those 1d hydrodynamic models based on saint venant equations are inherently subject to errors induced by the simplified assumptions and numerical discretization zhang and bao 2013 model parameters also need to be accurately identified and calibrated in order to obtain a high simulation accuracy in this context much recent research has focused on the identification of roughness coefficient in 1d open channel hydrodynamic models the trial and error method is often used for this purpose tang et al 2010 however a major problem of this method is that it depends heavily on the experience of hydrologists lin and wang 2007 and thus it may be not applicable to complex networks to address this problem various gradient based or heuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed to automatically identify roughness coefficient notable examples of which include sequential quadratic programming algorithm ramesh et al 2000 limited memory quasi newton ding et al 2004 ding and wang 2005 and variational lagrangian multipliers atanov et al 1999 nguyen et al 2015 tang et al 2010 and ayvaz 2013 adopted heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm to inverse the roughness of river networks respectively in recent years the data assimilation technique has been introduced to track changes in roughness wu et al 2008 lai et al 2013 however it is important to note that the parameters of other hydraulic structures in rivers also need to be calibrated for example pumps and sluice gates in the tidal river network can have a direct effect on regional hydrodynamic process yin et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 hu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the middle route of the south to north water transfer project is a large scale water transfer project aiming to transfer water from the yangtze river in southern china to the more arid northern china and it has numerous inverted siphons bridges tunnels gates culverts aqueducts and other hydraulic structures for various purposes tang et al 2013 tang et al 2014 the pumping station ps plays an important role in agriculture irrigation wang and qian 2017 urban drainage lee et al 2016a b yazdi et al 2016 inter basin water transfer du et al 2015 etc it differs significantly from other hydraulic structures in terms of hydraulic characteristics and the complex head discharge relationship in the 1d open channel hydrodynamic models the head discharge relationship is described by a quadratic characteristic curve of pumps with three parameters lamaddalena and khila 2013 however the direct use of these parameters could cause large simulation errors because the curve is generally obtained from physical model experiments that may suffer from scale effects bettaieb and taieb 2015 and importantly it is generated under static conditions rather than under dynamic conditions wu et al 2013 in the actual operation the characteristic curve should be adjusted according to changes in blade angle or pump revolution speed tan et al 2012 resulting in dynamic changes in model parameters accordingly there is a need to correct ps parameters by the effective field data to improve the simulation accuracy data assimilation is an effective method to correct system parameters ide et al 1997 kalnay 2003 habert et al 2016 the basic idea of which is to quantify errors in both the numerical model and observations and update model states in a way that optimally combines model simulations with observations clark et al 2008 it has gained much popularity in oceanography haugen and evensen 2002 zhang et al 2007 hydrology ricci et al 2011 man et al 2016 and petroleum engineering nævdal et al 2002 lee et al 2016a b in recent years it has been applied to the hydrodynamic field including state correction and roughness inversion madsen and skotner 2005 matgen et al 2010 amour et al 2013 huang et al 2013 garcia pintado et al 2015 compared with optimization methods the assimilation method has higher efficiency in parameter inversion however whether it is suitable for multi parameter simultaneous inversion of complex hydraulic structures in the 1d hydrodynamic model remains to be determined compared with other data assimilation techniques the ensemble kalman filter enkf introduced by evensen 1994 is more widely used due to its many advantageous properties such as non intrusive formulation high robustness and reasonable computational requirements gharamti et al 2015 in enkf random ensembles are first generated to obtain the initial distribution of the state variables followed by forecast and update stages in the forecast stage new forecast ensembles are formed from the previous update ensembles based on the mapping of the corresponding states in these ensembles while in the update stage a kalman update is applied to each member of the forecast ensembles using perturbed observations separately evensen 2003 enkf requires no calculation of error covariance but rather it uses an appropriate ensemble to reflect the same error statistics making it a reliable method to solve non linear filtering problems the purpose of this study is to correct ps parameters to improve the accuracy of the 1d open channel hydrodynamic model a 1d hydrodynamic model for open channels was established using ps compatibility equations and saint venant equations and then the enkf was used to inverse ps parameters in the hydrodynamic model verification results show that the proposed method can accurately correct ps parameters and the simulation accuracy can be significantly improved in a real project using these corrected parameters the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology used to treat ps inner boundary and parameter correction section 3 describes the validation of the proposed method in detail section 4 presents the method application and the simulation results with corrected parameters and section 5 gives the conclusions drawn in this study 2 methodology in this section a 1d open channel hydrodynamic model with ps inner boundary is established and then used in the enkf framework to inverse ps parameters 2 1 1d hydrodynamic model saint venant equations venutelli 2002 islam et al 2008 yi et al 2017 are often used to describe the 1d flow in open channels 1 b z t q x q 2 q t x α q 2 a g a z x g a s f 0 where b m is the channel cross sectional width z m is the water level t s is the time q m3 s is the discharge x m is the distance along the channel q m3 s is the lateral inflow α is the momentum correction coefficient a m2 is the wetted cross sectional area g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration and s f is the friction slope which can be calculated from the following equation 3 s f n 2 q q a 2 r 4 3 where n is the manning s roughness coefficient and r m is the hydraulic radius of the channel section in the hydrodynamic model the preissmann four point implicit difference scheme is adopted to discretize eqs 1 and 2 based on which the linearized equations between the i th and i 1 th cross sections can be described as follows 4 q i 1 n 1 q i n 1 c i z i 1 n 1 c i z i n 1 d i 5 e i q i n 1 g i q i 1 n 1 f i z i 1 n 1 f i z i n 1 φ i where q i n 1 and z i n 1 are the discharge and water level of the i th cross section at the n 1 th time step respectively and the coefficients of c i d i e i g i f i and φ i are calculated by the model parameters and the hydraulic elements at the n th time step these coefficients can be expressed as 6 c i b i 1 2 n δ x i 2 δ t θ d i q i 1 2 δ x i θ 1 θ θ q i 1 n q i n c i z i 1 n z i n e i δ x i 2 θ δ t α u i n g u n 2 2 θ r 4 3 i n δ x i g i δ x i 2 θ δ t α u i 1 n g u n 2 2 θ r 4 3 i 1 n δ x i f i g a i 1 2 n φ i δ x i 2 θ δ t q i 1 n q i n 1 θ θ α u q i 1 n α u q i n 1 θ θ g a i 1 2 n z i 1 n z i n where δ x i m is the distance between the i th and i 1 th cross sections δ t s is the time interval θ is the discrete weighting coefficient θ 0 75 and u m s is the average flow velocity in order to correct the ps parameters the continuity equation and the h q characteristic curve of the ps are chosen as the ps compatibility equations which are coupled with saint venant equations these compatibility equations can be written as follows 7 q out q in 8 h ps z out z in a ps q out 2 b ps q out c ps where q out m3 s and q in m3 s are the discharge of the ps at the outlet and inlet side h ps m is the net head of the ps z out m and z in m are the water level of the ps at the outlet and inlet side and a ps b ps and c ps are the parameters of the characteristic curve of the ps respectively in this hydrodynamic model the running units in the ps are treated as a whole when only one pump unit is switched on these parameters are equal to the coefficients of the characteristic curve of the unit which are usually available from the manufacturers and may vary greatly depending on the operating conditions of pumps however if there are more than one running pump unit the characteristic curve of the ps is formed by accumulating the discharges at the same heads of each running unit the ps parameters are equal to the coefficients of the combined characteristic curve the compatibility conditions of ps can also be linearized like the open channel equations assuming the inlet side and the outlet side of the ps are the k th section and the k 1 th section respectively eq 7 can be linearized as follows 9 q k 1 n 1 q k n 1 c k z k 1 n 1 c k z k n 1 d k in which c k d k 0 it is crucial to linearize the h q characteristic curve of the ps reasonably the taylor series expansion method gottardi and venutelli 2008 is used for eq 8 and then the second order and higher terms can be omitted then the linearized h q curve can be written as 10 h ps n 1 h ps n h ps n δ q k 1 a ps q k 1 n 2 b ps q k 1 n c ps 2 a ps q k 1 n b ps q k 1 n 1 q k 1 n considering eq 8 eq 10 can be converted to the following equation 11 2 a ps q k 1 n b ps q k 1 n 1 z k 1 n 1 z k n 1 a ps q k 1 n 2 c ps similar to eq 5 the linearized h q curve equation can be written as 12 e k q k n 1 g k q k 1 n 1 f k z k 1 n 1 f k z k n 1 φ k in which e k 0 g k 2 a ps q k 1 n b ps f k 1 and φ k a ps q k 1 n 2 c ps for a simulation area containing a ps inner boundary the linearized equations eqs 4 and 5 of each channel and the linearized ps equations eqs 9 and 12 are coupled to form a linear system of equations when the external boundary conditions are known the chasing method wang et al 2015 is used to solve the equation system finally the hydrodynamic process of this area is obtained 2 2 correction of ps parameters based on the enkf framework a state space model is often used to describe the dynamic changes in the studied system in which the implied time is taken as an independent variable this model contains two basic equations a state equation and an observation equation the state equation aims to pass the true state vector x n to the next moment x n 1 in the forecast stage which can be written as ide et al 1997 13 x n 1 m n x n η n 1 in which n 1 and n denote the time steps m n is the forecast operator that can reflect the relationship between x n and x n 1 and η n 1 is the model error vector that is independent white noise for the forecast model and parameters drawn from multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance q n 1 the observation equation aims to construct the mapping between the true state vector x n 1 and the observation vector y n 1 in the update stage which can be expressed as follows ide et al 1997 14 y n 1 h n 1 x n 1 ε n 1 in which h n 1 is the observation operator and ε n 1 is the observation error vector which accounts for instrument processing and representation errors this error vector is also assumed to be independent white noise that follows multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance o n 1 the difference between the correction of hydraulic parameters and that of hydraulic elements the water level and discharge is mainly manifested in m n and h n 1 in hydrodynamic model the hydraulic elements are always the simulation results using the hydraulic parameters therefore the state vector consists only of these ps parameters in the ps parameters correction process that is x n a ps n b ps n c ps n t because no change will occur in these parameters during the stable operation of pump units m n is taken as the unit matrix i the 1d hydrodynamic model provides a direct link between ps parameters x n 1 and observation elements y n 1 the water level and discharge in the hydrodynamic system this model is therefore used as a non linear observation operator h n 1 in the enkf framework in addition since the correction of hydraulic parameters does not change the original hydraulic elements the imbalance generated by the enkf can also be ignored the characteristic curve of pump units depends largely on the pump type axial flow pump or mixed flow pump and its operating conditions such as blade angle when the angle is constant the parameters of ps s combined characteristic curve is also time invariant this feature facilitates the inversion of ps parameters for the convenience of illustration the axial pump is selected as an example which changes operating condition by adjusting its blade angle to meet the water demand the correction process of ps parameters is shown in fig 1 and the correction process for other types of pumps is exactly the same as for axial pumps assuming that the initial ps parameters are x 0 a ps 0 b ps 0 c ps 0 t and the initial ensemble member can be generated using these parameters plus a random disturbance this process can be expressed as 15 x j 0 e x 0 ζ j where the subscript j indicates the j th member in the corresponding ensemble and ζ j is independent white noise that follows multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance r r is determined by the method of obtaining the initial parameters the initial parameters x 0 are usually available from the characteristic curves provided by the manufacturer which have a certain scale effect the population of x j 0 e j 1 2 j is called the initial ensemble or the initial analysis ensemble x j 0 a j 1 2 j the appropriate ensemble size in the hydraulic parameter correction model will be discussed in the verification section in the implementation of enkf each member of the initial or analysis ensemble successively performs the forecasting and correction process in parallel if the state vector at the n th moment x j n a is known the state vector at the next moment x j n 1 a can be obtained by the following three steps in the first step the disturbance forecast vector at the n 1 th moment x j n 1 f is calculated and the forecast vector is directly equivalent to the analysis state vector considering that there is no interference in the delivery process this step can be expressed as 16 x j n 1 f ix j n a x j n a the population of x j n 1 f j 1 2 j is called the forecast ensemble at the n 1 th moment the second step is to calculate the disturbance innovation which is defined as the difference between observed and predicted values thus 17 d j n 1 y n 1 ε j n 1 h n 1 x j n 1 f where d j n 1 is the j th member of the innovation vector both water level and discharge can be used as observation values to correct ps parameters for an invariant angle period the measurement data at that period is taken as the observation vector the last step is to calculate the disturbance analysis value x j n 1 a obviously this step is the core of filtering in which the innovation is used to correct the forecast value the correction process can be expressed as 18 x j n 1 a x j n 1 f k n 1 d j n 1 in which k n 1 is called kalman gain that determines the ratio between the forecasting mode and observation states during assimilation processes k n 1 can be written as 19 k n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t h n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t o n 1 1 in which p n 1 is the predictive error covariance matrix since the true state is not known the covariance matrix of the ensemble is generally defined around the ensemble mean therefore p n 1 can be expressed as 20 p n 1 1 j 1 j 1 j x j n 1 f x n 1 f x j n 1 f x n 1 f where x n 1 f is the average of x j n 1 f j 1 2 j in practical applications p n 1 h n 1 t and h n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t are often calculated directly to reduce the computational load zheng et al 2009 and facilitate model calculation which can be defined as 21 p n 1 h n 1 t 1 j 1 j 1 j x j n 1 f x n 1 f h n 1 x j n 1 f h n 1 x n 1 f t 22 h n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t 1 j 1 j 1 j h n 1 x j n 1 f h n 1 x n 1 f h n 1 x j n 1 f h n 1 x n 1 f t then it is necessary to determine whether the calculation should be repeated if n 1 is less than n where n is the number of observations at the correction position during the filter period the loop should continue however if n 1 is equal to n the loop should stop and the final corrected state vector x c can be expressed as follows 23 x c a ps c b ps c c ps c t 1 j j 1 j x j n a these corrected parameters a ps c b ps c and c ps c can be stored and used for future simulations in tidal river networks or water transfer systems there are other complex multi parameter hydraulic structures such as sluice gates inverted siphons etc taking the parameters of these structures as the state vector of the enkf model parameter correction can also be performed using the proposed method 3 verification in this section the experimental area is described and then the designed parameter correction schemes are verified 3 1 experimental area description niantou pumping station ntps located in beijing is considered in this study as shown in fig 2 it is the third level of the cascade pumping station system in the miyun reservoir regulation and storage project of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project the total length of the tested channel from the upstream boundary point a to the downstream boundary point b is 34 1 km the channel can be divided into two parts section i and ii in fig 2 by ntps and it has an isosceles trapezoid shaped cross section with a bottom width of 20 0 m and a side slope coefficient of 2 5 the bottom elevation of point a is 48 41 m and the bottom slope of the channel is 0 000062 in ntps four identical axial pump units are installed including three frequently used ones and an emergency one the design discharge of each unit is 6 67 m3 s fig 3 shows the h q characteristic curves of these pump units in ntps provided by the manufacturer and their expressions and the ps parameters a ps p b ps p c ps p based on physical model experiments at each blade angle are shown in table 1 it should be noted that the actual operating angles of these units are usually an integral multiple of 0 5 the characteristic curves at other angles are generally interpolated from the basic curves 4 2 0 2 these parameters may be not accurate for several reasons such as model errors scale effects and interpolation errors and thus need to be corrected precisely for the 1d hydrodynamic model the roughness coefficient of the channel should be calibrated prior to the correction of these parameters to avoid mutual interference between various hydraulic structure parameters the roughness coefficients of the two sections were calibrated separately using the unsteady flow measurement data the positions of upstream and downstream boundaries are shown in table 2 taking the water level at the upstream boundary as a reference the purpose of the calibration is to minimize the difference between observed and simulated values using the trial and error method oezkundakci et al 2012 the calibrated roughness coefficients of section i and ii are 0 043 and 0 035 respectively which are slightly higher than those of common lining channels due to the resistance of aquatic plants to the water flow the root mean square errors of the water levels simulated by these roughness coefficients are less than 0 05 m which satisfies simulation requirements after the calibration of channel parameters their interference with the correction of ps parameters can be ignored 3 2 correction scheme design and verification 3 2 1 correction scheme the characteristic curve of the prototype unit in ps is often difficult to obtain that is the true values of ps parameters are usually unknown in order to verify the correction effect of ps parameters a set of parameters a ps t b ps t c ps t is assumed to be true and used for hydrodynamic simulation then the simulation results plus disturbance are taken as the actual observation value and the proposed model is used to correct the ps parameters with a certain initial error in this correction scheme the true parameters a ps t b ps t and c ps t are 0 033 8 0 0420 and 5 4205 respectively the upstream and downstream boundary processes of the hydrodynamic model are shown in fig 4 a and the simulation results of ntps in fig 4 b the durations of the simulation and correction processes are both 2 days 3 2 2 measurements and error covariance in this experimental area electronic water level gauges were installed on the inlet and outlet sides of ntps respectively and flow meters were installed on each pump unit the discharge and water level at the entrance and exit of the tested channel were also measured in verification and application sections the observation vector is composed of the observed discharge inlet side and outlet side water levels of ntps y n 1 q in out n 1 o z in n 1 o z out n 1 o t the frequency of all variables was observed every 30 min observed error covariance mainly depends on the inherent error of the measurement equipment in ntps the measurement error of the used electronic water gauge is 0 02 m and that of the flowmeter is 5 therefore the main diagonal elements of the covariance matrix o n 1 are assumed to be 5 2 0 022 and 0 022 and the remaining elements are 0 since the hydrodynamic simulation results do not have noise characteristics they cannot be directly used as observation values in this correction scheme the ps simulation results added white noise are taken as real observation values and this noise also follows multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance o n 1 3 2 3 ensemble size ensemble size is one of the most important variables in the enkf framework generally the number of members j in the ensemble should be about 100 to obtain a representative distribution and a proper covariance matrix required subsequently madsen and skotner 2005 due to the large computational load of the hydrodynamic model the multi process parallel calculation is time consuming therefore the effect of parameter correction in the case of other ensemble sizes j 10 20 30 50 was examined in this study assuming that each parameter has a 10 initial error the initial parameters a ps 0 b ps 0 and c ps 0 are 0 0 304 0 0 378 and 4 8785 respectively fig 5 shows the correction results of the three ps parameters under different ensemble sizes it can be seen from fig 5 a and c that a ps n and c ps n can gradually converge to the true values after approximately 60 assimilation cycles at different ensemble sizes however b ps n does not completely converge to the true value eventually it can also be seen that the correction model does not have exactly the same correction effect on different parameters fig 5 b shows that when the ensemble size is 30 the corrected parameter b ps c is the closest to its true value compared with a ps n and c ps n b ps is an insensitive parameter described in section 3 2 4 that is easily affected by sensitive parameters observation disturbances and model disturbances when the ensemble size is 50 the various disturbances caused by the observation and the model may also increase resulting in b ps not converging this result also indicates that the requirement of correcting the ps parameters can be substantially satisfied when the ensemble size is equal to 30 therefore j 30 is chosen as the ensemble size in the subsequent verification and application 3 2 4 analysis of corrected parameters fig 6 a b and c show the variations of the mean and member values of the ps parameters in the correction process when the ensemble size is 30 as mentioned above the initial ensemble is generated from the initial parameters plus random perturbations considering the scale effect the loss of import and export of ps and trash rack loss the main diagonal elements of the covariance matrix r are assumed to be 10 2 it can be clearly seen from fig 6 a and c that a ps n and c ps n can gradually converge to the true value in each ensemble member however fig 6 b illustrates that b ps n in each member is stably dispersed around the mean value during the correction process which is significantly different from a ps n and c ps n to analyze the reason for this difference both the curve with true parameters a ps t 0 0338 b ps t 0 0420 c ps t 5 4205 and that with corrected parameters a ps c 0 03360 b ps c 0 0429 c ps c 5 4082 are plotted in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 the two curves basically coincide in the discharge range of 6 5 12 0 m3 s the difference between the heads of the two curves does not exceed 0 01 m this result shows that the curve with corrected parameters can reflect the h q characteristics of the curve with true parameters further the influence of b ps on the curve is obviously less than that of a ps and c ps in the operating discharge range 3 2 5 initial error of ps parameters in actual projects the initial error of ps parameters is not easy to measure which is assumed to be 10 in the above in this part other initial errors are separately tested including 10 20 and 20 fig 8 presents the correction results for each parameter at different initial error levels each parameter gradually converges to the true value and tends to stabilize after about 60 times of assimilation under different conditions the corrected parameters with different initial errors are listed in table 3 as illustrated by table 3 although the relative error of the corrected parameters becomes larger as the initial error increases the corrected parameters a ps c and c ps c at various initial error levels are less than 2 relative to the true value in addition b ps which has less influence on h q curve is also effectively corrected for example when its initial error is 20 the relative error after model correction is only 7 47 thus the proposed method can accurately correct the hydraulic parameters especially when the error is within 10 4 application and discussion based on the measured data the proposed method was applied to inverse the ps parameters at different fixed angles subsequently the hydrodynamic simulations were separately performed using the corrected parameters cps and the parameters based on physical model experiments pps 4 1 parameter correction at different fixed angles the parameters under guide vane body with fixed blade angles were corrected as no change is observed in the angles of pump units for the period from 7 00 on april 26 2016 to 19 00 on april 29 2016 this 36 h period is chosen as the assimilation period two units ran during this time period at a blade angle of 6 the curve parameters of pump units are 0 1352 0 0839 and 5 4205 at this angle and 0 0338 0 042 and 5 4205 after the merge of the two curves respectively which are the pps of ntps for simulation the enkf framework coupled with the hydrodynamic model is applied for the research area the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model shown in fig 9 are the discharge process at point a and the water level process at point b respectively the water levels at the inlet side and the outlet side are chosen as the observations and thus there is a total of 73 sets of observations at an observation step of 30 min the variances of initial parameter error water level and discharge observation error are 10 2 0 022 and 5 2 respectively fig 10 shows the variation of ps parameters in enkf it can be clearly seen from fig 10 a and c that parameters a ps n and c ps n converge to stable values after 60 assimilation cycles and their ensemble variances gradually decrease with the number of assimilations in fig 10 b parameter b ps does not change notably during the correction process which has been proved to have less effect on the h q curve the final cps of the two units at an operating angle of 6 are 0 0356 0 0407 and 6 8985 respectively fig 11 shows the simulation results at the fixed angles using pps and cps fig 11 a and c indicate that the inlet side and outlet side water levels simulated using cps are in better agreement with observations than that using pps also the simulated discharge using cps has also improved significantly as shown in fig 11 b however it is noted that although those simulated values using pps tend to have large simulation errors the overall trend is consistent with the observations generally the maximum errors of the simulated values using cps are observed at the initial stage which can be caused by the initial conditions of the hydrodynamic model fig 11 also shows that ps parameters can have a significant effect on the simulation results table 4 shows the effects of the two sets of parameters on the simulation results for cps the correlation coefficient between observed and simulated water levels at the inlet side is as high as 0 8897 whereas that at the outlet side is 0 8877 respectively the average of which are higher than that for pps as the observed discharge is a constant no correlation coefficient can be calculated the root mean square error of the discharge simulated using cps is only 0 29 m3 s and the relative error of the water levels at the inlet and outlet side and the discharge can be controlled within 2 5 it should be noted that the reference value of the water level relative error is the average depth over time in conclusion all the evaluation indexes indicate that the simulation with the use of cps is more effective by the aforementioned method the parameters under other blade angles are acquired based on the existing history data 4 2 hydrodynamic simulation using the corrected parameters to further verify the reliability of cps the hydrodynamic process under variable angles is simulated and the simulation period is 120 h from 0 00 on april 25 2016 to 0 00 on april 29 2016 the angles and ps parameters for each period are listed in table 5 and the boundary conditions are shown in fig 12 the pps and cps series are input into the hydrodynamic model separately to simulate the hydrodynamic process as shown in fig 13 similarly it is obvious that the water level fig 13 a and b or discharge fig 13 c simulated using cps are in better agreement with observations than that using pps changes in water demand often result in dynamic adjustment of discharge the variable angles can lead to abrupt changes in hydraulic elements which is particularly evident for the discharge of ntps as illustrated by fig 13 c the maximum simulation errors of water level and discharge are also observed when the unit angles change table 6 shows the simulation results at variable blade angles the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is also used to evaluate the long sequence simulation results of which the optimal value is 1 0 it clearly shows that all nses using the cps are higher compared with that using pps in particular the nse of the discharge is as high as 0 90 the root mean square errors of the water levels are less than 5 cm and the relative error can still be controlled within 3 all evaluation indicators show that using the cps can significantly improve the hydrodynamic simulation accuracy 5 conclusions in this study a 1d open channel hydrodynamic model with ps components was established and then the enkf framework was used to correct ps parameters the proposed method can effectively inverse ps parameters and the cps can significantly improve simulation accuracy thus this method can be extended to the inversion of ps parameters in any river or channel networks as well as the parameter correction of other single or multi parameter hydraulic structures however the proposed method has a different correction effect on each parameter of multi parameter structures therefore the influence of each parameter on the hydrodynamic model remains to be further studied to improve the accuracy of parameter correction acknowledgements the work was supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405900 and national natural science foundation of china grant nos

6801,pumping stations pss are common regulation facilities in a water distribution system with complex hydraulic characteristics and hydraulic parameters in this study a data assimilation based approach was proposed for the correction of ps parameters in which a 1d hydrodynamic model with ps inner boundary was established and then the ensemble kalman filter enkf framework was used to correct ps parameters in enkf framework the combination of the ps parameters was considered as the state vector and water levels and discharge as observation vectors the 1d hydrodynamic model was taken as the observation operator that constructs the mapping relationship between the state and the observation vector the method s reliability was demonstrated through the case of niantou ps in the middle route of south north water transfer project verification results show that the proposed method can accurately inverse ps parameters compared with the simulation results using ps parameters based on physical model experiments the ps parameters corrected by the data assimilation method can greatly improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic simulation this data assimilation based method can be used for parameter inversion of other complex hydraulic structures keywords parameter correction pumping station hydrodynamic model data assimilation ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction the 1d open channel hydrodynamic models have been extensively used in the large scale regional simulation of various water bodies lian et al 2007 remo and pinter 2007 biancamaria et al 2009 paz et al 2010 paiva et al 2011 and flood forecast mark et al 2004 liu et al 2010 neal et al 2012 liu and chung 2014 li et al 2016 because of their high computational efficiency however the accuracy of these models can be compromised by many factors such as initial conditions desmarais and kuerten 2014 boundary conditions pappenberger et al 2006 liu et al 2016 and geometry data pramanik et al 2010 safazadeh maleki and khan 2015 podhoranyi and fedorcak 2015 those 1d hydrodynamic models based on saint venant equations are inherently subject to errors induced by the simplified assumptions and numerical discretization zhang and bao 2013 model parameters also need to be accurately identified and calibrated in order to obtain a high simulation accuracy in this context much recent research has focused on the identification of roughness coefficient in 1d open channel hydrodynamic models the trial and error method is often used for this purpose tang et al 2010 however a major problem of this method is that it depends heavily on the experience of hydrologists lin and wang 2007 and thus it may be not applicable to complex networks to address this problem various gradient based or heuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed to automatically identify roughness coefficient notable examples of which include sequential quadratic programming algorithm ramesh et al 2000 limited memory quasi newton ding et al 2004 ding and wang 2005 and variational lagrangian multipliers atanov et al 1999 nguyen et al 2015 tang et al 2010 and ayvaz 2013 adopted heuristic particle swarm optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm to inverse the roughness of river networks respectively in recent years the data assimilation technique has been introduced to track changes in roughness wu et al 2008 lai et al 2013 however it is important to note that the parameters of other hydraulic structures in rivers also need to be calibrated for example pumps and sluice gates in the tidal river network can have a direct effect on regional hydrodynamic process yin et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 hu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the middle route of the south to north water transfer project is a large scale water transfer project aiming to transfer water from the yangtze river in southern china to the more arid northern china and it has numerous inverted siphons bridges tunnels gates culverts aqueducts and other hydraulic structures for various purposes tang et al 2013 tang et al 2014 the pumping station ps plays an important role in agriculture irrigation wang and qian 2017 urban drainage lee et al 2016a b yazdi et al 2016 inter basin water transfer du et al 2015 etc it differs significantly from other hydraulic structures in terms of hydraulic characteristics and the complex head discharge relationship in the 1d open channel hydrodynamic models the head discharge relationship is described by a quadratic characteristic curve of pumps with three parameters lamaddalena and khila 2013 however the direct use of these parameters could cause large simulation errors because the curve is generally obtained from physical model experiments that may suffer from scale effects bettaieb and taieb 2015 and importantly it is generated under static conditions rather than under dynamic conditions wu et al 2013 in the actual operation the characteristic curve should be adjusted according to changes in blade angle or pump revolution speed tan et al 2012 resulting in dynamic changes in model parameters accordingly there is a need to correct ps parameters by the effective field data to improve the simulation accuracy data assimilation is an effective method to correct system parameters ide et al 1997 kalnay 2003 habert et al 2016 the basic idea of which is to quantify errors in both the numerical model and observations and update model states in a way that optimally combines model simulations with observations clark et al 2008 it has gained much popularity in oceanography haugen and evensen 2002 zhang et al 2007 hydrology ricci et al 2011 man et al 2016 and petroleum engineering nævdal et al 2002 lee et al 2016a b in recent years it has been applied to the hydrodynamic field including state correction and roughness inversion madsen and skotner 2005 matgen et al 2010 amour et al 2013 huang et al 2013 garcia pintado et al 2015 compared with optimization methods the assimilation method has higher efficiency in parameter inversion however whether it is suitable for multi parameter simultaneous inversion of complex hydraulic structures in the 1d hydrodynamic model remains to be determined compared with other data assimilation techniques the ensemble kalman filter enkf introduced by evensen 1994 is more widely used due to its many advantageous properties such as non intrusive formulation high robustness and reasonable computational requirements gharamti et al 2015 in enkf random ensembles are first generated to obtain the initial distribution of the state variables followed by forecast and update stages in the forecast stage new forecast ensembles are formed from the previous update ensembles based on the mapping of the corresponding states in these ensembles while in the update stage a kalman update is applied to each member of the forecast ensembles using perturbed observations separately evensen 2003 enkf requires no calculation of error covariance but rather it uses an appropriate ensemble to reflect the same error statistics making it a reliable method to solve non linear filtering problems the purpose of this study is to correct ps parameters to improve the accuracy of the 1d open channel hydrodynamic model a 1d hydrodynamic model for open channels was established using ps compatibility equations and saint venant equations and then the enkf was used to inverse ps parameters in the hydrodynamic model verification results show that the proposed method can accurately correct ps parameters and the simulation accuracy can be significantly improved in a real project using these corrected parameters the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology used to treat ps inner boundary and parameter correction section 3 describes the validation of the proposed method in detail section 4 presents the method application and the simulation results with corrected parameters and section 5 gives the conclusions drawn in this study 2 methodology in this section a 1d open channel hydrodynamic model with ps inner boundary is established and then used in the enkf framework to inverse ps parameters 2 1 1d hydrodynamic model saint venant equations venutelli 2002 islam et al 2008 yi et al 2017 are often used to describe the 1d flow in open channels 1 b z t q x q 2 q t x α q 2 a g a z x g a s f 0 where b m is the channel cross sectional width z m is the water level t s is the time q m3 s is the discharge x m is the distance along the channel q m3 s is the lateral inflow α is the momentum correction coefficient a m2 is the wetted cross sectional area g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration and s f is the friction slope which can be calculated from the following equation 3 s f n 2 q q a 2 r 4 3 where n is the manning s roughness coefficient and r m is the hydraulic radius of the channel section in the hydrodynamic model the preissmann four point implicit difference scheme is adopted to discretize eqs 1 and 2 based on which the linearized equations between the i th and i 1 th cross sections can be described as follows 4 q i 1 n 1 q i n 1 c i z i 1 n 1 c i z i n 1 d i 5 e i q i n 1 g i q i 1 n 1 f i z i 1 n 1 f i z i n 1 φ i where q i n 1 and z i n 1 are the discharge and water level of the i th cross section at the n 1 th time step respectively and the coefficients of c i d i e i g i f i and φ i are calculated by the model parameters and the hydraulic elements at the n th time step these coefficients can be expressed as 6 c i b i 1 2 n δ x i 2 δ t θ d i q i 1 2 δ x i θ 1 θ θ q i 1 n q i n c i z i 1 n z i n e i δ x i 2 θ δ t α u i n g u n 2 2 θ r 4 3 i n δ x i g i δ x i 2 θ δ t α u i 1 n g u n 2 2 θ r 4 3 i 1 n δ x i f i g a i 1 2 n φ i δ x i 2 θ δ t q i 1 n q i n 1 θ θ α u q i 1 n α u q i n 1 θ θ g a i 1 2 n z i 1 n z i n where δ x i m is the distance between the i th and i 1 th cross sections δ t s is the time interval θ is the discrete weighting coefficient θ 0 75 and u m s is the average flow velocity in order to correct the ps parameters the continuity equation and the h q characteristic curve of the ps are chosen as the ps compatibility equations which are coupled with saint venant equations these compatibility equations can be written as follows 7 q out q in 8 h ps z out z in a ps q out 2 b ps q out c ps where q out m3 s and q in m3 s are the discharge of the ps at the outlet and inlet side h ps m is the net head of the ps z out m and z in m are the water level of the ps at the outlet and inlet side and a ps b ps and c ps are the parameters of the characteristic curve of the ps respectively in this hydrodynamic model the running units in the ps are treated as a whole when only one pump unit is switched on these parameters are equal to the coefficients of the characteristic curve of the unit which are usually available from the manufacturers and may vary greatly depending on the operating conditions of pumps however if there are more than one running pump unit the characteristic curve of the ps is formed by accumulating the discharges at the same heads of each running unit the ps parameters are equal to the coefficients of the combined characteristic curve the compatibility conditions of ps can also be linearized like the open channel equations assuming the inlet side and the outlet side of the ps are the k th section and the k 1 th section respectively eq 7 can be linearized as follows 9 q k 1 n 1 q k n 1 c k z k 1 n 1 c k z k n 1 d k in which c k d k 0 it is crucial to linearize the h q characteristic curve of the ps reasonably the taylor series expansion method gottardi and venutelli 2008 is used for eq 8 and then the second order and higher terms can be omitted then the linearized h q curve can be written as 10 h ps n 1 h ps n h ps n δ q k 1 a ps q k 1 n 2 b ps q k 1 n c ps 2 a ps q k 1 n b ps q k 1 n 1 q k 1 n considering eq 8 eq 10 can be converted to the following equation 11 2 a ps q k 1 n b ps q k 1 n 1 z k 1 n 1 z k n 1 a ps q k 1 n 2 c ps similar to eq 5 the linearized h q curve equation can be written as 12 e k q k n 1 g k q k 1 n 1 f k z k 1 n 1 f k z k n 1 φ k in which e k 0 g k 2 a ps q k 1 n b ps f k 1 and φ k a ps q k 1 n 2 c ps for a simulation area containing a ps inner boundary the linearized equations eqs 4 and 5 of each channel and the linearized ps equations eqs 9 and 12 are coupled to form a linear system of equations when the external boundary conditions are known the chasing method wang et al 2015 is used to solve the equation system finally the hydrodynamic process of this area is obtained 2 2 correction of ps parameters based on the enkf framework a state space model is often used to describe the dynamic changes in the studied system in which the implied time is taken as an independent variable this model contains two basic equations a state equation and an observation equation the state equation aims to pass the true state vector x n to the next moment x n 1 in the forecast stage which can be written as ide et al 1997 13 x n 1 m n x n η n 1 in which n 1 and n denote the time steps m n is the forecast operator that can reflect the relationship between x n and x n 1 and η n 1 is the model error vector that is independent white noise for the forecast model and parameters drawn from multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance q n 1 the observation equation aims to construct the mapping between the true state vector x n 1 and the observation vector y n 1 in the update stage which can be expressed as follows ide et al 1997 14 y n 1 h n 1 x n 1 ε n 1 in which h n 1 is the observation operator and ε n 1 is the observation error vector which accounts for instrument processing and representation errors this error vector is also assumed to be independent white noise that follows multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance o n 1 the difference between the correction of hydraulic parameters and that of hydraulic elements the water level and discharge is mainly manifested in m n and h n 1 in hydrodynamic model the hydraulic elements are always the simulation results using the hydraulic parameters therefore the state vector consists only of these ps parameters in the ps parameters correction process that is x n a ps n b ps n c ps n t because no change will occur in these parameters during the stable operation of pump units m n is taken as the unit matrix i the 1d hydrodynamic model provides a direct link between ps parameters x n 1 and observation elements y n 1 the water level and discharge in the hydrodynamic system this model is therefore used as a non linear observation operator h n 1 in the enkf framework in addition since the correction of hydraulic parameters does not change the original hydraulic elements the imbalance generated by the enkf can also be ignored the characteristic curve of pump units depends largely on the pump type axial flow pump or mixed flow pump and its operating conditions such as blade angle when the angle is constant the parameters of ps s combined characteristic curve is also time invariant this feature facilitates the inversion of ps parameters for the convenience of illustration the axial pump is selected as an example which changes operating condition by adjusting its blade angle to meet the water demand the correction process of ps parameters is shown in fig 1 and the correction process for other types of pumps is exactly the same as for axial pumps assuming that the initial ps parameters are x 0 a ps 0 b ps 0 c ps 0 t and the initial ensemble member can be generated using these parameters plus a random disturbance this process can be expressed as 15 x j 0 e x 0 ζ j where the subscript j indicates the j th member in the corresponding ensemble and ζ j is independent white noise that follows multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance r r is determined by the method of obtaining the initial parameters the initial parameters x 0 are usually available from the characteristic curves provided by the manufacturer which have a certain scale effect the population of x j 0 e j 1 2 j is called the initial ensemble or the initial analysis ensemble x j 0 a j 1 2 j the appropriate ensemble size in the hydraulic parameter correction model will be discussed in the verification section in the implementation of enkf each member of the initial or analysis ensemble successively performs the forecasting and correction process in parallel if the state vector at the n th moment x j n a is known the state vector at the next moment x j n 1 a can be obtained by the following three steps in the first step the disturbance forecast vector at the n 1 th moment x j n 1 f is calculated and the forecast vector is directly equivalent to the analysis state vector considering that there is no interference in the delivery process this step can be expressed as 16 x j n 1 f ix j n a x j n a the population of x j n 1 f j 1 2 j is called the forecast ensemble at the n 1 th moment the second step is to calculate the disturbance innovation which is defined as the difference between observed and predicted values thus 17 d j n 1 y n 1 ε j n 1 h n 1 x j n 1 f where d j n 1 is the j th member of the innovation vector both water level and discharge can be used as observation values to correct ps parameters for an invariant angle period the measurement data at that period is taken as the observation vector the last step is to calculate the disturbance analysis value x j n 1 a obviously this step is the core of filtering in which the innovation is used to correct the forecast value the correction process can be expressed as 18 x j n 1 a x j n 1 f k n 1 d j n 1 in which k n 1 is called kalman gain that determines the ratio between the forecasting mode and observation states during assimilation processes k n 1 can be written as 19 k n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t h n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t o n 1 1 in which p n 1 is the predictive error covariance matrix since the true state is not known the covariance matrix of the ensemble is generally defined around the ensemble mean therefore p n 1 can be expressed as 20 p n 1 1 j 1 j 1 j x j n 1 f x n 1 f x j n 1 f x n 1 f where x n 1 f is the average of x j n 1 f j 1 2 j in practical applications p n 1 h n 1 t and h n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t are often calculated directly to reduce the computational load zheng et al 2009 and facilitate model calculation which can be defined as 21 p n 1 h n 1 t 1 j 1 j 1 j x j n 1 f x n 1 f h n 1 x j n 1 f h n 1 x n 1 f t 22 h n 1 p n 1 h n 1 t 1 j 1 j 1 j h n 1 x j n 1 f h n 1 x n 1 f h n 1 x j n 1 f h n 1 x n 1 f t then it is necessary to determine whether the calculation should be repeated if n 1 is less than n where n is the number of observations at the correction position during the filter period the loop should continue however if n 1 is equal to n the loop should stop and the final corrected state vector x c can be expressed as follows 23 x c a ps c b ps c c ps c t 1 j j 1 j x j n a these corrected parameters a ps c b ps c and c ps c can be stored and used for future simulations in tidal river networks or water transfer systems there are other complex multi parameter hydraulic structures such as sluice gates inverted siphons etc taking the parameters of these structures as the state vector of the enkf model parameter correction can also be performed using the proposed method 3 verification in this section the experimental area is described and then the designed parameter correction schemes are verified 3 1 experimental area description niantou pumping station ntps located in beijing is considered in this study as shown in fig 2 it is the third level of the cascade pumping station system in the miyun reservoir regulation and storage project of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project the total length of the tested channel from the upstream boundary point a to the downstream boundary point b is 34 1 km the channel can be divided into two parts section i and ii in fig 2 by ntps and it has an isosceles trapezoid shaped cross section with a bottom width of 20 0 m and a side slope coefficient of 2 5 the bottom elevation of point a is 48 41 m and the bottom slope of the channel is 0 000062 in ntps four identical axial pump units are installed including three frequently used ones and an emergency one the design discharge of each unit is 6 67 m3 s fig 3 shows the h q characteristic curves of these pump units in ntps provided by the manufacturer and their expressions and the ps parameters a ps p b ps p c ps p based on physical model experiments at each blade angle are shown in table 1 it should be noted that the actual operating angles of these units are usually an integral multiple of 0 5 the characteristic curves at other angles are generally interpolated from the basic curves 4 2 0 2 these parameters may be not accurate for several reasons such as model errors scale effects and interpolation errors and thus need to be corrected precisely for the 1d hydrodynamic model the roughness coefficient of the channel should be calibrated prior to the correction of these parameters to avoid mutual interference between various hydraulic structure parameters the roughness coefficients of the two sections were calibrated separately using the unsteady flow measurement data the positions of upstream and downstream boundaries are shown in table 2 taking the water level at the upstream boundary as a reference the purpose of the calibration is to minimize the difference between observed and simulated values using the trial and error method oezkundakci et al 2012 the calibrated roughness coefficients of section i and ii are 0 043 and 0 035 respectively which are slightly higher than those of common lining channels due to the resistance of aquatic plants to the water flow the root mean square errors of the water levels simulated by these roughness coefficients are less than 0 05 m which satisfies simulation requirements after the calibration of channel parameters their interference with the correction of ps parameters can be ignored 3 2 correction scheme design and verification 3 2 1 correction scheme the characteristic curve of the prototype unit in ps is often difficult to obtain that is the true values of ps parameters are usually unknown in order to verify the correction effect of ps parameters a set of parameters a ps t b ps t c ps t is assumed to be true and used for hydrodynamic simulation then the simulation results plus disturbance are taken as the actual observation value and the proposed model is used to correct the ps parameters with a certain initial error in this correction scheme the true parameters a ps t b ps t and c ps t are 0 033 8 0 0420 and 5 4205 respectively the upstream and downstream boundary processes of the hydrodynamic model are shown in fig 4 a and the simulation results of ntps in fig 4 b the durations of the simulation and correction processes are both 2 days 3 2 2 measurements and error covariance in this experimental area electronic water level gauges were installed on the inlet and outlet sides of ntps respectively and flow meters were installed on each pump unit the discharge and water level at the entrance and exit of the tested channel were also measured in verification and application sections the observation vector is composed of the observed discharge inlet side and outlet side water levels of ntps y n 1 q in out n 1 o z in n 1 o z out n 1 o t the frequency of all variables was observed every 30 min observed error covariance mainly depends on the inherent error of the measurement equipment in ntps the measurement error of the used electronic water gauge is 0 02 m and that of the flowmeter is 5 therefore the main diagonal elements of the covariance matrix o n 1 are assumed to be 5 2 0 022 and 0 022 and the remaining elements are 0 since the hydrodynamic simulation results do not have noise characteristics they cannot be directly used as observation values in this correction scheme the ps simulation results added white noise are taken as real observation values and this noise also follows multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance o n 1 3 2 3 ensemble size ensemble size is one of the most important variables in the enkf framework generally the number of members j in the ensemble should be about 100 to obtain a representative distribution and a proper covariance matrix required subsequently madsen and skotner 2005 due to the large computational load of the hydrodynamic model the multi process parallel calculation is time consuming therefore the effect of parameter correction in the case of other ensemble sizes j 10 20 30 50 was examined in this study assuming that each parameter has a 10 initial error the initial parameters a ps 0 b ps 0 and c ps 0 are 0 0 304 0 0 378 and 4 8785 respectively fig 5 shows the correction results of the three ps parameters under different ensemble sizes it can be seen from fig 5 a and c that a ps n and c ps n can gradually converge to the true values after approximately 60 assimilation cycles at different ensemble sizes however b ps n does not completely converge to the true value eventually it can also be seen that the correction model does not have exactly the same correction effect on different parameters fig 5 b shows that when the ensemble size is 30 the corrected parameter b ps c is the closest to its true value compared with a ps n and c ps n b ps is an insensitive parameter described in section 3 2 4 that is easily affected by sensitive parameters observation disturbances and model disturbances when the ensemble size is 50 the various disturbances caused by the observation and the model may also increase resulting in b ps not converging this result also indicates that the requirement of correcting the ps parameters can be substantially satisfied when the ensemble size is equal to 30 therefore j 30 is chosen as the ensemble size in the subsequent verification and application 3 2 4 analysis of corrected parameters fig 6 a b and c show the variations of the mean and member values of the ps parameters in the correction process when the ensemble size is 30 as mentioned above the initial ensemble is generated from the initial parameters plus random perturbations considering the scale effect the loss of import and export of ps and trash rack loss the main diagonal elements of the covariance matrix r are assumed to be 10 2 it can be clearly seen from fig 6 a and c that a ps n and c ps n can gradually converge to the true value in each ensemble member however fig 6 b illustrates that b ps n in each member is stably dispersed around the mean value during the correction process which is significantly different from a ps n and c ps n to analyze the reason for this difference both the curve with true parameters a ps t 0 0338 b ps t 0 0420 c ps t 5 4205 and that with corrected parameters a ps c 0 03360 b ps c 0 0429 c ps c 5 4082 are plotted in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 the two curves basically coincide in the discharge range of 6 5 12 0 m3 s the difference between the heads of the two curves does not exceed 0 01 m this result shows that the curve with corrected parameters can reflect the h q characteristics of the curve with true parameters further the influence of b ps on the curve is obviously less than that of a ps and c ps in the operating discharge range 3 2 5 initial error of ps parameters in actual projects the initial error of ps parameters is not easy to measure which is assumed to be 10 in the above in this part other initial errors are separately tested including 10 20 and 20 fig 8 presents the correction results for each parameter at different initial error levels each parameter gradually converges to the true value and tends to stabilize after about 60 times of assimilation under different conditions the corrected parameters with different initial errors are listed in table 3 as illustrated by table 3 although the relative error of the corrected parameters becomes larger as the initial error increases the corrected parameters a ps c and c ps c at various initial error levels are less than 2 relative to the true value in addition b ps which has less influence on h q curve is also effectively corrected for example when its initial error is 20 the relative error after model correction is only 7 47 thus the proposed method can accurately correct the hydraulic parameters especially when the error is within 10 4 application and discussion based on the measured data the proposed method was applied to inverse the ps parameters at different fixed angles subsequently the hydrodynamic simulations were separately performed using the corrected parameters cps and the parameters based on physical model experiments pps 4 1 parameter correction at different fixed angles the parameters under guide vane body with fixed blade angles were corrected as no change is observed in the angles of pump units for the period from 7 00 on april 26 2016 to 19 00 on april 29 2016 this 36 h period is chosen as the assimilation period two units ran during this time period at a blade angle of 6 the curve parameters of pump units are 0 1352 0 0839 and 5 4205 at this angle and 0 0338 0 042 and 5 4205 after the merge of the two curves respectively which are the pps of ntps for simulation the enkf framework coupled with the hydrodynamic model is applied for the research area the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model shown in fig 9 are the discharge process at point a and the water level process at point b respectively the water levels at the inlet side and the outlet side are chosen as the observations and thus there is a total of 73 sets of observations at an observation step of 30 min the variances of initial parameter error water level and discharge observation error are 10 2 0 022 and 5 2 respectively fig 10 shows the variation of ps parameters in enkf it can be clearly seen from fig 10 a and c that parameters a ps n and c ps n converge to stable values after 60 assimilation cycles and their ensemble variances gradually decrease with the number of assimilations in fig 10 b parameter b ps does not change notably during the correction process which has been proved to have less effect on the h q curve the final cps of the two units at an operating angle of 6 are 0 0356 0 0407 and 6 8985 respectively fig 11 shows the simulation results at the fixed angles using pps and cps fig 11 a and c indicate that the inlet side and outlet side water levels simulated using cps are in better agreement with observations than that using pps also the simulated discharge using cps has also improved significantly as shown in fig 11 b however it is noted that although those simulated values using pps tend to have large simulation errors the overall trend is consistent with the observations generally the maximum errors of the simulated values using cps are observed at the initial stage which can be caused by the initial conditions of the hydrodynamic model fig 11 also shows that ps parameters can have a significant effect on the simulation results table 4 shows the effects of the two sets of parameters on the simulation results for cps the correlation coefficient between observed and simulated water levels at the inlet side is as high as 0 8897 whereas that at the outlet side is 0 8877 respectively the average of which are higher than that for pps as the observed discharge is a constant no correlation coefficient can be calculated the root mean square error of the discharge simulated using cps is only 0 29 m3 s and the relative error of the water levels at the inlet and outlet side and the discharge can be controlled within 2 5 it should be noted that the reference value of the water level relative error is the average depth over time in conclusion all the evaluation indexes indicate that the simulation with the use of cps is more effective by the aforementioned method the parameters under other blade angles are acquired based on the existing history data 4 2 hydrodynamic simulation using the corrected parameters to further verify the reliability of cps the hydrodynamic process under variable angles is simulated and the simulation period is 120 h from 0 00 on april 25 2016 to 0 00 on april 29 2016 the angles and ps parameters for each period are listed in table 5 and the boundary conditions are shown in fig 12 the pps and cps series are input into the hydrodynamic model separately to simulate the hydrodynamic process as shown in fig 13 similarly it is obvious that the water level fig 13 a and b or discharge fig 13 c simulated using cps are in better agreement with observations than that using pps changes in water demand often result in dynamic adjustment of discharge the variable angles can lead to abrupt changes in hydraulic elements which is particularly evident for the discharge of ntps as illustrated by fig 13 c the maximum simulation errors of water level and discharge are also observed when the unit angles change table 6 shows the simulation results at variable blade angles the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is also used to evaluate the long sequence simulation results of which the optimal value is 1 0 it clearly shows that all nses using the cps are higher compared with that using pps in particular the nse of the discharge is as high as 0 90 the root mean square errors of the water levels are less than 5 cm and the relative error can still be controlled within 3 all evaluation indicators show that using the cps can significantly improve the hydrodynamic simulation accuracy 5 conclusions in this study a 1d open channel hydrodynamic model with ps components was established and then the enkf framework was used to correct ps parameters the proposed method can effectively inverse ps parameters and the cps can significantly improve simulation accuracy thus this method can be extended to the inversion of ps parameters in any river or channel networks as well as the parameter correction of other single or multi parameter hydraulic structures however the proposed method has a different correction effect on each parameter of multi parameter structures therefore the influence of each parameter on the hydrodynamic model remains to be further studied to improve the accuracy of parameter correction acknowledgements the work was supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405900 and national natural science foundation of china grant nos

handled by huaming guo editor in chief with the assistance of georgia destouni associate editor a unified pipe network based numerical manifold method nmm is developed to simulate immiscible two phase flow in a geological medium both heterogeneous and non heterogeneous geological media can be discretized as numerical pipe networks which have high efficiency and accuracy in simulating fluid and mass transfer in fractured rock masses a manifold element method is developed to solve the governing equations of immiscible two phase flow in pipes the developed nmm can simulate moving and deforming of two phase flow interface a grid based front tracking method updates the marker points constructing the fluid interface explicitly in each time step the effectiveness of the nmm is verified through analytical and finite element analysis parametric studies are conducted by simulating immiscible two phase flows with various fluid properties in homogeneous and inhomogeneous geological conditions the results show that the developed method can efficiently simulate the moving interface of two phase flow in geological media including effects such as viscous fingering a noteworthy phenomenon in enhanced oil recovery when the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of the driven fluid the inhomogeneity of the medium can cause the fluid interface to roughen which increases over time during the process of two phase flow for the inverse situation although the fluid interface remains rough the roughness variation throughout the process is not prominent keywords immiscible displacement moving interface unified pipe network method numerical manifold method grid based front tracking method 1 introduction immiscible displacement a basic problem of two phase flow widely exists in many geotechnical engineerings such as seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers ketabchi et al 2016 koussis et al 2015 and unconfined seepage free surface seepage in porous or fractured porous media kazemzadeh parsi and daneshmand 2013 zheng et al 2014a b wang et al 2016 jiang et al 2014 ren et al 2016 moving and deforming of fluid interfaces related to two phase flow in geological media imposes a computational challenge because of the discontinuity of material properties of fluids in the past several decades a wide variety of numerical methods has been developed to describe the fluid interfaces the commonly used methods can be divided into two categories based on numerical implementation 1 methods under eulerian framework including volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 li et al 2000 garrioch and baliga 2006 aniszewski et al 2014 level set ls method sussman et al 1994 1998 olsson and kreiss 2005 olsson et al 2007 coupled level set and volume of fluid clsvof method or coupled volume of fluid and level set voset method wang et al 2009 yokoi 2013 ling et al 2015 chakrabortya et al 2016 and the phase field pf method jacqmin 1999 takada et al 2005 kim 2012 and 2 the front tracking method in lagrangian framework unverdi and tryggvason 1992 izbassarov and muradoglu 2015 the first one is also named the front capturing method in which the interface is implicitly embedded in a scalar field function defined on a fixed grid leung and zhao 2009 discussed the pros and cons of the front capturing method in detail the main advantages are 1 a geometric problem is turned into a partial differential equations problem on a fixed grid with a simple data structure and 2 topological changes of fluid interfaces such as merging or splitting can be easily solved the main drawbacks include 1 the front capturing method is less accurate and less efficient than the front tracking method in term of both the interface representation and evolution and 2 additional effort is needed to determine the interface explicitly further information about the front capturing method can be found in the references above here we focus on the front tracking method in the front tracking method the interface is typically constructed by a set of marker points which are updated in a lagrangian method based on the velocity field at each time step in two dimensions the front can be reconstructed via line segments in three dimensions triangles are often used this method is attractive because of the following advantages 1 representing the moving and deforming of fluid interface efficiently and accurately and 2 tracking the motion of the marker points easily the disadvantages of the method are 1 the points distributed in a fluid interface may move too close together or far apart making the redistribution of marker points necessary after several time steps and 2 oscillations of the fluid interface may occur to overcome the shortages of this method some improved measures have been adopted udaykumar and shyy 1995 developed a grid supported marker particle scheme for interface tracking which can accommodate particle depletion accumulation and merger breakup issues with suitable accuracy a front tracking method with an underlying grid was proposed by glimm et al 2000 the interface is represented by a triangulated mesh the underlying grid is used to maintain a quasi uniform triangulation of the interface during the evolution and to reconnect the interface when topological changes occur terashima and tryggvason 2009 introduced a front tracking ghost fluid method for the simulation of fluid interfaces incompressible flows which can simulate interface dynamics accurately for oscillations in the fluid interface the following remedies summarized by sethian 1999 can be used to eliminate this problem 1 reducing the time step 2 smoothing the speed function 3 redistributing marker particles according to the arc length or a related quantity after several time steps and 4 developing and implementing a filtering technique to remove noise i e oscillations in the particle positions in this study a grid based front tracking method is also developed which is introduced in detail in section 2 3 apart from the front tracking methods the choice of numerical methods is also important to solve the governing equations of immiscible displacement with fluid interfaces the widely used methods combined with a front tracking method include finite difference method unverdi and tryggvason 1992 irfan and muradoglu 2017 finite volume method tryggvason et al 2001 finite element method zhao and heinrich 2001 charlot et al 2015 and discontinuous galerkin method nguyen et al 2010 sollie et al 2011 lu et al 2016 in the above methods additional efforts should be taken for the situation where a front interface is in an element because an element can only represent a single material property to solve this problem the representative approaches are as follows 1 modifying the meshes near the front to make the mesh match the interface in each time step and 2 treating all of the phases in the fluids domain together by solving a single set of governing equations different fluids are identified by a step heaviside function h and the interface is marked by a nonzero value of the gradient of the step function on a fixed grid tryggvason et al 2001 the recently developed numerical manifold method nmm can model both a continuum and discontinuum in a unified framework based on a finite cover system with independent mathematical and physical covers the nmm cover system is free from the model geometry which dispenses the necessity of re meshing the grids near the interface thus the innovative dual cover system of the nmm overcomes the inconvenience of the interface element assumption that is required in the conventional numerical method in this way the nmm can model a continuum a transition of a continuum to a discontinuum and a discontinuum including geometric discontinuities shi 1991 2013 and material discontinuities an et al 2011 wu et al 2017 in a unified manner the nmm was initially proposed to solve rock mechanics problems such as stability of rock structures ma et al 2010 ning et al 2011 failure propagation in rock masses ma et al 2009 zhang and zhang 2012 zheng et al 2014a b zheng and xu 2014 wu and wong 2014 zhang et al 2017 hydraulic fracture simulating wu and wong 2014 zhang et al 2015 and stress wave propagation across rock masses fan et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 recently the nmm has also been explored and developed to analyze the seepage flow in porous and fractured media zheng et al 2015 adopted the nmm to solve unconfined seepage flow in porous media hu et al 2015 used the nmm to model fluid flow in heterogeneous media a new second order nmm was proposed and used to analyze a free surface flow in inner drains by wang et al 2016 hu et al 2016 2017 developed a new nmm model for analyzing fluid flow and the coupling process of hydro mechanical fluids in fractured media with non conforming mesh ma et al 2017 2018a adopted a developed nmm for simulating a two phase flow in fracture networks in this study we further develop the method to simulate two phase flow in geological media a geologic body such as rock mass and soil is an inhomogeneous fractured porous medium subjected to geostress external loading hydraulic pressure and thermal effects fan et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2018 to deal with this medium more efficiently another method based on a finite element mesh the unified pipe network method upm was developed by ren in 2015 which has a special advantage in simulating fluid flow heat transfer and contaminant transport in complicated geological media in this method fluids flow heat transfer and contaminant transport in both rock matrixes and fractures are treated as those in pipes the pipes can be divided as matrix pipes and fracture pipes based on their representative entities moreover no matter for three dimensional or two dimension problems the pipes are one dimensional thus the rock matrixes and fractures can be processed in a unified method despite their properties hitherto the method was adopted to analyze water flow in fractured porous rock ren et al 2016 co2 sequestration in fractured saline aquifers ren et al 2017a b wormhole propagation caused by acidizing in fractured carbonate rocks chen et al 2018a ma et al 2018b and evaluation of geothermal development in fractured hot dry rock chen et al 2018b c d however a pipe can only have one material property under the upm framework if the mesh is not to coincide with the interfaces auxiliary pipes are needed as in the study by ren et al 2016 to combine the advantages and overcome the disadvantages of the nmm and upm a unified pipe network based nmm is developed for simulating immiscible displacement with a fluid interface in this study the upm is adopted to discrete a geological medium into one dimensional flow pipes and the nmm is used to solve the governing equations of immiscible displacement in these pipes the outline of this paper is as follows the governing equations for the two phase flow the unified pipe network based nmm grid based front tracking method and adaptive time step updating method are introduced in detail in section 2 the validation of the developed method with grid based front tracking is verified by analytic and finite element method solutions in section 3 in section 4 immiscible displacement with various fluid properties is analyzed and discussed in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media with the developed method some conclusions are obtained in the last section 2 governing equations unified pipe network based nmm and grid based front tracking method 2 1 governing equations for immiscible displacement with an abrupt interface in the current mathematical model we assume that 1 two immiscible fluids exist in a geological medium 2 the densities of fluids are constant 3 the fluid flow in the medium obeys darcy s law 4 there is a fluid interface separating the two fluids and 5 the compressibility of fluids and the capillary pressure between two fluids are ignored fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of a two phase flow in a rectangle geological medium ω1 and ω2 are the regions occupied by fluid 1 and fluid 2 respectively г b represents the external boundary and г m is the internal fluid interface separating the two fluids in each side of the interface the governing equation of fluid flow is 1 k i μ i p ρ i g z 0 x ω i where subscript i 1 or 2 is the fluid phase k is permeability μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity ρ is fluid density p is hydraulic pressure g is gravitational acceleration z is the height along the z direction in the 2d problem x i y i for a horizontal plane and x i z i for a vertical plane the fluid velocity vi can be obtained based on darcy s law with the effect of gravity 2 v i k i μ i p i ρ i g z to solve this problem the velocity and pressure conditions on the fluid interface are also necessary the fluids velocities condition which needs to satisfy the continuity of fluid velocity is as follows 3 k 1 μ 1 p 1 ρ 1 g z k 2 μ 2 p 2 ρ 2 g z v o n γ m ξ t the pressure condition is as follows 4 p ξ t p ξ t p c on γ m ξ t where pc is capillary pressure which is neglected in our present study ξ t represents the positions of the fluid interface at time t ξ t and ξ t represent one side of the fluid interface and the other side respectively 2 2 a unified pipe network based nmm in the developed method the upm with rectangle grids is adopted to discretize the computational model and the nmm is used to solve the governing equations of the two phase flow in pipes the upm treats fractures and porous medium as connected one dimensional flow pipes in a unified way fig 2 a illustrates conceptualization of a fractured rock mass into pipe networks a fractured rock mass is shown in fig 2a 1 discretizing the rock mass with rectangular grids as shown in fig 2a 2 the line segments constitute the mesh are the pipes in the upm which are divided as rock matrix pipes fig 2a 3 and fracture pipes fig 2a 4 based on their representative entities for fractures as the fractures and fracture pipes have the same dimension in the 2d problem the equivalent permeabilities for fracture pipes are the same with that for corresponding fractures which can be obtained generally through cubic law ma et al 2017 5 k ef k f b h 2 12 μ where bh is hydraulic aperture μ is fluid dynamic viscosity kef and kf are equivalent permeability of fracture pipes and permeability of fractures respectively for a 2d rock matrix or porous medium the equivalent permeabilities for matrix pipes are different from the original permeability of the medium ren 2015 derived the equivalent parameters of matrix pipes of triangular grids a structured pipe network with rectangular grids is adopted in this study the method of deriving the equivalent parameters for pipes in a rectangular grid is the same as pipes in a triangular grid fig 2 b shows the pipe equivalence of a rock matrix or porous medium with rectangular grids the circumcenter o of the rectangle acts as the center of its division points the line linking the circumcenter o and the middle point of each edge is perpendicular to the edge which divides the rectangle into four parts polygon iboe polygon bjco polygon ockd and polygon eodl in the upm the fluid flow from polygon iboe to polygon bjco in the domain is equivalent to the fluid flow from point i to j in pipe ij similarly the fluid flow in polygons bjco and ockd is equivalent to the flow in pipe jk the fluid flow in polygons ockd and eodl is equivalent to the flow in pipe kl and the fluid flow in polygons eodl and iboe is equivalent to the flow in pipe li the original permeability of a porous medium is km then the corresponding equivalent permeability for each pipe kem is as follows based on ren s work 2015 6 k em i j l ob l ij k m k em j k l oc l jk k m k em k l l od l kl k m k em l i l oe l li k m for a pipe which represents both rock matrix and fracture its permeability kemf is calculated by superposition principle namely 7 k e m f m n k e m m n k e f m n note that the permeability of a medium is related to the properties of the medium only not the fluids in it thus the equivalent permeability derived from a single phase flow in a porous medium can be applied to the immiscible displacement with a fluid interface in a geological media after obtaining the equivalent permeability a two phase fluid flow in a porous media or a fractured porous medium can be treated as two phase flow in one dimensional pipes fig 3 a shows the immiscible displacement with a fluid interface in the rectangle grids fluid 1 occupies the red pipes and fluid 2 occupies the gray pipes the black solid line is the fluid interface separating the immiscible fluids the points in the black solid line are the intersection points of the interface with the grids which will be explained in section 2 3 there are two fluids in some pipes for example pipe 3 and pipe 4 shown in fig 3 a which causes discontinuities of material properties thus the nmm is adopted to solve the governing equations of the two phase flow in the pipes the nmm for a two phase flow in single fractures and fracture networks was developed in our previous study ma et al 2017 2018a the method includes three basic concepts the mathematical cover physical cover and manifold element the mathematical cover determines the numerical precision which can be constructed as a union of a finite number of small patches used to occupy the entire physical domain note that the edges of the small patches do not have to match either the internal or external discontinuities in the nmm the physical cover is a mathematical cover divided by fractures discrete interfaces and a boundary which determines the integration fields the manifold element is defined as the common region shared by several covers for a cross grid consisting of pipe 1 pipe 2 pipe 3 and pipe 4 as shown in fig 3 a the mathematical covers physical covers and manifold elements are shown in fig 3 b and the corresponding mathematical covers and physical covers for the cross point are shown in fig 3 c in this study two mathematical covers are used for each pipe when there is no fluid interface in a pipe two physical covers and one manifold element are ultimately formed for example in pipes 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 b an element in the nmm is a flow pipe in the upm when there is a fluid interface in a pipe the mathematical covers are divided by the interface four physical covers and two manifold elements are ultimately formed such as pipes 3 and 4 in fig 3 b in particular the pipe is divided into two pipes depending on the fluid properties which cannot be achieved under the upm framework alone a linear weight function φ x is defined in our present study on each mathematical cover mi which satisfies 8 φ i x 0 x m i φ i x 0 x m i a n d k if x m k φ i x 1 eq 8 partially imposes the continuity of approximation each function is nonzero only on its corresponding mathematical cover mi and zero elsewhere the governing equations of a two phase flow eq 1 are written discretely under the galerkin method as follows ma et al 2017 9 k α μ α l e ω x i ω t x i d x i p ω k α μ α p x i l e x i ω α x where p p 1 p 2 ω w 1 w 2 t and le is manifold element if there is no fluid interface in a pipe the matrix equation for the pipe is as follows based on eq 9 10 k p b where k is the assembly of k α μ α l e ω x i ω t x i d x i the submatrix of the manifold element in the pipe b is assembly of ω k α μ α p x i l e in the pipe for the situation where there is a fluid interface in a pipe the method of obtaining the matrix for the pipe is as follows based on the darcy s law the term k α μ α p x i represents the fluid velocity which is unknown variables and needs to be solved thus we change the above function as the following format 11 k α μ α l e ω x i ω t x i d x i p ω v α l e 0 x i ω α x then the following discrete equation is supplemented to satisfy the pressure interface condition 12 ω 1 x p 1 x ω 2 x p 2 x 0 where x is the position of the fluid interface ω 1 x and p 1 x are the weight functions and pressures on the physical covers related to the fluid interface for fluid 1 respectively ω 2 x and p 2 x are the weight functions and pressures on the physical covers related to the fluid interface for fluid 2 respectively eq 12 can be further written as the following format 13 ω x p x 0 where ω x ω t combining eqs 13 and 11 the following matrix equation can be obtained which satisfied both pressure interface condition and velocity interface condition 14 k ω ω t 0 p v 0 p c where pc is capillary pressure along a fluid interface it is 0 pa in this study the global discrete equation for a pipe system can be obtained by assembling the discrete equation for each pipe based on the physical cover codes for the pipes and the cross point note that if the fluid interface lies only at the cross point the following equation is added to satisfied mass conservation in the cross point 15 i 1 4 q i 0 the pressure functions of physical covers can be obtained by solving the global discrete equation under the appropriate boundary and initial conditions the velocity of the fluid at each pipe can be obtained based on darcy s law i e eq 2 2 3 a grid based front tracking method an explicit method is adopted to simulate the moving and deforming of the fluid interface the positions of the fluid interface are explicitly depicted in a developed grid based front tracking method which is a straightforward and practical approach in this method a set of marker points are used to track and construct the fluid interface different from the conventional front tracking method the marker points are redistributed based on the grids at each time step in this method fig 4 illustrates the approach to update a fluid interface fig 4 a shows that positions of the fluid interface at an initial time t t 0 there are two types of points the first type represented by a hollow circle is used to construct the initial interface at each time which does not have to be in the grids the second one represented by a solid circle is the intersection points of the initial fluid interface with the grids the intersection points which act as marker points are used to reconstruct the fluid interface by linking the points with line segments at the current time step and to track the position of the fluid interface at the next time step the fluid interface constructed by the marker points is called a modified fluid interface fig 4 b shows the positions of the marker points and the corresponding fluid interface black solid line formed by linking these marker points at time t tn fluid 1 lies on the left side of the fluid interface and fluid 2 lies in the right side the velocity for each marker point v ix t v iy t at the current time can be obtained based on darcy s law after a time step δt the new positions of all the marker points are calculated using eq 16 16 x i t δ t y i t δ t x i t y i t v ix t v iy t δ t where subscript i is a marker point number i 1 2 3 m m is the total number of marker points δt is the time step x i t δ t y i t δ t and x i t y i t are the positions of the marker points at t δt and δt respectively the new positions of all marker points and new forming initial fluid interfaces are shown in fig 4 b represented by a hollow circle and a purple dashed line respectively note that not all the new positions of the marker points are in the grids then the intersection points of the initial fluid interface and grids are computed as shown in fig 4 c to act as new marker points to obtain the new locations of the fluid interface at the next time step when there is a point boundary condition in the computational domain the marker points are closer to the boundary point and the fluid velocities near the boundary point are larger thus the line segments linking the points to construct the initial interface might be intersected at a time step as shown in fig 5 at a time the marker points and corresponding fluid interface shown in red are as shown in fig 5 a there are 21 marker points and the label for each marker point is a red normal number at the next time step the red marker points move to the positions presented by the black hollow circles the corresponding labels for which are black italic numbers note that when linking the black hollow circles to construct an initial fluid interface the line segment linking points 9 and 10 and the line segment linking points 12 and 13 have an intersection point which is indicated by as shown in the local enlarged drawing on the left side of fig 5 a for this phenomenon a modified approach is proposed to reconstruct the fluid interface which is as follows 1 calculating the position of the intersection point of the initial fluid interface as shown in fig 5 a labeled by c1 2 calculating the average position of the points forming a new closed area the points that form a closed area are c1 10 11 and 12 in fig 5 a and the average position is the point marked by a purple hollow circle numbered by purple normal 10 in fig 5 b 3 deleting the points forming the new enclosed area and reconstructing the initial fluid interface based on the remaining points and renumbering the points as shown in fig 5 b the purple dotted line and the purple normal numbers are used to reconstruct the initial fluid interface and the points respectively and 4 calculating the intersection points of the purple lines and grids which act as the marker points at the next time step as shown in fig 5 c in eq 16 in addition to the locations of the marker points the other two parameters namely the velocities of each marker point and time step δt are also important and are introduced in detail in the following two sections 2 4 calculating the velocities for each marker points based on the coupled method of the upm and the nmm the fluid velocity in a pipe is the average velocity namely it is constant in a pipe this results in the following two problems 1 the fluid velocities at the same cross point that belong to different pipes are different taking the cross grid shown in fig 3 a as an example the fluid velocity in pipe 1 might differ from that in pipe 3 along the x direction and the fluid velocity in pipe 2 might differ from that in pipe 4 along the y direction this actually conflicts with the principle of flux conservation at a cross point 2 there is only one direction in a pipe for example the direction of the fluid velocities in the pipes parallel to the x axis is the x direction and that parallel to the y axis is the y direction thus a modified velocity calculation approach is proposed first the fluid velocity at a cross node is treated as the average velocities of the cross points at different pipes which is calculated using the following equation for rectangular grids 17 v nx v ny 1 a n pi 1 a n v pix 1 b n pj 1 b n v pjy where vnx and vny are the fluid velocities at cross point n along the x direction and y direction respectively an is the number of pipes in the x direction connected to the cross point n and bn is the number of pipes in the y direction connected to the cross point n after obtaining the fluid velocities at the cross points the fluid velocity at a marker point in a pipe can be obtained through the linear interception method we take the marker point i and m shown in fig 6 a as an example for marker point i which lies in a pipe parallel to the y direction the velocity of the two endpoints of the pipe are viux viuy and vidx vidy as shown in fig 6 b the distance between the marker point and the upper endpoint is lu and the distance between the marker point and lower endpoint is ld l lu then the fluid velocity at the marker point i is calculated using the following equation 18 v ix v iy l d l v iux l u l v idx l d l v iuy l u l v idy for the marker point m which is in a pipe along the x direction the velocities for the two endpoints of the pipe are vmlx vmly and vmrx vmry as shown in fig 6 c the distances between the marker endpoint and the right endpoint and left endpoint are lr and ll respectively the velocity for the marker point m is calculated as follows 19 v mx v my l l l v mrx l r l v mly l l l v mry l r l v mly 2 5 an adaptive time step updating method an adaptive time step updating method with a fixed displacement is proposed in this section to balance the computational accuracy and efficiency because the velocities of the marker points constructing the fluid interface might be different at each time step the maximum moving distance of the marker points is constant at each time step the time step δt is calculated using the following equations 20 l a min l 1 l 2 l 3 l i l i 1 l n δ t l max v 1 v 2 v 3 v m where l is the maximum distance of the fluid interface moving at each time step li is the length of pipe i n is the total number of elements and a is a coefficient with 0 a 1 3 method verification to verify the accuracy of the coupled method of upm and nmm with the developed grid based front tracking method two examples are conducted in this section the first example involves two phase flow in a horizontal porous medium and is verified with analytical results where gravity is not considered and the second example involves two phase flow in a vertical porous medium considering the effects of gravity and is validated using the fem solutions 3 1 two phase flow in a horizontal porous medium the computational model is shown in fig 7 a which is a rectangular domain with dimensions of 10 m width and 20 m length the mesh grid is shown in fig 7 b and the length of each pipe is lm 0 125 m an output point is located in the middle of the domain which corresponds to a flux boundary condition of 1 m2 s boundaries 1 2 3 and 4 are pressure conditions the pressure of boundary 1 is 0 pa the pressures of boundaries 2 and 4 are shown in fig 7 c and the pressure of boundary 3 is shown in fig 7 d an analytical solution exists for the situation where the properties of the driving fluid and driven fluid are the same thus a two phase flow with the same fluid properties is conducted the densities of the two fluids are ρ 1 ρ 2 1000 kg m3 and the gravity constant is g 10 n kg the viscosities for the two fluids are μ 1 μ 2 0 001 pa s the permeability of the porous medium is k 10 9 m2 the pressures for boundaries 2 4 and 3 are obtained based on analytical solutions expressed as follows bear 2013 21 φ 0 φ q 4 π k ln x l 2 2 y d 2 x l 2 2 y d 2 φ z p ρ g where φ denotes the piezometric head and φ 0 is the piezometric head at x 0 which is set to be 0 q is the flow rate in the output point k is the hydraulic conductive coefficient with k kρg μ l is the length of the domain and d is the distance from x 0 to the output point p is the hydraulic pressure the domain is originally saturated with fluid 1 then fluid 2 is injected from the boundary y 0 m at the initial time the position of the fluid interface separating the two fluids is y 0 01 m the results calculated using the developed method are compared with the analytical solutions the pressure variations along the selected section l 1 and l 2 are shown in fig 8 a and b the selected sections l 1 and l 2 are the lines x 10 m and y 5 m in the domain respectively as shown in fig 7 b the black lines in fig 8 a and b are the results obtained by the developed method and the red dashed lines are the corresponding analytical results obtained using eq 21 the results of the developed method agree well with the analytical solutions moreover the total time from t 0 s to the moment that the driven fluid has just reached the output point is also calculated using the coupled method and compared with the analytical solution the maximum displacement among all marker points in each time step is l lm 11 which is used to calculate the time step δt using eq 20 the total time obtained by the coupled method is 52 77 s as shown in fig 8 c and the corresponding analytical solution is 52 36 s which is calculated using eq 22 bear 2013 22 t 2 π d 2 3 q 52 36 s in this example the calculation stops when the minimum distance between the output point and the fluid interface is smaller than 10 4 m a comparison of the two results further supports the accuracy of this developed method during the process of immiscible displacement the variations of the fluid interface at various times are presented in fig 8 c which indicates that the fluid interface gradually becomes a concave conical curve from an initial straight line the cause of this phenomenon is that the pipes closer to the output point corresponds to a larger pressure gradient as shown in fig 8 a and b 3 2 two phase flow in a vertical porous medium this section verifies the developed method under the effect of gravity with an example of a two phase flow in a vertical porous medium the computational model is shown in fig 9 a two fluids exist designated fluid 1 and fluid 2 the properties of the two fluids are the same with densities of 1000 kg m3 and viscosities of 0 001 pa s the permeability of the porous medium is 10 9 m2 the gravity constant g is 10 n kg in this model the left boundary and right boundary have the pressure boundary condition which is 100 kpa for the left boundary and 0 kpa for the right boundary the upper and lower boundaries have the velocity boundary condition with the normal fluid velocities of the two boundaries at 0 m s the fluid interface is at x 2 m within the domain the pressure nephogram obtained by the developed method is shown in fig 10 a and compared with the fem result obtained using comsol multiphysics shown in fig 10 b the pressure variations of the two results are the same to accurately compare the results of the two methods three cross sections are selected as shown in fig 9 a which are y 3 m y 5 m and y 7 m in the domain the pressure distributions along the three selected lines are shown in fig 10 c in the figure the red dashed lines represent the results of the coupled method and the solid blue lines represent the corresponding fem results the two methods are identical thus verifying the accuracy of the developed method under the effect of gravity 4 immiscible displacement in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media in this section the developed method is adopted to analyze immiscible displacement in a common geotechnical medium including a homogeneous medium and an inhomogeneous medium furthermore the following two cases are considered for the inhomogeneous medium 1 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium containing a single fracture and 2 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability 4 1 immiscible displacement in a horizontal homogeneous medium a two phase flow in a horizontal homogeneous medium with the same fluid properties was verified in section 3 1 in this section immiscible displacement with various fluid properties is studied the computational model and grids are shown in fig 7 a and fig 9 b respectively the length of each pipe is lm 0 25 m boundary 1 and boundary 5 are pressure boundary conditions of 0 mpa and 1 mpa respectively boundaries 2 3 and 4 are velocity boundary condition and the normal velocities along them are 0 m s the permeability of the porous medium is 10 9 m2 the medium is initially saturated with fluid 1 fluid 2 is then injected into the medium from boundary 1 three different situations are considered 1 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 00025 pa s 2 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 001 pa s and 3 μ 1 0 00025 pa s μ 2 0 001 pa s where μ is the viscosity of the fluid the fluid interface separating the two fluids lies at y 0 01 m at the initial time the maximum displacement of all marker points are l lm 31 at each time step for the above three situations and the time step δt can be obtained based on eq 20 similar to the case described in section 3 1 the calculation ends when the minimum distance between the output point and the fluid interface is smaller than 10 4 m the processes for immiscible displacement for the three situations are shown in fig 11 the black lines in the figures express the positions and shapes of the fluid interface at various times the total time from the beginning to the end and the ratio of the displacement area to the total area at the end are also given in the figures during the process of immiscible displacement the varying distances between the fluid interface at x 10 m and x 0 m versus time are presented in fig 12 because the total times are not the same for all three situations the time is normalized for a more straightforward presentation of the variation patterns comparing the three situations we find the following similarities 1 the deforming forms of the fluid interface are similar during the process for the three situations i e the fluid interface gradually becomes a concave conical curve from an initially straight line and 2 the distances l increase over time the cause of this phenomenon is that a closer output point corresponds to a larger fluid velocity the differences are as follows 1 a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 with the same m 1 corresponds to a larger difference between the maximum and minimum fluid velocity in the fluid interface 2 a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 with the same m 1 corresponds to a shorter time from beginning to end and 3 a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 with the same m 1 corresponds to a smaller area occupied by the driving fluid in the end the ratios of the displacement area to the total area for the three situations are 17 93 24 48 and 36 18 respectively 4 2 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with a single fracture the computational model for the inhomogeneous medium with a single fracture is shown in fig 13 a the size of which is 8 m 10 m the mesh for this model is shown in fig 13 b the length of each pipe is lm 0 25 m the permeability of the fracture is higher than that of the porous medium which is 1 0 10 m2 for the porous and 1 0 8 m2 for the fracture the left and right boundaries are pressure boundary conditions of 1 mpa and 0 mpa respectively the normal fluid velocities along boundary 3 and boundary 4 are 0 m s the medium is saturated with fluid 1 initially and then fluid 2 is injected into the medium from boundary 1 the fluid interface separating the immiscible fluids is located at x 0 001 m at t 0 s two distinct situations are considered in this case study 1 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 0005 pa s and 2 μ 1 0 0005 pa s μ 2 0 001 pa s where μ is the fluid viscosity the ending condition and the maximum moving displacement of the fluid interface in each time step are the same as those in section 4 1 the simulation results about the processes of immiscible displacement for the two situations are shown in fig 14 fig 14 a addresses the first situation taking 272 19 s from the beginning to the end the driving fluid fluid 2 presented in red reaches the left end point of the fracture at t 163 07 s and the right endpoint at t 179 56 s since the permeability of the fracture is larger than that of a porous medium in this model the fluid velocity along y 5 m is larger than that in other places before t 163 07 s as shown in fig 14 a from t 0 s to t 163 07 s after the driving fluid reaches the right endpoint of the fracture i e after t 179 56 s more of fluid 2 flows into the fracture because of the higher permeability of the fracture and this fluid gradually enters the porous medium near the fracture the amount of driving fluid in the area near the fracture s right tip is more than that on both sides of the fracture at t 234 96 s as shown in fig 14 a because the fracture has a higher permeability than the porous medium and because the driving fluid has a higher mobility more driving fluid tends to enter the fracture than entering the nearby porous medium with increasing time this phenomenon of infiltration inhomogeneity becomes increasingly prominent along the fracture the last figure in fig 14 a shows the fluid interface shape at the end of the process the process of immiscible displacement for the second situation is shown in fig 14 b this process lasts 371 56 s from beginning to end which is longer than that in the first situation because of the lower permeability of the driving fluid fluid 2 relative to that of the driven fluid the driving fluid presented in red reaches the left end point of the fracture at t 117 30 s and the right end point at t 136 81 s similar to the first situation the higher permeability of the fracture causes a larger pressure gradient near the end points of the fracture and the fluid velocity along y 5 m is larger than that in other places before t 117 30 s as shown in fig 14 b from t 0 s to t 117 30 s after the driving fluid reaches the right endpoint of the fracture i e after t 136 81 s more of fluid 2 tends to flow into the fracture and gradually enters the porous medium near the fracture owing to the same reason as described earlier the amount of driving fluid in the area near the right tip of the fracture is more than that in the areas on both sides of the fracture however this phenomenon of infiltration inhomogeneity gradually disappears with increasing time as shown in fig 14 b at t 371 56 s the cause of this phenomenon is analyzed in the following discussion during the process of immiscible displacement in the single fractured porous medium the varying distances between the fluid interface at y 5 and y 0 versus time are plotted in fig 15 for the two situations since the total times are not the same these times are normalized for more straightforward presentation of the variation patterns of the two situations in this figure the blue dotted line represents situation 1 and the red dotted line represents situation 2 for situation 1 the variations can be divided into 3 stages based on the variation trends in fig 14 a stage i lasts from t 0 s t ttotal 0 to t 163 07 s t ttotal 0 60 stage ii lasts from t 163 07 s t ttotal 0 60 to t 179 56 s t ttotal 0 66 and stage iii lasts from t 179 56 s t ttotal 0 66 to t 272 19 s t ttotal 1 in the first stage the distance increases slowly over time after the driving fluid enters into the fracture i e in the second stage the distance sharply increases over time in the third stage the distance still increases over time but the increased gradient is larger than that in stage i and smaller than that in stage ii for the second situation the process can also be divided into three stages based on the trends in fig 14 b stage i lasts from t 0 s t ttotal 0 to t 117 30 s t ttotal 0 32 stage ii lasts from t 117 30 s t ttotal 0 32 to t 136 81 s t ttotal 0 37 and stage iii lasts from t 136 81 s t ttotal 0 37 to t 371 56 s t ttotal 1 the variation trends for the first two stages are similar with the first situation in stage i the distance increases slowly over time in stage ii it increases sharply over time different from situation 1 the distance increases slightly at first and then decreases slowly over time in stage iii the reason for the slight increase is the method of calculating the fluid velocity in pipes as introduced in section 2 4 in this method the fluid velocity at a cross node is treated as the average velocities of the cross points at different pipes and the fluid velocity at marker point i is obtained through the endpoint s velocity of the pipe corresponding to the marker point as shown in eqs 17 and 18 when a porous pipe is connected with a fractured pipe the fluid velocity in this porous pipe affected by the nearby higher permeability fracture is augmented as for the subsequent decrease of the fluid velocity the explanations are as follows 1 the fluid velocity with lower mobility is smaller under the same pressure gradient 2 the permeability of a driving fluid is lower than that of the driven fluid and 3 when the driving fluid through the fracture has a higher permeability than the porous medium the driving fluid fluid 2 moves faster in the location y 5 m than in other areas however when an area is occupied by more of fluid 2 the fluid velocity decreases over time because of the lower mobility of fluid 2 after fluid 2 reenters the porous medium with lower permeability 4 3 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability on the basis of the study described in section 4 2 immiscible displacement in a horizontal inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability is simulated and analyzed in this section the computational model with discrete grids and a numbered sequence for the grids are shown in fig 16 a the size of which is 10 m 10 m the permeability of each pipe based on the upm framework in the medium is variable which ranges from 10 10 m2 to 10 9 m2 as shown in fig 16 b the length of each pipe is lm 0 25 m the left and right boundaries have the pressure boundary conditions of 1 mpa and 0 mpa respectively the normal fluid velocities along the front and back boundaries are 0 m s the medium is saturated with fluid 1 initially then fluid 2 is injected into the medium from the boundary of y 0 m the fluid interface separating the immiscible fluids is x 0 001 m at t 0 s in addition two different situations are considered in the section 1 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 0005 pa s and 2 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 005 pa s the maximum moving displacement of the fluid interface at each time step is the same as that described in section 4 1 the simulated results of the processes of immiscible displacement in the inhomogeneous medium for the two situations are shown in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 a which addresses the first situation that fluid interface is rough because the permeabilities of each pipe are different and the roughness increases over time fig 17 b addresses the second situation which also involves a rough moving fluid interface during the process however the change of roughness is not as prominent as that in the first situation fig 18 presents the variations of the differences between the maximum and the minimum in the fluid interface along the x direction with the normalized time for the two situations in the first situation the difference while retaining fluctuations overall increases over time however in the second situation the difference increases over time only in the beginning and then becomes stable with some fluctuations the phenomenon of a rough fluid interface named viscous fingering is common and important in oil reservoirs the phenomenon is influenced by fluid viscosities and permeabilities of the medium the previous study bear 2013 shows that viscous fingering always occurs when the mobility ratio m kdriving μdriving kdriven μ driven 1 which matches our computational results from this case study it can be concluded that the developed method is a useful tool to simulate the problem of a moving fluid interface 5 conclusions a unified pipe network based nmm is developed to simulate immiscible two phase flow in a geological medium including homogeneous and inhomogeneous media the effectiveness of the developed method is verified first by analytical and finite element methods through exemplification for immiscible displacement with the same fluid properties in a horizontal and vertical homogeneous medium subsequently the developed method is adopted to simulate immiscible displacement with various fluid properties in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media the following conclusions are drawn in the simulation of immiscible displacement in a rectangular geological medium with an output point a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 corresponds to a larger difference between the maximum and minimum fluid velocity in fluid interface a shorter time from beginning to end and a smaller area occupied by the driving fluid at the moment when the driving fluid reaches the output point for immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium containing a single fracture with a higher permeability the immiscible displacement phenomenon is different for different fluid properties in the situation that the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of driven fluid the distance between the most forward position and the rearward position in a fluid interface increases over time in the reverse situation the distance between the most forward position and the rearward position in a fluid interface increases with time until to the moment that the driving fluid reaches at the fracture right tip then it decreases over time for immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability the fluid interface is rough regardless of the fluid s mobility however the roughness increases over time for the situation that the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of the driven fluid in the reverse situation the change of roughness is not strongly linked to time the current study is restricted to the immiscible displacement in geotechnical media using the developed method with the rectangular grids future works will focus on developing the method with triangular grids and exploring the effects of boundary conditions fracture distribution capillary

handled by huaming guo editor in chief with the assistance of georgia destouni associate editor a unified pipe network based numerical manifold method nmm is developed to simulate immiscible two phase flow in a geological medium both heterogeneous and non heterogeneous geological media can be discretized as numerical pipe networks which have high efficiency and accuracy in simulating fluid and mass transfer in fractured rock masses a manifold element method is developed to solve the governing equations of immiscible two phase flow in pipes the developed nmm can simulate moving and deforming of two phase flow interface a grid based front tracking method updates the marker points constructing the fluid interface explicitly in each time step the effectiveness of the nmm is verified through analytical and finite element analysis parametric studies are conducted by simulating immiscible two phase flows with various fluid properties in homogeneous and inhomogeneous geological conditions the results show that the developed method can efficiently simulate the moving interface of two phase flow in geological media including effects such as viscous fingering a noteworthy phenomenon in enhanced oil recovery when the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of the driven fluid the inhomogeneity of the medium can cause the fluid interface to roughen which increases over time during the process of two phase flow for the inverse situation although the fluid interface remains rough the roughness variation throughout the process is not prominent keywords immiscible displacement moving interface unified pipe network method numerical manifold method grid based front tracking method 1 introduction immiscible displacement a basic problem of two phase flow widely exists in many geotechnical engineerings such as seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers ketabchi et al 2016 koussis et al 2015 and unconfined seepage free surface seepage in porous or fractured porous media kazemzadeh parsi and daneshmand 2013 zheng et al 2014a b wang et al 2016 jiang et al 2014 ren et al 2016 moving and deforming of fluid interfaces related to two phase flow in geological media imposes a computational challenge because of the discontinuity of material properties of fluids in the past several decades a wide variety of numerical methods has been developed to describe the fluid interfaces the commonly used methods can be divided into two categories based on numerical implementation 1 methods under eulerian framework including volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 li et al 2000 garrioch and baliga 2006 aniszewski et al 2014 level set ls method sussman et al 1994 1998 olsson and kreiss 2005 olsson et al 2007 coupled level set and volume of fluid clsvof method or coupled volume of fluid and level set voset method wang et al 2009 yokoi 2013 ling et al 2015 chakrabortya et al 2016 and the phase field pf method jacqmin 1999 takada et al 2005 kim 2012 and 2 the front tracking method in lagrangian framework unverdi and tryggvason 1992 izbassarov and muradoglu 2015 the first one is also named the front capturing method in which the interface is implicitly embedded in a scalar field function defined on a fixed grid leung and zhao 2009 discussed the pros and cons of the front capturing method in detail the main advantages are 1 a geometric problem is turned into a partial differential equations problem on a fixed grid with a simple data structure and 2 topological changes of fluid interfaces such as merging or splitting can be easily solved the main drawbacks include 1 the front capturing method is less accurate and less efficient than the front tracking method in term of both the interface representation and evolution and 2 additional effort is needed to determine the interface explicitly further information about the front capturing method can be found in the references above here we focus on the front tracking method in the front tracking method the interface is typically constructed by a set of marker points which are updated in a lagrangian method based on the velocity field at each time step in two dimensions the front can be reconstructed via line segments in three dimensions triangles are often used this method is attractive because of the following advantages 1 representing the moving and deforming of fluid interface efficiently and accurately and 2 tracking the motion of the marker points easily the disadvantages of the method are 1 the points distributed in a fluid interface may move too close together or far apart making the redistribution of marker points necessary after several time steps and 2 oscillations of the fluid interface may occur to overcome the shortages of this method some improved measures have been adopted udaykumar and shyy 1995 developed a grid supported marker particle scheme for interface tracking which can accommodate particle depletion accumulation and merger breakup issues with suitable accuracy a front tracking method with an underlying grid was proposed by glimm et al 2000 the interface is represented by a triangulated mesh the underlying grid is used to maintain a quasi uniform triangulation of the interface during the evolution and to reconnect the interface when topological changes occur terashima and tryggvason 2009 introduced a front tracking ghost fluid method for the simulation of fluid interfaces incompressible flows which can simulate interface dynamics accurately for oscillations in the fluid interface the following remedies summarized by sethian 1999 can be used to eliminate this problem 1 reducing the time step 2 smoothing the speed function 3 redistributing marker particles according to the arc length or a related quantity after several time steps and 4 developing and implementing a filtering technique to remove noise i e oscillations in the particle positions in this study a grid based front tracking method is also developed which is introduced in detail in section 2 3 apart from the front tracking methods the choice of numerical methods is also important to solve the governing equations of immiscible displacement with fluid interfaces the widely used methods combined with a front tracking method include finite difference method unverdi and tryggvason 1992 irfan and muradoglu 2017 finite volume method tryggvason et al 2001 finite element method zhao and heinrich 2001 charlot et al 2015 and discontinuous galerkin method nguyen et al 2010 sollie et al 2011 lu et al 2016 in the above methods additional efforts should be taken for the situation where a front interface is in an element because an element can only represent a single material property to solve this problem the representative approaches are as follows 1 modifying the meshes near the front to make the mesh match the interface in each time step and 2 treating all of the phases in the fluids domain together by solving a single set of governing equations different fluids are identified by a step heaviside function h and the interface is marked by a nonzero value of the gradient of the step function on a fixed grid tryggvason et al 2001 the recently developed numerical manifold method nmm can model both a continuum and discontinuum in a unified framework based on a finite cover system with independent mathematical and physical covers the nmm cover system is free from the model geometry which dispenses the necessity of re meshing the grids near the interface thus the innovative dual cover system of the nmm overcomes the inconvenience of the interface element assumption that is required in the conventional numerical method in this way the nmm can model a continuum a transition of a continuum to a discontinuum and a discontinuum including geometric discontinuities shi 1991 2013 and material discontinuities an et al 2011 wu et al 2017 in a unified manner the nmm was initially proposed to solve rock mechanics problems such as stability of rock structures ma et al 2010 ning et al 2011 failure propagation in rock masses ma et al 2009 zhang and zhang 2012 zheng et al 2014a b zheng and xu 2014 wu and wong 2014 zhang et al 2017 hydraulic fracture simulating wu and wong 2014 zhang et al 2015 and stress wave propagation across rock masses fan et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 recently the nmm has also been explored and developed to analyze the seepage flow in porous and fractured media zheng et al 2015 adopted the nmm to solve unconfined seepage flow in porous media hu et al 2015 used the nmm to model fluid flow in heterogeneous media a new second order nmm was proposed and used to analyze a free surface flow in inner drains by wang et al 2016 hu et al 2016 2017 developed a new nmm model for analyzing fluid flow and the coupling process of hydro mechanical fluids in fractured media with non conforming mesh ma et al 2017 2018a adopted a developed nmm for simulating a two phase flow in fracture networks in this study we further develop the method to simulate two phase flow in geological media a geologic body such as rock mass and soil is an inhomogeneous fractured porous medium subjected to geostress external loading hydraulic pressure and thermal effects fan et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2018 to deal with this medium more efficiently another method based on a finite element mesh the unified pipe network method upm was developed by ren in 2015 which has a special advantage in simulating fluid flow heat transfer and contaminant transport in complicated geological media in this method fluids flow heat transfer and contaminant transport in both rock matrixes and fractures are treated as those in pipes the pipes can be divided as matrix pipes and fracture pipes based on their representative entities moreover no matter for three dimensional or two dimension problems the pipes are one dimensional thus the rock matrixes and fractures can be processed in a unified method despite their properties hitherto the method was adopted to analyze water flow in fractured porous rock ren et al 2016 co2 sequestration in fractured saline aquifers ren et al 2017a b wormhole propagation caused by acidizing in fractured carbonate rocks chen et al 2018a ma et al 2018b and evaluation of geothermal development in fractured hot dry rock chen et al 2018b c d however a pipe can only have one material property under the upm framework if the mesh is not to coincide with the interfaces auxiliary pipes are needed as in the study by ren et al 2016 to combine the advantages and overcome the disadvantages of the nmm and upm a unified pipe network based nmm is developed for simulating immiscible displacement with a fluid interface in this study the upm is adopted to discrete a geological medium into one dimensional flow pipes and the nmm is used to solve the governing equations of immiscible displacement in these pipes the outline of this paper is as follows the governing equations for the two phase flow the unified pipe network based nmm grid based front tracking method and adaptive time step updating method are introduced in detail in section 2 the validation of the developed method with grid based front tracking is verified by analytic and finite element method solutions in section 3 in section 4 immiscible displacement with various fluid properties is analyzed and discussed in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media with the developed method some conclusions are obtained in the last section 2 governing equations unified pipe network based nmm and grid based front tracking method 2 1 governing equations for immiscible displacement with an abrupt interface in the current mathematical model we assume that 1 two immiscible fluids exist in a geological medium 2 the densities of fluids are constant 3 the fluid flow in the medium obeys darcy s law 4 there is a fluid interface separating the two fluids and 5 the compressibility of fluids and the capillary pressure between two fluids are ignored fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of a two phase flow in a rectangle geological medium ω1 and ω2 are the regions occupied by fluid 1 and fluid 2 respectively г b represents the external boundary and г m is the internal fluid interface separating the two fluids in each side of the interface the governing equation of fluid flow is 1 k i μ i p ρ i g z 0 x ω i where subscript i 1 or 2 is the fluid phase k is permeability μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity ρ is fluid density p is hydraulic pressure g is gravitational acceleration z is the height along the z direction in the 2d problem x i y i for a horizontal plane and x i z i for a vertical plane the fluid velocity vi can be obtained based on darcy s law with the effect of gravity 2 v i k i μ i p i ρ i g z to solve this problem the velocity and pressure conditions on the fluid interface are also necessary the fluids velocities condition which needs to satisfy the continuity of fluid velocity is as follows 3 k 1 μ 1 p 1 ρ 1 g z k 2 μ 2 p 2 ρ 2 g z v o n γ m ξ t the pressure condition is as follows 4 p ξ t p ξ t p c on γ m ξ t where pc is capillary pressure which is neglected in our present study ξ t represents the positions of the fluid interface at time t ξ t and ξ t represent one side of the fluid interface and the other side respectively 2 2 a unified pipe network based nmm in the developed method the upm with rectangle grids is adopted to discretize the computational model and the nmm is used to solve the governing equations of the two phase flow in pipes the upm treats fractures and porous medium as connected one dimensional flow pipes in a unified way fig 2 a illustrates conceptualization of a fractured rock mass into pipe networks a fractured rock mass is shown in fig 2a 1 discretizing the rock mass with rectangular grids as shown in fig 2a 2 the line segments constitute the mesh are the pipes in the upm which are divided as rock matrix pipes fig 2a 3 and fracture pipes fig 2a 4 based on their representative entities for fractures as the fractures and fracture pipes have the same dimension in the 2d problem the equivalent permeabilities for fracture pipes are the same with that for corresponding fractures which can be obtained generally through cubic law ma et al 2017 5 k ef k f b h 2 12 μ where bh is hydraulic aperture μ is fluid dynamic viscosity kef and kf are equivalent permeability of fracture pipes and permeability of fractures respectively for a 2d rock matrix or porous medium the equivalent permeabilities for matrix pipes are different from the original permeability of the medium ren 2015 derived the equivalent parameters of matrix pipes of triangular grids a structured pipe network with rectangular grids is adopted in this study the method of deriving the equivalent parameters for pipes in a rectangular grid is the same as pipes in a triangular grid fig 2 b shows the pipe equivalence of a rock matrix or porous medium with rectangular grids the circumcenter o of the rectangle acts as the center of its division points the line linking the circumcenter o and the middle point of each edge is perpendicular to the edge which divides the rectangle into four parts polygon iboe polygon bjco polygon ockd and polygon eodl in the upm the fluid flow from polygon iboe to polygon bjco in the domain is equivalent to the fluid flow from point i to j in pipe ij similarly the fluid flow in polygons bjco and ockd is equivalent to the flow in pipe jk the fluid flow in polygons ockd and eodl is equivalent to the flow in pipe kl and the fluid flow in polygons eodl and iboe is equivalent to the flow in pipe li the original permeability of a porous medium is km then the corresponding equivalent permeability for each pipe kem is as follows based on ren s work 2015 6 k em i j l ob l ij k m k em j k l oc l jk k m k em k l l od l kl k m k em l i l oe l li k m for a pipe which represents both rock matrix and fracture its permeability kemf is calculated by superposition principle namely 7 k e m f m n k e m m n k e f m n note that the permeability of a medium is related to the properties of the medium only not the fluids in it thus the equivalent permeability derived from a single phase flow in a porous medium can be applied to the immiscible displacement with a fluid interface in a geological media after obtaining the equivalent permeability a two phase fluid flow in a porous media or a fractured porous medium can be treated as two phase flow in one dimensional pipes fig 3 a shows the immiscible displacement with a fluid interface in the rectangle grids fluid 1 occupies the red pipes and fluid 2 occupies the gray pipes the black solid line is the fluid interface separating the immiscible fluids the points in the black solid line are the intersection points of the interface with the grids which will be explained in section 2 3 there are two fluids in some pipes for example pipe 3 and pipe 4 shown in fig 3 a which causes discontinuities of material properties thus the nmm is adopted to solve the governing equations of the two phase flow in the pipes the nmm for a two phase flow in single fractures and fracture networks was developed in our previous study ma et al 2017 2018a the method includes three basic concepts the mathematical cover physical cover and manifold element the mathematical cover determines the numerical precision which can be constructed as a union of a finite number of small patches used to occupy the entire physical domain note that the edges of the small patches do not have to match either the internal or external discontinuities in the nmm the physical cover is a mathematical cover divided by fractures discrete interfaces and a boundary which determines the integration fields the manifold element is defined as the common region shared by several covers for a cross grid consisting of pipe 1 pipe 2 pipe 3 and pipe 4 as shown in fig 3 a the mathematical covers physical covers and manifold elements are shown in fig 3 b and the corresponding mathematical covers and physical covers for the cross point are shown in fig 3 c in this study two mathematical covers are used for each pipe when there is no fluid interface in a pipe two physical covers and one manifold element are ultimately formed for example in pipes 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 b an element in the nmm is a flow pipe in the upm when there is a fluid interface in a pipe the mathematical covers are divided by the interface four physical covers and two manifold elements are ultimately formed such as pipes 3 and 4 in fig 3 b in particular the pipe is divided into two pipes depending on the fluid properties which cannot be achieved under the upm framework alone a linear weight function φ x is defined in our present study on each mathematical cover mi which satisfies 8 φ i x 0 x m i φ i x 0 x m i a n d k if x m k φ i x 1 eq 8 partially imposes the continuity of approximation each function is nonzero only on its corresponding mathematical cover mi and zero elsewhere the governing equations of a two phase flow eq 1 are written discretely under the galerkin method as follows ma et al 2017 9 k α μ α l e ω x i ω t x i d x i p ω k α μ α p x i l e x i ω α x where p p 1 p 2 ω w 1 w 2 t and le is manifold element if there is no fluid interface in a pipe the matrix equation for the pipe is as follows based on eq 9 10 k p b where k is the assembly of k α μ α l e ω x i ω t x i d x i the submatrix of the manifold element in the pipe b is assembly of ω k α μ α p x i l e in the pipe for the situation where there is a fluid interface in a pipe the method of obtaining the matrix for the pipe is as follows based on the darcy s law the term k α μ α p x i represents the fluid velocity which is unknown variables and needs to be solved thus we change the above function as the following format 11 k α μ α l e ω x i ω t x i d x i p ω v α l e 0 x i ω α x then the following discrete equation is supplemented to satisfy the pressure interface condition 12 ω 1 x p 1 x ω 2 x p 2 x 0 where x is the position of the fluid interface ω 1 x and p 1 x are the weight functions and pressures on the physical covers related to the fluid interface for fluid 1 respectively ω 2 x and p 2 x are the weight functions and pressures on the physical covers related to the fluid interface for fluid 2 respectively eq 12 can be further written as the following format 13 ω x p x 0 where ω x ω t combining eqs 13 and 11 the following matrix equation can be obtained which satisfied both pressure interface condition and velocity interface condition 14 k ω ω t 0 p v 0 p c where pc is capillary pressure along a fluid interface it is 0 pa in this study the global discrete equation for a pipe system can be obtained by assembling the discrete equation for each pipe based on the physical cover codes for the pipes and the cross point note that if the fluid interface lies only at the cross point the following equation is added to satisfied mass conservation in the cross point 15 i 1 4 q i 0 the pressure functions of physical covers can be obtained by solving the global discrete equation under the appropriate boundary and initial conditions the velocity of the fluid at each pipe can be obtained based on darcy s law i e eq 2 2 3 a grid based front tracking method an explicit method is adopted to simulate the moving and deforming of the fluid interface the positions of the fluid interface are explicitly depicted in a developed grid based front tracking method which is a straightforward and practical approach in this method a set of marker points are used to track and construct the fluid interface different from the conventional front tracking method the marker points are redistributed based on the grids at each time step in this method fig 4 illustrates the approach to update a fluid interface fig 4 a shows that positions of the fluid interface at an initial time t t 0 there are two types of points the first type represented by a hollow circle is used to construct the initial interface at each time which does not have to be in the grids the second one represented by a solid circle is the intersection points of the initial fluid interface with the grids the intersection points which act as marker points are used to reconstruct the fluid interface by linking the points with line segments at the current time step and to track the position of the fluid interface at the next time step the fluid interface constructed by the marker points is called a modified fluid interface fig 4 b shows the positions of the marker points and the corresponding fluid interface black solid line formed by linking these marker points at time t tn fluid 1 lies on the left side of the fluid interface and fluid 2 lies in the right side the velocity for each marker point v ix t v iy t at the current time can be obtained based on darcy s law after a time step δt the new positions of all the marker points are calculated using eq 16 16 x i t δ t y i t δ t x i t y i t v ix t v iy t δ t where subscript i is a marker point number i 1 2 3 m m is the total number of marker points δt is the time step x i t δ t y i t δ t and x i t y i t are the positions of the marker points at t δt and δt respectively the new positions of all marker points and new forming initial fluid interfaces are shown in fig 4 b represented by a hollow circle and a purple dashed line respectively note that not all the new positions of the marker points are in the grids then the intersection points of the initial fluid interface and grids are computed as shown in fig 4 c to act as new marker points to obtain the new locations of the fluid interface at the next time step when there is a point boundary condition in the computational domain the marker points are closer to the boundary point and the fluid velocities near the boundary point are larger thus the line segments linking the points to construct the initial interface might be intersected at a time step as shown in fig 5 at a time the marker points and corresponding fluid interface shown in red are as shown in fig 5 a there are 21 marker points and the label for each marker point is a red normal number at the next time step the red marker points move to the positions presented by the black hollow circles the corresponding labels for which are black italic numbers note that when linking the black hollow circles to construct an initial fluid interface the line segment linking points 9 and 10 and the line segment linking points 12 and 13 have an intersection point which is indicated by as shown in the local enlarged drawing on the left side of fig 5 a for this phenomenon a modified approach is proposed to reconstruct the fluid interface which is as follows 1 calculating the position of the intersection point of the initial fluid interface as shown in fig 5 a labeled by c1 2 calculating the average position of the points forming a new closed area the points that form a closed area are c1 10 11 and 12 in fig 5 a and the average position is the point marked by a purple hollow circle numbered by purple normal 10 in fig 5 b 3 deleting the points forming the new enclosed area and reconstructing the initial fluid interface based on the remaining points and renumbering the points as shown in fig 5 b the purple dotted line and the purple normal numbers are used to reconstruct the initial fluid interface and the points respectively and 4 calculating the intersection points of the purple lines and grids which act as the marker points at the next time step as shown in fig 5 c in eq 16 in addition to the locations of the marker points the other two parameters namely the velocities of each marker point and time step δt are also important and are introduced in detail in the following two sections 2 4 calculating the velocities for each marker points based on the coupled method of the upm and the nmm the fluid velocity in a pipe is the average velocity namely it is constant in a pipe this results in the following two problems 1 the fluid velocities at the same cross point that belong to different pipes are different taking the cross grid shown in fig 3 a as an example the fluid velocity in pipe 1 might differ from that in pipe 3 along the x direction and the fluid velocity in pipe 2 might differ from that in pipe 4 along the y direction this actually conflicts with the principle of flux conservation at a cross point 2 there is only one direction in a pipe for example the direction of the fluid velocities in the pipes parallel to the x axis is the x direction and that parallel to the y axis is the y direction thus a modified velocity calculation approach is proposed first the fluid velocity at a cross node is treated as the average velocities of the cross points at different pipes which is calculated using the following equation for rectangular grids 17 v nx v ny 1 a n pi 1 a n v pix 1 b n pj 1 b n v pjy where vnx and vny are the fluid velocities at cross point n along the x direction and y direction respectively an is the number of pipes in the x direction connected to the cross point n and bn is the number of pipes in the y direction connected to the cross point n after obtaining the fluid velocities at the cross points the fluid velocity at a marker point in a pipe can be obtained through the linear interception method we take the marker point i and m shown in fig 6 a as an example for marker point i which lies in a pipe parallel to the y direction the velocity of the two endpoints of the pipe are viux viuy and vidx vidy as shown in fig 6 b the distance between the marker point and the upper endpoint is lu and the distance between the marker point and lower endpoint is ld l lu then the fluid velocity at the marker point i is calculated using the following equation 18 v ix v iy l d l v iux l u l v idx l d l v iuy l u l v idy for the marker point m which is in a pipe along the x direction the velocities for the two endpoints of the pipe are vmlx vmly and vmrx vmry as shown in fig 6 c the distances between the marker endpoint and the right endpoint and left endpoint are lr and ll respectively the velocity for the marker point m is calculated as follows 19 v mx v my l l l v mrx l r l v mly l l l v mry l r l v mly 2 5 an adaptive time step updating method an adaptive time step updating method with a fixed displacement is proposed in this section to balance the computational accuracy and efficiency because the velocities of the marker points constructing the fluid interface might be different at each time step the maximum moving distance of the marker points is constant at each time step the time step δt is calculated using the following equations 20 l a min l 1 l 2 l 3 l i l i 1 l n δ t l max v 1 v 2 v 3 v m where l is the maximum distance of the fluid interface moving at each time step li is the length of pipe i n is the total number of elements and a is a coefficient with 0 a 1 3 method verification to verify the accuracy of the coupled method of upm and nmm with the developed grid based front tracking method two examples are conducted in this section the first example involves two phase flow in a horizontal porous medium and is verified with analytical results where gravity is not considered and the second example involves two phase flow in a vertical porous medium considering the effects of gravity and is validated using the fem solutions 3 1 two phase flow in a horizontal porous medium the computational model is shown in fig 7 a which is a rectangular domain with dimensions of 10 m width and 20 m length the mesh grid is shown in fig 7 b and the length of each pipe is lm 0 125 m an output point is located in the middle of the domain which corresponds to a flux boundary condition of 1 m2 s boundaries 1 2 3 and 4 are pressure conditions the pressure of boundary 1 is 0 pa the pressures of boundaries 2 and 4 are shown in fig 7 c and the pressure of boundary 3 is shown in fig 7 d an analytical solution exists for the situation where the properties of the driving fluid and driven fluid are the same thus a two phase flow with the same fluid properties is conducted the densities of the two fluids are ρ 1 ρ 2 1000 kg m3 and the gravity constant is g 10 n kg the viscosities for the two fluids are μ 1 μ 2 0 001 pa s the permeability of the porous medium is k 10 9 m2 the pressures for boundaries 2 4 and 3 are obtained based on analytical solutions expressed as follows bear 2013 21 φ 0 φ q 4 π k ln x l 2 2 y d 2 x l 2 2 y d 2 φ z p ρ g where φ denotes the piezometric head and φ 0 is the piezometric head at x 0 which is set to be 0 q is the flow rate in the output point k is the hydraulic conductive coefficient with k kρg μ l is the length of the domain and d is the distance from x 0 to the output point p is the hydraulic pressure the domain is originally saturated with fluid 1 then fluid 2 is injected from the boundary y 0 m at the initial time the position of the fluid interface separating the two fluids is y 0 01 m the results calculated using the developed method are compared with the analytical solutions the pressure variations along the selected section l 1 and l 2 are shown in fig 8 a and b the selected sections l 1 and l 2 are the lines x 10 m and y 5 m in the domain respectively as shown in fig 7 b the black lines in fig 8 a and b are the results obtained by the developed method and the red dashed lines are the corresponding analytical results obtained using eq 21 the results of the developed method agree well with the analytical solutions moreover the total time from t 0 s to the moment that the driven fluid has just reached the output point is also calculated using the coupled method and compared with the analytical solution the maximum displacement among all marker points in each time step is l lm 11 which is used to calculate the time step δt using eq 20 the total time obtained by the coupled method is 52 77 s as shown in fig 8 c and the corresponding analytical solution is 52 36 s which is calculated using eq 22 bear 2013 22 t 2 π d 2 3 q 52 36 s in this example the calculation stops when the minimum distance between the output point and the fluid interface is smaller than 10 4 m a comparison of the two results further supports the accuracy of this developed method during the process of immiscible displacement the variations of the fluid interface at various times are presented in fig 8 c which indicates that the fluid interface gradually becomes a concave conical curve from an initial straight line the cause of this phenomenon is that the pipes closer to the output point corresponds to a larger pressure gradient as shown in fig 8 a and b 3 2 two phase flow in a vertical porous medium this section verifies the developed method under the effect of gravity with an example of a two phase flow in a vertical porous medium the computational model is shown in fig 9 a two fluids exist designated fluid 1 and fluid 2 the properties of the two fluids are the same with densities of 1000 kg m3 and viscosities of 0 001 pa s the permeability of the porous medium is 10 9 m2 the gravity constant g is 10 n kg in this model the left boundary and right boundary have the pressure boundary condition which is 100 kpa for the left boundary and 0 kpa for the right boundary the upper and lower boundaries have the velocity boundary condition with the normal fluid velocities of the two boundaries at 0 m s the fluid interface is at x 2 m within the domain the pressure nephogram obtained by the developed method is shown in fig 10 a and compared with the fem result obtained using comsol multiphysics shown in fig 10 b the pressure variations of the two results are the same to accurately compare the results of the two methods three cross sections are selected as shown in fig 9 a which are y 3 m y 5 m and y 7 m in the domain the pressure distributions along the three selected lines are shown in fig 10 c in the figure the red dashed lines represent the results of the coupled method and the solid blue lines represent the corresponding fem results the two methods are identical thus verifying the accuracy of the developed method under the effect of gravity 4 immiscible displacement in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media in this section the developed method is adopted to analyze immiscible displacement in a common geotechnical medium including a homogeneous medium and an inhomogeneous medium furthermore the following two cases are considered for the inhomogeneous medium 1 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium containing a single fracture and 2 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability 4 1 immiscible displacement in a horizontal homogeneous medium a two phase flow in a horizontal homogeneous medium with the same fluid properties was verified in section 3 1 in this section immiscible displacement with various fluid properties is studied the computational model and grids are shown in fig 7 a and fig 9 b respectively the length of each pipe is lm 0 25 m boundary 1 and boundary 5 are pressure boundary conditions of 0 mpa and 1 mpa respectively boundaries 2 3 and 4 are velocity boundary condition and the normal velocities along them are 0 m s the permeability of the porous medium is 10 9 m2 the medium is initially saturated with fluid 1 fluid 2 is then injected into the medium from boundary 1 three different situations are considered 1 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 00025 pa s 2 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 001 pa s and 3 μ 1 0 00025 pa s μ 2 0 001 pa s where μ is the viscosity of the fluid the fluid interface separating the two fluids lies at y 0 01 m at the initial time the maximum displacement of all marker points are l lm 31 at each time step for the above three situations and the time step δt can be obtained based on eq 20 similar to the case described in section 3 1 the calculation ends when the minimum distance between the output point and the fluid interface is smaller than 10 4 m the processes for immiscible displacement for the three situations are shown in fig 11 the black lines in the figures express the positions and shapes of the fluid interface at various times the total time from the beginning to the end and the ratio of the displacement area to the total area at the end are also given in the figures during the process of immiscible displacement the varying distances between the fluid interface at x 10 m and x 0 m versus time are presented in fig 12 because the total times are not the same for all three situations the time is normalized for a more straightforward presentation of the variation patterns comparing the three situations we find the following similarities 1 the deforming forms of the fluid interface are similar during the process for the three situations i e the fluid interface gradually becomes a concave conical curve from an initially straight line and 2 the distances l increase over time the cause of this phenomenon is that a closer output point corresponds to a larger fluid velocity the differences are as follows 1 a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 with the same m 1 corresponds to a larger difference between the maximum and minimum fluid velocity in the fluid interface 2 a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 with the same m 1 corresponds to a shorter time from beginning to end and 3 a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 with the same m 1 corresponds to a smaller area occupied by the driving fluid in the end the ratios of the displacement area to the total area for the three situations are 17 93 24 48 and 36 18 respectively 4 2 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with a single fracture the computational model for the inhomogeneous medium with a single fracture is shown in fig 13 a the size of which is 8 m 10 m the mesh for this model is shown in fig 13 b the length of each pipe is lm 0 25 m the permeability of the fracture is higher than that of the porous medium which is 1 0 10 m2 for the porous and 1 0 8 m2 for the fracture the left and right boundaries are pressure boundary conditions of 1 mpa and 0 mpa respectively the normal fluid velocities along boundary 3 and boundary 4 are 0 m s the medium is saturated with fluid 1 initially and then fluid 2 is injected into the medium from boundary 1 the fluid interface separating the immiscible fluids is located at x 0 001 m at t 0 s two distinct situations are considered in this case study 1 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 0005 pa s and 2 μ 1 0 0005 pa s μ 2 0 001 pa s where μ is the fluid viscosity the ending condition and the maximum moving displacement of the fluid interface in each time step are the same as those in section 4 1 the simulation results about the processes of immiscible displacement for the two situations are shown in fig 14 fig 14 a addresses the first situation taking 272 19 s from the beginning to the end the driving fluid fluid 2 presented in red reaches the left end point of the fracture at t 163 07 s and the right endpoint at t 179 56 s since the permeability of the fracture is larger than that of a porous medium in this model the fluid velocity along y 5 m is larger than that in other places before t 163 07 s as shown in fig 14 a from t 0 s to t 163 07 s after the driving fluid reaches the right endpoint of the fracture i e after t 179 56 s more of fluid 2 flows into the fracture because of the higher permeability of the fracture and this fluid gradually enters the porous medium near the fracture the amount of driving fluid in the area near the fracture s right tip is more than that on both sides of the fracture at t 234 96 s as shown in fig 14 a because the fracture has a higher permeability than the porous medium and because the driving fluid has a higher mobility more driving fluid tends to enter the fracture than entering the nearby porous medium with increasing time this phenomenon of infiltration inhomogeneity becomes increasingly prominent along the fracture the last figure in fig 14 a shows the fluid interface shape at the end of the process the process of immiscible displacement for the second situation is shown in fig 14 b this process lasts 371 56 s from beginning to end which is longer than that in the first situation because of the lower permeability of the driving fluid fluid 2 relative to that of the driven fluid the driving fluid presented in red reaches the left end point of the fracture at t 117 30 s and the right end point at t 136 81 s similar to the first situation the higher permeability of the fracture causes a larger pressure gradient near the end points of the fracture and the fluid velocity along y 5 m is larger than that in other places before t 117 30 s as shown in fig 14 b from t 0 s to t 117 30 s after the driving fluid reaches the right endpoint of the fracture i e after t 136 81 s more of fluid 2 tends to flow into the fracture and gradually enters the porous medium near the fracture owing to the same reason as described earlier the amount of driving fluid in the area near the right tip of the fracture is more than that in the areas on both sides of the fracture however this phenomenon of infiltration inhomogeneity gradually disappears with increasing time as shown in fig 14 b at t 371 56 s the cause of this phenomenon is analyzed in the following discussion during the process of immiscible displacement in the single fractured porous medium the varying distances between the fluid interface at y 5 and y 0 versus time are plotted in fig 15 for the two situations since the total times are not the same these times are normalized for more straightforward presentation of the variation patterns of the two situations in this figure the blue dotted line represents situation 1 and the red dotted line represents situation 2 for situation 1 the variations can be divided into 3 stages based on the variation trends in fig 14 a stage i lasts from t 0 s t ttotal 0 to t 163 07 s t ttotal 0 60 stage ii lasts from t 163 07 s t ttotal 0 60 to t 179 56 s t ttotal 0 66 and stage iii lasts from t 179 56 s t ttotal 0 66 to t 272 19 s t ttotal 1 in the first stage the distance increases slowly over time after the driving fluid enters into the fracture i e in the second stage the distance sharply increases over time in the third stage the distance still increases over time but the increased gradient is larger than that in stage i and smaller than that in stage ii for the second situation the process can also be divided into three stages based on the trends in fig 14 b stage i lasts from t 0 s t ttotal 0 to t 117 30 s t ttotal 0 32 stage ii lasts from t 117 30 s t ttotal 0 32 to t 136 81 s t ttotal 0 37 and stage iii lasts from t 136 81 s t ttotal 0 37 to t 371 56 s t ttotal 1 the variation trends for the first two stages are similar with the first situation in stage i the distance increases slowly over time in stage ii it increases sharply over time different from situation 1 the distance increases slightly at first and then decreases slowly over time in stage iii the reason for the slight increase is the method of calculating the fluid velocity in pipes as introduced in section 2 4 in this method the fluid velocity at a cross node is treated as the average velocities of the cross points at different pipes and the fluid velocity at marker point i is obtained through the endpoint s velocity of the pipe corresponding to the marker point as shown in eqs 17 and 18 when a porous pipe is connected with a fractured pipe the fluid velocity in this porous pipe affected by the nearby higher permeability fracture is augmented as for the subsequent decrease of the fluid velocity the explanations are as follows 1 the fluid velocity with lower mobility is smaller under the same pressure gradient 2 the permeability of a driving fluid is lower than that of the driven fluid and 3 when the driving fluid through the fracture has a higher permeability than the porous medium the driving fluid fluid 2 moves faster in the location y 5 m than in other areas however when an area is occupied by more of fluid 2 the fluid velocity decreases over time because of the lower mobility of fluid 2 after fluid 2 reenters the porous medium with lower permeability 4 3 immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability on the basis of the study described in section 4 2 immiscible displacement in a horizontal inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability is simulated and analyzed in this section the computational model with discrete grids and a numbered sequence for the grids are shown in fig 16 a the size of which is 10 m 10 m the permeability of each pipe based on the upm framework in the medium is variable which ranges from 10 10 m2 to 10 9 m2 as shown in fig 16 b the length of each pipe is lm 0 25 m the left and right boundaries have the pressure boundary conditions of 1 mpa and 0 mpa respectively the normal fluid velocities along the front and back boundaries are 0 m s the medium is saturated with fluid 1 initially then fluid 2 is injected into the medium from the boundary of y 0 m the fluid interface separating the immiscible fluids is x 0 001 m at t 0 s in addition two different situations are considered in the section 1 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 0005 pa s and 2 μ 1 0 001 pa s μ 2 0 005 pa s the maximum moving displacement of the fluid interface at each time step is the same as that described in section 4 1 the simulated results of the processes of immiscible displacement in the inhomogeneous medium for the two situations are shown in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 a which addresses the first situation that fluid interface is rough because the permeabilities of each pipe are different and the roughness increases over time fig 17 b addresses the second situation which also involves a rough moving fluid interface during the process however the change of roughness is not as prominent as that in the first situation fig 18 presents the variations of the differences between the maximum and the minimum in the fluid interface along the x direction with the normalized time for the two situations in the first situation the difference while retaining fluctuations overall increases over time however in the second situation the difference increases over time only in the beginning and then becomes stable with some fluctuations the phenomenon of a rough fluid interface named viscous fingering is common and important in oil reservoirs the phenomenon is influenced by fluid viscosities and permeabilities of the medium the previous study bear 2013 shows that viscous fingering always occurs when the mobility ratio m kdriving μdriving kdriven μ driven 1 which matches our computational results from this case study it can be concluded that the developed method is a useful tool to simulate the problem of a moving fluid interface 5 conclusions a unified pipe network based nmm is developed to simulate immiscible two phase flow in a geological medium including homogeneous and inhomogeneous media the effectiveness of the developed method is verified first by analytical and finite element methods through exemplification for immiscible displacement with the same fluid properties in a horizontal and vertical homogeneous medium subsequently the developed method is adopted to simulate immiscible displacement with various fluid properties in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media the following conclusions are drawn in the simulation of immiscible displacement in a rectangular geological medium with an output point a larger ratio of m 2 to m 1 corresponds to a larger difference between the maximum and minimum fluid velocity in fluid interface a shorter time from beginning to end and a smaller area occupied by the driving fluid at the moment when the driving fluid reaches the output point for immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium containing a single fracture with a higher permeability the immiscible displacement phenomenon is different for different fluid properties in the situation that the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of driven fluid the distance between the most forward position and the rearward position in a fluid interface increases over time in the reverse situation the distance between the most forward position and the rearward position in a fluid interface increases with time until to the moment that the driving fluid reaches at the fracture right tip then it decreases over time for immiscible displacement in an inhomogeneous medium with varying permeability the fluid interface is rough regardless of the fluid s mobility however the roughness increases over time for the situation that the mobility of the driving fluid is larger than that of the driven fluid in the reverse situation the change of roughness is not strongly linked to time the current study is restricted to the immiscible displacement in geotechnical media using the developed method with the rectangular grids future works will focus on developing the method with triangular grids and exploring the effects of boundary conditions fracture distribution capillary

6803,to determine the influence of the mesozoic yanshanian orogeny in east asia on contemporaneous sr isotopic evolution of seawater we systematically investigated the weathering profile riverbed sediment and stream water in mono lithological small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains anhui eastern china analysis based on 190 samples from 1 to 2 samplings per month during an entire hydrological year spanning july 2014 to june 2015 shows that the intra annual change of sr concentration is 10 70 but 87sr 86sr ratios only exhibit a slight change 0 709148 0 710427 this result indicates that using single sampling data to evaluate the influence of chemical weathering on the 87sr 86sr ratio evolution of seawater may cause some deviations the 87sr 86sr ratio in the small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains is 0 709148 0 710427 with an average of 0 710021 which is significantly higher than the lowest value 0 7068 160 ma of seawater in the phanerozoic during and after this period the east asian continent experienced a strong tectonic event yanshanian orogeny and formed widespread jurassic cretaceous igneous rocks such as the jiuhua mountains granite in the yangtze block the yanshanian granites in several main tectonic units in china exhibit high radiogenic sr characteristics combined with the evidence of enhanced chemical weathering during late jurassic early cretaceous the notable increase of the seawater 87sr 86sr ratio after 160 ma may be related to the yanshanian orogeny in east asia keywords jiuhua mountains small granitic watersheds chemical weathering sr isotopic characteristics seawater sr isotope evolution 1 introduction the evolution of strontium sr isotopes in seawater through geological time is primarily dominated by the changing balance between two sources 1 relatively radiogenic sr 0 7119 derived from continental weathering and 2 relatively nonradiogenic sr 0 7037 from hydrothermal exchange in the mid ocean ridge and hydrothermal alteration of submarine basalt fig 1 e g richter et al 1992 the dissolved sr flux from continental rivers is significantly higher than that of hydrothermal fluids and it is the most important reason for the sr isotopic evolution of seawater the 87sr 86sr ratio changes in continental and marine sedimentary records are related to changes in the chemical weathering rates caused by tectonism such as supercontinent assembly and break up and the formation of large basalt provinces e g burke et al 1982 richter et al 1992 blum 1997 taylor and lasaga 1999 veizer et al 1999 dessert et al 2001 das et al 2006 allègre et al 2010 krabbenhöft et al 2010 peucker ehrenbrink et al 2010 beck et al 2013 kani et al 2013 ullmann et al 2013 sedlacek et al 2014 satkoski et al 2016 korte and ullmann 2018 studies have shown that the sr isotopic composition of seawater has significantly increased and decreased since the phanerozoic e g burke et al 1982 depaolo and ingram 1985 palmer and elderfield 1985 elderfield 1986 veizer et al 1999 mcarthur et al 2001 2012 the cambrian approximately 500 ma 87sr 86sr ratio is very close to today 0 7091 which is the highest in the entire phanerozoic and is usually considered to be the result of enhanced weathering caused by pan african and himalayan orogeny respectively at approximately 160 ma in the mesozoic the 87sr 86sr ratio in seawater was the lowest in the entire phanerozoic approximately 0 7068 this value is usually attributed to the increased seafloor hydrothermal and volcanic activity caused by the break up of the gondwana continent and the formation of a new atlantic tethys ocean basin with less impact due to continental weathering rates jones et al 1994a b jones 2001 mcarthur et al 2001 wierzbowski et al 2013 2017 then the sr isotope ratio gradually increased before decreasing again at approximately 128 ma this increase and decrease are thought to be related to the early uplift and erosion of the cordillera mountains in north america gröcke et al 2003 and the eruption of the rajamahal flood basalts and or increased hydrothermal activity jones 2001 respectively river input is one of the most important sources of seawater sr evolution previous studies have mostly calculated annual sr fluxes of a river based on data from one sampling time considering the effects of dilution and evaporation use of data from a single sampling may lead to deviation to accurately assess the impact of continental weathering on seawater sr evolution therefore a time series sampling 1 2 times per month was conducted in this study in addition we completed a systematic study on sr isotopic characteristics of bedrock weathering profile riverbed sediment and stream water in the typical subtropic granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains and we discussed the controlling factors of the 87sr 86sr ratio through intensive sampling of 1 2 times a month in a hydrological year for 10 small watersheds affected by different terrains and human activities we investigated the temporal and spatial changes of sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio and analyzed the contribution of silicate weathering to the sr isotopic evolution of seawater 2 studied area the jiuhua mountains are located in anhui province eastern china the elevation of the main peak is 1344 m the jiuhua mountains are in a subtropical monsoon zone with a mild climate and abundant rainfall the multiyear average temperature and precipitation snowfall in winter and rainfall throughout the year are 13 4 c and 2437 5 mm respectively qingyang county meteorological administration multiyear average 2003 2015 runoff of the qingtong river and lingyang river is 1021 mm and 1072 mm respectively both the sampling year and the multiyear average discharge data show that most of the discharge occurs during the wet period june august while the winter december february is the dry period the data are from hydrological yearbook of china ministry of water resources of china vegetation coverage is 30 60 including farmland 1027 ha 11 garden land 3 and forestland 86 respectively the data from jiuhua mountains management committee the jurassic cretaceous igneous rocks are widespread in the south china block and were traditionally considered to form on the yanshanian magmatic event the jiuhua mountains qingyang complex are situated in the ne yangzte block china which was crystallized 139 127 ma the complex includes a main body the qingyang granite consisting of granodiorite and monzogranite and a central body consisting mainly of alkali feldspar granite the jiuhua mountains granite the complex intruded into the late precambrian to early paleozoic sandstones shales and limestones the first stage intrusion was named the qingyang body which in turn was intruded by the second stage central granite named the jiuhua mountains body with an outcrop area over 100 km2 the jiuhua mountains alkali feldspar granites are enriched in sio2 na2o k2o and rb but depleted in al2o3 cao and sr xu et al 2009 3 sampling and analysis in a full hydrological year from july 2014 to june 2015 water samples in ten small granitic watersheds were collected 1 2 times month including six samples in the qingtong river catchment originates from the jiuhua mountains and flows northward into the yangtze river and four in the lingyang river stems from the jiuhua mountains and flows southward through the taiping lake qingyi river and finally into the yangtze river fig 2 table 1 stream water samples were collected at the river bank and stored in precleaned polyethylene bottles that were free of air during this period 23 rainwater samples were collected using a clean polyethylene wash basin near the sampling site qth2 and then stored in bottles of the six farmland water samples five were collected at the same location in the qingtong river watershed at different times and the remaining one was collected at another site riverbed sediments of ten small granitic watersheds were collected in june 2015 a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer wtw 340i was used to measure temperature ph conductivity and total dissolved solids in situ a roadside granite weathering profile was sampled along the river valley the profile has a height of 3 5 m and no bedrock exposed fig 3 this profile can be divided into the following layers from top to bottom a 80 cm gray brown dark soil rich in organic matter wp 0 to wp 2 and a 2 2 m red brown mud silt sand layer wp 3 to wp 7 with some gray mineral particles with the size tending to increase from top to bottom and finally a 50 cm yellow brown layer wp 8 to wp 9 a total of ten samples wp 0 to wp 9 from top to bottom were collected from this profile two samples of granite bedrock were collected in fresh rocks exposed near the weathering profile water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters an aliquot of the filtered water was acidified to a ph less than 2 with ultrapure grade 1 1 nitric acid sr was measured in filtered and acidified water with an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp oes 6300 in the key laboratory of surficial geochemistry ministry of education school of earth sciences and engineering nanjing university 87sr 86sr ratios were measured using mc icp ms neptune plus thermo fisher scientific in the same laboratory the strontium standard srm987 was periodically measured to check the precision and accuracy of isotopic analyses with a mean 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 710239 42 2σ external standard deviation n 15 solid rock samples were crushed and powdered with an agate mill river sediments and weathering profile samples were air dried and ground to 200 mesh then fully digested with a mixture of different acids in sealed teflon beakers for analysis of major elements trace elements and sr isotope major and trace element contents were measured by xrf arl 9900 and icp ms finnigan mat element ii in the state key laboratory for mineral deposits research school of earth sciences and engineering nanjing university 4 results in a full hydrological year measured sr contents of 190 stream water samples range from 0 179 to 1 47 μmol l 1 showing an important temporal fluctuation table 1 87sr 86sr ratios range from 0 709148 to 0 710427 with an average of 0 710021 there is small variation of sr isotopic composition in one year relative to sr content the sr contents of 23 rainwater samples in a hydrological year range from 0 02 to 0 281 μmol l 1 and the 87sr 86sr ratios range between 0 709155 and 0 710936 table 1 sr contents of six farmland water samples range from 0 137 to 1 21 μmol l 1 being approximately one order of magnitude higher than rainwater the 87sr 86sr ratios are relatively homogeneous 0 709310 0 709861 87sr 86sr ratios of two granite and two carbonate bedrocks are 0 712826 0 712933 and 0 709066 0 709387 and 1000sr ca is 7 8 and 0 4 respectively table 2 the sr contents of riverbed sediment samples are from 96 to 312 μg g 1 and the 87sr 86sr ratios are 0 711763 0 716874 average 0 713987 1000sr ca values are high reaching 18 28 being far higher than the bedrock s which shows a large loss of ca in sediment during weathering and transportation in the granite weathering profile sr contents are 38 9 172 μg g 1 and show a decreasing trend from top to bottom table 3 the 87sr 86sr ratios range from 0 711540 to 0 735887 5 discussion 5 1 fractionation of sr isotope associated with chemical weathering to investigate the fractionation behavior of sr isotopes associated with chemical weathering we conducted a comprehensive study of weathering profile sediments and water bodies as a watershed system in the ten small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains the absolute content of elements is easily affected by the leaching of mobile elements and thus cannot truly reflect the geochemical characteristics of elements in the processes of weathering and soil formation therefore an immobile element such as ti zr and nb is usually used as a reference to calculate elemental losses and gains in the weathering profiles relative to bedrock nesbitt 1979 brimhall et al 1992 anderson et al 2002 brantley and lebedeva 2011 1 change c j c i w c j c i p 1 100 where cj and ci are the concentrations in weight percent of mobile element j and immobile element i and the subscripts w and p refer to weathered material and parent rock respectively in the topsoil layer above 50 cm na depletion is 90 and ca and k are 80 in the layer from 50 cm to 2 5 m na depletion is close to 100 and ca and k are 90 and 85 respectively in the layer from 2 5 m to 3 m the depletion level of the three elements drops to 75 80 60 70 and 10 20 respectively the decline of na ca and k loss levels in the topsoil may be attributed to two reasons on one hand the release of organic acids from the plant s roots and microorganisms to the soil fixes some major elements on the other hand input from surface runoff may also influence the major element contents in the topsoil there are very similar change trends between sr and cao rb and k2o with profile depth fig 4 a b reflecting the isomorphism relationship of the two pairs of elements in ca containing and k containing minerals the change trends of sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios with profile depth are opposite and there is a good positive correlation between 1 sr and 87sr 86sr ratios r2 0 67 figs 4c 5 which may indicate the mixing of influence from two end members we speculate that the end member with high 87sr 86sr ratio and low sr content is attributed to the k rich minerals weathering such as weathering resistant potassium feldspars and another end member with low 87sr 86sr ratio and high sr content may be anorthite albite feldspar weathering and input from surface runoff when compared with the granite bedrocks the weathering profile has higher 87sr 86sr ratios with the exception of the two samples in the topsoil the main reason is the preferential leaching of anorthite albite feldspar with lower 87sr 86sr ratio during weathering the topsoil above 50 cm has lowest 87sr 86sr ratio in the profile which may reflect the influence of input from surface runoff with low sr isotopic compositions small changes of the 87sr 86sr ratio in the 50 cm 2 5 m layer can be attributed to the same slight change of loss level of ca na and k a significant rise of the 87sr 86sr ratio highest in the profile in the 2 5 m 3 0 m layer is highly consistent with the increase of k and rb contents which shows that with the large loss of na and ca the proportion of k containing minerals increases resulting in a rapid increase in the sr isotopic composition in the ten sediment samples the 87sr 86sr values of six samples were higher than those of the granite bedrock in the catchment while the values of the other four samples were lower than the bedrock this finding may reflect changes in the proportion of minerals such as anorthite albite calcite with lower 87sr 86sr values and potassium feldspar biotite with high 87sr 86sr values in the sediments the 87sr 86sr ratios of the sediments are all higher than the corresponding values in stream water indicating that sr isotope has been fractionated during the weathering process the dissolved load in water is primarily derived from an easily soluble component such as albite anorthite and calcite lower 87sr 86sr value and weathering resistant potassium feldspar higher 87sr 86sr value is more preferentially retained in sediments there is no obvious correlation between 87sr 86sr ratios of sediments and water fig 6 the possible reason for this lack of correlation is that the tiny streams are more susceptible to the inputs from trace carbonate evaporite minerals and human activity 5 2 source of sr in stream water the dissolved load content in river water is mainly controlled by rock weathering in the catchment moreover the atmospheric input and human activities will also have an impact according to turekian and kulp 1956 there is a positive correlation between sr and ca in granites this is also well reflected in ten small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains the correlation coefficient between sr and ca is 0 68 in 190 samples of a hydrological year the 1000sr ca value in the stream water is 1 08 5 2 with an average of 3 53 which is considerably higher than the carbonate rock 0 4 and lower than the value of the granite bedrock 7 8 in these catchments among the ten small watersheds the average sr ca of lyh9 is the lowest which is obviously affected by the upstream simple calcite processing factory we use the following mass balance equation to estimate the contribution of different sources to sr in stream water 2 sr i sr ca river i sr ca i α i ca ca river where i represents different reservoirs atmospheric input agricultural input silicate weathering and carbonate weathering sr ca i are from our measured values where the atmospheric input is the average of 23 rainwaters the agricultural input is the average of the six farmland water samples and the silicate and carbonate weathering are the average of the two granite bedrocks and two carbonate rock bedrocks respectively the α i ca is the mixing proportions of ca the sum of the α i is equal to 1 in the different reservoirs we have obtained this value by using the mass balance equations of the major ion in another companion paper sun et al minor revision submitted the calculated sr is mainly from silicate weathering which is 40 90 with an average of 75 for these small watersheds in the jiuhua mountains the low ph 3 81 5 81 mean 4 78 and high so4 2 content in rainwater indicates that even in the jiuhua mountains area the impact of acid rain cannot be ignored sun et al minor revision submitted the sr contents in rainwater are nearly one order of magnitude lower than those of stream water and the 87sr 86sr ratio is similar therefore according to the mass balance the impact of rainwater input on sr in stream water should be relatively weak the sr contents of farmland water are close to those of stream water but the 87sr 86sr ratios are lower therefore the effect of agricultural activities on 87sr 86sr ratios of stream water is related to the proportion of farmland in the catchment 5 3 spatial and temporal variations of sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio in stream water and their influencing factors according to the seasonal characteristics of sampling sites we divided the stream samples in a hydrological year from july 2014 to june 2015 into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february summer is a water rich period therefore the samples of autumn winter and spring are normalized to summer to discuss the temporal variations of sr content meanwhile water discharge the data are from the yearbook of hydrology the ministry of water resources of china of corresponding seasons are also normalized to summer fig 7 a this figure shows a strongly negative correlation between sr content variations and water discharge in different seasons if we make a scatter plot of the sr content versus discharge normalization coefficient spring autumn winter normalize to summer for each watershed the correlation coefficient is 0 59 1 with an average of 0 91 therefore the water discharge has the most important effect on the temporal variation of sr content in these small granitic watersheds among the ten samples qth1 has the highest altitude and the longest distance from the main road and is relatively least affected by human activities therefore the annual average sr content of every sample is normalized to qth1 to explore the spatial variation of sr fig 7b in addition in order to investigate the influence of small lithological differences on the sr content in the stream water we also normalized the cao and sio2 contents in the riverbed sediment of the other nine samples to qth1 in a companion paper sun et al minor revision submitted we found the characteristics of the major ions in lyh8 may be predominated by evaporite minerals mainly mirabilite and gypsum and thus sr variations of lyh8 will be discussed separately in fig 7b sr and cao exhibit very consistent spatial variation characteristics in contrast the spatial variation of sio2 is smaller but exhibits a change tendency opposite to sr and cao specifically sr cao and sio2 contents of qth3 qth4 and lyh7 are similar to qth1 but the other samples show relatively large variations since riverbed sediments represent the average composition of the rocks in the catchment we speculate that the slight lithological differences at different sampling sites which cannot be shown in 1 200 000 geological maps are an important reason for the sr content variation in the stream fig 2 shows that the source areas of qth1 qth3 qth4 and lyh7 are very close and qth5 qth6 and lyh10 originate from another mountain moreover qth2 and qth10 flow across village and farmland and qth5 and qth6 are located along the main road therefore the higher sr contents in these samples probably also reflects the impact of human activities and road dust although only a few hundred meters between lyh7 and lyh8 the sr content of lyh8 is 1 5 2 5 times that of lyh7 since lyh8 is an extremely small stream with a width of only approximately 1 m and a depth of less than 10 cm the water discharge and area are much smaller than lyh7 which is therefore more susceptible to agricultural activities and or scattered exposure of carbonates and evaporite minerals in the catchment moreover due to the low discharge during the water lean season the concentration effect is more pronounced and it is also more susceptible to the influence of the external environment s input there is a simple calcite powder processing plant 200 m upstream of lyh9 during the sampling period we found that the stream water was milky after heavy rain indicating that the upstream calcite processing plant transported a large amount of material into the stream and the impact is also more pronounced during dry periods compared with sr content the 87sr 86sr ratio in a hydrological year has a very small change and does not show any regularity fig 8 indicating that the water discharge has no significant effect on the sr isotopic composition spatially 87sr 86sr ratios of qth2 qth5 qth6 and lyh10 with higher sr contents are lower than other samples therefore the variations of sr isotopic composition also demonstrate that qth2 qth5 qth6 and lyh10 are mainly affected by bedrock weathering and or human activities with low radiogenic sr isotopic composition and high sr content as the sr content in the streams is dominated by water discharge and the 87sr 86sr ratio is not the same there is no correlation between the sr contents and the 87sr 86sr ratios of the 190 samples fig 9 however when the annual average sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio of each watershed are plotted there is a very strongly positive correlation between them r2 0 96 after we remove lyh8 and lyh9 which are affected by evaporite dissolution and industrial activities respectively this correlation reflects a binary mixing of two end members the end member with a high 87sr 86sr ratio and a low sr content represents k feldspar biotite weathering and another end member with a low 87sr 86sr ratio and a relatively high sr content may be anorthite albite feldspars trace carbonate evaporite minerals weathering and agricultural sewage inputs 5 4 effects of the late jurassic early cretaceous orogeny on the sr isotopic evolution of seawater continental weathering and hydrothermal activity are the two most important factors affecting the evolution of seawater sr isotope the weathered rock type and weathering intensity determine the 87sr 86sr ratio and sr flux into ocean which are directly related to the sr isotopic evolution of seawater the orogeny strongly enhances chemical weathering by increasing the physical erosion rate since ancient orogenic belts usually have a high 87sr 86sr ratio enhanced chemical weathering will cause high radiogenic sr to be transported into the ocean resulting in an increase in the sr isotopic composition of seawater for instance a large number of studies have shown that the steady rise in the seawater 87sr 86sr ratio since the cenozoic was mainly attributed to the uplift and weathering of the himalayas e g raymo et al 1988 edmond 1992 richter et al 1992 this inference is also supported by the evidence of li e g misra and froelich 2012 and os isotopes e g peucker ehrenbrink and ravizza 2012 in contrast the 87sr 86sr ratio of seawater in the late jurassic early cretaceous has also been significantly increased from 0 7068 the lowest value in the phanerozoic at 160 ma to 0 7075 at 128 ma but its relationship with the orogeny has not been very clear the δ18o and δ13c records of plant and carbonate fossils point to the rise of co2 content and temperature and increasing chemical weathering rates through the late jurassic interval e g retallack 2001 price and gröcke 2002 grossman 2012 saltzman and thomas 2012 veizer and prokoph 2015 price et al 2016 henkes et al 2018 moreover sediment and phosphorus fluxes transported to the ocean which are dependent on continental weathering rates show an increase during the latest jurassic to early cretaceous thiede and ehrmann 1986 föllmi 1995 weissert and mohr 1996 suggested that intensified late jurassic water cycling triggered by elevated levels of atmospheric co2 led to enhanced chemical weathering in a warm and humid environment gröcke et al 2003 used the sr c and o isotopic evidence to infer that the western cordillera mountain building event led to an increase in the 87sr 86sr values of seawater recent modeling of kristall et al 2017 showed that the rise of 87sr 86sr values from the late jurassic to early cretaceous may be interpreted as a result of increasing input from continental weathering with high radiogenic sr and a small contribution from granite weathering can have a significant impact yanshanian orogeny is a major event in the geologic history of china this event was the most important tectonism that occurred in the east asian continent during the jurassic and cretaceous periods this event broke the stable pattern of several hundred million years of the north china craton and formed a series of north east deep faults and triggered fierce magmatic activities e g wong 1927 huang 1959 dong et al 2015 at the same time europe is roughly equivalent to the period of rifting and expansion of the early alpine movement the large scale collisional orogeny has not yet begun the major mountains building event in the jurassic and early cretaceous in the americas was the development of the western cordillera rocky mountains archibald et al 1984 monger 1998 we compiled the 87sr 86sr ratios of more than 100 yanshanian granites in several main tectonic units in china table 4 the north china block the yangtze block and the cathaysia block all showed high radiogenic sr isotopic ratios average values of 0 762269 0 749669 and 0 752813 respectively in this study the measured 87sr 86sr ratios of granite bedrock weathering profile and sediment in the jiuhua mountains are basically between 0 711 and 0 736 in a full hydrological year the 87sr 86sr ratios of 190 samples of stream water are 0 709148 0 710427 with an average of 0 710021 which is slightly higher than the modern seawater value 0 70916 hodell et al 1990 but significantly higher than the seawater value 0 7068 at 160 ma in the late jurassic therefore we speculate that the yanshanian orogeny and the uplift of the western cordillera mountains that occurred in the east asia and north america during the late jurassic early cretaceous period promoted chemical weathering and allowed more radiogenic sr to enter the ocean resulting in the contemporaneous rise of the 87sr 86sr ratio in the seawater this mechanism is similar to the impact of the himalayan orogeny on the sr isotope evolution of seawater in the cenozoic 6 conclusions 1 in the granite weathering profile the 87sr 86sr ratios are higher than those of bedrock except for the two samples from the topsoil layer the main reason for this is the preferential leaching of anorthite feldspar and albite feldspar with a lower 87sr 86sr ratio during weathering the change of 87sr 86sr ratio is closely related to the changing trend of na ca k and rb with profile depth the 87sr 86sr ratios of the sediments are significantly higher than those of the corresponding values of stream water indicating that the sr isotope fractionation occurs during the weathering processes anorthite and albite easily weathered lower 87sr 86sr ratios preferentially dissolve into the solution while weathering resistant potassium feldspars high 87sr 86sr ratio are mostly retained in sediments 2 in a full hydrological year the 87sr 86sr ratio change of 190 samples of stream water is very small but the sr content shows a significant fluctuation 10 70 which is strongly negatively correlated with changes in water discharge therefore when discussing the effects of chemical weathering on the sr isotopic evolution of seawater only using the data from a single sampling will cause a deviation of the result 3 the average 87sr 86sr ratio of 190 samples of stream water in the jiuhua mountains is 0 710021 which is significantly higher than the lowest value 0 7068 160 ma of seawater in the phanerozoic the average 87sr 86sr ratio of the yanshanian granites in several main blocks in china is high up to 0 76 moreover the δ18o and δ13c records of plant and carbonate fossils from other researchers demonstrate the increased chemical weathering rates during the late jurassic early cretaceous therefore the yanshanian orogeny in east asia and cordillera orogeny in north america are considered to be an important cause of the 87sr 86sr ratio increase of seawater after 160 ma acknowledgments this work was

precipitation and evaporation 
6803,to determine the influence of the mesozoic yanshanian orogeny in east asia on contemporaneous sr isotopic evolution of seawater we systematically investigated the weathering profile riverbed sediment and stream water in mono lithological small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains anhui eastern china analysis based on 190 samples from 1 to 2 samplings per month during an entire hydrological year spanning july 2014 to june 2015 shows that the intra annual change of sr concentration is 10 70 but 87sr 86sr ratios only exhibit a slight change 0 709148 0 710427 this result indicates that using single sampling data to evaluate the influence of chemical weathering on the 87sr 86sr ratio evolution of seawater may cause some deviations the 87sr 86sr ratio in the small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains is 0 709148 0 710427 with an average of 0 710021 which is significantly higher than the lowest value 0 7068 160 ma of seawater in the phanerozoic during and after this period the east asian continent experienced a strong tectonic event yanshanian orogeny and formed widespread jurassic cretaceous igneous rocks such as the jiuhua mountains granite in the yangtze block the yanshanian granites in several main tectonic units in china exhibit high radiogenic sr characteristics combined with the evidence of enhanced chemical weathering during late jurassic early cretaceous the notable increase of the seawater 87sr 86sr ratio after 160 ma may be related to the yanshanian orogeny in east asia keywords jiuhua mountains small granitic watersheds chemical weathering sr isotopic characteristics seawater sr isotope evolution 1 introduction the evolution of strontium sr isotopes in seawater through geological time is primarily dominated by the changing balance between two sources 1 relatively radiogenic sr 0 7119 derived from continental weathering and 2 relatively nonradiogenic sr 0 7037 from hydrothermal exchange in the mid ocean ridge and hydrothermal alteration of submarine basalt fig 1 e g richter et al 1992 the dissolved sr flux from continental rivers is significantly higher than that of hydrothermal fluids and it is the most important reason for the sr isotopic evolution of seawater the 87sr 86sr ratio changes in continental and marine sedimentary records are related to changes in the chemical weathering rates caused by tectonism such as supercontinent assembly and break up and the formation of large basalt provinces e g burke et al 1982 richter et al 1992 blum 1997 taylor and lasaga 1999 veizer et al 1999 dessert et al 2001 das et al 2006 allègre et al 2010 krabbenhöft et al 2010 peucker ehrenbrink et al 2010 beck et al 2013 kani et al 2013 ullmann et al 2013 sedlacek et al 2014 satkoski et al 2016 korte and ullmann 2018 studies have shown that the sr isotopic composition of seawater has significantly increased and decreased since the phanerozoic e g burke et al 1982 depaolo and ingram 1985 palmer and elderfield 1985 elderfield 1986 veizer et al 1999 mcarthur et al 2001 2012 the cambrian approximately 500 ma 87sr 86sr ratio is very close to today 0 7091 which is the highest in the entire phanerozoic and is usually considered to be the result of enhanced weathering caused by pan african and himalayan orogeny respectively at approximately 160 ma in the mesozoic the 87sr 86sr ratio in seawater was the lowest in the entire phanerozoic approximately 0 7068 this value is usually attributed to the increased seafloor hydrothermal and volcanic activity caused by the break up of the gondwana continent and the formation of a new atlantic tethys ocean basin with less impact due to continental weathering rates jones et al 1994a b jones 2001 mcarthur et al 2001 wierzbowski et al 2013 2017 then the sr isotope ratio gradually increased before decreasing again at approximately 128 ma this increase and decrease are thought to be related to the early uplift and erosion of the cordillera mountains in north america gröcke et al 2003 and the eruption of the rajamahal flood basalts and or increased hydrothermal activity jones 2001 respectively river input is one of the most important sources of seawater sr evolution previous studies have mostly calculated annual sr fluxes of a river based on data from one sampling time considering the effects of dilution and evaporation use of data from a single sampling may lead to deviation to accurately assess the impact of continental weathering on seawater sr evolution therefore a time series sampling 1 2 times per month was conducted in this study in addition we completed a systematic study on sr isotopic characteristics of bedrock weathering profile riverbed sediment and stream water in the typical subtropic granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains and we discussed the controlling factors of the 87sr 86sr ratio through intensive sampling of 1 2 times a month in a hydrological year for 10 small watersheds affected by different terrains and human activities we investigated the temporal and spatial changes of sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio and analyzed the contribution of silicate weathering to the sr isotopic evolution of seawater 2 studied area the jiuhua mountains are located in anhui province eastern china the elevation of the main peak is 1344 m the jiuhua mountains are in a subtropical monsoon zone with a mild climate and abundant rainfall the multiyear average temperature and precipitation snowfall in winter and rainfall throughout the year are 13 4 c and 2437 5 mm respectively qingyang county meteorological administration multiyear average 2003 2015 runoff of the qingtong river and lingyang river is 1021 mm and 1072 mm respectively both the sampling year and the multiyear average discharge data show that most of the discharge occurs during the wet period june august while the winter december february is the dry period the data are from hydrological yearbook of china ministry of water resources of china vegetation coverage is 30 60 including farmland 1027 ha 11 garden land 3 and forestland 86 respectively the data from jiuhua mountains management committee the jurassic cretaceous igneous rocks are widespread in the south china block and were traditionally considered to form on the yanshanian magmatic event the jiuhua mountains qingyang complex are situated in the ne yangzte block china which was crystallized 139 127 ma the complex includes a main body the qingyang granite consisting of granodiorite and monzogranite and a central body consisting mainly of alkali feldspar granite the jiuhua mountains granite the complex intruded into the late precambrian to early paleozoic sandstones shales and limestones the first stage intrusion was named the qingyang body which in turn was intruded by the second stage central granite named the jiuhua mountains body with an outcrop area over 100 km2 the jiuhua mountains alkali feldspar granites are enriched in sio2 na2o k2o and rb but depleted in al2o3 cao and sr xu et al 2009 3 sampling and analysis in a full hydrological year from july 2014 to june 2015 water samples in ten small granitic watersheds were collected 1 2 times month including six samples in the qingtong river catchment originates from the jiuhua mountains and flows northward into the yangtze river and four in the lingyang river stems from the jiuhua mountains and flows southward through the taiping lake qingyi river and finally into the yangtze river fig 2 table 1 stream water samples were collected at the river bank and stored in precleaned polyethylene bottles that were free of air during this period 23 rainwater samples were collected using a clean polyethylene wash basin near the sampling site qth2 and then stored in bottles of the six farmland water samples five were collected at the same location in the qingtong river watershed at different times and the remaining one was collected at another site riverbed sediments of ten small granitic watersheds were collected in june 2015 a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer wtw 340i was used to measure temperature ph conductivity and total dissolved solids in situ a roadside granite weathering profile was sampled along the river valley the profile has a height of 3 5 m and no bedrock exposed fig 3 this profile can be divided into the following layers from top to bottom a 80 cm gray brown dark soil rich in organic matter wp 0 to wp 2 and a 2 2 m red brown mud silt sand layer wp 3 to wp 7 with some gray mineral particles with the size tending to increase from top to bottom and finally a 50 cm yellow brown layer wp 8 to wp 9 a total of ten samples wp 0 to wp 9 from top to bottom were collected from this profile two samples of granite bedrock were collected in fresh rocks exposed near the weathering profile water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters an aliquot of the filtered water was acidified to a ph less than 2 with ultrapure grade 1 1 nitric acid sr was measured in filtered and acidified water with an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp oes 6300 in the key laboratory of surficial geochemistry ministry of education school of earth sciences and engineering nanjing university 87sr 86sr ratios were measured using mc icp ms neptune plus thermo fisher scientific in the same laboratory the strontium standard srm987 was periodically measured to check the precision and accuracy of isotopic analyses with a mean 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 710239 42 2σ external standard deviation n 15 solid rock samples were crushed and powdered with an agate mill river sediments and weathering profile samples were air dried and ground to 200 mesh then fully digested with a mixture of different acids in sealed teflon beakers for analysis of major elements trace elements and sr isotope major and trace element contents were measured by xrf arl 9900 and icp ms finnigan mat element ii in the state key laboratory for mineral deposits research school of earth sciences and engineering nanjing university 4 results in a full hydrological year measured sr contents of 190 stream water samples range from 0 179 to 1 47 μmol l 1 showing an important temporal fluctuation table 1 87sr 86sr ratios range from 0 709148 to 0 710427 with an average of 0 710021 there is small variation of sr isotopic composition in one year relative to sr content the sr contents of 23 rainwater samples in a hydrological year range from 0 02 to 0 281 μmol l 1 and the 87sr 86sr ratios range between 0 709155 and 0 710936 table 1 sr contents of six farmland water samples range from 0 137 to 1 21 μmol l 1 being approximately one order of magnitude higher than rainwater the 87sr 86sr ratios are relatively homogeneous 0 709310 0 709861 87sr 86sr ratios of two granite and two carbonate bedrocks are 0 712826 0 712933 and 0 709066 0 709387 and 1000sr ca is 7 8 and 0 4 respectively table 2 the sr contents of riverbed sediment samples are from 96 to 312 μg g 1 and the 87sr 86sr ratios are 0 711763 0 716874 average 0 713987 1000sr ca values are high reaching 18 28 being far higher than the bedrock s which shows a large loss of ca in sediment during weathering and transportation in the granite weathering profile sr contents are 38 9 172 μg g 1 and show a decreasing trend from top to bottom table 3 the 87sr 86sr ratios range from 0 711540 to 0 735887 5 discussion 5 1 fractionation of sr isotope associated with chemical weathering to investigate the fractionation behavior of sr isotopes associated with chemical weathering we conducted a comprehensive study of weathering profile sediments and water bodies as a watershed system in the ten small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains the absolute content of elements is easily affected by the leaching of mobile elements and thus cannot truly reflect the geochemical characteristics of elements in the processes of weathering and soil formation therefore an immobile element such as ti zr and nb is usually used as a reference to calculate elemental losses and gains in the weathering profiles relative to bedrock nesbitt 1979 brimhall et al 1992 anderson et al 2002 brantley and lebedeva 2011 1 change c j c i w c j c i p 1 100 where cj and ci are the concentrations in weight percent of mobile element j and immobile element i and the subscripts w and p refer to weathered material and parent rock respectively in the topsoil layer above 50 cm na depletion is 90 and ca and k are 80 in the layer from 50 cm to 2 5 m na depletion is close to 100 and ca and k are 90 and 85 respectively in the layer from 2 5 m to 3 m the depletion level of the three elements drops to 75 80 60 70 and 10 20 respectively the decline of na ca and k loss levels in the topsoil may be attributed to two reasons on one hand the release of organic acids from the plant s roots and microorganisms to the soil fixes some major elements on the other hand input from surface runoff may also influence the major element contents in the topsoil there are very similar change trends between sr and cao rb and k2o with profile depth fig 4 a b reflecting the isomorphism relationship of the two pairs of elements in ca containing and k containing minerals the change trends of sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios with profile depth are opposite and there is a good positive correlation between 1 sr and 87sr 86sr ratios r2 0 67 figs 4c 5 which may indicate the mixing of influence from two end members we speculate that the end member with high 87sr 86sr ratio and low sr content is attributed to the k rich minerals weathering such as weathering resistant potassium feldspars and another end member with low 87sr 86sr ratio and high sr content may be anorthite albite feldspar weathering and input from surface runoff when compared with the granite bedrocks the weathering profile has higher 87sr 86sr ratios with the exception of the two samples in the topsoil the main reason is the preferential leaching of anorthite albite feldspar with lower 87sr 86sr ratio during weathering the topsoil above 50 cm has lowest 87sr 86sr ratio in the profile which may reflect the influence of input from surface runoff with low sr isotopic compositions small changes of the 87sr 86sr ratio in the 50 cm 2 5 m layer can be attributed to the same slight change of loss level of ca na and k a significant rise of the 87sr 86sr ratio highest in the profile in the 2 5 m 3 0 m layer is highly consistent with the increase of k and rb contents which shows that with the large loss of na and ca the proportion of k containing minerals increases resulting in a rapid increase in the sr isotopic composition in the ten sediment samples the 87sr 86sr values of six samples were higher than those of the granite bedrock in the catchment while the values of the other four samples were lower than the bedrock this finding may reflect changes in the proportion of minerals such as anorthite albite calcite with lower 87sr 86sr values and potassium feldspar biotite with high 87sr 86sr values in the sediments the 87sr 86sr ratios of the sediments are all higher than the corresponding values in stream water indicating that sr isotope has been fractionated during the weathering process the dissolved load in water is primarily derived from an easily soluble component such as albite anorthite and calcite lower 87sr 86sr value and weathering resistant potassium feldspar higher 87sr 86sr value is more preferentially retained in sediments there is no obvious correlation between 87sr 86sr ratios of sediments and water fig 6 the possible reason for this lack of correlation is that the tiny streams are more susceptible to the inputs from trace carbonate evaporite minerals and human activity 5 2 source of sr in stream water the dissolved load content in river water is mainly controlled by rock weathering in the catchment moreover the atmospheric input and human activities will also have an impact according to turekian and kulp 1956 there is a positive correlation between sr and ca in granites this is also well reflected in ten small granitic watersheds of the jiuhua mountains the correlation coefficient between sr and ca is 0 68 in 190 samples of a hydrological year the 1000sr ca value in the stream water is 1 08 5 2 with an average of 3 53 which is considerably higher than the carbonate rock 0 4 and lower than the value of the granite bedrock 7 8 in these catchments among the ten small watersheds the average sr ca of lyh9 is the lowest which is obviously affected by the upstream simple calcite processing factory we use the following mass balance equation to estimate the contribution of different sources to sr in stream water 2 sr i sr ca river i sr ca i α i ca ca river where i represents different reservoirs atmospheric input agricultural input silicate weathering and carbonate weathering sr ca i are from our measured values where the atmospheric input is the average of 23 rainwaters the agricultural input is the average of the six farmland water samples and the silicate and carbonate weathering are the average of the two granite bedrocks and two carbonate rock bedrocks respectively the α i ca is the mixing proportions of ca the sum of the α i is equal to 1 in the different reservoirs we have obtained this value by using the mass balance equations of the major ion in another companion paper sun et al minor revision submitted the calculated sr is mainly from silicate weathering which is 40 90 with an average of 75 for these small watersheds in the jiuhua mountains the low ph 3 81 5 81 mean 4 78 and high so4 2 content in rainwater indicates that even in the jiuhua mountains area the impact of acid rain cannot be ignored sun et al minor revision submitted the sr contents in rainwater are nearly one order of magnitude lower than those of stream water and the 87sr 86sr ratio is similar therefore according to the mass balance the impact of rainwater input on sr in stream water should be relatively weak the sr contents of farmland water are close to those of stream water but the 87sr 86sr ratios are lower therefore the effect of agricultural activities on 87sr 86sr ratios of stream water is related to the proportion of farmland in the catchment 5 3 spatial and temporal variations of sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio in stream water and their influencing factors according to the seasonal characteristics of sampling sites we divided the stream samples in a hydrological year from july 2014 to june 2015 into four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february summer is a water rich period therefore the samples of autumn winter and spring are normalized to summer to discuss the temporal variations of sr content meanwhile water discharge the data are from the yearbook of hydrology the ministry of water resources of china of corresponding seasons are also normalized to summer fig 7 a this figure shows a strongly negative correlation between sr content variations and water discharge in different seasons if we make a scatter plot of the sr content versus discharge normalization coefficient spring autumn winter normalize to summer for each watershed the correlation coefficient is 0 59 1 with an average of 0 91 therefore the water discharge has the most important effect on the temporal variation of sr content in these small granitic watersheds among the ten samples qth1 has the highest altitude and the longest distance from the main road and is relatively least affected by human activities therefore the annual average sr content of every sample is normalized to qth1 to explore the spatial variation of sr fig 7b in addition in order to investigate the influence of small lithological differences on the sr content in the stream water we also normalized the cao and sio2 contents in the riverbed sediment of the other nine samples to qth1 in a companion paper sun et al minor revision submitted we found the characteristics of the major ions in lyh8 may be predominated by evaporite minerals mainly mirabilite and gypsum and thus sr variations of lyh8 will be discussed separately in fig 7b sr and cao exhibit very consistent spatial variation characteristics in contrast the spatial variation of sio2 is smaller but exhibits a change tendency opposite to sr and cao specifically sr cao and sio2 contents of qth3 qth4 and lyh7 are similar to qth1 but the other samples show relatively large variations since riverbed sediments represent the average composition of the rocks in the catchment we speculate that the slight lithological differences at different sampling sites which cannot be shown in 1 200 000 geological maps are an important reason for the sr content variation in the stream fig 2 shows that the source areas of qth1 qth3 qth4 and lyh7 are very close and qth5 qth6 and lyh10 originate from another mountain moreover qth2 and qth10 flow across village and farmland and qth5 and qth6 are located along the main road therefore the higher sr contents in these samples probably also reflects the impact of human activities and road dust although only a few hundred meters between lyh7 and lyh8 the sr content of lyh8 is 1 5 2 5 times that of lyh7 since lyh8 is an extremely small stream with a width of only approximately 1 m and a depth of less than 10 cm the water discharge and area are much smaller than lyh7 which is therefore more susceptible to agricultural activities and or scattered exposure of carbonates and evaporite minerals in the catchment moreover due to the low discharge during the water lean season the concentration effect is more pronounced and it is also more susceptible to the influence of the external environment s input there is a simple calcite powder processing plant 200 m upstream of lyh9 during the sampling period we found that the stream water was milky after heavy rain indicating that the upstream calcite processing plant transported a large amount of material into the stream and the impact is also more pronounced during dry periods compared with sr content the 87sr 86sr ratio in a hydrological year has a very small change and does not show any regularity fig 8 indicating that the water discharge has no significant effect on the sr isotopic composition spatially 87sr 86sr ratios of qth2 qth5 qth6 and lyh10 with higher sr contents are lower than other samples therefore the variations of sr isotopic composition also demonstrate that qth2 qth5 qth6 and lyh10 are mainly affected by bedrock weathering and or human activities with low radiogenic sr isotopic composition and high sr content as the sr content in the streams is dominated by water discharge and the 87sr 86sr ratio is not the same there is no correlation between the sr contents and the 87sr 86sr ratios of the 190 samples fig 9 however when the annual average sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio of each watershed are plotted there is a very strongly positive correlation between them r2 0 96 after we remove lyh8 and lyh9 which are affected by evaporite dissolution and industrial activities respectively this correlation reflects a binary mixing of two end members the end member with a high 87sr 86sr ratio and a low sr content represents k feldspar biotite weathering and another end member with a low 87sr 86sr ratio and a relatively high sr content may be anorthite albite feldspars trace carbonate evaporite minerals weathering and agricultural sewage inputs 5 4 effects of the late jurassic early cretaceous orogeny on the sr isotopic evolution of seawater continental weathering and hydrothermal activity are the two most important factors affecting the evolution of seawater sr isotope the weathered rock type and weathering intensity determine the 87sr 86sr ratio and sr flux into ocean which are directly related to the sr isotopic evolution of seawater the orogeny strongly enhances chemical weathering by increasing the physical erosion rate since ancient orogenic belts usually have a high 87sr 86sr ratio enhanced chemical weathering will cause high radiogenic sr to be transported into the ocean resulting in an increase in the sr isotopic composition of seawater for instance a large number of studies have shown that the steady rise in the seawater 87sr 86sr ratio since the cenozoic was mainly attributed to the uplift and weathering of the himalayas e g raymo et al 1988 edmond 1992 richter et al 1992 this inference is also supported by the evidence of li e g misra and froelich 2012 and os isotopes e g peucker ehrenbrink and ravizza 2012 in contrast the 87sr 86sr ratio of seawater in the late jurassic early cretaceous has also been significantly increased from 0 7068 the lowest value in the phanerozoic at 160 ma to 0 7075 at 128 ma but its relationship with the orogeny has not been very clear the δ18o and δ13c records of plant and carbonate fossils point to the rise of co2 content and temperature and increasing chemical weathering rates through the late jurassic interval e g retallack 2001 price and gröcke 2002 grossman 2012 saltzman and thomas 2012 veizer and prokoph 2015 price et al 2016 henkes et al 2018 moreover sediment and phosphorus fluxes transported to the ocean which are dependent on continental weathering rates show an increase during the latest jurassic to early cretaceous thiede and ehrmann 1986 föllmi 1995 weissert and mohr 1996 suggested that intensified late jurassic water cycling triggered by elevated levels of atmospheric co2 led to enhanced chemical weathering in a warm and humid environment gröcke et al 2003 used the sr c and o isotopic evidence to infer that the western cordillera mountain building event led to an increase in the 87sr 86sr values of seawater recent modeling of kristall et al 2017 showed that the rise of 87sr 86sr values from the late jurassic to early cretaceous may be interpreted as a result of increasing input from continental weathering with high radiogenic sr and a small contribution from granite weathering can have a significant impact yanshanian orogeny is a major event in the geologic history of china this event was the most important tectonism that occurred in the east asian continent during the jurassic and cretaceous periods this event broke the stable pattern of several hundred million years of the north china craton and formed a series of north east deep faults and triggered fierce magmatic activities e g wong 1927 huang 1959 dong et al 2015 at the same time europe is roughly equivalent to the period of rifting and expansion of the early alpine movement the large scale collisional orogeny has not yet begun the major mountains building event in the jurassic and early cretaceous in the americas was the development of the western cordillera rocky mountains archibald et al 1984 monger 1998 we compiled the 87sr 86sr ratios of more than 100 yanshanian granites in several main tectonic units in china table 4 the north china block the yangtze block and the cathaysia block all showed high radiogenic sr isotopic ratios average values of 0 762269 0 749669 and 0 752813 respectively in this study the measured 87sr 86sr ratios of granite bedrock weathering profile and sediment in the jiuhua mountains are basically between 0 711 and 0 736 in a full hydrological year the 87sr 86sr ratios of 190 samples of stream water are 0 709148 0 710427 with an average of 0 710021 which is slightly higher than the modern seawater value 0 70916 hodell et al 1990 but significantly higher than the seawater value 0 7068 at 160 ma in the late jurassic therefore we speculate that the yanshanian orogeny and the uplift of the western cordillera mountains that occurred in the east asia and north america during the late jurassic early cretaceous period promoted chemical weathering and allowed more radiogenic sr to enter the ocean resulting in the contemporaneous rise of the 87sr 86sr ratio in the seawater this mechanism is similar to the impact of the himalayan orogeny on the sr isotope evolution of seawater in the cenozoic 6 conclusions 1 in the granite weathering profile the 87sr 86sr ratios are higher than those of bedrock except for the two samples from the topsoil layer the main reason for this is the preferential leaching of anorthite feldspar and albite feldspar with a lower 87sr 86sr ratio during weathering the change of 87sr 86sr ratio is closely related to the changing trend of na ca k and rb with profile depth the 87sr 86sr ratios of the sediments are significantly higher than those of the corresponding values of stream water indicating that the sr isotope fractionation occurs during the weathering processes anorthite and albite easily weathered lower 87sr 86sr ratios preferentially dissolve into the solution while weathering resistant potassium feldspars high 87sr 86sr ratio are mostly retained in sediments 2 in a full hydrological year the 87sr 86sr ratio change of 190 samples of stream water is very small but the sr content shows a significant fluctuation 10 70 which is strongly negatively correlated with changes in water discharge therefore when discussing the effects of chemical weathering on the sr isotopic evolution of seawater only using the data from a single sampling will cause a deviation of the result 3 the average 87sr 86sr ratio of 190 samples of stream water in the jiuhua mountains is 0 710021 which is significantly higher than the lowest value 0 7068 160 ma of seawater in the phanerozoic the average 87sr 86sr ratio of the yanshanian granites in several main blocks in china is high up to 0 76 moreover the δ18o and δ13c records of plant and carbonate fossils from other researchers demonstrate the increased chemical weathering rates during the late jurassic early cretaceous therefore the yanshanian orogeny in east asia and cordillera orogeny in north america are considered to be an important cause of the 87sr 86sr ratio increase of seawater after 160 ma acknowledgments this work was

6804,mountainous regions are important sources of freshwater measurement of actual evapotranspiration et is difficult to obtain in high mountain regions because of the harsh natural environment and potential et pet is therefore a suitable term to describe the atmospheric water demand of land surfaces under given meteorological conditions in those high elevation areas in situ measured meteorological data were collected in 2015 and 2016 from five meteorological stations at various elevations from 2980 m to 4484 m in the qilian mountains northwestern china and the meteorological factors changed markedly with elevation pet calculated with the penman method showed a significant elevational gradient and decreased as the elevation increased the sensitivity analysis indicated that over the whole period pet in the research region was most sensitive to net radiation rn followed by relative humidity rh air temperature t wind speed ws and soil heat flux g when rn was positive the sensitivity of pet to rn decreased as the elevation increased and when rn was negative the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased when t was above 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t decreased as the elevation increased and when t was below 0 c the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to both rh and ws the topographic shading in mountainous regions affected meteorological factors pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors in those high elevation areas the rn was relatively small at the sites with topographic shading because of the reduction in solar radiation and resulted in less sensitivity of pet to rn and greater sensitivity of pet to other meteorological factors this study can help us to understand pet in the qilian mountains and in other mountain regions from which meteorological data are difficult to obtain and very sensitive to climate change keywords potential evapotranspiration penman method sensitivity analysis high elevation mountainous regions 1 introduction mountain catchments are key sources for river water and water supplies dettinger 2014 7 of the global mountain area plays an essential role in water resources whilst another 37 provides important supportive supply especially in arid and semiarid regions that are vulnerable to seasonal and regional water shortages viviroli et al 2007 2011 as climates change sensitive high mountain cold regions can act as reliable indicators of the responses to global warming beniston and stoffel 2014 mountain research initiative edw working group 2015 rogora et al 2018 mountain catchments have shown warnings of change in land surface hydrology milano et al 2015 and the hydrological balance and possible future changes in mountainous regions remain poorly understood ragettlia et al 2016 evapotranspiration et along with precipitation and runoff is a major component of the water cycle at or near land surfaces in large regions senay et al 2011 yin et al 2013 and is thus considered to be the most appropriate indicator of the activity of climate change and water cycle wang et al 2013 because et shows great variability over time and space it is perhaps the most difficult and complicated component in the hydrological cycle li et al 2014 the complex terrain in mountainous regions and the scarcity of measurement data because of the harsh natural environmental conditions exacerbate the lack of understanding of et in mountainous regions the actual et is the best parameter for characterising the hydrological cycle but measurement of the actual et in high mountain regions presents many challenges and difficulties yang et al 2017a the biggest challenge is that the low temperatures in these cold high mountain regions test the endurance of field workers and their instruments woo 2008 since the actual et is difficult to measure directly as an alternative it can be calculated using mathematical models usually relying on reference et or potential et pet allen 2006 almorox et al 2015 the reference et is taken from a reference surface which is a hypothetical grass reference crop with specific characteristics allen et al 1998 pet refers to the maximum moisture loss from the surface as determined by the meteorological conditions and the surface type assuming an unlimited moisture supply lhomme 1997 pet provides the upper limit of land surface et while the estimation of actual et in hydrological models is generally based on pet and crop coefficient allen 2006 douglas et al 2009 becomes the common and important input for hydrological models li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 as the indicator of evaporative power of atmosphere pet determines the maximum possible water consumption from the land surface wang et al 2017 therefore become the most suitable term to describe the atmospheric water demand of land surfaces under given meteorological conditions zheng et al 2017 pet is an integrated measure of four key meteorological variables including radiation wind speed temperature and vapor pressure donohue et al 2010 sun et al 2016 and the dominant factors that affect pet show regional differences in the yangtze river basin in china the decline in pet during the past several decades was attributed to a decrease solar radiation wang et al 2007 whilst wind speed was the dominant factor in the canadian prairies burn and hesch 2007 and australia roderick et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2012 furthermore water vapor and temperature were found to be the dominant factors in a few regions e g tabari et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 most studies of pet were based on measurements from national meteorological stations and discussed pet trends in time series and their sensitivity to meteorological parameters e g zuo et al 2012 li et al 2015 2017 peng et al 2017 robinson et al 2017 national meteorological stations are generally located far from each other and the interpolated gridded datasets from those stations across various climate zones may not provide spatially explicit pet data at high mountainous regions the complex terrain in high mountain regions may affect the distribution of meteorological elements and thereby affect the spatial distribution of pet climatic conditions change markedly with elevation and pet depends greatly upon elevation van den bergh et al 2013 pet is affected by variations in meteorological factors but the relationships among these factors and elevation remain unclear wang et al 2016 therefore the calculation of pet from datasets based on in situ measurement in a small catchment with the same climatic zone may improve our understanding of et and its elevational gradient in mountainous regions the qilian mountains located at the northeastern edge of the tibetan plateau are the runoff formation zone and the source of all rivers in the arid hexi corridor region feng 2010 dong et al 2015 which was the main path of the ancient silk road and the most important communication route between western and eastern eurasia zhou et al 2016 therefore research into pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors is of vital significance to understand the water cycle in the qilian mountains and water resource management in the oasis belt at the piedmont plain in the hexi corridor the objectives of this study are 1 to calculate pet at five elevation sites 2 to assess the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors and 3 to estimate the elevational gradients of sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors in the qilian mountains 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the hulu catchment located in the qilian mountains northwestern china ranges from 99 49 e to 99 54 e longitude and from 38 12 n to 38 17 n latitude with an altitude range from 2960 m to 4800 m and a drainage area of 23 1 km2 fig 1 a cryosphere hydrology observation system was established in this small alpine catchment in 2008 chen et al 2014 in 2008 four automatic meteorological stations were positioned at various elevations the underlying surfaces were covered by grassland 99 52 9 e 38 16 1 n 2980 m shrub meadow 99 52 6 e 38 14 9 n 3232 m swamp meadow 99 53 4 e 38 13 9 n 3711 m and moraine 99 53 4 e 38 13 3 n 4164 m fig 1 meteorological factors were measured at each station included four component radiation downward and upward shortwave radiation downward and upward longwave radiation air temperature t relative humidity rh wind speed ws and direction multiple layers of soil moisture and temperature land surface temperature soil heat flux g precipitation snow depth in june 2014 an automatic meteorological station was installed near the shiyi glacier in the hulu catchment fig 1 and the underlying surface was covered by moraine 99 52 6 e 38 13 1 n 4484 m unlike the first four automatic meteorological stations this station near the shiyi glacier did not gather complete meteorological data only four component radiation t rh ws wind direction and precipitation the net radiation rn is the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation of both short and long wavelengths and rn is calculated as followed 1 r n r s r l r s r l where r s r l r s and r l is downward shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 downward longwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 upward shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 and upward longwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 respectively the positive of rn means downward radiation and the negative means upward radiation the positive of g means upward radiation and the negative means downward radiation the meteorological data in this study were gathered from those five meteorological stations which in this study are named sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 in this study fig 1 and table 1 to compare meteorological factors and pet over the same period 2 years 2015 and 2016 were selected as the research period 2 2 methods 2 2 1 penman method a multitude of methods are used to calculate pet xu and singh 2002 li et al 2016 and the penman method performs reasonably across the range of conditions tested e g donohue et al 2010 milly and dunne 2016 zheng et al 2017 the land cover and plant types were different at five research site in order to reduce the influences from land surface conditions the penman method based on the assumption of water surface was chosen to compare the pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors at different research sites the penman method for calculating pet can be expressed as 2 pet δ r n g 6 43 γ 1 0 536 u 2 e s e a δ γ λ where pet is the potential et mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure at daily mean air temperature ta kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and λ is the latent heat of evaporation mj kg 1 3 λ

kg 1 c 1 ε is the ratio of the molecular weight of water vapor to that for dry air 0 622 and p is atmospheric pressure 5 p 101 3 293 0 0065 z 293 5 26 where z is the elevation above sea level m 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity coefficient in this study indicates the sensitivity of pet to the meteorological variable and it is favored to quantify the determining factors in pet to be dimensionless the relative sensitivity coefficient s is calculated by the partial derivative mccuen 1974 6 s v i lim v i 0 δ p e t p e t δ v i v i p e t v i v i pet where svi is the sensitivity coefficient of meteorological factor vi δpet is the variation in pet vi is the meteorological factor and δvi is the variation of the meteorological factor a positive negative svi indicates that the pet will increase decrease as the meteorological factor increases the greater the svi the greater the effects of the meteorological factor on pet the analytical expressions can be found in the supplementary material the sensitivity coefficient has been widely used in et studies e g yin et al 2010 liu et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 li et al 2015 paparrizos et al 2016 li et al 2017 in this study rn g t rh and ws were chosen to analyse the sensitivity of meteorological factors to pet and their sensitivity coefficients were labelled srn sg st srh and su respectively the daily variations in the meteorological factors in mountainous areas are greatly influenced by local terrain clouds and fog and it is difficult to establish a daily scale elevational gradient in this study the meteorological factors and their sensitivity coefficients on pet were analysed on monthly scales by using monthly meteorological quantities and the seasonal and yearly sensitivity coefficients were obtained by averaging monthly values 2 2 3 soil heat flux for sn4484 site the data for g were measured at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 and sn4164 sites but not at the sn4484 site allen et al 1998 recommended two simple ways to calculate g for monthly period 7 g m i 0 07 t m i 1 t m i 1 8 g m i 0 14 t m i t m i 1 where gm i is the soil heat flux density of month i mj m 2 day 1 tm i tm i 1 and tm i 1 are the mean air temperatures of month i the previous month and the next month c in consideration of the form of eqs 7 8 the following regression formula was built 9 g m i a r ms i b r ns i c t m i 1 t m i 1 d t m i t m i 1 where rms i and rns i is the solar radiation and the rn of month i mj m 2 day 1 respectively a b c and d are taken from regression analysis with data from the sn4164 site with a similar underlying surface as the sn4484 site and with values of 0 0493 0 1485 0 0431 and 0 0375 respectively fig 2 showed that the comparison of calculation by eqs 7 9 and the measured g at the sn4164 site and their relationship showed that eq 9 could more effectively calculate g than eq 7 or 8 at the sn4164 site sn4484 site has an underlying land cover similar to that of the sn4164 site so it is reasonable to calculate g with eq 9 at the sn4484 site 3 results 3 1 elevational gradients of meteorological factors 3 1 1 net radiation the mean annual rn measurements at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 7 85 mj m 2 day 1 6 74 mj m 2 day 1 4 34 mj m 2 day 1 4 36 mj m 2 day 1 and 4 63 mj m 2 day 1 respectively the rn showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites fig 3 a at the beginning of the year the rn was low and then it increased until reaching its maximum in july in autumn the rn began to decrease because the decrease of solar radiation and the increase of albedo from snow cover caused the decrease of net shortwave radiation the rn reached its minimum in december and began to increase the next year entering another cycle topographic shading from surrounding terrain was seen at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites in the cold season which could not be ignored and the topographic shading at those two sites lasted from october to next march thus the research period in this study was divided into a warm season april may june july august and september and a cold season january february march october november and december according to the measured data from the five automatic meteorological stations the rn showed a significant linear elevational gradient relationship during the warm season and the mean rn decreased about 0 242 mj m 2 day 1 for each 100 m of 100 m fig 3b correlation coefficient r2 0 97 the annual elevational gradient of the rn over the whole research period 2 years was about 0 224 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 r2 0 75 but it was not as significant as that during the warm season because the measured rn in the cold season from five stations showed a weak elevational gradient r2 0 41 the mean monthly rn measurements in the cold season at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites were significantly lower than those from the other three researcher sites fig 3b because of topographic shading in the cold season thus the elevational gradient for the rn in the cold season or over the whole period was more reasonable when the results were calculated from the three meteorological stations that did not have topographic shading under this circumstance the rn elevational gradient was about 0 200 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 for the whole period and 0 147 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 for the cold season 3 1 2 soil heat flux the mean annual g at sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 0 09 mj m 2 day 1 0 25 mj m 2 day 1 0 03 mj m 2 day 1 0 10 mj m 2 day 1 and 0 13 mj m 2 day 1 respectively g showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites fig 4 a at the beginning of the year the g was negative upward heat conduction towards relatively cold air it then increased and became positive in march and reached its maximum in summer g decreased in autumn became negative in september reached its minimum in december and began to increase the next year entering another cycle g is relatively low and may be ignored for day time steps and it is related to rn its mineral composition and its water content allen et al 1998 the elevational gradient of g during the warm season in the hulu catchment was 0 0188 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 r2 0 93 fig 4b however no significant linear elevational gradients were seen for the cold season or for the whole period fig 4b 3 1 3 air temperature the mean t at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 was 1 05 c 0 78 c 1 50 c 3 76 c and 6 19 c respectively t showed significant seasonal variations at all five research sites the maximum t usually occurred in july or august whilst the minimum generally occurred in january fig 5 a it is well known that the elevational gradient of t varies from about 0 98 c 100 m 1 for dry air to about 0 40 c 100 m 1 for very warm saturated air and that the mean lapse rate is 0 65 c 100 m 1 dodson and marks 1997 according to the data measured from the five automatic meteorological stations mean t showed a significant linear elevational gradient relationship in the warm season the cold season and during the whole period with elevational gradients in the research region was 0 54 c 100 m 1 r2 0 97 0 34 c 100 m 1 r2 0 92 and 0 44 c 100 m 1 r2 0 95 respectively fig 5b 3 1 4 relative humidity the mean rh at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 56 00 53 34 55 31 52 84 and 55 57 respectively like rn g and t rh showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites it was low in the cold season and high in the warm season the maximums occurred in june or september 2015 and august 2016 whilst the minimums occurred in december 2015 and february 2016 fig 6 a in the warm season rh had a weak positive linear relationship with elevation r2 0 57 and the rate of increase with elevation was 0 32 100 m 1 the rh showed the opposite elevational gradient in the cold season and the rate of decrease was 0 38 100 m 1 r2 0 81 on a yearly scale the correlation between rh and elevation had no obvious linear elevational gradient in the research catchment r2 0 02 fig 6b 3 1 5 wind speed the mean ws at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 1 87 m s 1 2 18 m s 1 2 39 m s 1 2 82 m s 1 and 2 92 m s 1 respectively unlike rn g t and rh the ws showed no apparent seasonal variation at the five research sites ws in the cold season were slightly higher than those in the warm season at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 and sn4484 but not at the sn4164 site fig 7 a the reason for this difference might be the presence of higher surrounding terrain around the sn4164 site which might have caused a unique wind field and local circulation the ws elevational gradients in the warm season in the cold season and during the whole research period were 0 056 m s 1 100 m 1 r2 0 90 0 083 m s 1 100 m 1 r2 0 86 and 0 069 m s 1 100 m 1 r2 0 98 respectively fig 7b 3 2 elevational gradient of pet according to the measured meteorological data from the five stations the mean monthly pet values at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 74 90 mm month 1 68 88 mm month 1 53 67 mm month 1 52 72 mm month 1 and 47 27 mm month 1 respectively a slight difference was seen between 2015 and 2016 the total pet values at the five sites were 875 22 mm 810 19 mm 620 59 mm 625 59 mm and 539 42 mm respectively in 2015 and 922 39 mm 842 97 mm 667 57 mm 639 58 mm and 595 16 mm respectively in 2016 significant seasonal variation in pet i e low in the cold season and high in the warm season was seen at all five research sites at the beginning of the year the pet value was small and it then increased until it reached the maximum in july before decreasing in the autumn and reach its minimum in december or january fig 8 the relationship between pet and elevation showed that pet decreased as elevation increased fig 9 analysis of the measured meteorological data showed that the topographic shading in mountainous region would influence the meteorological factors especially the rn in this study the influences of topographic shading could not be ignored at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites in the cold season under these circumstances all five sites were chosen for calculation of the pet elevational gradient for the warm season fig 9a and only three sites sn2980 sn3232 and sn4484 were chosen for the calculation for the cold season and for the whole period fig 9b thus the pet elevational gradients for the warm season the cold season and the whole period were 2 61 mm month 1 100 m 1 r2 0 98 0 88 mm month 1 100 m 1 r2 0 99 and 1 80 mm month 1 100 m 1 r2 0 99 respectively fig 9 3 3 sensitivity analysis of pet to meteorological factors 3 3 1 sn2980 the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to the pet at the sn2980 site fig 10 a positive srn and su values for the whole research period indicated that the greater the rn and ws the greater the pet a negative of srh value for the whole research period meant that the greater the rh the smaller the pet the sg value was positive for most of the cold season and negative for most of the warm season the g was usually positive in the warm season and downward heat conduction towards relatively cold soil conversely in the cold season the greater the g value in the positive the smaller the pet and the greater the absolute value of g in the negative the smaller the pet the opposite phenomenon was shown by the st which was positive for most of the warm season and negative for most of the cold season when t was above 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t decreased as elevation increased when t was below 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t increased as elevation increased on a yearly scale the st was negative at the sn2980 site the mean of the absolute values for srn sg st srh and su showed that pet at the sn2980 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh t ws and g during the whole period and in the warm season the most sensitive meteorological factors in the cold season were rh and rn followed by t ws and g table 2 3 3 2 sn3232 like the sn2980 site the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to pet at the sn3232 site fig 10b the sg st srh and su at the sn3232 site showed similar monthly variation to that of the sn2980 site whilst the srn showed a slight difference in some cold months such as january 2015 and december 2016 the rn was negative at the sn3232 site and the srn was also negative in those months when rn was positive the sensitivity of pet to rn decreased as elevation increased when rn was negative the sensitivity of pet to rn increased as elevation increased the mean values for srn sg st srh and su showed that pet at the sn3232 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh t ws and g during the whole period and in the warm season in the cold season the most sensitive meteorological factors were t followed by rh ws rn and g table 2 3 3 3 sn3711 like the sn2980 and sn3232 sites the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to the pet at the sn3711 site fig 10c the sg st srh and su values showed trends toward variation similar to that of the sn2980 site whilst the srn value was negative in some cold months because of the negative rn as seen the sn3232 site because of topographic shading at the sn3711 site the absolute value of the negative rn in the cold season was high and the pet was low the absolute values for srn sg st srh and su all showed significant increases in winter fig 10c the pet at the sn3711 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh ws t and g for the whole period and for the warm season in the cold season the most sensitive meteorological factor was rh followed by rn ws t and g table 2 3 3 4 sn4164 like the sn3711 site the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to the pet at the sn4164 site fig 10d because of topographic shading the absolute value of negative rn in the cold season was high and the pet was low and the absolute values of srn sg st srh and su all showed significant increases in winter at the sn4164 site fig 10d the pet at the sn4164 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh ws t and g for the whole period and for the warm season in the cold season the most sensitive meteorological factor was rn followed by ws rh t and g table 2 3 3 5 sn4484 because there was no obvious topographic shading the variation trends of the srn sg st srh and su values at the sn4484 site were more like the trends at the more distant sn3232 site than those at nearer sn4164 site fig 10e unlike the sn4164 site the sensitivities of meteorological factors showed no obvious increase in winter the su values were positive and srh values were negative throughout the whole research period the sg value was positive for most of the cold season and negative for most of the warm season conversely the srn and st values were negative for most of the cold season and positive for most of the warm season fig 10e the pet at the sn4484 site was most sensitive to rh followed by rn t ws and g for the whole period the sensitivity of meteorological factors at the sn4484 site in order of stronger to weaker was rn rh ws t and g in the warm season and t rh ws rn and g in the cold season table 2 3 3 6 catchment as seen from the results from the five research sites for the whole yearly scale the pet in the research region was most sensitive to rn followed by rh ws t and g the sensitivity of these characteristics in the research region in order of stronger to weaker was rn rh t ws and g in the warm season and rh rn ws t and g in the cold season table 2 if the sites with topographic shading were removed and only sn2980 sn3232 and sn4484 were considered the order of sensitivity would have been rn rh t ws and g for the whole year and the warm season and t rh ws rn and g for the cold season if only the sn3711 and sn4164 sites were considered the order of sensitivity in the regions with topographic shading was rn rh ws t and g for the whole period the warm season and the cold season in all cases the sensitivity of pet to g was weakest 3 4 elevational gradients of sensitivities of pet to meteorological factors 3 4 1 net radiation because of topographic shading in the cold season at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites all five sites were chosen to calculate the elevational gradient of srn for the warm season fig 11 a but only three sites were chosen for the cold season and for the whole period fig 11b thus the elevational gradients of srn for the warm season the cold season and the whole period were 0 0033 100 m 1 r2 0 77 0 016 100 m 1 r2 0 87 and 0 010 100 m 1 r2 0 86 respectively fig 11 the negative srn elevational gradient showed that the higher the elevation the weaker the sensitivity of pet to rn the rn was negative for a few months and in this case the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to rn 3 4 2 soil heat flux just as no significant linear elevational gradient of g was found in the research region for the cold season and for the whole period the relationships between the sg and elevation at five or three research sites showed there were no significant elevational gradient for the sensitivity of pet to g all r2 0 30 fig 12 in the warm season the elevational gradient of the sg was 0 001 100 m 1 in research region fig 12a the elevational gradient of the sg was positive in the warm season but sg was negative for most of the warm season therefore the higher the elevation the weaker the sensitivity of pet to g in the warm season 3 4 3 air temperature at all five or three research sites the relationships between the st and elevation showed significant linear elevational gradients for the sensitivity of pet to t for the warm season the cold season and the whole period all r2 0 90 fig 13 in the warm season the elevational gradient of the st was 0 015 100 m 1 r2 0 95 fig 13a and the negative elevational gradient meant that the higher the elevation the weaker the sensitivity of pet to t in the cold season and for the whole period the elevational gradient of st was 0 022 100 m 1 and 0 019 100 m 1 respectively r2 0 99 fig 13b the negative st value and its elevational gradient in the cold season and for the whole period meant that if the t was below 0 c the higher the elevation the greater sensitivity of pet to t 3 4 4 relative humidity all srh values were negative throughout the whole research period at all five research sites fig 14 showed the relationships between the srh values and elevation as with srn all five sites were chosen to calculate the elevational gradient of srh for the warm season fig 14a and only three sites were chosen for the cold season and for the whole period fig 14b the elevational gradients of srh for the warm season the cold season and the whole period were 0 012 100 m 1 r2 0 82 0 005 100 m 1 r2 0 99 and 0 009 100 m 1 r2 0 99 respectively fig 14 the negative srh value and the negative srh elevational gradient showed that the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to rh 3 4 5 wind speed fig 15 showed the relationships between the su value and elevation the elevational gradients of su for the warm season the cold season and the whole research period were 0 003 100 m r2 0 83 0 013 100 m r2 0 99 and 0 008 100 m r2 0 98 respectively fig 15 the positive su value and the positive su elevational gradient meant that the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to ws 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors is known to vary spatially among climate zones the sensitivity of pet to the same factors showed significant variation from one climate location to another in the united states including semiarid mediterranean type coastal humid inland humid semi humid and island climates irmak et al 2006 t was found to be the most important factor for pet in australia but the second most important factors differed between dry and humid catchments guo et al 2017 the most sensitive factor in china was rh and great regional differences were seen liu et al 2012 for example the maximum temperature was the most sensitive factor in the yellow river basin yangtze river basin and some other river basins but rh was the most sensitive factor in the northwest river drainage system where this study area was located liu et al 2012 the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors is regional variation because climate conditions and meteorological factors from the different climate zones differ with regional variation tabari and talaee 2014 guo et al 2017 this study showed that even in a small catchment the sensitivity varied from low elevations to high elevations on a yearly scale rh and rn were the two most sensitive factors in catchment but rh was more sensitive at high elevation and rn was more sensitive at low elevation elevation strongly influences meteorological factors in high mountainous regions thereby affecting pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors the influences of elevation on the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors have seldom been discussed the sensitivity coefficients of maximum temperature and wind speed decreased as the elevation increased in yellow river basin in china liu et al 2012 in wei river a tributary of the yellow river rh and t were both more sensitive in the middle lower region with a low elevation than upstream of the basin with a high elevation and the sensitivities of solar radiation and ws showed seasonal variations zuo et al 2012 in upper mekong river basin rh t and ws were more sensitive in the middle lower reaches whilst the sensitivity of pet to the sunshine duration hours showed seasonal variation among the upper middle and lower reaches li et al 2015 the results of this study differed from those of other reports for example in this study the sensitivities of pet to rh fig 14 and ws fig 15 both increased as the elevation increased possibly because the earlier studies were based on data from national meteorological stations located in various climate regions for example the study of yellow river used data from 77 meteorological stations in the basin with a length of 5464 km and a drainage area of 752443 km2 liu et al 2012 the research area in this study was a small catchment with area of 23 1 km2 and the results were taken from five in situ meteorological stations at various elevations the influence of elevation on pet sensitivity may differ with regional scale 4 2 influence of topographic shading on radiation in mountainous region as a dominant energy source solar radiation exerts a significant influence on the planet s energy and water cycles wang et al 2018 in mountainous regions the amount of solar radiation varies strongly with complex terrain chow et al 2013 and controls water and heat processes such as et essery 2004 to reduce the influence of topography on measurements of radiation and other meteorological factors the meteorological stations must be built in open and flat part of mountainous areas as much as possible however topographic shading is widespread in mountainous regions in this study the solar elevation angles were high in the warm season and no topographic shading was seen at any of the five meteorological stations in the cold season however the solar elevation angles decreased and the radiation sensors were usually shadowed by surrounding terrain while the sun rose at sn3711 and sn4164 sites fig 16 a the time duration during which direct beam solar radiation fell upon the sn3711 and sn4164 sites were the same as at the other three sites in the warm season but were significantly shorter in the cold season fig 16 in addition to shortwave radiation longwave radiation including upward and downward radiation is another key component to determine rn the downward longwave radiation depends on the various gaseous layers in the atmosphere which are heated to a range of temperatures and is controlled by air temperature and effective atmosphere emissivity the upward longwave radiation depends on the emittance absorptance properties of the material at the ground surface and its temperature ebrahimi and marshall 2015 pashiardis et al 2017 because air temperature has a significant elevational gradient and the ground surface temperature has a good correlation with air temperature yang et al 2017b the upward and downward longwave radiation at lower elevation sites sn2980 and sn 3232 were significantly higher than those radiation at higher elevation sites sn3711 sn4164 and sn 4484 fig 17 a and b however the upward and downward longwave radiation at higher elevation sites both showed weak difference probably because there were many influencing factors to atmosphere emissivity and ground surface emissivity atmosphere emissivity is controlled by water vapor carbon dioxide ozone cloud and dust allen et al 1998 masiri et al 2017 and ground surface emissivity varies significantly as a result of differences in soil texture mineral composition organic and moisture content and differences in plant cover van de griend et al 1991 the net longwave radiation the difference between the upward and the downward longwave radiation showed no obvious elevational gradient in the research region fig 17c unlike the solar radiation the net longwave radiations were not noticeably influenced by topographic shading the rn at sn3711 and sn4164 sites in the cold season were not only significantly lower than that of sn2980 and sn3232 sites with lower elevation but also lower than that of sn4484 site with higher elevation the main reason for the relatively small rn in cold season at sn3711 and sn4164 sites was that the solar radiation was shielded by topographic shading the obviously lower rn values at sn3711 and sn4164 sites because of topographic shading in the cold season influenced et and its sensitivity to meteorological factors terrain complexity is an important characteristic of mountains and solar radiation was affected not only by cast shadowing in this study but also by the slope and aspect of the terrain atmospheric transmittance albedo sky view factor and self shadowing oliphant et al 2003 marsh et al 2012 the influence of terrain on radiation in mountainous areas is extremely complex at the fine scale and thus forms a complex process of pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors due to the lack of measurement data for meteorological factors under various topographic conditions the results of this study focused only on the influences of elevation on pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors 5 conclusions in this study the elevational gradients of meteorological factors such as net radiation rn soil heat flux g air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed ws were investigated based on measurement data from 2015 to 2016 from five automatic meteorological stations at various elevations in the hulu catchment qilian mountains the rn and t decreased as the elevation increased in both warm and cold season and ws increased as the elevation increased topographic shading by surrounding terrain significantly altered the direct solar radiation received at the surface and reduced rn in the high mountainous regions the rh in warm season increased as the elevation increased and but decreased in cold season the g in warm season decreased as the elevation increased whilst no significant elevational gradient were found for the cold season potential evapotranspiration pet showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites it was low in the cold season and high in the warm season the mean monthly pet values at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 74 90 mm month 1 68 88 mm month 1 53 67 mm month 1 52 72 mm month 1 and 47 27 mm month 1 respectively pet showed a significant elevational gradient and decreased as the elevation increased the sensitivity of meteorological factors to pet in the research region in order of stronger to weaker was rn rh t ws and g for the whole period and the warm season and t rh ws rn and g for the cold season the sensitivity of g was significantly lower than that of the other meteorological factors the sensitivities of pet to meteorological factors showed different elevational gradients both in magnitude and direction when the rn was positive the sensitivity of pet to rn decreased as the elevation increased and when the rn was negative the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased when t was above 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t decreased as the elevation increased and when t was below 0 c the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to both rh and ws in warm season the sensitivity of pet to g increased as the elevation increased and the sensitivity did not show significant relationship with elevation in cold season the rn was relatively small at the sites with topographic shading and resulting in less sensitivity of pet to rn and greater sensitivity of pet to other meteorological factors the complex terrain in mountainous regions affects the water and heat transfer processes in the area including et this study presents the effects of elevation on pet and its sensitivities to five meteorological factors future studies should consider the influences of other topographic factors on pet such as slope and aspect to contribute to our understanding of the influences of complex terrain on et and water cycle and to provide some scientific basis for water

6804,mountainous regions are important sources of freshwater measurement of actual evapotranspiration et is difficult to obtain in high mountain regions because of the harsh natural environment and potential et pet is therefore a suitable term to describe the atmospheric water demand of land surfaces under given meteorological conditions in those high elevation areas in situ measured meteorological data were collected in 2015 and 2016 from five meteorological stations at various elevations from 2980 m to 4484 m in the qilian mountains northwestern china and the meteorological factors changed markedly with elevation pet calculated with the penman method showed a significant elevational gradient and decreased as the elevation increased the sensitivity analysis indicated that over the whole period pet in the research region was most sensitive to net radiation rn followed by relative humidity rh air temperature t wind speed ws and soil heat flux g when rn was positive the sensitivity of pet to rn decreased as the elevation increased and when rn was negative the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased when t was above 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t decreased as the elevation increased and when t was below 0 c the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to both rh and ws the topographic shading in mountainous regions affected meteorological factors pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors in those high elevation areas the rn was relatively small at the sites with topographic shading because of the reduction in solar radiation and resulted in less sensitivity of pet to rn and greater sensitivity of pet to other meteorological factors this study can help us to understand pet in the qilian mountains and in other mountain regions from which meteorological data are difficult to obtain and very sensitive to climate change keywords potential evapotranspiration penman

an essential role in water resources whilst another 37 provides important supportive supply especially in arid and semiarid regions that are vulnerable to seasonal and regional water shortages viviroli et al 2007 2011 as climates change sensitive high mountain cold regions can act as reliable indicators of the responses to global warming beniston and stoffel 2014 mountain research initiative edw working group 2015 rogora et al 2018 mountain catchments have shown warnings of change in land surface hydrology milano et al 2015 and the hydrological balance and possible future changes in mountainous regions remain poorly understood ragettlia et al 2016 evapotranspiration et along with precipitation and runoff is a major component of the water cycle at or near land surfaces in large regions senay et al 2011 yin et al 2013 and is thus considered to be the most appropriate indicator of the activity of climate change and water cycle wang et al 2013 because et shows great variability over time and space it is perhaps the most difficult and complicated component in the hydrological cycle li et al 2014 the complex terrain in mountainous regions and the scarcity of measurement data because of the harsh natural environmental conditions exacerbate the lack of understanding of et in mountainous regions the actual et is the best parameter for characterising the hydrological cycle but measurement of the actual et in high mountain regions presents many challenges and difficulties yang et al 2017a the biggest challenge is that the low temperatures in these cold high mountain regions test the endurance of field workers and their instruments woo 2008 since the actual et is difficult to measure directly as an alternative it can be calculated using mathematical models usually relying on reference et or potential et pet allen 2006 almorox et al 2015 the reference et is taken from a reference surface which is a hypothetical grass reference crop with specific characteristics allen et al 1998 pet refers to the maximum moisture loss from the surface as determined by the meteorological conditions and the surface type assuming an unlimited moisture supply lhomme 1997 pet provides the upper limit of land surface et while the estimation of actual et in hydrological models is generally based on pet and crop coefficient allen 2006 douglas et al 2009 becomes the common and important input for hydrological models li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 as the indicator of evaporative power of atmosphere pet determines the maximum possible water consumption from the land surface wang et al 2017 therefore become the most suitable term to describe the atmospheric water demand of land surfaces under given meteorological conditions zheng et al 2017 pet is an integrated measure of four key meteorological variables including radiation wind speed temperature and vapor pressure donohue et al 2010 sun et al 2016 and the dominant factors that affect pet show regional differences in the yangtze river basin in china the decline in pet during the past several decades was attributed to a decrease solar radiation wang et al 2007 whilst wind speed was the dominant factor in the canadian prairies burn and hesch 2007 and australia roderick et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2012 furthermore water vapor and temperature were found to be the dominant factors in a few regions e g tabari et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 most studies of pet were based on measurements from national meteorological stations and discussed pet trends in time series and their sensitivity to meteorological parameters e g zuo et al 2012 li et al 2015 2017 peng et al 2017 robinson et al 2017 national meteorological stations are generally located far from each other and the interpolated gridded datasets from those stations across various climate zones may not provide spatially explicit pet data at high mountainous regions the complex terrain in high mountain regions may affect the distribution of meteorological elements and thereby affect the spatial distribution of pet climatic conditions change markedly with elevation and pet depends greatly upon elevation van den bergh et al 2013 pet is affected by variations in meteorological factors but the relationships among these factors and elevation remain unclear wang et al 2016 therefore the calculation of pet from datasets based on in situ measurement in a small catchment with the same climatic zone may improve our understanding of et and its elevational gradient in mountainous regions the qilian mountains located at the northeastern edge of the tibetan plateau are the runoff formation zone and the source of all rivers in the arid hexi corridor region feng 2010 dong et al 2015 which was the main path of the ancient silk road and the most important communication route between western and eastern eurasia zhou et al 2016 therefore research into pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors is of vital significance to understand the water cycle in the qilian mountains and water resource management in the oasis belt at the piedmont plain in the hexi corridor the objectives of this study are 1 to calculate pet at five elevation sites 2 to assess the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors and 3 to estimate the elevational gradients of sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors in the qilian mountains 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the hulu catchment located in the qilian mountains northwestern china ranges from 99 49 e to 99 54 e longitude and from 38 12 n to 38 17 n latitude with an altitude range from 2960 m to 4800 m and a drainage area of 23 1 km2 fig 1 a cryosphere hydrology observation system was established in this small alpine catchment in 2008 chen et al 2014 in 2008 four automatic meteorological stations were positioned at various elevations the underlying surfaces were covered by grassland 99 52 9 e 38 16 1 n 2980 m shrub meadow 99 52 6 e 38 14 9 n 3232 m swamp meadow 99 53 4 e 38 13 9 n 3711 m and moraine 99 53 4 e 38 13 3 n 4164 m fig 1 meteorological factors were measured at each station included four component radiation downward and upward shortwave radiation downward and upward longwave radiation air temperature t relative humidity rh wind speed ws and direction multiple layers of soil moisture and temperature land surface temperature soil heat flux g precipitation snow depth in june 2014 an automatic meteorological station was installed near the shiyi glacier in the hulu catchment fig 1 and the underlying surface was covered by moraine 99 52 6 e 38 13 1 n 4484 m unlike the first four automatic meteorological stations this station near the shiyi glacier did not gather complete meteorological data only four component radiation t rh ws wind direction and precipitation the net radiation rn is the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation of both short and long wavelengths and rn is calculated as followed 1 r n r s r l r s r l where r s r l r s and r l is downward shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 downward longwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 upward shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 and upward longwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 respectively the positive of rn means downward radiation and the negative means upward radiation the positive of g means upward radiation and the negative means downward radiation the meteorological data in this study were gathered from those five meteorological stations which in this study are named sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 in this study fig 1 and table 1 to compare meteorological factors and pet over the same period 2 years 2015 and 2016 were selected as the research period 2 2 methods 2 2 1 penman method a multitude of methods are used to calculate pet xu and singh 2002 li et al 2016 and the penman method performs reasonably across the range of conditions tested e g donohue et al 2010 milly and dunne 2016 zheng et al 2017 the land cover and plant types were different at five research site in order to reduce the influences from land surface conditions the penman method based on the assumption of water surface was chosen to compare the pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors at different research sites the penman method for calculating pet can be expressed as 2 pet δ r n g 6 43 γ 1 0 536 u 2 e s e a δ γ λ where pet is the potential et mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 es is the saturation vapor

sensitivity analysis the sensitivity coefficient in this study indicates the sensitivity of pet to the meteorological variable and it is favored to quantify the determining factors in pet to be dimensionless the relative sensitivity coefficient s is calculated by the partial derivative mccuen 1974 6 s v i lim v i 0 δ p e t p e t δ v i v i p e t v i v i pet where svi is the sensitivity coefficient of meteorological factor vi δpet is the variation in pet vi is the meteorological factor and δvi is the variation of the meteorological factor a positive negative svi indicates that the pet will increase decrease as the meteorological factor increases the greater the svi the greater the effects of the meteorological factor on pet the analytical expressions can be found in the supplementary material the sensitivity coefficient has been widely used in et studies e g yin et al 2010 liu et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 li et al 2015 paparrizos et al 2016 li et al 2017 in this study rn g t rh and ws were chosen to analyse the sensitivity of meteorological factors to pet and their sensitivity coefficients were labelled srn sg st srh and su respectively the daily variations in the meteorological factors in mountainous areas are greatly influenced by local terrain clouds and fog and it is difficult to establish a daily scale elevational gradient in this study the meteorological factors and their sensitivity coefficients on pet were analysed on monthly scales by using monthly meteorological quantities and the seasonal and yearly sensitivity coefficients were obtained by averaging monthly values 2 2 3 soil heat flux for sn4484 site the data for g were measured at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 and sn4164 sites but not at the sn4484 site allen et al 1998 recommended two simple ways to calculate g for monthly period 7 g m i 0 07 t m i 1 t m i 1 8 g m i 0 14 t m i t m i 1 where gm i is the soil heat flux density of month i mj m 2 day 1 tm i tm i 1 and tm i 1 are the mean air temperatures of month i the previous month and the next month c in consideration of the form of eqs 7 8 the following regression formula was built 9 g m i a r ms i b r ns i c t m i 1 t m i 1 d t m i t m i 1 where rms i and rns i is the solar radiation and the rn of month i mj m 2 day 1 respectively a b c and d are taken from regression analysis with data from the sn4164 site with a similar underlying surface as the sn4484 site and with values of 0 0493 0 1485 0 0431 and 0 0375 respectively fig 2 showed that the comparison of calculation by eqs 7 9 and the measured g at the sn4164 site and their relationship showed that eq 9 could more effectively calculate g than eq 7 or 8 at the sn4164 site sn4484 site has an underlying land cover similar to that of the sn4164 site so it is reasonable to calculate g with eq 9 at the sn4484 site 3 results 3 1 elevational gradients of meteorological factors 3 1 1 net radiation the mean annual rn measurements at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 7 85 mj m 2 day 1 6 74 mj m 2 day 1 4 34 mj m 2 day 1 4 36 mj m 2 day 1 and 4 63 mj m 2 day 1 respectively the rn showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites fig 3 a at the beginning of the year the rn was low and then it increased until reaching its maximum in july in autumn the rn began to decrease because the decrease of solar radiation and the increase of albedo from snow cover caused the decrease of net shortwave radiation the rn reached its minimum in december and began to increase the next year entering another cycle topographic shading from surrounding terrain was seen at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites in the cold season which could not be ignored and the topographic shading at those two sites lasted from october to next march thus the research period in this study was divided into a warm season april may june july august and september and a cold season january february march october november and december according to the measured data from the five automatic meteorological stations the rn showed a significant linear elevational gradient relationship during the warm season and the mean rn decreased about 0 242 mj m 2 day 1 for each 100 m of 100 m fig 3b correlation coefficient r2 0 97 the annual elevational gradient of the rn over the whole research period 2 years was about 0 224 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 r2 0 75 but it was not as significant as that during the warm season because the measured rn in the cold season from five stations showed a weak elevational gradient r2 0 41 the mean monthly rn measurements in the cold season at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites were significantly lower than those from the other three researcher sites fig 3b because of topographic shading in the cold season thus the elevational gradient for the rn in the cold season or over the whole period was more reasonable when the results were calculated from the three meteorological stations that did not have topographic shading under this circumstance the rn elevational gradient was about 0 200 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 for the whole period and 0 147 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 for the cold season 3 1 2 soil heat flux the mean annual g at sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 0 09 mj m 2 day 1 0 25 mj m 2 day 1 0 03 mj m 2 day 1 0 10 mj m 2 day 1 and 0 13 mj m 2 day 1 respectively g showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites fig 4 a at the beginning of the year the g was negative upward heat conduction towards relatively cold air it then increased and became positive in march and reached its maximum in summer g decreased in autumn became negative in september reached its minimum in december and began to increase the next year entering another cycle g is relatively low and may be ignored for day time steps and it is related to rn its mineral composition and its water content allen et al 1998 the elevational gradient of g during the warm season in the hulu catchment was 0 0188 mj m 2 day 1 100 m 1 r2 0 93 fig 4b however no significant linear elevational gradients were seen for the cold season or for the whole period fig 4b 3 1 3 air temperature the mean t at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 was 1 05 c 0 78 c 1 50 c 3 76 c and 6 19 c respectively t showed significant seasonal variations at all five research sites the maximum t usually occurred in july or august whilst the minimum generally occurred in january fig 5 a it is well known that the elevational gradient of t varies from about 0 98 c 100 m 1 for dry air to about 0 40 c 100 m 1 for very warm saturated air and that the mean lapse rate is 0 65 c 100 m 1 dodson and marks 1997 according to the data measured from the five automatic meteorological stations mean t showed a significant linear elevational gradient relationship in the warm season the cold season and during the whole period with elevational gradients in the research region was 0 54 c 100 m 1 r2 0 97 0 34 c 100 m 1 r2 0 92 and 0 44 c 100 m 1 r2 0 95 respectively fig 5b 3 1 4 relative humidity the mean rh at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 56 00 53 34 55 31 52 84 and 55 57 respectively like rn g and t rh showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites it was low in the cold season and high in the warm season the maximums occurred in june or september 2015 and august 2016 whilst the minimums occurred in december 2015 and february 2016 fig 6 a in the warm season rh had a weak positive linear relationship with elevation r2 0 57 and the rate of increase with elevation was 0 32 100 m 1 the rh showed the opposite elevational gradient in the cold season and the rate of decrease was 0 38 100 m 1 r2 0 81 on a yearly scale the correlation between rh and elevation had no obvious linear elevational gradient in the research catchment r2 0 02 fig 6b 3 1 5 wind speed the mean ws at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 1 87 m s 1 2 18 m s 1 2 39 m s 1 2 82 m s 1 and 2 92 m s 1 respectively unlike rn g t and rh the ws showed no apparent seasonal variation at the five research sites ws in the cold season were slightly higher than those in the warm season at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 and sn4484 but not at the sn4164 site fig 7 a the reason for this difference might be the presence of higher surrounding terrain around the sn4164 site which might have caused a unique wind field and local circulation the ws elevational gradients in the warm season in the cold season and during the whole research period were 0 056 m s 1 100 m 1 r2 0 90 0 083 m s 1 100 m 1 r2 0 86 and 0 069 m s 1 100 m 1 r2 0 98 respectively fig 7b 3 2 elevational gradient of pet according to the measured meteorological data from the five stations the mean monthly pet values at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 74 90 mm month 1 68 88 mm month 1 53 67 mm month 1 52 72 mm month 1 and 47 27 mm month 1 respectively a slight difference was seen between 2015 and 2016 the total pet values at the five sites were 875 22 mm 810 19 mm 620 59 mm 625 59 mm and 539 42 mm respectively in 2015 and 922 39 mm 842 97 mm 667 57 mm 639 58 mm and 595 16 mm respectively in 2016 significant seasonal variation in pet i e low in the cold season and high in the warm season was seen at all five research sites at the beginning of the year the pet value was small and it then increased until it reached the maximum in july before decreasing in the autumn and reach its minimum in december or january fig 8 the relationship between pet and elevation showed that pet decreased as elevation increased fig 9 analysis of the measured meteorological data showed that the topographic shading in mountainous region would influence the meteorological factors especially the rn in this study the influences of topographic shading could not be ignored at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites in the cold season under these circumstances all five sites were chosen for calculation of the pet elevational gradient for the warm season fig 9a and only three sites sn2980 sn3232 and sn4484 were chosen for the calculation for the cold season and for the whole period fig 9b thus the pet elevational gradients for the warm season the cold season and the whole period were 2 61 mm month 1 100 m 1 r2 0 98 0 88 mm month 1 100 m 1 r2 0 99 and 1 80 mm month 1 100 m 1 r2 0 99 respectively fig 9 3 3 sensitivity analysis of pet to meteorological factors 3 3 1 sn2980 the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to the pet at the sn2980 site fig 10 a positive srn and su values for the whole research period indicated that the greater the rn and ws the greater the pet a negative of srh value for the whole research period meant that the greater the rh the smaller the pet the sg value was positive for most of the cold season and negative for most of the warm season the g was usually positive in the warm season and downward heat conduction towards relatively cold soil conversely in the cold season the greater the g value in the positive the smaller the pet and the greater the absolute value of g in the negative the smaller the pet the opposite phenomenon was shown by the st which was positive for most of the warm season and negative for most of the cold season when t was above 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t decreased as elevation increased when t was below 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t increased as elevation increased on a yearly scale the st was negative at the sn2980 site the mean of the absolute values for srn sg st srh and su showed that pet at the sn2980 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh t ws and g during the whole period and in the warm season the most sensitive meteorological factors in the cold season were rh and rn followed by t ws and g table 2 3 3 2 sn3232 like the sn2980 site the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to pet at the sn3232 site fig 10b the sg st srh and su at the sn3232 site showed similar monthly variation to that of the sn2980 site whilst the srn showed a slight difference in some cold months such as january 2015 and december 2016 the rn was negative at the sn3232 site and the srn was also negative in those months when rn was positive the sensitivity of pet to rn decreased as elevation increased when rn was negative the sensitivity of pet to rn increased as elevation increased the mean values for srn sg st srh and su showed that pet at the sn3232 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh t ws and g during the whole period and in the warm season in the cold season the most sensitive meteorological factors were t followed by rh ws rn and g table 2 3 3 3 sn3711 like the sn2980 and sn3232 sites the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to the pet at the sn3711 site fig 10c the sg st srh and su values showed trends toward variation similar to that of the sn2980 site whilst the srn value was negative in some cold months because of the negative rn as seen the sn3232 site because of topographic shading at the sn3711 site the absolute value of the negative rn in the cold season was high and the pet was low the absolute values for srn sg st srh and su all showed significant increases in winter fig 10c the pet at the sn3711 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh ws t and g for the whole period and for the warm season in the cold season the most sensitive meteorological factor was rh followed by rn ws t and g table 2 3 3 4 sn4164 like the sn3711 site the rn g t rh and ws values showed different sensitivities to the pet at the sn4164 site fig 10d because of topographic shading the absolute value of negative rn in the cold season was high and the pet was low and the absolute values of srn sg st srh and su all showed significant increases in winter at the sn4164 site fig 10d the pet at the sn4164 site was most sensitive to rn followed by rh ws t and g for the whole period and for the warm season in the cold season the most sensitive meteorological factor was rn followed by ws rh t and g table 2 3 3 5 sn4484 because there was no obvious topographic shading the variation trends of the srn sg st srh and su values at the sn4484 site were more like the trends at the more distant sn3232 site than those at nearer sn4164 site fig 10e unlike the sn4164 site the sensitivities of meteorological factors showed no obvious increase in winter the su values were positive and srh values were negative throughout the whole research period the sg value was positive for most of the cold season and negative for most of the warm season conversely the srn and st values were negative for most of the cold season and positive for most of the warm season fig 10e the pet at the sn4484 site was most sensitive to rh followed by rn t ws and g for the whole period the sensitivity of meteorological factors at the sn4484 site in order of stronger to weaker was rn rh ws t and g in the warm season and t rh ws rn and g in the cold season table 2 3 3 6 catchment as seen from the results from the five research sites for the whole yearly scale the pet in the research region was most sensitive to rn followed by rh ws t and g the sensitivity of these characteristics in the research region in order of stronger to weaker was rn rh t ws and g in the warm season and rh rn ws t and g in the cold season table 2 if the sites with topographic shading were removed and only sn2980 sn3232 and sn4484 were considered the order of sensitivity would have been rn rh t ws and g for the whole year and the warm season and t rh ws rn and g for the cold season if only the sn3711 and sn4164 sites were considered the order of sensitivity in the regions with topographic shading was rn rh ws t and g for the whole period the warm season and the cold season in all cases the sensitivity of pet to g was weakest 3 4 elevational gradients of sensitivities of pet to meteorological factors 3 4 1 net radiation because of topographic shading in the cold season at the sn3711 and sn4164 sites all five sites were chosen to calculate the elevational gradient of srn for the warm season fig 11 a but only three sites were chosen for the cold season and for the whole period fig 11b thus the elevational gradients of srn for the warm season the cold season and the whole period were 0 0033 100 m 1 r2 0 77 0 016 100 m 1 r2 0 87 and 0 010 100 m 1 r2 0 86 respectively fig 11 the negative srn elevational gradient showed that the higher the elevation the weaker the sensitivity of pet to rn the rn was negative for a few months and in this case the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to rn 3 4 2 soil heat flux just as no significant linear elevational gradient of g was found in the research region for the cold season and for the whole period the relationships between the sg and elevation at five or three research sites showed there were no significant elevational gradient for the sensitivity of pet to g all r2 0 30 fig 12 in the warm season the elevational gradient of the sg was 0 001 100 m 1 in research region fig 12a the elevational gradient of the sg was positive in the warm season but sg was negative for most of the warm season therefore the higher the elevation the weaker the sensitivity of pet to g in the warm season 3 4 3 air temperature at all five or three research sites the relationships between the st and elevation showed significant linear elevational gradients for the sensitivity of pet to t for the warm season the cold season and the whole period all r2 0 90 fig 13 in the warm season the elevational gradient of the st was 0 015 100 m 1 r2 0 95 fig 13a and the negative elevational gradient meant that the higher the elevation the weaker the sensitivity of pet to t in the cold season and for the whole period the elevational gradient of st was 0 022 100 m 1 and 0 019 100 m 1 respectively r2 0 99 fig 13b the negative st value and its elevational gradient in the cold season and for the whole period meant that if the t was below 0 c the higher the elevation the greater sensitivity of pet to t 3 4 4 relative humidity all srh values were negative throughout the whole research period at all five research sites fig 14 showed the relationships between the srh values and elevation as with srn all five sites were chosen to calculate the elevational gradient of srh for the warm season fig 14a and only three sites were chosen for the cold season and for the whole period fig 14b the elevational gradients of srh for the warm season the cold season and the whole period were 0 012 100 m 1 r2 0 82 0 005 100 m 1 r2 0 99 and 0 009 100 m 1 r2 0 99 respectively fig 14 the negative srh value and the negative srh elevational gradient showed that the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to rh 3 4 5 wind speed fig 15 showed the relationships between the su value and elevation the elevational gradients of su for the warm season the cold season and the whole research period were 0 003 100 m r2 0 83 0 013 100 m r2 0 99 and 0 008 100 m r2 0 98 respectively fig 15 the positive su value and the positive su elevational gradient meant that the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to ws 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors is known to vary spatially among climate zones the sensitivity of pet to the same factors showed significant variation from one climate location to another in the united states including semiarid mediterranean type coastal humid inland humid semi humid and island climates irmak et al 2006 t was found to be the most important factor for pet in australia but the second most important factors differed between dry and humid catchments guo et al 2017 the most sensitive factor in china was rh and great regional differences were seen liu et al 2012 for example the maximum temperature was the most sensitive factor in the yellow river basin yangtze river basin and some other river basins but rh was the most sensitive factor in the northwest river drainage system where this study area was located liu et al 2012 the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors is regional variation because climate conditions and meteorological factors from the different climate zones differ with regional variation tabari and talaee 2014 guo et al 2017 this study showed that even in a small catchment the sensitivity varied from low elevations to high elevations on a yearly scale rh and rn were the two most sensitive factors in catchment but rh was more sensitive at high elevation and rn was more sensitive at low elevation elevation strongly influences meteorological factors in high mountainous regions thereby affecting pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors the influences of elevation on the sensitivity of pet to meteorological factors have seldom been discussed the sensitivity coefficients of maximum temperature and wind speed decreased as the elevation increased in yellow river basin in china liu et al 2012 in wei river a tributary of the yellow river rh and t were both more sensitive in the middle lower region with a low elevation than upstream of the basin with a high elevation and the sensitivities of solar radiation and ws showed seasonal variations zuo et al 2012 in upper mekong river basin rh t and ws were more sensitive in the middle lower reaches whilst the sensitivity of pet to the sunshine duration hours showed seasonal variation among the upper middle and lower reaches li et al 2015 the results of this study differed from those of other reports for example in this study the sensitivities of pet to rh fig 14 and ws fig 15 both increased as the elevation increased possibly because the earlier studies were based on data from national meteorological stations located in various climate regions for example the study of yellow river used data from 77 meteorological stations in the basin with a length of 5464 km and a drainage area of 752443 km2 liu et al 2012 the research area in this study was a small catchment with area of 23 1 km2 and the results were taken from five in situ meteorological stations at various elevations the influence of elevation on pet sensitivity may differ with regional scale 4 2 influence of topographic shading on radiation in mountainous region as a dominant energy source solar radiation exerts a significant influence on the planet s energy and water cycles wang et al 2018 in mountainous regions the amount of solar radiation varies strongly with complex terrain chow et al 2013 and controls water and heat processes such as et essery 2004 to reduce the influence of topography on measurements of radiation and other meteorological factors the meteorological stations must be built in open and flat part of mountainous areas as much as possible however topographic shading is widespread in mountainous regions in this study the solar elevation angles were high in the warm season and no topographic shading was seen at any of the five meteorological stations in the cold season however the solar elevation angles decreased and the radiation sensors were usually shadowed by surrounding terrain while the sun rose at sn3711 and sn4164 sites fig 16 a the time duration during which direct beam solar radiation fell upon the sn3711 and sn4164 sites were the same as at the other three sites in the warm season but were significantly shorter in the cold season fig 16 in addition to shortwave radiation longwave radiation including upward and downward radiation is another key component to determine rn the downward longwave radiation depends on the various gaseous layers in the atmosphere which are heated to a range of temperatures and is controlled by air temperature and effective atmosphere emissivity the upward longwave radiation depends on the emittance absorptance properties of the material at the ground surface and its temperature ebrahimi and marshall 2015 pashiardis et al 2017 because air temperature has a significant elevational gradient and the ground surface temperature has a good correlation with air temperature yang et al 2017b the upward and downward longwave radiation at lower elevation sites sn2980 and sn 3232 were significantly higher than those radiation at higher elevation sites sn3711 sn4164 and sn 4484 fig 17 a and b however the upward and downward longwave radiation at higher elevation sites both showed weak difference probably because there were many influencing factors to atmosphere emissivity and ground surface emissivity atmosphere emissivity is controlled by water vapor carbon dioxide ozone cloud and dust allen et al 1998 masiri et al 2017 and ground surface emissivity varies significantly as a result of differences in soil texture mineral composition organic and moisture content and differences in plant cover van de griend et al 1991 the net longwave radiation the difference between the upward and the downward longwave radiation showed no obvious elevational gradient in the research region fig 17c unlike the solar radiation the net longwave radiations were not noticeably influenced by topographic shading the rn at sn3711 and sn4164 sites in the cold season were not only significantly lower than that of sn2980 and sn3232 sites with lower elevation but also lower than that of sn4484 site with higher elevation the main reason for the relatively small rn in cold season at sn3711 and sn4164 sites was that the solar radiation was shielded by topographic shading the obviously lower rn values at sn3711 and sn4164 sites because of topographic shading in the cold season influenced et and its sensitivity to meteorological factors terrain complexity is an important characteristic of mountains and solar radiation was affected not only by cast shadowing in this study but also by the slope and aspect of the terrain atmospheric transmittance albedo sky view factor and self shadowing oliphant et al 2003 marsh et al 2012 the influence of terrain on radiation in mountainous areas is extremely complex at the fine scale and thus forms a complex process of pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors due to the lack of measurement data for meteorological factors under various topographic conditions the results of this study focused only on the influences of elevation on pet and its sensitivity to meteorological factors 5 conclusions in this study the elevational gradients of meteorological factors such as net radiation rn soil heat flux g air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed ws were investigated based on measurement data from 2015 to 2016 from five automatic meteorological stations at various elevations in the hulu catchment qilian mountains the rn and t decreased as the elevation increased in both warm and cold season and ws increased as the elevation increased topographic shading by surrounding terrain significantly altered the direct solar radiation received at the surface and reduced rn in the high mountainous regions the rh in warm season increased as the elevation increased and but decreased in cold season the g in warm season decreased as the elevation increased whilst no significant elevational gradient were found for the cold season potential evapotranspiration pet showed significant seasonal variation at all five research sites it was low in the cold season and high in the warm season the mean monthly pet values at the sn2980 sn3232 sn3711 sn4164 and sn4484 sites in 2015 and 2016 were 74 90 mm month 1 68 88 mm month 1 53 67 mm month 1 52 72 mm month 1 and 47 27 mm month 1 respectively pet showed a significant elevational gradient and decreased as the elevation increased the sensitivity of meteorological factors to pet in the research region in order of stronger to weaker was rn rh t ws and g for the whole period and the warm season and t rh ws rn and g for the cold season the sensitivity of g was significantly lower than that of the other meteorological factors the sensitivities of pet to meteorological factors showed different elevational gradients both in magnitude and direction when the rn was positive the sensitivity of pet to rn decreased as the elevation increased and when the rn was negative the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased when t was above 0 c the sensitivity of pet to t decreased as the elevation increased and when t was below 0 c the sensitivity increased as the elevation increased the higher the elevation the greater the sensitivity of pet to both rh and ws in warm season the sensitivity of pet to g increased as the elevation increased and the sensitivity did not show significant relationship with elevation in cold season the rn was relatively small at the sites with topographic shading and resulting in less sensitivity of pet to rn and greater sensitivity of pet to other meteorological factors the complex terrain in mountainous regions affects the water and heat transfer processes in the area including et this study presents the effects of elevation on pet and its sensitivities to five meteorological factors future studies should consider the influences of other topographic factors on pet such as slope and aspect to contribute to our understanding of the influences of complex terrain on et and water cycle and to provide some scientific basis for water
