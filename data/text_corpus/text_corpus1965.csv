9825,the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system has been adopted widely to improve and stabilize the productivity of dryland crops in order to significantly reduce irrigation rate applied to fields an 8 year 2012 2020 in situ field experiment that rfrh combined with supplemental irrigation ri of winter wheat was conducted in the semiarid region of northwest china border irrigation bi was used as the control under ri and bi irrigation was applied only once jointing heading stage or twice jointing heading and heading flowering stage in separate trials irrigation rates applied each time under ri and bi were 37 5 mm 50 of that under bi and 75 0 mm respectively the results indicated that compared with bi ri significantly increased the soil water storage in the early growth stage net photosynthetic rate water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency and decreased the evapotranspiration in years with different precipitation distributions when irrigation was applied once ri increased wue by 13 4 9 1 and 8 7 compared with bi in dry normal and wet years respectively when irrigation was applied twice ri increased wue by 12 6 8 9 and 5 1 compared with bi in dry normal and wet years respectively compared with bi ri required 50 less irrigation water but it increased the grain yield by 3 3 2 4 and 2 8 with once application in dry normal and wet years respectively and decreased it by 6 3 4 1 and 3 2 when applied twice p 0 05 ri effectively maintained the yield and there was no significant difference compared with the yield under bi therefore ri could be applied as a technique for significantly reducing irrigation rate consumed in semiarid and semi humid areas keywords precipitation distribution ridge furrow mulching system border irrigation water use efficiency wheat yield semiarid areas 1 introduction climate change and water scarcity are important factors that affect agricultural production eck et al 2020 piao et al 2010 wu and ma 2018 semiarid and arid regions with abundant solar and thermal resources comprise 41 of the global land area and there is great potential for increasing grain production in these regions reynolds et al 2007 however precipitation is scarce with uneven spatial and temporal distributions in these regions and thus the potential for increasing crop yields is quite limited when dependent on precipitation alone gan et al 2013 mueller et al 2012 wei et al 2018 therefore providing irrigation in the critical growing stage is beneficial for enhancing the potential crop yield iqbal et al 2014 in addition many climate modeling studies indicate that dryland farming is more vulnerable to climate change than irrigated farming piao et al 2010 in order to address the lack of water available for irrigation in semiarid areas rainwater collection techniques have been developed to store water and water conservation facilities have improved to facilitate the irrigation of farmland ren et al 2010 however about 97 of the irrigation applied to farmland in these areas is still delivered using the traditional border irrigation bi method which consumes large amounts of water ali et al 2019 the utilization of irrigation water is inefficient with bi because of the high evapotranspiration et in semiarid areas qi et al 2015 moreover the water resources available for irrigating farmland at risk of drought stress are increasingly scarce due to frequent inter annual and seasonal fluctuations in precipitation and deepening of the groundwater level thus in order to achieve sustainable agricultural development there is an urgent need to develop water saving cultivation techniques that reduce the consumption of water for irrigation as well as increasing the water use efficiency wue to produce high and stable yields that are comparable to those without reduced irrigation gao et al 2017 memon et al 2021 sadras and angus 2006 water saving agricultural techniques are based on the efficient use of precipitation resources and reducing the water applied for irrigation by employing a variety of scientifically evaluated methods such as plastic film mulching straw mulching and drip and sprinkler irrigation in particular the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system one of the plastic film mulching is widely used in semiarid regions which involves the construction of alternating furrows and ridges and covering the ridges with plastic film to collect rainwater li et al 2020 ren et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 furthermore the collected rainwater is retained effectively near the crop root zone which is more conducive to water absorption by crops thereby improving the precipitation utilization efficiency such as by minimizing the surface runoff during heavy and intense precipitation and promoting the penetration of rainwater into deeper soil layers after light precipitation li and gong 2002 a previous study found that the soil moisture content at a depth of 0 75 m was 42 higher under the rfrh system than the conventional flat cropping system after 27 5 mm of precipitation gan et al 2013 the efficient utilization of precipitation resources and reduced ineffective evaporation due to ridge mulching can prolong the crop water availability period and thus rfrh combined with supplementary irrigation ri might facilitate the reduced usage of irrigation water li et al 2016 wu et al 2015 rfrh has been shown to significantly improve the crop yield and wue but its effects depend greatly on the precipitation characteristics el sadek and salem 2015 ren et al 2016 few studies have considered the application of ri and it is still not clear whether ri can improve the wue and maintain yields while significantly reducing supplementary irrigation rate compared with bi therefore in the present study conducted during 2012 2020 ri was tested by using 50 of irrigation rate compared with bi in winter wheat fields in a typical semiarid region of northwest china this study had the following objectives 1 to determine whether ri could optimize the spatial and temporal soil moisture distributions in dry normal and wet years 2 to compare the differences in winter wheat growth and the photosynthetic characteristics under ri and bi during years with different precipitation distributions and 3 to characterize the general mechanism that allows ri to maintain yields and improve the wue in semiarid areas with uncertain precipitation distributions the results obtained in this study suggest that this new technique may be suitable for saving water and maintaining the winter wheat yield in china and possibly other semiarid and semi humid areas throughout the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from september 2012 to july 2020 at the dryland agricultural research station in pengyang county ningxia northwestern china 106 45 e 35 79 n 1800 m above sea level fig 1 which is located in

249 4 mm the drought index di for annual precipitation was used to assess variations and status in the precipitation distribution among different years guo et al 2012 di was calculated to designate each year as a dry 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 normal 2013 2014 and 2019 2020 or wet 2012 2013 2014 2015 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 year dong et al 2019 guo et al 2012 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized complete block design was applied in this study the field study tested two irrigation methods the rfrh system combined with supplementary irrigation ri fig 2a and c and border irrigation bi fig 2b and d for each irrigation method trials were conducted with irrigation applied once and irrigation applied twice thus the following four treatments were tested 1 ri1 ri with irrigation once 2 bi1 bi with irrigation once 3 ri2 ri with irrigation twice and 4 bi2 bi with irrigation twice three replicates were conducted for each treatment in total there were 12 plots 4 treatments 3 replicates 12 plots and each had an area of 60 m2 10 6 m alternate ridges 60 cm wide and 15 cm high and furrows 60 cm wide were constructed for ri according to the experimental design the ridges were covered with plastic film 0 008 mm thick four rows of winter wheat were planted in the furrow fig 2a and c and irrigation was applied in the furrow under bi each plot was divided evenly into four parts to allow uniform irrigation each part was 5 m long and 3 m wide and irrigation was applied evenly in each part fig 2d using the equation etc et 0 kc irrigation rate was calculated based on the crop coefficients kc and the reference evapotranspiration et 0 calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 irrigation rates applied each time under ri and bi were 37 5 mm 50 of that under bi and 75 0 mm respectively according to the local precipitation distribution irrigation was applied during the jointing heading stage for winter wheat under ri1 and bi1 and during the jointing heading stage and heading flowering stage for winter wheat under ri2 and bi2 table 2 a 1 2 m wide space was kept clear between the plots to eliminate the effects of surface runoff and water seepage a pump connected to a water meter accurate to 0 001 m3 ningbo science student instrument technology co ltd zhejiang china was used to precisely control irrigation rate the field was prepared 10 days before sowing and ridge mulching was applied for the ri1 and ri2 treatments all plots received fertilizer comprising 180 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 urea and diammonium phosphate were employed as np fertilizer which was spread evenly in the furrows for ri1 and ri2 and on the surface for bi1 and bi2 before plowing into the 0 20 cm soil layer seeds of winter wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar longjian 301 were sown at a rate of 190 kg seed ha 1 with an inter row distance of 20 cm between september 15 and 25 during 2012 2020 table 2 pests diseases and weeds were controlled in a timely manner according to the standard local practices crops were harvested between 29 june and 10 july table 2 after harvesting the film was completely removed and recycled and the field was plowed immediately to avoid any other effects on soil and water conservation during the fallow period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water storage sws the soil gravimetric water content swc was recorded at 20 cm intervals in the 0 200 cm layer at different stages using a hand held soil ferric auger diameter 54 mm in this study the swc was measured in the seedling regreening jointing heading filling and maturity growth stages during october 1 29 march 25 31 april 15 20 may 11 20 june 12 20 and june 29 to july 11 respectively in the ri treatments the swc was determined as the average based on samples taken from the middle of the ridges fig 2a a the connections between ridges and furrows fig 2a b and the middle of the furrows fig 2a c the sampling location for the bi treatments was between the rows of winter wheat the wet soil samples were weighed oven dried at 105 c for 48 h and then weighed again the gravimetric swc was calculated according to the following equation 1 swc m 1 m 2 m 2 100 where m1 g is the mass of the wet soil and m2 g is the mass of the dry soil the sws mm in the soil profile 0 200 cm was then calculated using the following formula 2 sws

respectively sd cm is the soil depth n is the number of soil layers and i represents the soil layer e g 0 20 20 40 180 200 cm 2 3 2 et et mm was determined using the following formula 3 et i p r d sws where i mm is the total irrigation p mm is the precipitation r mm is the runoff d mm is the deep drainage and δsws is the change in sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile in this experiment r and d were considered negligible zero the experimental field was flat so runoff was never observed the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 80 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible the drainage was assumed to be insignificant over a depth of 200 cm 2 3 3 photosynthetic parameters the photosynthetic characteristics of the flag leaves were measured in the winter wheat heading stage after the first irrigation and filling stage after the second irrigation using a li 6400 system li cor inc lincoln ne usa between 9 00 and 11 00 local time on sunny days five random replicates were measured for each treatment in addition the side rows and middle rows were measured separately for both ri treatments and the mean values were used as representative of each treatment 2 3 4 accumulated dry matter to determine the accumulated dry matter two 0 5 m long rows one from the side row and one from the middle row in the ri treatments were randomly selected from each plot in the regreening jointing heading filling and maturity stages the plant samples were oven dried at 105 c for 0 5 h and then at 75 c for 24 h 2 3 5 yield and yield components and coefficient of relative yield stability crys in the maturity stage three quadrats 1 0 1 2 m were randomly selected in each plot to determine the yield and yield components spike number kernel number per spike and 1000 grain weight excluding the borders of the plots fig 2c and d the grain yield and 1000 grain weight were determined at a water content of 12 in the present study the relative yield stability under ri was evaluated using bi as a control the ratio of the yield under ri treatments relative to that under the corresponding bi treatments was used to define crys which was calculated with eq 4 4 crys y ri y bi where y ri kg ha 1 and y bi kg ha 1 are the grain yields under the ri and bi treatments ri1 vs bi1 and ri2 vs bi2 respectively relative to ri the yield increased when crys 1 and the yield decreased when crys 1 2 3 6 wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue wue kg ha 1 mm 1 and iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 wue y et 6 iwue y i where y kg ha 1 is the grain yield et mm is the evapotranspiration throughout the growth stage and i mm is the total irrigation 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance was performed using spss 18 0 ibm inc armonk ny usa post hoc tests fisher s least significant difference test p 0 05 were conducted to compare the mean differences among treatments the relationship between the yield and еt was evaluated using regression analysis all figures were prepared using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 sws in 0 60 and 60 200 cm soil layers in the 0 60 cm soil layer the sws was significantly increased under ri from the regreening to jointing stage when not irrigated compared with the corresponding bi treatment p 0 05 fig 3 in particular the sws values were 13 3 and 12 5 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with those under bi1 and bi2 in dry years respectively as well as 5 9 and 6 3 higher in normal years and 3 7 and 2 8 higher in wet years however there were no significant differences in sws between the ri and bi treatments during the heading stage after the first irrigation among the three rainfall types different trends were observed during the filling maturity stage after the second irrigation under the three rainfall types specifically the sws values were 3 2 and 6 4 lower under ri1 and ri2 in dry years but there were no significant differences in ri and bi in normal years and ri2 was 7 1 lower compared with bi2 in wet years in the 60 200 cm soil layer the sws values during the seedling to jointing stage were 2 8 and 3 7 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 in dry years respectively as well as 2 1 and 2 5 higher in normal years and 3 6 and 3 5 higher in wet years p 0 05 fig 3 by contrast the sws values were significantly lower under the ri treatments than the corresponding bi treatments after the heading stage in particular from the heading to maturity stage the average sws values were 4 4 3 7 and 4 3 lower under ri1 compared with bi during the dry normal and wet years respectively the sws values were 5 0 6 4 and 9 6 lower under ri2 compared with bi2 during the dry normal and wet years respectively p 0 05 in semiarid areas precipitation during the fallow period was critical for restoring the soil moisture and it accounted for 38 65 of the annual precipitation in the present study table 1 the sws values in the 0 200 cm soil layer differed significantly under the four treatments during the winter wheat maturity stage in the following order bi2 ri2 bi1 ri1 p 0 05 fig 4 however sws clearly increased during the fallow period and recovered to a high level and thus there were no significant differences among the four treatments after abundant precipitation for more than two months during the summer fallow period 3 2 et throughout the growing season the average et rates in the 0 200 cm layer were 6 7 and 11 7 lower under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively p 0 05 fig 5 in particular the et rates were 10 0 6 6 and 5 8 lower under ri1 than bi1 during the dry normal and wet years respectively similarly the et rates were 19 8 13 6 and 8 5 lower under ri2 compared with bi2 during the dry normal and wet years respectively during dry years et was mainly lower from the sowing to heading stage under ri1 compared with bi1 but it was significantly lower in all stages under ri2 compared with bi2 however during normal and wet years et was mainly lower from the sowing to filling stage under ri1 compared with bi1 and et was significantly lower under ri2 compared with bi2 during each growth stage except for the jointing heading stage in normal years and the regreening jointing stage in wet years 3 3 photosynthetic characteristics compared with the corresponding bi treatments ri significantly promoted stomatal opening which enhanced the photosynthetic and transpiration rates in winter wheat fig 6 over all eight growing seasons the average net photosynthetic rates were 10 9 and 6 3 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively p 0 05 in the heading stage after the first irrigation the net photosynthetic rates during dry years were 12 8 and 2 3 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively as well as 12 5 and 8 1 higher during normal years and 10 6 and 7 7 higher during wet years p 0 05 similar results were obtained in the filling stage after the second irrigation where the net photosynthetic rate was significantly improved by 14 6 and 8 1 in dry years 11 0 and 3 6 in normal years and 7 7 and 5 6 in wet years under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 p 0 05 3 4 accumulated dry matter over all eight growing seasons the average accumulated dry matter amounts of ri1 significantly increased by 4 0 5 0 and 4 3 compared with bi1 in dry normal and wet years respectively p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between ri2 and bi2 fig 7 the accumulated dry matter amounts were 6 7 12 9 and 10 6 higher under ri1 than bi1 in dry normal and wet years respectively and 5 6 5 4 and 8 7 higher under ri2 compared with bi2 however the increases in the accumulated dry matter gradually declined as the growth period advanced and irrigation was applied 3 5 yield yield components crys wue and iwue during dry wet and normal years the grain yield did not differ significantly under ri compared with the corresponding bi treatments ri1 vs bi1 and ri2 vs bi2 although irrigation rate applied was 50 lower under ri table 3 in particular the grain yields were 3 3 2 4 and 2 8 higher under ri1 than bi1 during dry normal and wet years respectively however the yields were 6 3 4 1 and 3 2 lower under ri2 than bi2 during dry normal and wet years respectively p 0 05 thus ri had a greater effect on the yield during dry years it should be noted that ri reduced the spike numbers per hectare ri1 by 6 4 and ri2 by 8 8 on average but significantly increased the 1000 grain weights p 0 05 ri1 by 7 0 and ri2 by 2 3 on average and there were no significant differences in the kernel number per spike in comparison with the corresponding bi treatments table 3 ri tended to maintain the yield compared with bi according to the stable crys values which varied around one as the precipitation increased during the growing season fig 8 the yield was slightly higher under ri when irrigation was applied once crys 1 where the crys values were 1 03 1 02 and 1 03 during dry normal and wet years respectively the yield was slightly lower under ri when irrigation was applied twice crys 1 where the crys values were 0 94 0 96 and 0 97 during dry normal and wet years respectively thus ri effectively maintained the yield regardless of the annual precipitation distribution in general ri1 significantly increased wue and iwue by 6 7 14 6 average 10 1 and 102 8 109 2 average 105 5 compared with bi1 respectively while ri2 significantly increased wue and iwue by 1 1 17 6 average 7 8 and 86 5 95 9 average 92 0 compared with bi2 respectively p 0 05 table 3 in particular the wue values were 13 4 and 12 6 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 during dry years respectively and 9 1 and 8 9 higher during normal years p 0 05 during wet years wue was 8 7 higher under ri1 than bi1 but wue was only significantly higher under ri2 than bi2 during 2014 2015 p 0 05 and the average wue over the four wet years was 5 1 higher the correlation between the grain yield and total et was significant among the winter wheat growing seasons r 2 0 8 fig 9 the fitted quadratic polynomial equations were characterized as parabolas with an inverted u shape when the yield was 5000 kg ha 1 the et rates were 36 3 mm and 46 1 mm lower under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively when the yield was 6000 kg ha 1 the et rates were 46 6 mm and 37 8 mm lower under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively when the yield was 7000 kg ha 1 et was 14 7 mm lower under ri2 compared with bi2 the yield could not reach 7000 kg ha 1 under ri1 and bi1 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture rfrh is considered one of the most effective methods for improving the sws capacity and reducing evaporation from the soil zhang et al 2009 in addition rfrh is capable of prolonging the crop water validity period by increasing the sws which is beneficial for improving the crop yield and wue according to the present study the rfrh system combined with supplementary irrigation obtained a significantly greater water storage capacity in the soil during the early winter wheat growth stages compared with the bi treatments fig 3 intense evaporation from the soil occurs in semiarid areas during the spring and winter and rfrh reduces the evaporation by mulching as well as improving the wue jia et al 2018b in this study the water supply was dependent on precipitation and irrigation rfrh is highly effective at collecting precipitation even trace and light amounts of precipitation but it also increases the deep infiltration of precipitation and ridge mulching can reduce soil water evaporation thereby maximizing the use of precipitation resources ali et al 2016 li et al 2016 in addition the alternate ridges and furrows in the field provide a buffer against heavy precipitation to reduce surface runoff which helps to prevent the loss of precipitation and the precipitation use efficiency is improved mo et al 2017 however irrigation leads to large variations in the soil moisture in the upper 60 cm layer of the soil interestingly there was no significant difference in the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer under the two irrigation methods after the first application of irrigation even though irrigation rate applied was 50 lower under ri compared with bi fig 3 which was probably due to the reduced irrigation rate in the ri system enhancing rapid water infiltration and reducing evaporation moreover under ri irrigation was applied only in the furrows and the mulch on the ridge effectively suppressed evaporation thereby helping to retain water wu et al 2015 the actual sources of water consumption in wheat fields include soil water storage precipitation and irrigation we found that the 8 year average sws increased by 4 0 and 4 3 under ri1 and ri2 respectively at the regreening jointing stage but decreased by 2 6 and 6 6 respectively at the heading maturity stage compared with the corresponding bi treatments 0 200 cm soil layer fig 3 the differences in residual water and irrigation rate in the soil suggest that there may have been differences in water consumption between ri and bi these differences may be explained by the mulch covering the surface of the ridges in the ri system reducing the water exchange between the soil and the atmosphere thereby inhibiting evaporation and helping to retain the soil moisture especially in the early crop growth stages when soil evaporation is a major component of et zhang et al 2019b however the rapid growth of the crop canopy in the late stages under ri resulted in greater plant transpiration which might have offset the increase in the soil moisture due to the suppression of evaporation li et al 2017 in addition ri reduced the total et throughout the growing season compared with bi fig 5 as also found in a previous study ali et al 2019 it should be noted that the distribution of the root system is closely related to the absorption and utilization of soil water rfrh promotes the extension of the root system into deeper soil layers to allow the consumption of deep soil water in the later growth stage jia et al 2018a in maize nosalewicz and lipiec 2014 in deeper soils more water is extracted during grain filling when the root length is greater which facilitates yield formation wasson et al 2012 moreover the differences in soil moisture under different irrigation methods may have been related to the ability of the root system to penetrate deeper soil layers li et al 2010 a few days after irrigation the upper layer of the soil becomes dry and there is a water potential gradient between the upper layer and the deeper wet layers the excellent moisture retention in the early stages of ri resulted in a greater water potential gradient than bi at night transpiration decreases and deep soil water is transferred to the upper layer through hydraulic lift by the root system which is beneficial for improving the utilization of deep soil water wan et al 2000 as a consequence sws was significantly lower in the deeper soil 60 200 cm soil layer from heading until maturity under ri compared with bi fig 3 the water use in these stages promotes conversion into grain because vegetative growth is over and all of the photosynthate is used for grain formation wasson et al 2012 furthermore the loss of moisture from the soil due to deep drainage was not observed in our study in addition due to the strong effect of the monsoon climate on this region the precipitation is mainly concentrated from july to september winter wheat fallow period adequate precipitation in the fallow period recharges the soil water and moisture is restored to the previous level before sowing in the next season dong et al 2019 turner et al 2011 4 2 photosynthetic characteristics and accumulated dry matter photosynthesis is the main factor that affects the accumulated dry matter and yield formation and thus it is the basis of plant production according to the results obtained in the present study ri enhanced the photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaves thereby leading to increases in the post flowering source sink ratio borrás et al 2004 the accumulation of photosynthetic products and the 1000 grain weight compared with bi during dry normal and wet years this facilitative effect may have occurred because ri improved the soil moisture and temperature conditions in the root domain as well as the aboveground ventilation and light penetration to effectively enhance physiological processes mo et al 2017 however wheat is a tillering crop and although the sowing rates were the same under ri2 and bi2 ri2 was only sown in the furrows and the number of tillers per plant was lower than that under bi2 data not shown in this manuscript which may have reduced the number of spikes per unit area available for yield formation to some extent the difference in the kernel number per spike was not significant between ri2 and bi2 table 3 therefore the difference in the number of spikes per unit area may have been related to the enhanced photosynthesis but slightly lower yield under ri2 compared with bi2 a previous study conducted in a semiarid region showed that crop photosynthesis was closely related to the soil moisture hou et al 2015 abscisic acid plays a regulatory role in crop transpiration and stomatal opening and closing including osmoregulation and morphological regulation such as the leaf size stomatal density and stomatal size negin and moshelion 2016 abscisic acid controls reductions in the stomatal density and stomatal narrowing in crops under mild water deficit conditions which may even lead to stomatal closure ashraf and harris 2013 liu et al 2005 however in a c3 plant such as wheat the co2 assimilation rate may be reduced by stomatal closure but a similar electron transfer rate can be maintained to that in unaffected leaves because of the water cycle and increased photorespiration under mild water deficit conditions baker and rosenqvist 2004 indeed photosynthesis is less sensitive to a soil water deficit than stomatal conductance and a high photosynthetic rate may still be maintained under moderate drought conditions zhang et al 2019b which explains the lower sws fig 3 but higher photosynthetic rate fig 6 in the heading and filling stage under ri compared with bi in the present study photosynthetic metabolism will be inhibited under excessive water deficit conditions and a decline in the photosynthetic potential occurs thereby slowing down the transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate baker and rosenqvist 2004 rouhi et al 2007 in the present study the accumulated dry matter was higher in the jointing and heading stages under ri compared with bi and it remained higher until maturity under ri1 fig 7 the higher accumulated dry matter content was mainly attributed to the reduced soil water evaporation more efficient use of small amounts of precipitation and enhanced crop growth under ri gu et al 2017 in particular ri provided an adequate water supply during the jointing and heading stages which facilitated the growth and development of winter wheat and thus the accumulated dry matter was higher than that under bi li et al 2016 furthermore ri enhanced photosynthesis and the accumulation of dry matter by effectively improving the soil water distribution and promoting the growth of roots to absorb water and nutrients from the deeper soil as well as increasing plant transpiration zhang et al 2019a however the accumulated dry matter was slightly lower under ri2 than bi2 after the second application of irrigation in normal and wet years fig 7 possibly because of the positive correlation between crop water use and the accumulated dry matter ali et al 2019 sufficient water for wheat growth was provided in normal and wet years under bi2 due to the abundant precipitation and the application of double irrigation rate compared with ri2 led to the increased accumulated dry matter content 4 3 yield and wue the development of irrigation systems that conserve water maintain economic yields and increase the wue is essential for improved wheat production in the present study irrigation rate under ri was half of that under bi but the yield was 93 3 104 6 of that under bi while wue and iwue were 1 1 17 6 and 86 5 109 2 higher respectively table 3 ri effectively increased the grain filling rate and extended the grain filling period ali et al 2019 thereby increasing the 1000 grain weight table 3 which made a positive contribution to the yield in addition ri effectively increased the availability of nutrients in the wheat root zone the fertilizer was spread evenly only in the planting area comprising the furrows where the moisture status was also better especially in the early growth stage the absorption of nutrients by crops is effectively facilitated by the greater availability of moisture in the ri system li et al 2009 which contributes to crop growth yield formation and increased water and fertilizer use efficiency moreover the efficient use of precipitation resources can determine the stability of the winter wheat yield in semiarid regions macholdt et al 2021 rfrh reduces ineffective soil evaporation through mulching and allows the production of a larger canopy during the vegetative growth period to enhance the precipitation use efficiency by effective precipitation harvesting ali et al 2016 in addition the crop yield and wue are influenced by the soil moisture status frequency of irrigation and irrigation method jia et al 2018b kang et al 2002 wang 2017 rfrh makes more effective use of irrigation water and precipitation by changing the surface microtopography which facilitates the growth and downward extension of roots to enhance the uptake of water and nutrients and greater crop transpiration increases the wue li et al 2016 furthermore the jointing stage is a critical stage for vegetative growth and canopy formation by winter wheat and any water deficit in this stage will severely affect the yield li et al 2010 ri ensures that the water supply is adequate during this period because it increases the capacity to store water and retain moisture especially in dry and normal years fig 3 moreover ri can optimize the spatial and temporal utilization of water to improve the wue yang et al 2021 in a previous study of bi a single application of irrigation in the jointing stage bi1 was effective for increasing the yield and wue xu et al 2016 according to the present study ri1 with half of irrigation rate obtained a higher yield and wue compared with bi1 and thus ri1 was a more effective irrigation strategy applying irrigation twice obtained a higher yield but consumed double irrigation water 5 conclusions in the present study the results of an 8 year field experiment showed that compared with border irrigation rfrh combined with supplementary irrigation ri used 50 less irrigation water but it optimized the spatial and temporal patterns of water use thereby increasing wue and iwue by 1 1 17 6 and 86 5 109 2 respectively moreover ri enhanced the photosynthetic activity of winter wheat and maintained the yield 93 3 104 6 of that under border irrigation however it should be noted that the positive effect was regulated by the precipitation conditions and it may decrease with increasing precipitation therefore ri could be applied as an effective technique to significantly reduce the consumption of irrigation water in semiarid and semi humid areas declaration of competing

9825,the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system has been adopted widely to improve and stabilize the productivity of dryland crops in order to significantly reduce irrigation rate applied to fields an 8 year 2012 2020 in situ field experiment that rfrh combined with supplemental irrigation ri of winter wheat was conducted in the semiarid region of northwest china border irrigation bi was used as the control under ri and bi irrigation was applied only once jointing heading stage or twice jointing heading and heading flowering stage in separate trials irrigation rates applied each time under ri and bi were 37 5 mm 50 of that under bi and 75 0 mm respectively the results indicated that compared with bi ri significantly increased the soil water storage in the early growth stage net photosynthetic rate water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency and decreased the evapotranspiration in years with different precipitation distributions when irrigation was applied once ri increased wue by 13 4 9 1 and 8 7 compared with bi in dry normal and wet years respectively when irrigation was applied twice ri increased wue by 12 6 8 9 and 5 1 compared with bi in dry normal and wet years respectively compared with bi ri required 50 less irrigation water but it increased the grain yield by 3 3 2 4 and 2 8 with once application in dry normal and wet years respectively and decreased it by 6 3 4 1 and 3 2 when applied twice p 0 05 ri effectively maintained the yield and there was no significant difference compared with the yield under bi therefore ri could be applied as a technique for significantly reducing irrigation rate consumed in semiarid and semi humid areas keywords precipitation distribution ridge furrow mulching system border irrigation water use efficiency wheat yield semiarid areas 1 introduction climate change and water scarcity are important factors that affect agricultural production eck et al 2020 piao et al 2010 wu and ma 2018 semiarid and arid regions with abundant solar and thermal resources comprise 41 of the global land area and there is great potential for increasing grain production in these regions reynolds et al 2007 however precipitation is scarce with uneven spatial and temporal distributions in these regions and thus the potential for increasing crop yields is quite limited when dependent on precipitation alone gan et al 2013 mueller et al 2012 wei et al 2018 therefore providing irrigation in the critical growing stage is beneficial for enhancing the potential crop yield iqbal et al 2014 in addition many climate modeling studies indicate that dryland farming is more vulnerable to climate change than irrigated farming piao et al 2010 in order to address the lack of water available for irrigation in semiarid areas rainwater collection techniques have been developed to store water and water conservation facilities have improved to facilitate the irrigation of farmland ren et al 2010 however about 97 of the irrigation applied to farmland in these areas is still delivered using the traditional border irrigation bi method which consumes large amounts of water ali et al 2019 the utilization of irrigation water is inefficient with bi because of the high evapotranspiration et in semiarid areas qi et al 2015 moreover the water resources available for irrigating farmland at risk of drought stress are increasingly scarce due to frequent inter annual and seasonal fluctuations in precipitation and deepening of the groundwater level thus in order to achieve sustainable agricultural development there is an urgent need to develop water saving cultivation techniques that reduce the consumption of water for irrigation as well as increasing the water use efficiency wue to produce high and stable yields that are comparable to those without reduced irrigation gao et al 2017 memon et al 2021 sadras and angus 2006 water saving agricultural techniques are based on the efficient use of precipitation resources and reducing the water applied for irrigation by employing a variety of scientifically evaluated methods such as plastic film mulching straw mulching and drip and sprinkler irrigation in particular the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system one of the plastic film mulching is widely used in semiarid regions which involves the construction of alternating furrows and ridges and covering the ridges with plastic film to collect rainwater li et al 2020 ren et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 furthermore the collected rainwater is retained effectively near the crop root zone which is more conducive to water absorption by crops thereby improving the precipitation utilization efficiency such as by minimizing the surface runoff during heavy and intense precipitation and promoting the penetration of rainwater into deeper soil layers after light precipitation li and gong 2002 a previous study found that the soil moisture content at a depth of 0 75 m was 42 higher under the rfrh system than the conventional flat cropping system after 27 5 mm of precipitation gan et al 2013 the efficient utilization of precipitation resources and reduced ineffective evaporation due to ridge mulching can prolong the crop water availability period and thus rfrh combined with supplementary irrigation ri might facilitate the reduced usage of irrigation water li et al 2016 wu et al 2015 rfrh has been shown to significantly improve the crop yield and wue but its effects depend greatly on the precipitation characteristics el sadek and salem 2015 ren et al 2016 few studies have considered the application of ri and it is still not clear whether ri can improve the wue and maintain yields while significantly reducing supplementary irrigation rate compared with bi therefore in the present study conducted during 2012 2020 ri was tested by using 50 of irrigation rate compared with bi in winter wheat fields in a typical semiarid region of northwest china this study had the following objectives 1 to determine whether ri could optimize the spatial and temporal soil moisture distributions in dry normal and wet years 2 to compare the differences in winter wheat growth and the photosynthetic characteristics under ri and bi during years with different precipitation distributions and 3 to characterize the general mechanism that allows ri to maintain yields and improve the wue in semiarid areas with uncertain precipitation distributions the results obtained in this study suggest that this new technique may be suitable for saving water and maintaining the winter wheat yield in china and possibly other semiarid and semi humid areas throughout the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were

management a randomized complete block design was applied in this study the field study tested two irrigation methods the rfrh system combined with supplementary irrigation ri fig 2a and c and border irrigation bi fig 2b and d for each irrigation method trials were conducted with irrigation applied once and irrigation applied twice thus the following four treatments were tested 1 ri1 ri with irrigation once 2 bi1 bi with irrigation once 3 ri2 ri with irrigation twice and 4 bi2 bi with irrigation twice three replicates were conducted for each treatment in total there were 12 plots 4 treatments 3 replicates 12 plots and each had an area of 60 m2 10 6 m alternate ridges 60 cm wide and 15 cm high and furrows 60 cm wide were constructed for ri according to the experimental design the ridges were covered with plastic film 0 008 mm thick four rows of winter wheat were planted in the furrow fig 2a and c and irrigation was applied in the furrow under bi each plot was divided evenly into four parts to allow uniform irrigation each part was 5 m long and 3 m wide and irrigation was applied evenly in each part fig 2d using the equation etc et 0 kc irrigation rate was calculated based on the crop coefficients kc and the reference evapotranspiration et 0 calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 irrigation rates applied each time under ri and bi were 37 5 mm 50 of that under bi and 75 0 mm respectively according to the local precipitation distribution irrigation was applied during the jointing heading stage for winter wheat under ri1 and bi1 and during the jointing heading stage and heading flowering stage for winter wheat under ri2 and bi2 table 2 a 1 2 m wide space was kept clear between the plots to eliminate the effects of surface runoff and water seepage a pump connected to a water meter accurate to 0 001 m3 ningbo science student instrument technology co ltd zhejiang china was used to precisely control irrigation rate the field was prepared 10 days before sowing and ridge mulching was applied for the ri1 and ri2 treatments all plots received fertilizer comprising 180 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 urea and diammonium phosphate were employed as np fertilizer which was spread evenly in the furrows for ri1 and ri2 and on the surface for bi1 and bi2 before plowing into the 0 20 cm soil layer seeds of winter wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar longjian 301 were sown at a rate of 190 kg seed ha 1 with an inter row distance of 20 cm between september 15 and 25 during 2012 2020 table 2 pests diseases and weeds were controlled in a timely manner according to the standard local practices crops were harvested between 29 june and 10 july table 2 after harvesting the film was completely removed and recycled and the field was plowed immediately to avoid any other effects on soil and water conservation during the fallow period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water storage sws the soil gravimetric water content swc was recorded at 20 cm intervals in the 0 200 cm layer at different stages using a hand held soil ferric auger diameter 54 mm in this study the swc was measured in the seedling regreening jointing heading filling and maturity growth stages during october 1 29 march 25 31 april 15 20 may 11 20 june 12 20 and june 29 to july 11 respectively in the ri treatments the swc was determined as

where i mm is the total irrigation p mm is the precipitation r mm is the runoff d mm is the deep drainage and δsws is the change in sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile in this experiment r and d were considered negligible zero the experimental field was flat so runoff was never observed the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 80 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible the drainage was assumed to be insignificant over a depth of 200 cm 2 3 3 photosynthetic parameters the photosynthetic characteristics of the flag leaves were measured in the winter wheat heading stage after the first irrigation and filling stage after the second irrigation using a li 6400 system li cor inc lincoln ne usa between 9 00 and 11 00 local time on sunny days five random replicates were measured for each treatment in addition the side rows and middle rows were measured separately for both ri treatments and the mean values were used as representative of each treatment 2 3 4 accumulated dry matter to determine the accumulated dry matter two 0 5 m long rows one from the side row and one from the middle row in the ri treatments were randomly selected from each plot in the regreening jointing heading filling and maturity stages the plant samples were oven dried at 105 c for 0 5 h and then at 75 c for 24 h 2 3 5 yield and yield components and coefficient of relative

evaluated using bi as a control the ratio of the yield under ri treatments relative to that under the corresponding bi treatments was used to define crys which was calculated with eq 4 4 crys y ri y bi where y ri kg ha 1 and y bi kg ha 1 are the grain yields under the ri and bi treatments ri1 vs bi1 and ri2 vs bi2 respectively relative to ri the yield increased when crys 1 and the yield decreased

post hoc tests fisher s least significant difference test p 0 05 were conducted to compare the mean differences among treatments the relationship between the yield and еt was evaluated using regression analysis all figures were prepared using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 sws in 0 60 and 60 200 cm soil layers in the 0 60 cm soil layer the sws was significantly increased under ri from the regreening to jointing stage when not irrigated compared with the corresponding bi treatment p 0 05 fig 3 in particular the sws values were 13 3 and 12 5 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with those under bi1 and bi2 in dry years respectively as well as 5 9 and 6 3 higher in normal years and 3 7 and 2 8 higher in wet years however there were no significant differences in sws between the ri and bi treatments during the heading stage after the first irrigation among the three rainfall types different trends were observed during the filling maturity stage after the second irrigation under the three rainfall types specifically the sws values were 3 2 and 6 4 lower under ri1 and ri2 in dry years but there were no significant differences in ri and bi in normal years and ri2 was 7 1 lower compared with bi2 in wet years in the 60 200 cm soil layer the sws values during the seedling to jointing stage were 2 8 and 3 7 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 in dry years respectively as well as 2 1 and 2 5 higher in normal years and 3 6 and 3 5 higher in wet years p 0 05 fig 3 by contrast the sws values were significantly lower under the ri treatments than the corresponding bi treatments after the heading stage in particular from the heading to maturity stage the average sws values were 4 4 3 7 and 4 3 lower under ri1 compared with bi during the dry normal and wet years respectively the sws values were 5 0 6 4 and 9 6 lower under ri2 compared with bi2 during the dry normal and wet years respectively p 0 05 in semiarid areas precipitation during the fallow period was critical for restoring the soil moisture and it accounted for 38 65 of the annual precipitation in the present study table 1 the sws values in the 0 200 cm soil layer differed significantly under the four treatments during the winter wheat maturity stage in the following order bi2 ri2 bi1 ri1 p 0 05 fig 4 however sws clearly increased during the fallow period and recovered to a high level and thus there were no significant differences among the four treatments after abundant precipitation for more than two months during the summer fallow period 3 2 et throughout the growing season the average et rates in the 0 200 cm layer were 6 7 and 11 7 lower under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively p 0 05 fig 5 in particular the et rates were 10 0 6 6 and 5 8 lower under ri1 than bi1 during the dry normal and wet years respectively similarly the et rates were 19 8 13 6 and 8 5 lower under ri2 compared with bi2 during the dry normal and wet years respectively during dry years et was mainly lower from the sowing to heading stage under ri1 compared with bi1 but it was significantly lower in all stages under ri2 compared with bi2 however during normal and wet years et was mainly lower from the sowing to filling stage under ri1 compared with bi1 and et was significantly lower under ri2 compared with bi2 during each growth stage except for the jointing heading stage in normal years and the regreening jointing stage in wet years 3 3 photosynthetic characteristics compared with the corresponding bi treatments ri significantly promoted stomatal opening which enhanced the photosynthetic and transpiration rates in winter wheat fig 6 over all eight growing seasons the average net photosynthetic rates were 10 9 and 6 3 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively p 0 05 in the heading stage after the first irrigation the net photosynthetic rates during dry years were 12 8 and 2 3 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively as well as 12 5 and 8 1 higher during normal years and 10 6 and 7 7 higher during wet years p 0 05 similar results were obtained in the filling stage after the second irrigation where the net photosynthetic rate was significantly improved by 14 6 and 8 1 in dry years 11 0 and 3 6 in normal years and 7 7 and 5 6 in wet years under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 p 0 05 3 4 accumulated dry matter over all eight growing seasons the average accumulated dry matter amounts of ri1 significantly increased by 4 0 5 0 and 4 3 compared with bi1 in dry normal and wet years respectively p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between ri2 and bi2 fig 7 the accumulated dry matter amounts were 6 7 12 9 and 10 6 higher under ri1 than bi1 in dry normal and wet years respectively and 5 6 5 4 and 8 7 higher under ri2 compared with bi2 however the increases in the accumulated dry matter gradually declined as the growth period advanced and irrigation was applied 3 5 yield yield components crys wue and iwue during dry wet and normal years the grain yield did not differ significantly under ri compared with the corresponding bi treatments ri1 vs bi1 and ri2 vs bi2 although irrigation rate applied was 50 lower under ri table 3 in particular the grain yields were 3 3 2 4 and 2 8 higher under ri1 than bi1 during dry normal and wet years respectively however the yields were 6 3 4 1 and 3 2 lower under ri2 than bi2 during dry normal and wet years respectively p 0 05 thus ri had a greater effect on the yield during dry years it should be noted that ri reduced the spike numbers per hectare ri1 by 6 4 and ri2 by 8 8 on average but significantly increased the 1000 grain weights p 0 05 ri1 by 7 0 and ri2 by 2 3 on average and there were no significant differences in the kernel number per spike in comparison with the corresponding bi treatments table 3 ri tended to maintain the yield compared with bi according to the stable crys values which varied around one as the precipitation increased during the growing season fig 8 the yield was slightly higher under ri when irrigation was applied once crys 1 where the crys values were 1 03 1 02 and 1 03 during dry normal and wet years respectively the yield was slightly lower under ri when irrigation was applied twice crys 1 where the crys values were 0 94 0 96 and 0 97 during dry normal and wet years respectively thus ri effectively maintained the yield regardless of the annual precipitation distribution in general ri1 significantly increased wue and iwue by 6 7 14 6 average 10 1 and 102 8 109 2 average 105 5 compared with bi1 respectively while ri2 significantly increased wue and iwue by 1 1 17 6 average 7 8 and 86 5 95 9 average 92 0 compared with bi2 respectively p 0 05 table 3 in particular the wue values were 13 4 and 12 6 higher under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 during dry years respectively and 9 1 and 8 9 higher during normal years p 0 05 during wet years wue was 8 7 higher under ri1 than bi1 but wue was only significantly higher under ri2 than bi2 during 2014 2015 p 0 05 and the average wue over the four wet years was 5 1 higher the correlation between the grain yield and total et was significant among the winter wheat growing seasons r 2 0 8 fig 9 the fitted quadratic polynomial equations were characterized as parabolas with an inverted u shape when the yield was 5000 kg ha 1 the et rates were 36 3 mm and 46 1 mm lower under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively when the yield was 6000 kg ha 1 the et rates were 46 6 mm and 37 8 mm lower under ri1 and ri2 compared with bi1 and bi2 respectively when the yield was 7000 kg ha 1 et was 14 7 mm lower under ri2 compared with bi2 the yield could not reach 7000 kg ha 1 under ri1 and bi1 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture rfrh is considered one of the most effective methods for improving the sws capacity and reducing evaporation from the soil zhang et al 2009 in addition rfrh is capable of prolonging the crop water validity period by increasing the sws which is beneficial for improving the crop yield and wue according to the present study the rfrh system combined with supplementary irrigation obtained a significantly greater water storage capacity in the soil during the early winter wheat growth stages compared with the bi treatments fig 3 intense evaporation from the soil occurs in semiarid areas during the spring and winter and rfrh reduces the evaporation by mulching as well as improving the wue jia et al 2018b in this study the water supply was dependent on precipitation and irrigation rfrh is highly effective at collecting precipitation even trace and light amounts of precipitation but it also increases the deep infiltration of precipitation and ridge mulching can reduce soil water evaporation thereby maximizing the use of precipitation resources ali et al 2016 li et al 2016 in addition the alternate ridges and furrows in the field provide a buffer against heavy precipitation to reduce surface runoff which helps to prevent the loss of precipitation and the precipitation use efficiency is improved mo et al 2017 however irrigation leads to large variations in the soil moisture in the upper 60 cm layer of the soil interestingly there was no significant difference in the sws in the 0 60 cm soil layer under the two irrigation methods after the first application of irrigation even though irrigation rate applied was 50 lower under ri compared with bi fig 3 which was probably due to the reduced irrigation rate in the ri system enhancing rapid water infiltration and reducing evaporation moreover under ri irrigation was applied only in the furrows and the mulch on the ridge effectively suppressed evaporation thereby helping to retain water wu et al 2015 the actual sources of water consumption in wheat fields include soil water storage precipitation and irrigation we found that the 8 year average sws increased by 4 0 and 4 3 under ri1 and ri2 respectively at the regreening jointing stage but decreased by 2 6 and 6 6 respectively at the heading maturity stage compared with the corresponding bi treatments 0 200 cm soil layer fig 3 the differences in residual water and irrigation rate in the soil suggest that there may have been differences in water consumption between ri and bi these differences may be explained by the mulch covering the surface of the ridges in the ri system reducing the water exchange between the soil and the atmosphere thereby inhibiting evaporation and helping to retain the soil moisture especially in the early crop growth stages when soil evaporation is a major component of et zhang et al 2019b however the rapid growth of the crop canopy in the late stages under ri resulted in greater plant transpiration which might have offset the increase in the soil moisture due to the suppression of evaporation li et al 2017 in addition ri reduced the total et throughout the growing season compared with bi fig 5 as also found in a previous study ali et al 2019 it should be noted that the distribution of the root system is closely related to the absorption and utilization of soil water rfrh promotes the extension of the root system into deeper soil layers to allow the consumption of deep soil water in the later growth stage jia et al 2018a in maize nosalewicz and lipiec 2014 in deeper soils more water is extracted during grain filling when the root length is greater which facilitates yield formation wasson et al 2012 moreover the differences in soil moisture under different irrigation methods may have been related to the ability of the root system to penetrate deeper soil layers li et al 2010 a few days after irrigation the upper layer of the soil becomes dry and there is a water potential gradient between the upper layer and the deeper wet layers the excellent moisture retention in the early stages of ri resulted in a greater water potential gradient than bi at night transpiration decreases and deep soil water is transferred to the upper layer through hydraulic lift by the root system which is beneficial for improving the utilization of deep soil water wan et al 2000 as a consequence sws was significantly lower in the deeper soil 60 200 cm soil layer from heading until maturity under ri compared with bi fig 3 the water use in these stages promotes conversion into grain because vegetative growth is over and all of the photosynthate is used for grain formation wasson et al 2012 furthermore the loss of moisture from the soil due to deep drainage was not observed in our study in addition due to the strong effect of the monsoon climate on this region the precipitation is mainly concentrated from july to september winter wheat fallow period adequate precipitation in the fallow period recharges the soil water and moisture is restored to the previous level before sowing in the next season dong et al 2019 turner et al 2011 4 2 photosynthetic characteristics and accumulated dry matter photosynthesis is the main factor that affects the accumulated dry matter and yield formation and thus it is the basis of plant production according to the results obtained in the present study ri enhanced the photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaves thereby leading to increases in the post flowering source sink ratio borrás et al 2004 the accumulation of photosynthetic products and the 1000 grain weight compared with bi during dry normal and wet years this facilitative effect may have occurred because ri improved the soil moisture and temperature conditions in the root domain as well as the aboveground ventilation and light penetration to effectively enhance physiological processes mo et al 2017 however wheat is a tillering crop and although the sowing rates were the same under ri2 and bi2 ri2 was only sown in the furrows and the number of tillers per plant was lower than that under bi2 data not shown in this manuscript which may have reduced the number of spikes per unit area available for yield formation to some extent the difference in the kernel number per spike was not significant between ri2 and bi2 table 3 therefore the difference in the number of spikes per unit area may have been related to the enhanced photosynthesis but slightly lower yield under ri2 compared with bi2 a previous study conducted in a semiarid region showed that crop photosynthesis was closely related to the soil moisture hou et al 2015 abscisic acid plays a regulatory role in crop transpiration and stomatal opening and closing including osmoregulation and morphological regulation such as the leaf size stomatal density and stomatal size negin and moshelion 2016 abscisic acid controls reductions in the stomatal density and stomatal narrowing in crops under mild water deficit conditions which may even lead to stomatal closure ashraf and harris 2013 liu et al 2005 however in a c3 plant such as wheat the co2 assimilation rate may be reduced by stomatal closure but a similar electron transfer rate can be maintained to that in unaffected leaves because of the water cycle and increased photorespiration under mild water deficit conditions baker and rosenqvist 2004 indeed photosynthesis is less sensitive to a soil water deficit than stomatal conductance and a high photosynthetic rate may still be maintained under moderate drought conditions zhang et al 2019b which explains the lower sws fig 3 but higher photosynthetic rate fig 6 in the heading and filling stage under ri compared with bi in the present study photosynthetic metabolism will be inhibited under excessive water deficit conditions and a decline in the photosynthetic potential occurs thereby slowing down the transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate baker and rosenqvist 2004 rouhi et al 2007 in the present study the accumulated dry matter was higher in the jointing and heading stages under ri compared with bi and it remained higher until maturity under ri1 fig 7 the higher accumulated dry matter content was mainly attributed to the reduced soil water evaporation more efficient use of small amounts of precipitation and enhanced crop growth under ri gu et al 2017 in particular ri provided an adequate water supply during the jointing and heading stages which facilitated the growth and development of winter wheat and thus the accumulated dry matter was higher than that under bi li et al 2016 furthermore ri enhanced photosynthesis and the accumulation of dry matter by effectively improving the soil water distribution and promoting the growth of roots to absorb water and nutrients from the deeper soil as well as increasing plant transpiration zhang et al 2019a however the accumulated dry matter was slightly lower under ri2 than bi2 after the second application of irrigation in normal and wet years fig 7 possibly because of the positive correlation between crop water use and the accumulated dry matter ali et al 2019 sufficient water for wheat growth was provided in normal and wet years under bi2 due to the abundant precipitation and the application of double irrigation rate compared with ri2 led to the increased accumulated dry matter content 4 3 yield and wue the development of irrigation systems that conserve water maintain economic yields and increase the wue is essential for improved wheat production in the present study irrigation rate under ri was half of that under bi but the yield was 93 3 104 6 of that under bi while wue and iwue were 1 1 17 6 and 86 5 109 2 higher respectively table 3 ri effectively increased the grain filling rate and extended the grain filling period ali et al 2019 thereby increasing the 1000 grain weight table 3 which made a positive contribution to the yield in addition ri effectively increased the availability of nutrients in the wheat root zone the fertilizer was spread evenly only in the planting area comprising the furrows where the moisture status was also better especially in the early growth stage the absorption of nutrients by crops is effectively facilitated by the greater availability of moisture in the ri system li et al 2009 which contributes to crop growth yield formation and increased water and fertilizer use efficiency moreover the efficient use of precipitation resources can determine the stability of the winter wheat yield in semiarid regions macholdt et al 2021 rfrh reduces ineffective soil evaporation through mulching and allows the production of a larger canopy during the vegetative growth period to enhance the precipitation use efficiency by effective precipitation harvesting ali et al 2016 in addition the crop yield and wue are influenced by the soil moisture status frequency of irrigation and irrigation method jia et al 2018b kang et al 2002 wang 2017 rfrh makes more effective use of irrigation water and precipitation by changing the surface microtopography which facilitates the growth and downward extension of roots to enhance the uptake of water and nutrients and greater crop transpiration increases the wue li et al 2016 furthermore the jointing stage is a critical stage for vegetative growth and canopy formation by winter wheat and any water deficit in this stage will severely affect the yield li et al 2010 ri ensures that the water supply is adequate during this period because it increases the capacity to store water and retain moisture especially in dry and normal years fig 3 moreover ri can optimize the spatial and temporal utilization of water to improve the wue yang et al 2021 in a previous study of bi a single application of irrigation in the jointing stage bi1 was effective for increasing the yield and wue xu et al 2016 according to the present study ri1 with half of irrigation rate obtained a higher yield and wue compared with bi1 and thus ri1 was a more effective irrigation strategy applying irrigation twice obtained a higher yield but consumed double irrigation water 5 conclusions in the present study the results of an 8 year field experiment showed that compared with border irrigation rfrh combined with supplementary irrigation ri used 50 less irrigation water but it optimized the spatial and temporal patterns of water use thereby increasing wue and iwue by 1 1 17 6 and 86 5 109 2 respectively moreover ri enhanced the photosynthetic activity of winter wheat and maintained the yield 93 3 104 6 of that under border irrigation however it should be noted that the positive effect was regulated by the precipitation conditions and it may decrease with increasing precipitation therefore ri could be applied as an effective technique to significantly reduce the consumption of irrigation water in semiarid and semi humid areas declaration of competing

9826,the guanzhong plain is a critical food production area in the yellow river basin that frequently suffers from water shortages in this study long term june 2013 to june 2018 water and energy fluxes were observed and path analysis was conducted over an irrigated winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l rotation field to identify the controlling factors of evapotranspiration et total et for each crop year ranged from 627 to 775 mm with an average growing season et of 398 mm for wheat and 310 mm for maize there is significant seasonal variation in both et and surface conductance gs daily et varied from 0 0 to 6 0 mm d 1 for wheat and 0 0 to 6 7 mm d 1 for maize the peak daily values of gs were 29 5 mm s 1 for wheat and 19 5 mm s 1 for maize the direct and indirect effects of environmental and biological factors net radiation rn surface conductance gs saturation vapor pressure deficit vpd leaf area index lai air temperature tair and volumetric soil water content vwc on et were calculated using the path analysis method rn was determined to be the primary controlling factor of et for both the summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons also gs was found to be another controlling factor that has more controlling power in the summer maize growing season than in the winter wheat season vpd had a significant positive and direct effect on et for both of the crop seasons while it had a significant negative and indirect effect on et through gs in the summer maize season vwc and tair only directly affected the wheat et in addition vwc had two significant paths that can indirectly affect et through lai and gs the revealed seasonal patterns and controlling factors of evapotranspiration in this agroecosystem provide a theoretical basis for optimizing water resources management of the yellow river keywords evapotranspiration eddy covariance canopy conductance controlling factors guanzhong plain data availability the tower based ec measurements used in this study can be accessed as described by wang et al 2019 1 introduction evapotranspiration et plays a vital role in the hydrological cycle and energy partitioning in agricultural ecosystems identifying and understanding seasonal variation in water flux and energy partitioning is essential to determine controlling factors of water and energy fluxes at different spatial and temporal scales burba and verma 2005 where water resources are scarce an in depth study of ecohydrological processes especially et is of paramount importance for efficient water use a large amount of cropland irrigation can change the regional energy balance and water cycles which affect the regional microclimate prueger et al 1996 therefore studying the variation in water and energy fluxes which are influenced by human activities e g irrigation is helpful to understand the regional water cycle lei and yang 2010 the eco hydrological processes underlying the soil plant atmosphere continuum are controlled by meteorological factors e g net radiation vapor pressure deficit air temperature hydrological factors soil water content and biological factors leaf area index and stomatal conductance zha et al 2013 while it was upscaled to the canopy water and carbon exchanges are determined by the relationship between surface conductance gs and aforementioned factors marques et al 2020 for given available radiation the surface vapor conductance or gs is the key parameter that controlling the magnitude of evapotranspiration in most land surface models salvucci and gentine 2013 better understanding of gs not only reveals the mechanisms underlying water and carbon exchange of land surface but also is helpful for future applications of et models under the conditions in which gs need to be calculated marques et al 2020 quantifying gs and studying its relationship with et remain challenging because it is influenced by climate pattern and vegetation species tan et al 2019 therefore it is essential to study the differences of mechanisms of gs response to meteorological biological and hydrological factors among different vegetation types in addition previous studies only studied the relationship between gs and aforementioned factors but ignored the inner relationship among these factors lei and yang 2010 ma et al 2015 ryu et al 2008 suyker and verma 2008 tan et al 2019 zha et al 2013 recently some studies have focused on revealing the main controlling factors considering the inner relevance of the ecohydrological factors although such studies are challenging tian et al 2016 massmann et al 2019 marques et al 2020 vapor pressure deficit vpd is projected to increase over continents at the end of this century because of the combination of increased temperature and depending on region decreased relative humidity byrne and o gorman 2013 high vpd increases the atmospheric demanding of et monteith 1965 penman 1948 as well as reduces stomatal aperture damour et al 2010 therefore there are two possible perspectives for how et responds to vpd massmann et al 2019 on the one hand it is well known that from a hydrometeorological perspective higher vpd increases the vapor pressure gradient between land surface and atmosphere and this leads to an increase et penman 1948 on the other hand from a plant physiology perspective plants stomata have evolved to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon and tend to partially close in response to increased atmospheric dryness medlyn et al 2017 which leads to a decrease in et rigden and salvucci 2017 in a word the question how does et respond to vpd can be related to whether plant regulation or atmospheric demand dominates the et response massmann et al 2019 as an important component of the yellow river basin the guanzhong plain located in shaanxi province of northwest china is an important food production area that accounts for approximately two thirds of the entire province s total crop yield zhao et al 2018 the major agricultural system in this region is double cropping winter wheat summer maize li et al 2016 the eddy covariance ec technique is widely used to directly quantify water flux or et between the biosphere and atmosphere without destroying the ecosystem baldocchi 2014 this technique is considered dependable for measuring fluxes with high time resolution and accuracy baldocchi 2003 with this technique we can improve our understanding of ecological and hydrological problems baldocchi 2008 2014 korner 2003 wofsy et al 1993 although many studies have used the ec method to characterize energy and mass fluxes across diverse ecosystems baldocchi et al 2001 none has characterized annual variation and controlling factors of water vapor flux in typical irrigated rotation cropland winter wheat summer maize on the guanzhong plain this area has a dry semi humid climate there was high vpd despite the crop being well watered therefore understanding the et response to these two opposing effects of vpd massmann et al 2019 especially for this irrigated area will be useful for quantifying water use and optimizing water source management with the ec technique we conducted energy flux measurements undertaken on guanzhong plain cropland from june 2013 to june 2018 to 1 assess seasonal variability in energy fluxes and determine the energy budget 2 characterize seasonal and interannual variation in et and 3 investigate seasonal and interannual variability in et and gs and identify the main controlling environmental and biological factors of et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted in an experimental field in yangling 34 17 n 108 04 e 521 m a s l from june 2013 to june 2018 fig 1 the field was approximately 200 m north to south by 250 m east to west the soil in the study area is a silty clay loam based on the usda soil taxonomy system zheng et al 2021 with a field capacity of 0 235 m3 m 3 and bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 yu et al 2016 the groundwater table depth is 55 m below the soil surface thus the water supplied by groundwater was assumed to equal zero the mean annual temperature at the site is 12 9 c and mean annual precipitation is 630 mm yu et al 2016 2018 the mean annual precipitation during the study period was 599 mm with 2016 and 2017 being wetter years 2013 and 2015 being drier years and 2014 being a relatively normal precipitation year table 1 the maximum crop height was approximately 190 cm for summer maize and 90 cm for winter wheat summer maize cv wuke no 2 was planted around 20 june and harvested around 10 october each year and winter wheat cv xinong 979 was planted around 20 october and harvested around 10 june field management operations i e fertilizer application weed control and irrigation followed the local standard management schedule nitrogen typically 180 kg n ha 1 was applied as urea ammonium nitrate solution prior to planting each crop flood irrigation was implemented when the crop was under slight water stress soil moisture less than 70 field capacity to avoid large amounts of deep percolation the amount of irrigation was determined by water use et minus precipitation since the last irrigation wang et al 2020a 2 2 fluxes and meteorological measurements the ec system was installed on a height adjustable tripod the sensors were positioned 2 m above the soil surface during the wheat growing season and 3 m above the soil surface during the maize growing season wang et al 2020a the ec system included a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific logan ut usa pointed toward the direction of the prevailing wind providing approximately 120 m of fetch an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500a li cor lincoln ne usa and a datalogger li7550 10 hz li cor lincoln ne usa the system measured both latent and sensible heat fluxes between the ecosystem and atmosphere solar radiation was measured by pyranometer upward and downward short wave and long wave radiation were measured by pyrgeometer both of which were installed 1 5 m above the soil surface during the wheat growing season and 2 5 m above the soil surface during the maize growing season boundary layer meteorological measurements included wind speed and wind direction measured with propeller anemometers r m young model 03002 5 available from campbell scientific logan ut usa and air temperature and relative humidity measured with a humidity and temperature probe model hmp60 vaisala vantaa finland placed 1 5 m and 2 5 m above the soil surface in the wheat and maize growing seasons respectively all signals were logged with a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific and recorded at 30 min intervals soil temperature and soil volumetric water content observations were taken at three depths 20 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface using a model 5tm dielectric permittivity meter meter environment pullman wa usa rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge model te525mm l campbell scientific snowfall was measured with a weighing type precipitation gauge model ott pluvio dusseldorf germany and soil heat flux g was measured with a self tuning heat flux plate model hfp01sc l50 hukseflux delft the netherlands located 8 cm below the soil surface all sensors were calibrated and validated before installation wang et al 2020a 2020b the theoretical basis of this ec system can be found in the book published by aubinet et al 2012 using an lai sunscan instrument we measured leaf area index lai in the wheat and maize growing seasons every two weeks owing to the relatively low time resolution for field observations of lai the values were obtained from the noaa climate data record derived from a noaa avhrr surface reflectance product and gridded at a daily resolution of 0 05 https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog noaa cdr avhrr lai fapar v4 the field observations of lai were used to filter the remotely sensed lai for outliers with data gaps filled by linear interpolation 2 3 flux data processing eddypro software https www licor com env products eddy covariance software html was used to process data into 30 min interval turbulent latent le and sensible h heat fluxes post processing of ec data included 1 spike detection 2 time lag correction of h2o co2 3 frequency response correction and 4 coordinate rotation using the planar fit method wilczak et al 2001 during the calculation of flux data density correction was based on the method presented by webb et al 1980 the processed 30 min flux data and meteorological data were screened for anomalous or spurious values caused by system malfunction power failure and bad atmospheric conditions and excluded zhang et al 2016 based on the quality analysis by eddypro software approximately 23 1 of the flux data recorded from 2013 to 2018 were deleted data gaps shorter than 2 h were filled by linear interpolation and data gaps longer than 2 h were filled using the average daily variation method falge et al 2001 the gap filling method used in this study could introduce uncertainties to the data especially during periods of crop rotation however as the low quality data usually occurred in the evening the systematic bias of filled data has limited effects on the water and energy flux analysis 2 4 calculations of hydrometeorological parameters hydrometeorological parameters were used to identify the reasons for seasonal and interannual variability in et the parameters selected were gs the priestley taylor coefficient α priestley and taylor 1972 and the bowen ratio β bowen 1926 gs was calculated by inverting the penman monteith equation 1 g s γ le g a r n g ρ c p vpd le γ where gs is surface conductance m s 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 le is latent heat flux measured by ec ga is aerodynamic conductance m s 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is net radiation at the study area w m 2 g is the heat energy density into the soil soil heat flux w m 2 ρ is air density 1 2 kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of the air 1004 7 j kg 1 k 1 and vpd is air vapor pressure deficit kpa at the observation height note outlier gs values were not used when analyzing the relationship between gs and other parameters the calculation of aerodynamic conductance ga can be calculated as paulson 1970 businger et al 1971 massman 1992 li et al 2015 2 g a k 2 w s ln z z o ψ h ln z z o ψ m where ws is average wind speed at height z m s 1 k is von karman s constant 0 41 z is the reference height m d is the zero plane displacement height m zo is roughness length of the crop relative to momentum transfer m ψ h is the stability correction function for heat and water transfer ψ m is the stability correction function for momentum transfers the priestley taylor coefficient α which is the ratio of measured et eta to equilibrium evaporation eteq can determine whether atmospheric demand or surface moisture supply is the limiting factor the calculation of eteq is as follows 3 λ et eq γ r n g an et eteq 1 indicates that available energy rn g is the main factor controlling et due to sufficient soil water mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 in arid and semi arid regions this value is often less than 1 it is reasonable to use the et eteq ratio to compare different observational sites because the sites are normalized by equilibrium rates mainly determined by rn wilson and baldocchi 2000 the bowen ratio β bowen 1926 which is the ratio of sensible heat flux h to latent heat flux le through its effect on the warming extent of available energy to the ecosystem land surface air heavily influences the ecosystem microclimate and hydrological cycle at both regional and global scales tang et al 2014 the bowen ratio is calculated as 4 β h le 2 5 data analysis path analysis was conducted to analyze the individual effects of independent variables on dependent variables edwards and lambert 2007 it is widely used in multiple regression because it can exclude potential relationships between independent variables rodrigues et al 2014 although it is similar to multiple regression path analysis can estimate the strength and relative importance of assumed causal relationships among variables path analysis is most effective in the absence of feedback and for evaluating data in which independence among variables is not certain rendering more common multiple regression techniques inappropriate huxman et al 2003 zhuang et al 2016 similar studies have adopted this method to reveal the direct effects of microclimate meteorological air temperature tair net radiation rn vapor pressure deficit vpd volumetric soil water content vwc wind speed ws and surface conductance gs and biological leaf area index lai variables on et the standardized partial regression coefficient represents the direct effects of the meteorological and biological variables on et eq 5 and the sum of the standardized partial regression coefficients across each path is the indirect effect of the variable huxman et al 2003 rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2016 the path analysis of et was conducted based on the followed equation 5 et f t air r n vpd vwc w s lai g s linear fitting was used to evaluate energy balance of the ec data and to analyze the relationship between measured et and eteq nonlinear fitting was used to analyze the relationship between gs and α all of the data analysis was performed using spss25 0 software 3 results 3 1 meteorological information and energy balance closure studies have used the energy balance closure calculated as linear regression analysis of available energy rn g and the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes h le to evaluate the quality of ec data wilson et al 2002 rodrigues et al 2014 based on the daily data without gap filling from june 2013 to june 2018 the slope between h le and rn g during the summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons was 0 79 and 0 87 respectively with respective regression intercepts of 9 96 w m 2 and 1 48 w m 2 and coefficients of determination r2 of 0 81 and 0 92 fig 2 the results of the regression analysis are shown in table 2 for the five year study period the slopes of the regression analysis ranged from 0 75 to 0 90 during the maize growing season and 0 70 to 0 91 during the wheat growing season and the intercepts ranged from 3 40 to 13 22 w m 2 and 9 30 to 4 71 w m 2 for the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively thus indicating that some heat fluxes were not accounted for by the ec system even though many long term flux observations based on the ec technique have been conducted worldwide the reasons for residual energy and lack of energy balance closure are not fully understood foken 2008 widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 likewise we found it difficult to identify the main factors that caused the energy imbalance in this agroecosystem measurement errors from the instruments e g soil heat flux plates and ec system sensible heat advection energy consumed by photosynthesis and energy storage in the surface soil layer and crop canopy could affect the energy balance li and yu 2007 meyers and hollinger 2004 reported that canopy and photosynthetic storage accounted for nearly 14 and 8 of rn in maize and soybean glycine max l respectively it is likely that the difference in canopy heat storage was the primary factor for the different energy balance closure between maize and wheat in our study based on the data from fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 the slopes of the energy balance closure ranged from 0 53 to 0 99 mean 0 79 0 01 and intercept values ranged from 32 9 to 36 9 w m 2 mean 3 7 2 0 wilson et al 2002 for chinaflux sites the slopes ranged from 0 49 to 0 81 mean 0 67 and intercept values ranged from 10 8 to 79 9 w m 2 mean 28 9 li 2005 the slope and intercept in the current study were comparable with these studies twine et al 2000 introduced the bowen ratio method for overcoming the energy imbalance issue which assumes that the bowen ratio can be measured accurately and forces the energy closure using the corrected long term quality assured observed data we analyzed annual and interannual variation in energy fluxes in the studied ecosystem during the observation period solar radiation rg and vpd ranged from 0 2 to 34 4 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 to 2 98 kpa respectively both of which had typical seasonal variation fig 3a the mean annual temperature over the five years ranged from 13 7 to 14 5 c mean 12 9 c from 1990 to 2008 the maximum temperature during the observation period was 42 2 c and the minimum temperature was 9 3 c fig 3b the average annual precipitation was 599 mm slightly below the 1990 2008 average of 630 mm most of the rainfall occurred from april to october during the maize and wheat growing seasons there was relatively low precipitation from november to march when winter wheat was dormant total precipitation ranged from 210 to 394 mm during the maize growing seasons and 202 to 385 mm during the wheat growing seasons fig 3c although the temporal variability of precipitation was substantial vwc remained relatively high during the crop growing seasons with the use of sufficient irrigation fig 3c lai peaked twice each year due to the winter wheat summer maize rotation fig 3d after the wheat was planted around 20 october lai increased slightly with emergence and early season growth decreased when winter wheat was dormant increased sharply in early march when regrowth began peaking in late april early may 4 04 4 93 m2 m 2 before rapidly decreasing until harvest in the summer maize cropping season lai peaked in early august 3 59 5 31 m2 m 2 before decreasing as maize progressed to physiological maturity in late september 3 2 hydrometeorological parameters seasonal patterns of daily α eta eteq and gs for this ecosystem were similar to those previously reported lei and yang 2010 shen et al 2013 suyker and verma 2008 generally α followed a clear annual cycle during the measurement period fig 4a the α value peaked during winter when wheat was dormant indicating that sensible heat advection in winter significantly enhances et annual average values of α over the five years of the study table 1 ranged from 1 00 to 1 13 thus indicating that α is a relatively stable parameter for estimating actual annual et totals in this region the average α values during the five wheat growing seasons ranged from 1 17 to 1 37 table 1 these values were higher than the average α values during the five maize growing seasons which ranged from 0 82 to 1 00 table 1 which indicated that the water consumption capacity of wheat is greater than that of maize under the same radiative condition the seasonal variation in daily et as well as daily equilibrium evaporation during the five years of the study are shown in fig 4b because winter wheat was planted in mid october et gradually increased from about 0 5 to 2 5 mm d 1 from emergence to early canopy development in november during the winter dormancy period december to january et reached minimum values due to both minimum equilibrium evaporation values and no transpiration from wheat subsequently daily et values were consistent with eteq until late may when winter wheat began to senesce as shown in fig 4b et was relatively low in june 2 0 mm d 1 despite the high equilibrium evaporation because of the crop rotation used as a result of the rapid maize growth from late june to august et rapidly increased during this period before rapidly decreasing from late august as summer maize matured and eteq decreased the daily et of wheat reached maximum values between 5 5 and 6 0 mm d 1 whereas maize reached maximum daily et values between 5 2 and 6 7 mm d 1 because the peak eteq for maize was slightly higher than that of wheat maize had higher eta during times of peak eteq 6 5 mm d 1 than wheat during the wheat growing seasons equilibrium evaporation eteq explained 84 6 of the seasonal variability in daily et during the maize growing seasons eteq explained 82 6 of the seasonal variability in daily et the slope of the relationship between eta and eteq was 0 93 and 1 04 for the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively fig 5 and this can likely be attributed to the greater water use efficiency of c4 maize than c3 wheat tong et al 2009 a similar result was reported by lei and yang 2010 in a maize wheat rotation system in the north china plain the scatter of data points around the regression lines in fig 5 indicates that other environmental factors are influencing actual et the outlier values usually occurred between the wheat and maize rotation phases when lai was low but eteq was high surface conductance has been used as a parameter to reflect biological factors controlling seasonal variation in et baldocchi et al 2004 annual and interannual variation in daytime gs is shown in fig 4d as crop production moved between wheat and maize phases gs decreased as lai reached the minimum values daytime gs was about 1 mm s 1 during the wheat dormancy period in winter and then increasing to 25 29 mm s 1 when lai reached maximum values in april in the maize growing season peak gs values reached 13 17 mm s 1 during vigorous growth in august maximum gs values occurred when wheat and maize were actively growing the winter wheat growing season produced around two times higher average surface conductance than the maize growing season which agrees with the two or more times higher gs values observed in a fully developed wheat field c3 plant than a maize field c4 plant baldocchi 1994 3 3 energy partitioning and bowen ratio variations seasonal variability in daily rn h le and g during the five years of the experiment are shown in fig 6 the maximum daily le between 150 and 200 w m 2 usually occurred mid season during may and august respectively and corresponded with maximum leaf area development fig 6a the first peak in daily h values occurred in june to early july between wheat senescence and rapid maize development the second lower peak occurred in october between maize senescence and early wheat development fig 6a we expect that this difference between locations is attributable to the lower latitude of our experimental site than the north china plain resulting in relatively higher rn when maize matured the h decreased rapidly following crop emergence each year during the rapid growth of wheat daily h values were near zero however h rarely reached zero in the rapid growth period of summer maize the ratios of heat fluxes to available energy le rn g h rn g are shown in fig 6b to verify the relationship between seasonal variations in energy partitioning and crop phenology three peaks of le rn g were observed in each crop year during the wheat growing season peak values usually occurred in november due to the emergence of wheat and late april early may full canopy development and maximum lai and august maximum lai during the maize growing season during the wheat growing season le rn g ranged from 0 30 to 0 60 during the dormant season and 0 90 to 0 95 when maximum lai was reached as wheat approached maturity le rn g sharply declined to approximately 0 25 during the maize growing season le rn g peaked at approximately 0 8 0 9 which was lower than the values observed in the winter wheat growing season the values for h rn g followed the opposite pattern to that seen for canopy development fig 6b the diurnal variations in energy fluxes rn le h and g each month averaged from 2013 to 2018 are shown in fig 7 all energy components followed familiar bell shaped variation each day the figure also shows that the energy fluxes exhibited clear seasonal variability with significant differences due to the development and senescence periods of the two crops midday rn increased from 209 w m 2 in january to 513 w m 2 in july with a slight decline from the peak value in june due to increased cloudiness associated with the rainy season rn decreased to 223 w m 2 in december le peaked in may 400 w m 2 maximum wheat leaf area and august 442 w m 2 maximum maize leaf area high h values occurred from october to february when lai values were low at which time h and le were nearly equal wheat leaf area increased rapidly in march with a subsequent decline in h g only consumed a small fraction of rn and showed diurnal hysteresis peaking approximately 3 h later than the other three energy components annual variability in the daily bowen ratio fig 6c was large during the two crop phases in a given year as well as the winter wheat dormancy period with maximum values ranging from about 1 5 to 2 9 however β was relatively low when soil moisture was very high e g june 2016 and october 2016 when the vwc was high as the maize and wheat canopies developed fully the β values decreased to relatively stable low values 0 1 0 3 with mean values of 0 50 in the wheat growing season and 0 59 in the maize growing season 3 4 environmental and biological controls on evapotranspiration path analysis was used to determine the importance of daily meteorological hydrological and biological variables rn gs vpd lai tair and vwc on et during the maize and wheat growing seasons fig 9 and table 3 as the figures shown rn was the primary direct factor controlling et in both the maize and wheat growing seasons and the direct path coefficient of rn to et was 0 730 and 0 718 for maize and wheat season respectively besides rn gs was another main direct factor that controlling et the direct path coefficient of gs to et was 0 345 and 0 212 for maize and wheat season respectively the direct path coefficient of vpd to maize et was 0 121 which was less sensitive when compared with wheat et both maize and wheat et were directly affected by lai but the direct path coefficient of lai to wheat et 0 082 was lower than to maize et 0 199 as shown in fig 9 only wheat et was affected by vwc and tair indicating that wheat et is prone to be affected by the soil water content during the growing season although the crop was well watered the maize season gs was more sensitive to vpd than wheat season gs which results in a greater indirect effect of vpd through gs on et although the maize et was not directly affected by vwc there was a relatively higher indirect effect of vwc through gs on et the direct effects of meteorological hydrological and biological factors on et are shown by month in fig 10 similar to the results shown for the growing season analysis fig 9 rn was the primary direct path for et with direct path coefficients was around 0 75 from march to september evidenced by the nearly synchronized variations in daily averages of rn and et the controlling power of vpd and gs on et was weaker than the effect of rn on et whereas the effect of vpd and gs on et was also strong in some specific months the relatively lower path coefficients of gs on et corresponded with the higher lai in wheat and maize season these results are consistent with the results of the seasonal scale analysis vwc generally significantly affected et in november december and march while wheat was experiencing dormancy the soil had relatively low water content and et was mainly composed of soil evaporation et was not directly affected by tair in most months a positive direct effect of lai on et occurred in may june august and october and corresponded with periods of the large variability in lai the indirect effects of vpd lai vwc and rn through gs on et are shown by month in fig 11 vpd which can significantly affect gs was the primary indirect controlling factor of et the most significant negative indirect effect of vpd occurred in july which corresponded with the highest vpd values at the same time the highest positive indirect effect of lai on et was also founded in july which corresponded with the rapid growth period of maize the indirect effects of rn on et through gs were relatively low in each month although vwc cannot directly affect et in july it can indirectly affect et by affecting gs it is consistent with the results of the seasonal scale analysis 4 discussion 4 1 environmental and biological controls on evapotranspiration plant water use is influenced by both species type and the prevailing environmental conditions during the growing season xu et al 2018 the maximum gs values for maize and wheat 19 5 29 5 mm s 1 fig 4c were comparable with those reported by lei and yang 2010 in a similar rotation cropland in the north china plain 15 30 mm s 1 ding et al 2013 in maize fields in an arid region 20 mm s 1 and tian et al 2016 in cotton fields 13 20 mm s 1 lower than those reported by suyker and verma 2008 in maize and soybean fields in nebraska usa 30 40 mm s 1 et increases with gs but this relationship does not continue when gs is higher than a threshold value fig 8 there are numerous previous studies have demonstrated that the rn is the primary driver of et but the effect of the other environmental and biological factors varies with climate type and land surface generally the values of gs reflect the effects of biological factors on the seasonal variation in et and the values of eteq can reflect the effect of environmental factors on seasonal variation in et however gs was also affected by vpd and soil water content a study conducted by mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 reported that α was sensitive to gs when gs was less than a threshold value suyker and verma 2008 reported a consistent threshold of gs in a maize field the threshold gs at our site 10 mm s 1 was lower than the threshold gs values reported by lei and yang 2010 in a wheat maize rotation 15 20 mm s 1 ding et al 2013 in a maize field 20 mm s 1 and suyker and verma 2008 in a maize and soybean rotation 10 15 mm s 1 but slightly higher than the threshold gs value reported by tian et al 2016 in a cotton field in northwest china 8 mm s 1 the other studies have also reported this threshold phenomenon but the threshold varies with ecosystems and climates ryu et al 2008 zha et al 2013 ma et al 2015 tan et al 2019 marques et al 2020 for croplands with a large amount of irrigation such as the wheat maize rotation cropland in the north china plain the et was mainly controlled by rn therefore the α values could increase until gs reached a relatively high value for the yangling site due to the rn was significantly higher than that of weishan and luancheng the controlling effect of rn was lower than other mentioned sites thus the threshold of gs was lower that reported by lei and yang 2010 ding et al 2013 and suyker and verma 2008 the et in the cotton field was mainly controlled by soil moisture due to the sufficient rn it results that the threshold value of gs of the cotton was slightly lower than that of the maize at yangling the vpd had two paths that can affect et on the one hand a higher vpd will result in a higher et as it reflects a high vapor pressure difference between air and stomatal or soil pores which can enhance water vapor flow through stomata or the soil surface on the other hand the increasing vpd will reduce the stomatal aperture which will increase stomatal resistance and reduce et and was demonstrated in previous studies lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2016 suyker et al 2008 gong et al 2020 marques et al 2020 this study quantified the direct and indirect effects of vpd on et the increased flow through stomata as a function of vpd would be compensated for by reductions in stomatal aperture and increased flow rate through stomata as the path analysis of et showed the maize season gs was more sensitive to vpd than wheat season gs which indicates that the higher vpd in summer can significantly and indirectly reduced et this was due to decreasing stomatal conductance as vpd increased rodrigues et al 2014 these results are consistent with those in a maize ecosystem ding et al 2015 the direct effect of lai was relatively small in the monthly analysis the reason is that the variation of lai is small except for the rapid growth period of crop and the rotation period vwc had two paths that can indirectly affect et in the seasonal and interannual scale vwc can affect the development of lai furthermore vwc can directly and positively affect gs by decrease soil surface resistance and stomatal resistance then increasing soil evaporation and transpiration although the crop was rarely suffering moderate or severe water stress due to irrigation vwc was relatively low due to lack of irrigation and the et was mainly made up of soil evaporation when the wheat going into dormancy thus the direct effect of vwc can be found in november and december then the different effects of vwc for maize and season in fig 9 can be explained in addition there was a different effect of tair for the maize and wheat seasons in the monthly path analysis et was directly affected by tair in october november and february the air temperature in october november and february can significantly affect the emergency dormancy and returning green stages of winter wheat the transpiration of wheat will stop when wheat is experiencing dormancy and will increase when the wheat enters the returning green stage in warmer winter for wheat the dormancy date will be delayed and the returning green stage will advance which would increase et although the effect was relatively low in summer as the air temperature was high and the phenology of maize was usually controlled by soil water content rather than the air temperature therefore the significant direct effect of tair was not founded during the maize season the indirect effect of soil moisture on et through gs was relatively low for both wheat and maize because gs was less affected by soil moisture when soil moisture was relatively high xu et al 2018 the reason why vpd has a high indirect effect on et through gs in the monthly analysis is that increases in vapor flow through stomata as a function of vapor pressure deficit would be compensated for by reductions in stomatal aperture which was consistent with the results of the seasonal analysis figs 9 11 illustrate that path analysis can identify the primary factors controlling et 4 2 bowen ratio in various ecosystems of china the seasonal variation in daily β in the winter wheat and summer maize rotation agroecosystem near yangling china followed the pattern of a double u shaped curve with minimum values occurring in may and august each year fig 6c during the study period the mean values of β for the maize growing season the wheat growing season and annually were 0 59 0 50 and 0 53 respectively table 4 these values differ from those reported in other ecosystems such as spring maize grassland and forest gao et al 2018 li et al 2006 wilson and baldocchi 2000 as table 3 shows the β values during both the maize and wheat growing seasons on the guanzhong plain were higher than those reported on the north china plain lei and yang 2010 this may be attributed to the rn of yangling was much higher than that of weishan and luancheng owing to irrigation the annual et of this study was higher than that of a grassland on the loess plateau this leads to a much lower β compared to the grassland site ping et al 2018 this indicates that a high water consuming agroecosystem can significantly change its energy partitioning some periods of negative sensible heat flux were measured during the dormancy period of winter wheat in winter which can be attributed to the advection of h prueger et al 1996 and indicates that h can provide energy for evapotranspiration during the dormancy period lei and yang 2010 many studies have reported that changes in actual evapotranspiration are mainly affected by changes in precipitation rather than equilibrium evaporation in regions that are prone to drought such as the guanzhong plain but the reverse is true in humid regions yang et al 2007 however in agroecosystem studied here the variability in actual evapotranspiration was primarily explained by eteq and no significant relationship was found between et and precipitation this result indicates that the patterns of et and energy partitioning can be changed by human activity e g large amounts of irrigation large spatial scale irrigation results in sensible heat advection which subsequently affects local energy partitioning and the water cycle on an annual basis le consumed a large proportion of net radiation 62 6 which was slightly higher than those reported for maize and soybean fields in nebraska usa 60 suyker and verma 2008 maize wheat agroecosystems in the north china plain 59 lei and yang 2010 shen et al 2013 and a temperate mixed forest ecosystem in changbai mountain 52 wu et al 2007 but much higher that reported for a grassland ecosystem in the tibetan region 24 gu et al 2005 the mean value of daytime le rn g was about 66 9 in the wheat growing season and 63 5 in the summer maize growing season indicating that wheat consumed more water than maize for a given amount of energy 4 3 annual evapotranspiration for maize and wheat in various regions of china two of the most important grain crops worldwide maize and wheat are widely cultivated in north china it is vital to understand the differences in timing and amount of water use for these two crops in different regions therefore et for maize and wheat between different regions in north china was compared and the data is presented in table 5 summer maize generally has a lower et than that of spring maize due to its shorter growing season we did not find a significant relationship between et and precipitation as the irrigation mitigated the effects of low precipitation a comparison of the three main summer maize planting areas in china weishan luancheng and yangling lei and yang 2010 shen et al 2013 revealed that summer maize in yangling consumes more water than the other two locations the reason is that yangling has higher rn and vpd than weishan and luancheng yangling also had slightly lower winter wheat et than luancheng and slightly higher winter wheat et than weishan thus indicating that sufficient irrigation can change the pattern of water and energy partitioning relative to semi arid and humid regions in addition irrigated cropland in semi arid regions not only experiences lower precipitation than semi humid regions but also higher evaporative demand 5 conclusion ec observations of water and energy fluxes with good quality were made and path analysis of et with meteorological hydrological and biological factors was conducted in a typical irrigated winter wheat summer maize rotation field in the guanzhong plain from june 2013 to june 2018 the total et for each crop year was 645 627 753 775 and 739 mm from june 2013 to june 2018 average total evapotranspiration was 310 mm and 398 mm for the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively for both crops et increased rapidly with rapid canopy development reaching peak values when the canopy was fully developed the et decreased as the canopy senesced gs reached 19 5 and 29 5 mm s 1 in the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively for both maize and wheat daily β values were between 0 1 and 0 2 when lai reached maximum values and ranged from 1 5 to 2 9 during the rotation period the average β value in the five year study was 0 59 for maize and 0 53 for wheat rn was the primary controlling factor of et for both maize and wheat season also gs was another controlling factor that had more controlling power in maize season than in wheat season vpd had a significant positive and direct effect on et for both wheat and maize season whereas it had a significant negative and indirect effect on et through gs in the maize season vwc and tair only directly affect the wheat et in addition vwc had two significant paths that can indirectly affect et through lai and gs the understanding of the controlling factors of et provides the theoretical basis for quantifying crop water

9826,the guanzhong plain is a critical food production area in the yellow river basin that frequently suffers from water shortages in this study long term june 2013 to june 2018 water and energy fluxes were observed and path analysis was conducted over an irrigated winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l rotation field to identify the controlling factors of evapotranspiration et total et for each crop year ranged from 627 to 775 mm with an average growing season et of 398 mm for wheat and 310 mm for maize there is significant seasonal variation in both et and surface conductance gs daily et varied from 0 0 to 6 0 mm d 1 for wheat and 0 0 to 6 7 mm d 1 for maize the peak daily values of gs were 29 5 mm s 1 for wheat and 19 5 mm s 1 for maize the direct and indirect effects of environmental and biological factors net radiation rn surface conductance gs saturation vapor pressure deficit vpd leaf area index lai air temperature tair and volumetric soil water content vwc on et were calculated using the path analysis method rn was determined to be the primary controlling factor of et for both the summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons also gs was found to be another controlling factor that has more controlling power in the summer maize growing season than in the winter wheat season vpd had a significant positive and direct effect on et for both of the crop seasons while it had a significant negative and indirect effect on et through gs in the summer maize season vwc and tair only directly affected the wheat et in addition vwc had two significant paths that can indirectly affect et through lai and gs the revealed seasonal patterns and controlling factors of evapotranspiration in this agroecosystem provide a theoretical basis for optimizing water resources management of the yellow river keywords evapotranspiration eddy covariance canopy conductance controlling factors guanzhong plain data availability the tower based ec measurements used in this study can be accessed as described by wang et al 2019 1 introduction evapotranspiration et plays a vital role in the hydrological cycle and energy partitioning in agricultural ecosystems identifying and understanding seasonal variation in water flux and energy partitioning is essential to determine controlling factors of water and energy fluxes at different spatial and temporal scales burba and verma 2005 where water resources are scarce an in depth study of ecohydrological processes especially et is of paramount importance for efficient water use a large amount of cropland irrigation can change the regional energy balance and water cycles which affect the regional microclimate prueger et al 1996 therefore studying the variation in water and energy fluxes which are influenced by human activities e g irrigation is helpful to understand the regional water cycle lei and yang 2010 the eco hydrological processes underlying the soil plant atmosphere continuum are controlled by meteorological factors e g net radiation vapor pressure deficit air temperature hydrological factors soil water content and biological factors leaf area index and stomatal conductance zha et al 2013 while it was upscaled to the canopy water and carbon exchanges are determined by the relationship between surface conductance gs and aforementioned factors marques et al 2020 for given available radiation the surface vapor conductance or gs is the key parameter that controlling the magnitude of evapotranspiration in most land surface models salvucci and gentine 2013 better understanding of gs not only reveals the mechanisms underlying water and carbon exchange of land surface but also is helpful for future applications of et models under the conditions in which gs need to be calculated marques et al 2020 quantifying gs and studying its relationship with et remain challenging because it is influenced by climate pattern and vegetation species tan et al 2019 therefore it is essential to study the differences of mechanisms of gs response to meteorological biological and hydrological factors among different vegetation types in addition previous studies only studied the relationship between gs and aforementioned factors but ignored the inner relationship among these factors lei and yang 2010 ma et al 2015 ryu et al 2008 suyker and verma 2008 tan et al 2019 zha et al 2013 recently some studies have focused on revealing the main controlling factors considering the inner relevance of the ecohydrological factors although such studies are challenging tian et al 2016 massmann et al 2019 marques et al 2020 vapor pressure deficit vpd is projected to increase over continents at the end of this century because of the combination of increased temperature and depending on region decreased relative humidity byrne and o gorman 2013 high vpd increases the atmospheric demanding of et monteith 1965 penman 1948 as well as reduces stomatal aperture damour et al 2010 therefore there are two possible perspectives for how et responds to vpd massmann et al 2019 on the one hand it is well known that from a hydrometeorological perspective higher vpd increases the vapor pressure gradient between land surface and atmosphere and this leads to an increase et penman 1948 on the other hand from a plant physiology perspective plants stomata have evolved to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon and tend to partially close in response to increased atmospheric dryness medlyn et al 2017 which leads to a decrease in et rigden and salvucci 2017 in a word the question how does et respond to vpd can be related to whether plant regulation or atmospheric demand dominates the et response massmann et al 2019 as an important component of the yellow river basin the guanzhong plain located in shaanxi province of northwest china is an important food production area that accounts for approximately two thirds of the entire province s total crop yield zhao et al 2018 the major agricultural system in this region is double cropping winter wheat summer maize li et al 2016 the eddy covariance ec technique is widely used to directly quantify water flux or et between the biosphere and atmosphere without destroying the ecosystem baldocchi 2014 this technique is considered dependable for measuring fluxes with high time resolution and accuracy baldocchi 2003 with this technique we can improve our understanding of ecological and hydrological problems baldocchi 2008 2014 korner 2003 wofsy et al 1993 although many studies have used the ec method to characterize energy and mass fluxes across diverse ecosystems baldocchi et al 2001 none has characterized annual variation and controlling factors of water vapor flux in typical irrigated rotation cropland winter wheat summer maize on the guanzhong plain this area has a dry semi humid climate there was high vpd despite the crop being well watered therefore understanding the et response to these two opposing effects of vpd massmann et al 2019 especially for this irrigated area will be useful for quantifying water use and optimizing water source management with the ec technique we conducted energy flux measurements undertaken on guanzhong plain cropland from june 2013 to june 2018 to 1 assess seasonal variability in energy fluxes and determine the energy budget 2 characterize seasonal and interannual variation in et and 3 investigate seasonal and interannual variability in et and gs and identify the main controlling environmental and biological factors of et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted in an experimental field in yangling 34 17 n 108 04 e 521 m a s l from june 2013 to june 2018 fig 1 the field was approximately 200 m north to south by 250 m east to west the soil in the study area is a silty clay loam based on the usda soil taxonomy system zheng et al 2021 with a field capacity of 0 235 m3 m 3 and bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 yu et al 2016 the groundwater table depth is 55 m below the soil surface thus the water supplied by groundwater was assumed to equal zero the mean annual temperature at the site is 12 9 c and mean annual precipitation is 630 mm yu et al 2016 2018 the mean annual precipitation during the study period was 599 mm with 2016 and 2017 being wetter years 2013 and 2015 being drier years and 2014 being a relatively normal precipitation year table 1 the maximum crop height was approximately 190 cm for summer maize and 90 cm for winter wheat summer maize cv wuke no 2 was planted around 20 june and harvested around 10 october each year and winter wheat cv xinong 979 was planted around 20 october and harvested around 10 june field management operations i e fertilizer application weed control and irrigation followed the local standard management schedule nitrogen typically 180 kg n ha 1 was applied as urea ammonium nitrate solution prior to planting each crop flood irrigation was implemented when the crop was under slight water stress soil moisture less than 70 field capacity to avoid large amounts of deep percolation the amount of irrigation was determined by water use et minus precipitation since the last irrigation wang et al 2020a 2 2 fluxes and meteorological measurements the ec system was installed on a height adjustable tripod the sensors were positioned 2 m above the soil surface during the wheat growing season and 3 m above the soil surface during the maize growing season wang et al 2020a the ec system included a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat 3 campbell

li7550 10 hz li cor lincoln ne usa the system measured both latent and sensible heat fluxes between the ecosystem and atmosphere solar radiation was measured by pyranometer upward and downward short wave and long wave radiation were measured by pyrgeometer both of which were installed 1 5 m above the soil surface during the wheat growing season and 2 5 m above the soil surface during the maize growing season boundary layer meteorological measurements included wind speed and wind direction measured with propeller anemometers r m young model 03002 5 available from campbell scientific logan ut usa and air temperature and relative humidity measured with a humidity and temperature probe model hmp60 vaisala vantaa finland placed 1 5 m and 2 5 m above the soil surface in the wheat and maize growing seasons respectively all signals were logged with a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific and recorded at 30 min intervals soil temperature and soil volumetric water content observations were taken at three depths 20 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface using a model 5tm dielectric permittivity meter meter environment pullman wa usa rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge

plate model hfp01sc l50 hukseflux delft the netherlands located 8 cm below the soil surface all sensors were calibrated and validated before installation wang et al 2020a 2020b the theoretical basis of this ec system can be found in the book published by aubinet et al 2012 using an lai sunscan instrument we measured leaf area index lai in the wheat and maize growing seasons every two weeks owing to the relatively low time resolution for field observations of lai the values were obtained from the noaa climate data record derived from a noaa avhrr surface reflectance product and gridded at a daily resolution of 0 05 https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog noaa cdr avhrr lai fapar v4 the field observations of lai were used to filter the remotely sensed lai for outliers with data gaps filled by linear interpolation 2 3 flux data processing eddypro software https www licor com env products eddy covariance software html was used to process data into 30 min interval turbulent latent le and sensible h heat fluxes post processing of ec data included 1 spike detection 2 time lag correction of h2o co2 3 frequency response correction and 4 coordinate rotation using the planar fit method wilczak et al 2001 during the calculation of flux data density correction was based on the method presented by webb et al 1980 the processed 30 min flux data and meteorological data were screened for anomalous or spurious values caused by system malfunction power failure and bad atmospheric conditions and excluded zhang et al 2016 based on the quality analysis by eddypro software approximately 23 1 of the flux data recorded from 2013 to 2018 were deleted data gaps shorter than 2 h were filled by linear interpolation and data gaps longer than 2 h were filled using the average daily variation method falge et al 2001 the gap filling method used in this study could introduce uncertainties to the data especially during periods of crop rotation however as the low quality data usually occurred in the evening the systematic bias of filled data has limited effects on the water and energy flux analysis 2 4 calculations of hydrometeorological parameters hydrometeorological parameters were used to identify the reasons for seasonal and interannual variability in et the parameters selected were gs the priestley taylor coefficient α priestley and taylor 1972 and the bowen ratio β bowen 1926 gs was calculated by inverting the penman monteith equation 1 g s γ le g a r n g ρ c p vpd le γ where gs is surface conductance m s 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 le is latent heat flux measured by ec ga is aerodynamic conductance m s 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is net radiation at the study area w m 2 g is the heat energy density into the soil soil heat flux w m 2 ρ is air density 1 2 kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of the air 1004 7 j kg 1 k 1 and vpd is air vapor pressure deficit kpa at the observation height note outlier gs values were not used when analyzing the relationship between gs and other parameters the calculation of aerodynamic conductance ga can be calculated as paulson 1970 businger et al 1971 massman 1992 li et al 2015 2 g a k 2 w s ln z z o ψ h ln z z o ψ m where ws is average wind speed at height z m s 1 k is von karman s constant 0 41 z is the reference height m d is the zero plane displacement height m zo is roughness length of the crop relative to momentum transfer m ψ h is the stability correction function for heat and water transfer ψ m is the stability correction function for momentum transfers the priestley taylor coefficient α which is the ratio of measured et eta to equilibrium evaporation eteq can determine whether atmospheric demand or surface moisture supply is the limiting factor the calculation of eteq is as follows 3 λ et eq γ r n g an et eteq 1 indicates that available energy rn g is the main factor controlling et due to sufficient soil water mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 in arid and semi arid regions this value is often less than 1 it is reasonable to use the et eteq ratio to compare different observational sites because the sites are normalized by equilibrium rates mainly determined by rn wilson and baldocchi 2000 the bowen ratio β bowen 1926 which is the ratio of sensible heat flux h to latent heat flux le through its effect on the warming extent of available energy to the ecosystem land surface air heavily influences the ecosystem microclimate and hydrological cycle at both regional and global scales tang et al 2014 the bowen ratio is calculated as 4 β h le 2 5 data analysis path analysis was conducted to analyze the individual effects of independent variables on dependent variables edwards and lambert 2007 it is widely used in multiple regression because it can exclude potential relationships between independent variables rodrigues et al 2014 although it is similar to multiple regression path analysis can estimate the strength and relative importance of assumed causal relationships among variables path analysis is most effective in the absence of feedback and for evaluating data in which independence among variables is not certain rendering more common multiple regression techniques inappropriate huxman et al 2003 zhuang et al 2016 similar studies have adopted this method to reveal the direct effects of microclimate meteorological air temperature tair net radiation rn vapor pressure deficit vpd volumetric soil water content vwc wind speed ws and surface conductance gs and biological leaf area index lai variables on et the standardized partial regression coefficient represents the direct effects of the meteorological and biological variables on et eq 5 and the sum of the standardized partial regression coefficients across each path is the indirect effect of the variable huxman et al 2003 rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2016 the path analysis of et was conducted based on the followed equation 5 et f t air r n vpd vwc w s lai g s linear fitting was used to evaluate energy balance of the ec data and to analyze the relationship between measured et and eteq nonlinear fitting was used to analyze the relationship between gs and α all of the data analysis was performed using spss25 0 software 3 results 3 1 meteorological information and energy balance closure studies have used the energy balance closure calculated as linear regression analysis of available energy rn g and the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes h le to evaluate the quality of ec data wilson et al 2002 rodrigues et al 2014 based on the daily data without gap filling from june 2013 to june 2018 the slope between h le and rn g during the summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons was 0 79 and 0 87 respectively with respective regression intercepts of 9 96 w m 2 and 1 48 w m 2 and coefficients of determination r2 of 0 81 and 0 92 fig 2 the results of the regression analysis are shown in table 2 for the five year study period the slopes of the regression analysis ranged from 0 75 to 0 90 during the maize growing season and 0 70 to 0 91 during the wheat growing season and the intercepts ranged from 3 40 to 13 22 w m 2 and 9 30 to 4 71 w m 2 for the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively thus indicating that some heat fluxes were not accounted for by the ec system even though many long term flux observations based on the ec technique have been conducted worldwide the reasons for residual energy and lack of energy balance closure are not fully understood foken 2008 widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 likewise we found it difficult to identify the main factors that caused the energy imbalance in this agroecosystem measurement errors from the instruments e g soil heat flux plates and ec system sensible heat advection energy consumed by photosynthesis and energy storage in the surface soil layer and crop canopy could affect the energy balance li and yu 2007 meyers and hollinger 2004 reported that canopy and photosynthetic storage accounted for nearly 14 and 8 of rn in maize and soybean glycine max l respectively it is likely that the difference in canopy heat storage was the primary factor for the different energy balance closure between maize and wheat in our study based on the data from fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 the slopes of the energy balance closure ranged from 0 53 to 0 99 mean 0 79 0 01 and intercept values ranged from 32 9 to 36 9 w m 2 mean 3 7 2 0 wilson et al 2002 for chinaflux sites the slopes ranged from 0 49 to 0 81 mean 0 67 and intercept values ranged from 10 8 to 79 9 w m 2 mean 28 9 li 2005 the slope and intercept in the current study were comparable with these studies twine et al 2000 introduced the bowen ratio method for overcoming the energy imbalance issue which assumes that the bowen ratio can be measured accurately and forces the energy closure using the corrected long term quality assured observed data we analyzed annual and interannual variation in energy fluxes in the studied ecosystem during the observation period solar radiation rg and vpd ranged from 0 2 to 34 4 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 to 2 98 kpa respectively both of which had typical seasonal variation fig 3a the mean annual temperature over the five years ranged from 13 7 to 14 5 c mean 12 9 c from 1990 to 2008 the maximum temperature during the observation period was 42 2 c and the minimum temperature was 9 3 c fig 3b the average annual precipitation was 599 mm slightly below the 1990 2008 average of 630 mm most of the rainfall occurred from april to october during the maize and wheat growing seasons there was relatively low precipitation from november to march when winter wheat was dormant total precipitation ranged from 210 to 394 mm during the maize growing seasons and 202 to 385 mm during the wheat growing seasons fig 3c although the temporal variability of precipitation was substantial vwc remained relatively high during the crop growing seasons with the use of sufficient irrigation fig 3c lai peaked twice each year due to the winter wheat summer maize rotation fig 3d after the wheat was planted around 20 october lai increased slightly with emergence and early season growth decreased when winter wheat was dormant increased sharply in early march when regrowth began peaking in late april early may 4 04 4 93 m2 m 2 before rapidly decreasing until harvest in the summer maize cropping season lai peaked in early august 3 59 5 31 m2 m 2 before decreasing as maize progressed to physiological maturity in late september 3 2 hydrometeorological parameters seasonal patterns of daily α eta eteq and gs for this ecosystem were similar to those previously reported lei and yang 2010 shen et al 2013 suyker and verma 2008 generally α followed a clear annual cycle during the measurement period fig 4a the α value peaked during winter when wheat was dormant indicating that sensible heat advection in winter significantly enhances et annual average values of α over the five years of the study table 1 ranged from 1 00 to 1 13 thus indicating that α is a relatively stable parameter for estimating actual annual et totals in this region the average α values during the five wheat growing seasons ranged from 1 17 to 1 37 table 1 these values were higher than the average α values during the five maize growing seasons which ranged from 0 82 to 1 00 table 1 which indicated that the water consumption capacity of wheat is greater than that of maize under the same radiative condition the seasonal variation in daily et as well as daily equilibrium evaporation during the five years of the study are shown in fig 4b because winter wheat was planted in mid october et gradually increased from about 0 5 to 2 5 mm d 1 from emergence to early canopy development in november during the winter dormancy period december to january et reached minimum values due to both minimum equilibrium evaporation values and no transpiration from wheat subsequently daily et values were consistent with eteq until late may when winter wheat began to senesce as shown in fig 4b et was relatively low in june 2 0 mm d 1 despite the high equilibrium evaporation because of the crop rotation used as a result of the rapid maize growth from late june to august et rapidly increased during this period before rapidly decreasing from late august as summer maize matured and eteq decreased the daily et of wheat reached maximum values between 5 5 and 6 0 mm d 1 whereas maize reached maximum daily et values between 5 2 and 6 7 mm d 1 because the peak eteq for maize was slightly higher than that of wheat maize had higher eta during times of peak eteq 6 5 mm d 1 than wheat during the wheat growing seasons equilibrium evaporation eteq explained 84 6 of the seasonal variability in daily et during the maize growing seasons eteq explained 82 6 of the seasonal variability in daily et the slope of the relationship between eta and eteq was 0 93 and 1 04 for the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively fig 5 and this can likely be attributed to the greater water use efficiency of c4 maize than c3 wheat tong et al 2009 a similar result was reported by lei and yang 2010 in a maize wheat rotation system in the north china plain the scatter of data points around the regression lines in fig 5 indicates that other environmental factors are influencing actual et the outlier values usually occurred between the wheat and maize rotation phases when lai was low but eteq was high surface conductance has been used as a parameter to reflect biological factors controlling seasonal variation in et baldocchi et al 2004 annual and interannual variation in daytime gs is shown in fig 4d as crop production moved between wheat and maize phases gs decreased as lai reached the minimum values daytime gs was about 1 mm s 1 during the wheat dormancy period in winter and then increasing to 25 29 mm s 1 when lai reached maximum values in april in the maize growing season peak gs values reached 13 17 mm s 1 during vigorous growth in august maximum gs values occurred when wheat and maize were actively growing the winter wheat growing season produced around two times higher average surface conductance than the maize growing season which agrees with the two or more times higher gs values observed in a fully developed wheat field c3 plant than a maize field c4 plant baldocchi 1994 3 3 energy partitioning and bowen ratio variations seasonal variability in daily rn h le and g during the five years of the experiment are shown in fig 6 the maximum daily le between 150 and 200 w m 2 usually occurred mid season during may and august respectively and corresponded with maximum leaf area development fig 6a the first peak in daily h values occurred in june to early july between wheat senescence and rapid maize development the second lower peak occurred in october between maize senescence and early wheat development fig 6a we expect that this difference between locations is attributable to the lower latitude of our experimental site than the north china plain resulting in relatively higher rn when maize matured the h decreased rapidly following crop emergence each year during the rapid growth of wheat daily h values were near zero however h rarely reached zero in the rapid growth period of summer maize the ratios of heat fluxes to available energy le rn g h rn g are shown in fig 6b to verify the relationship between seasonal variations in energy partitioning and crop phenology three peaks of le rn g were observed in each crop year during the wheat growing season peak values usually occurred in november due to the emergence of wheat and late april early may full canopy development and maximum lai and august maximum lai during the maize growing season during the wheat growing season le rn g ranged from 0 30 to 0 60 during the dormant season and 0 90 to 0 95 when maximum lai was reached as wheat approached maturity le rn g sharply declined to approximately 0 25 during the maize growing season le rn g peaked at approximately 0 8 0 9 which was lower than the values observed in the winter wheat growing season the values for h rn g followed the opposite pattern to that seen for canopy development fig 6b the diurnal variations in energy fluxes rn le h and g each month averaged from 2013 to 2018 are shown in fig 7 all energy components followed familiar bell shaped variation each day the figure also shows that the energy fluxes exhibited clear seasonal variability with significant differences due to the development and senescence periods of the two crops midday rn increased from 209 w m 2 in january to 513 w m 2 in july with a slight decline from the peak value in june due to increased cloudiness associated with the rainy season rn decreased to 223 w m 2 in december le peaked in may 400 w m 2 maximum wheat leaf area and august 442 w m 2 maximum maize leaf area high h values occurred from october to february when lai values were low at which time h and le were nearly equal wheat leaf area increased rapidly in march with a subsequent decline in h g only consumed a small fraction of rn and showed diurnal hysteresis peaking approximately 3 h later than the other three energy components annual variability in the daily bowen ratio fig 6c was large during the two crop phases in a given year as well as the winter wheat dormancy period with maximum values ranging from about 1 5 to 2 9 however β was relatively low when soil moisture was very high e g june 2016 and october 2016 when the vwc was high as the maize and wheat canopies developed fully the β values decreased to relatively stable low values 0 1 0 3 with mean values of 0 50 in the wheat growing season and 0 59 in the maize growing season 3 4 environmental and biological controls on evapotranspiration path analysis was used to determine the importance of daily meteorological hydrological and biological variables rn gs vpd lai tair and vwc on et during the maize and wheat growing seasons fig 9 and table 3 as the figures shown rn was the primary direct factor controlling et in both the maize and wheat growing seasons and the direct path coefficient of rn to et was 0 730 and 0 718 for maize and wheat season respectively besides rn gs was another main direct factor that controlling et the direct path coefficient of gs to et was 0 345 and 0 212 for maize and wheat season respectively the direct path coefficient of vpd to maize et was 0 121 which was less sensitive when compared with wheat et both maize and wheat et were directly affected by lai but the direct path coefficient of lai to wheat et 0 082 was lower than to maize et 0 199 as shown in fig 9 only wheat et was affected by vwc and tair indicating that wheat et is prone to be affected by the soil water content during the growing season although the crop was well watered the maize season gs was more sensitive to vpd than wheat season gs which results in a greater indirect effect of vpd through gs on et although the maize et was not directly affected by vwc there was a relatively higher indirect effect of vwc through gs on et the direct effects of meteorological hydrological and biological factors on et are shown by month in fig 10 similar to the results shown for the growing season analysis fig 9 rn was the primary direct path for et with direct path coefficients was around 0 75 from march to september evidenced by the nearly synchronized variations in daily averages of rn and et the controlling power of vpd and gs on et was weaker than the effect of rn on et whereas the effect of vpd and gs on et was also strong in some specific months the relatively lower path coefficients of gs on et corresponded with the higher lai in wheat and maize season these results are consistent with the results of the seasonal scale analysis vwc generally significantly affected et in november december and march while wheat was experiencing dormancy the soil had relatively low water content and et was mainly composed of soil evaporation et was not directly affected by tair in most months a positive direct effect of lai on et occurred in may june august and october and corresponded with periods of the large variability in lai the indirect effects of vpd lai vwc and rn through gs on et are shown by month in fig 11 vpd which can significantly affect gs was the primary indirect controlling factor of et the most significant negative indirect effect of vpd occurred in july which corresponded with the highest vpd values at the same time the highest positive indirect effect of lai on et was also founded in july which corresponded with the rapid growth period of maize the indirect effects of rn on et through gs were relatively low in each month although vwc cannot directly affect et in july it can indirectly affect et by affecting gs it is consistent with the results of the seasonal scale analysis 4 discussion 4 1 environmental and biological controls on evapotranspiration plant water use is influenced by both species type and the prevailing environmental conditions during the growing season xu et al 2018 the maximum gs values for maize and wheat 19 5 29 5 mm s 1 fig 4c were comparable with those reported by lei and yang 2010 in a similar rotation cropland in the north china plain 15 30 mm s 1 ding et al 2013 in maize fields in an arid region 20 mm s 1 and tian et al 2016 in cotton fields 13 20 mm s 1 lower than those reported by suyker and verma 2008 in maize and soybean fields in nebraska usa 30 40 mm s 1 et increases with gs but this relationship does not continue when gs is higher than a threshold value fig 8 there are numerous previous studies have demonstrated that the rn is the primary driver of et but the effect of the other environmental and biological factors varies with climate type and land surface generally the values of gs reflect the effects of biological factors on the seasonal variation in et and the values of eteq can reflect the effect of environmental factors on seasonal variation in et however gs was also affected by vpd and soil water content a study conducted by mcnaughton and spriggs 1986 reported that α was sensitive to gs when gs was less than a threshold value suyker and verma 2008 reported a consistent threshold of gs in a maize field the threshold gs at our site 10 mm s 1 was lower than the threshold gs values reported by lei and yang 2010 in a wheat maize rotation 15 20 mm s 1 ding et al 2013 in a maize field 20 mm s 1 and suyker and verma 2008 in a maize and soybean rotation 10 15 mm s 1 but slightly higher than the threshold gs value reported by tian et al 2016 in a cotton field in northwest china 8 mm s 1 the other studies have also reported this threshold phenomenon but the threshold varies with ecosystems and climates ryu et al 2008 zha et al 2013 ma et al 2015 tan et al 2019 marques et al 2020 for croplands with a large amount of irrigation such as the wheat maize rotation cropland in the north china plain the et was mainly controlled by rn therefore the α values could increase until gs reached a relatively high value for the yangling site due to the rn was significantly higher than that of weishan and luancheng the controlling effect of rn was lower than other mentioned sites thus the threshold of gs was lower that reported by lei and yang 2010 ding et al 2013 and suyker and verma 2008 the et in the cotton field was mainly controlled by soil moisture due to the sufficient rn it results that the threshold value of gs of the cotton was slightly lower than that of the maize at yangling the vpd had two paths that can affect et on the one hand a higher vpd will result in a higher et as it reflects a high vapor pressure difference between air and stomatal or soil pores which can enhance water vapor flow through stomata or the soil surface on the other hand the increasing vpd will reduce the stomatal aperture which will increase stomatal resistance and reduce et and was demonstrated in previous studies lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2016 suyker et al 2008 gong et al 2020 marques et al 2020 this study quantified the direct and indirect effects of vpd on et the increased flow through stomata as a function of vpd would be compensated for by reductions in stomatal aperture and increased flow rate through stomata as the path analysis of et showed the maize season gs was more sensitive to vpd than wheat season gs which indicates that the higher vpd in summer can significantly and indirectly reduced et this was due to decreasing stomatal conductance as vpd increased rodrigues et al 2014 these results are consistent with those in a maize ecosystem ding et al 2015 the direct effect of lai was relatively small in the monthly analysis the reason is that the variation of lai is small except for the rapid growth period of crop and the rotation period vwc had two paths that can indirectly affect et in the seasonal and interannual scale vwc can affect the development of lai furthermore vwc can directly and positively affect gs by decrease soil surface resistance and stomatal resistance then increasing soil evaporation and transpiration although the crop was rarely suffering moderate or severe water stress due to irrigation vwc was relatively low due to lack of irrigation and the et was mainly made up of soil evaporation when the wheat going into dormancy thus the direct effect of vwc can be found in november and december then the different effects of vwc for maize and season in fig 9 can be explained in addition there was a different effect of tair for the maize and wheat seasons in the monthly path analysis et was directly affected by tair in october november and february the air temperature in october november and february can significantly affect the emergency dormancy and returning green stages of winter wheat the transpiration of wheat will stop when wheat is experiencing dormancy and will increase when the wheat enters the returning green stage in warmer winter for wheat the dormancy date will be delayed and the returning green stage will advance which would increase et although the effect was relatively low in summer as the air temperature was high and the phenology of maize was usually controlled by soil water content rather than the air temperature therefore the significant direct effect of tair was not founded during the maize season the indirect effect of soil moisture on et through gs was relatively low for both wheat and maize because gs was less affected by soil moisture when soil moisture was relatively high xu et al 2018 the reason why vpd has a high indirect effect on et through gs in the monthly analysis is that increases in vapor flow through stomata as a function of vapor pressure deficit would be compensated for by reductions in stomatal aperture which was consistent with the results of the seasonal analysis figs 9 11 illustrate that path analysis can identify the primary factors controlling et 4 2 bowen ratio in various ecosystems of china the seasonal variation in daily β in the winter wheat and summer maize rotation agroecosystem near yangling china followed the pattern of a double u shaped curve with minimum values occurring in may and august each year fig 6c during the study period the mean values of β for the maize growing season the wheat growing season and annually were 0 59 0 50 and 0 53 respectively table 4 these values differ from those reported in other ecosystems such as spring maize grassland and forest gao et al 2018 li et al 2006 wilson and baldocchi 2000 as table 3 shows the β values during both the maize and wheat growing seasons on the guanzhong plain were higher than those reported on the north china plain lei and yang 2010 this may be attributed to the rn of yangling was much higher than that of weishan and luancheng owing to irrigation the annual et of this study was higher than that of a grassland on the loess plateau this leads to a much lower β compared to the grassland site ping et al 2018 this indicates that a high water consuming agroecosystem can significantly change its energy partitioning some periods of negative sensible heat flux were measured during the dormancy period of winter wheat in winter which can be attributed to the advection of h prueger et al 1996 and indicates that h can provide energy for evapotranspiration during the dormancy period lei and yang 2010 many studies have reported that changes in actual evapotranspiration are mainly affected by changes in precipitation rather than equilibrium evaporation in regions that are prone to drought such as the guanzhong plain but the reverse is true in humid regions yang et al 2007 however in agroecosystem studied here the variability in actual evapotranspiration was primarily explained by eteq and no significant relationship was found between et and precipitation this result indicates that the patterns of et and energy partitioning can be changed by human activity e g large amounts of irrigation large spatial scale irrigation results in sensible heat advection which subsequently affects local energy partitioning and the water cycle on an annual basis le consumed a large proportion of net radiation 62 6 which was slightly higher than those reported for maize and soybean fields in nebraska usa 60 suyker and verma 2008 maize wheat agroecosystems in the north china plain 59 lei and yang 2010 shen et al 2013 and a temperate mixed forest ecosystem in changbai mountain 52 wu et al 2007 but much higher that reported for a grassland ecosystem in the tibetan region 24 gu et al 2005 the mean value of daytime le rn g was about 66 9 in the wheat growing season and 63 5 in the summer maize growing season indicating that wheat consumed more water than maize for a given amount of energy 4 3 annual evapotranspiration for maize and wheat in various regions of china two of the most important grain crops worldwide maize and wheat are widely cultivated in north china it is vital to understand the differences in timing and amount of water use for these two crops in different regions therefore et for maize and wheat between different regions in north china was compared and the data is presented in table 5 summer maize generally has a lower et than that of spring maize due to its shorter growing season we did not find a significant relationship between et and precipitation as the irrigation mitigated the effects of low precipitation a comparison of the three main summer maize planting areas in china weishan luancheng and yangling lei and yang 2010 shen et al 2013 revealed that summer maize in yangling consumes more water than the other two locations the reason is that yangling has higher rn and vpd than weishan and luancheng yangling also had slightly lower winter wheat et than luancheng and slightly higher winter wheat et than weishan thus indicating that sufficient irrigation can change the pattern of water and energy partitioning relative to semi arid and humid regions in addition irrigated cropland in semi arid regions not only experiences lower precipitation than semi humid regions but also higher evaporative demand 5 conclusion ec observations of water and energy fluxes with good quality were made and path analysis of et with meteorological hydrological and biological factors was conducted in a typical irrigated winter wheat summer maize rotation field in the guanzhong plain from june 2013 to june 2018 the total et for each crop year was 645 627 753 775 and 739 mm from june 2013 to june 2018 average total evapotranspiration was 310 mm and 398 mm for the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively for both crops et increased rapidly with rapid canopy development reaching peak values when the canopy was fully developed the et decreased as the canopy senesced gs reached 19 5 and 29 5 mm s 1 in the maize and wheat growing seasons respectively for both maize and wheat daily β values were between 0 1 and 0 2 when lai reached maximum values and ranged from 1 5 to 2 9 during the rotation period the average β value in the five year study was 0 59 for maize and 0 53 for wheat rn was the primary controlling factor of et for both maize and wheat season also gs was another controlling factor that had more controlling power in maize season than in wheat season vpd had a significant positive and direct effect on et for both wheat and maize season whereas it had a significant negative and indirect effect on et through gs in the maize season vwc and tair only directly affect the wheat et in addition vwc had two significant paths that can indirectly affect et through lai and gs the understanding of the controlling factors of et provides the theoretical basis for quantifying crop water

9827,water scarcity adversely affects the growth and yield of summer maize in the semi arid region of northwest china and the application of irrigation technology to save water is an effective method for sustainable agricultural development in the area in order to evaluate the potential of different drip methods for increasing grain yield and water productivity wp a 2 year 2018 19 field experiments was conducted to study the effects of various drip irrigation methods on the biomass accumulation and translocation and grain filling progress the experiment involved three drip irrigation methods conventional surface drip irrigation cdi subsurface drip irrigation sdi and alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation in the soil vertical profile adi the results showed that the adi treatment had the highest above ground accumulation of biomass at the maturity stage however no statistically significant differences were observed in all the treatments the contribution of post silking biomass to grain yield was adi sdi cdi based on the two year average analysis of data the contribution of post silking biomass to the grain yield in adi was 3 6 and 7 0 higher than that in sdi and cdi respectively the maximum grain filling rate and the mean grain filling rate were the highest in the adi followed by sdi with cdi as the lowest the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time were the highest under adi and the lowest under cdi there was a positive correlation between the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time the adi treatment decreased the grain number per spike but significantly increased the kernel weight two years of mean data demonstrated that the grain yield of the adi was 6939 5 kg ha 1 which corresponded to increases of 4 8 and 13 3 from 6625 0 and 6126 5 kg ha 1 for sdi and cdi respectively for wp the difference between treatments followed a similar pattern in 2018 and 2019 i e the adi was significantly higher than the sdi while the sdi was significantly higher than the cdi taken together in addition to its potential for saving water adi has the additional advantage of promoting yield furthermore the findings can contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of biomass accumulation and grain filling process responses to drip irrigation methods keywords irrigation pattern biomass grain filling harvest index zea mays 1 introduction china is a populous country that contains approximately 25 of the world s population sial et al 2019 and this large population base increases the demand for food maize zea mays l is one of china s daily staple foods with an output of approximately 2 2 108 tonnes in 2017 gao et al 2020 and it plays a vital role in maintaining food security in china the guanzhong plain shaanxi province semiarid regions of northwest china is one of the traditional summer areas in which maize is produced yan et al 2020 however this region is characterized by limited irrigation water erratic rainfall and high evapotranspiration during the main growing period of summer maize all of which adversely affect the growth and yield formation of this crop yan et al 2020 therefore supplemental irrigation with efficient and reasonable water saving irrigation technology to improve crop yield and water productivity wp is a major initiative to safeguard agricultural production in the semiarid regions of china several new water saving irrigation techniques have been applied to improve the crop yield and wp including stage based deficit irrigation çakir 2004 subsurface drip irrigation al ghobari and dewidar 2018 and alternate partial root zone irrigation shu et al 2020 many studies have shown that stage based deficit irrigation can save water and produce relatively high yields by reducing the amount of irrigation at non critical growth stages of the crop igbadun et al 2007 subsurface drip irrigation has been found to enhance the photosynthetic activity of crops and significantly improve crop yield and wp ayars et al 1999 2015 xu et al 2011 controlled alternate root zone irrigation which alternately irrigates and dries the root zone of crops at a preset frequency is a representative method that saves water and results in optimal yields this irrigation method can regulate leaf stomatal openings by stimulating the production of abscisic acid aba and reducing the loss of water through transpiration resulting in the conservation of water and the maintenance of high photosynthetic product assimilation kang and zhang 2004 tang et al 2010 as shown by this analysis subsurface drip irrigation and controlled alternate root zone irrigation both effectively improved crop yields and wp therefore a new vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system can be formed by combining controlled alternate root zone irrigation with subsurface drip irrigation i e the alternate conduction of surface and subsurface drip irrigation we hypothesize that the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system will have the potential to further improve irrigation efficiency this is because the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system irrigates approximately half of the root system with a normal amount each time and the other half is always exposed to dry soil which is different from the traditional irrigation method chai et al 2015 this results in the stimulation of the generation and transmission of the signal for water deficit from the root zone of the dry part which induces the closure of the stomata as a means to reduce the water loss through transpiration liu et al 2006 sobeih et al 2004 alternatively the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system creates a stress rewater cycle pattern in the root zone of crops causing a compensatory effect of water uptake chai et al 2015 while also reducing the soil hypoxia caused by subsurface drip irrigation zhu et al 2019 the accumulation and distribution of biomass has a profound effect on plant growth and production and is influenced by soil water conditions poorter et al 2012 therefore the regulation of soil water conditions through different irrigation methods to optimize the accumulation of above ground biomass and its distribution between vegetative and reproductive organs is an effective way to maintain the high yield and stable production of plants particularly in semiarid environments kage et al 2004 poorter et al 2012 maize is a crop that uses the c4 photosynthetic pathway with a high yield potential xu et al 2009 and the study of its potential for high yield per plant is an important reference for grain yield per area improvement the grain filling stage is a vital phase during its growth cycle in which the final grain weight yield and quality of maize are determined li et al 2020 shen et al 2017 as information transfer substances plant hormones such as indole 3 acetic acid iaa and gibberellic acid ga play an essential role in crop growth and development especially grain filling endogenous grain hormones can significantly increase the rate and duration of filling by regulating grain development and grain assimilate metabolism ultimately increasing yield gao et al 2017 travaglia et al 2007 exploring the process of grain filling can contribute to both deepening the knowledge of process of grain weight formation and making effective interventions targeted for the critical process of grain filling thus the purpose of obtaining high yield and quality of maize would be achieved the effects of vertical alternating irrigation systems on grain irrigation and wp in field conditions have rarely been studied therefore in this study three irrigation methods namely surface drip irrigation subsurface drip irrigation and alternate drip irrigation in soil vertical profile were selected to investigate the effects of irrigation methods on biomass accumulation and transport grain filling characteristics yield and wp the purpose of this study was to reveal the differences in yield and wp of summer maize under different irrigation methods our results will be used to provide a scientific basis for the selection of water saving and high yield irrigation methods for summer maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil an orientation field plot experiment over a 2 year period 2018 2019 was conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of ministry of education 34 17 n 108 04 e altitude 521 m northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province china the experimental site has a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 630 mm an average annual temperature of 12 9 and an average evaporation of 1500 mm the depth of the groundwater table of this study area is located 5 m below the ground surface the field capacity of the 0 120 cm soil layer is 0 266 cm3 cm 3 the soil organic matter and total nitrogen of the 0 120 cm soil layer are 10 22 g kg 1and 0 64 g kg 1 respectively the main soil physical properties of the experimental site are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment established three irrigation methods including conventional surface drip irrigation cdi subsurface drip irrigation sdi and alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation in the soil vertical profile adi fig 1 all the experiments were repeated three times for each irrigation method and they were assigned to nine plots in a completely randomized block design the individual plots were 4 m long and 2 m wide the trial area was equipped with a movable rain proof rainout shelter which was closed during rainfall to eliminate the influence of rainfall on the results summer maize z mays l cv jixiang no 1 a local variety was planted in a wide narrow spacing pattern which was divided into wide 50 cm and narrow 40 cm row spacing fig 1 and the plants were spaced 30 cm within the row the planting dates were 15 june 2018 and 13 june 2019 and the harvest dates were 4 october 2018 and 30 september 2019 respectively a total of 180 35 and 50 kg ha 1 were the nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilization doses recommended for summer maize production in the local area and the fertilizer was applied using a fine trench which was dug 5 cm from the corn seeds and 8 cm deep yan et al 2020 the n p and k fertilizers used in the experiment were urea superphosphate and potassium chloride respectively the drip irrigation tubes 16 mm diameter and 0 38 mm wall thickness netafim limited company tel aviv hashalom israel were placed in the central part of each narrow row prior research has shown that driplines installed too deep are detrimental to the germination and development of shallow rooted crops lamm et al 2010 but installed too shallow may be disturbed by soil tillage lamm et al 2017 according to the investigation of farmers the commonly used rotary tillage depth in this study area is no more than 25 cm thus after comprehensive consideration the tubes used for subsurface drip irrigation were buried 30 cm below the ground a drip irrigation tube was used to irrigate two rows of maize fig 1 the emitter to emitter spacing was 30 cm and the flow rate under 0 1 mpa of each emitter was 1 05 l h 1 the discharge and pressure of the drip irrigation system were stable during the experiment each plot was connected with a high precision water meter and a control valve to control the irrigation water amount and each plot can be separately controlled since the moisture content of the top soil layer 0 30 cm was low before sowing to ensure uniform and rapid emergence and harden the seedlings each experimental plot was irrigated with 30 and 20 mm using the surface drip irrigation on 1 and 15 days after sowing respectively zhang et al 2017 zou et al 2020 the irrigation treatments were initiated using the three irrigation methods when summer maize was at the 6 leaf stage kang et al 2002 yan et al 2020 and discontinued prior to 10 20 days before harvest zou et al 2020 the maize was irrigated every 7 days during the treatment period and the amount of per irrigation was the sum of the daily crop evapotranspiration et c within 7 days of the last irrigation the scheme for irrigation implementation of summer maize in 2018 and 2019 is shown in table 2 et c was calculated as described in eq 1 1 e t c k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient for maize according to previous studies in local areas the k c was set to 0 7 from sowing to seeding stages yan et al 2020 to 1 04 from the jointing to filling stages wang et al 2020 and to 0 6 from the milk to maturity stages yan et al 2020 the daily et 0 reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 was determined by the penman monteith equation nakhforoosh et al 2016 the daily et 0 values of the experimental site during the two summer maize growth seasons are illustrated in fig 2 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpi a stainless steel soil auger was used to collect soil samples in each plot at the sowing and harvest stages the sampling depth was 0 120 cm and the sampling interval was 10 cm the soil samples were used to measure the moisture content of soil by oven drying for 48 h at 105 c moreover the soil samples were collected at distances of 0 20 between two plants and 45 cm from the midpoint of two emitters on a drip irrigation tube respectively the average value of three points was taken and repeated three times the water productivity wp kg m 3 and irrigation water productivity wpi kg m 3 were calculated as described by eqs 2 and 3 2 w p g y e t 3 w p i g y i where g y is the grain yield of summer maize in kg ha 1 i is the total amount of irrigation in the maize growth period m3 ha 1 and i in the growth period of summer maize in 2018 and 2019 was 309 2 and 301 8 mm respectively based on similar research in the same experimental area and considering that the water required for maize growth was supplied by irrigation water and that the depth of soil wetting after irrigation was shallow the amount of leakage into the lower boundary of the crop root layer could safely be ignored zou et al 2021 therefore et evapotranspiration can be calculated using eq 4 4 e t i 10 ρ h w 0 w 1 where ρ is the mean soli bulk density g cm 3 h is the soil sampling depth cm and w 0 and w 1 are the soil moisture content before sowing and after harvest g g 1 respectively 2 3 2 biomass accumulation and transport three randomly taken representative maize plants at the jointing twelve collars silking filling and maturity stages were used for measurements of the above ground dry weight through oven drying at 80 c for 48 h planchet et al 2011 the above ground parts were divided into culms leaves panicle axis and grains post silking biomass accumulation amount kg ha 1 was the difference between the biomass accumulation at silking stage and that at the maturity stage the contribution of biomass to grain cbg was defined as the biomass transfer amount as a percentage of the grain dry weight at the maturity stage qi et al 2020 2 3 3 grain filling process and endogenous hormones in grains three maize ears were randomly selected in the same plot and 100 kernels were taken from the middle of each ear the dry weight of kernels was determined using a microbalance sensitivity 1 10 000 after oven drying the samples were taken every 6 d at the beginning of the silking stage for a total of seven times a logistic equation y a 1 b e k t in which y and a are the measured and theoretical maximal value of the 100 kernel dry weight g respectively t is the days after silking d and b and k are the parameters that were fitted with the days after silking as the dependent variable and the 100 kernel dry weight as the independent variable fang et al 2020 li et al 2020 based on the logistic equation parameters obtained the following grain filling characteristic parameters were calculated as the following eqs 5 8

immunosorbent assay elisa liang et al 2017 2 3 4 grain yield and harvest index when the maize was mature the middle two rows of maize cobs in each plot were picked and threshed after air drying to determine the yield and yield components grain number per panicle and 100 kernel weight the harvest index hi was calculated as the grain yield divided by the total above ground biomass at physiological maturity hütsch and schubert 2017 2 4 statistical analysis spss 18 0 ibm inc armonk ny usa was used to carry out the analysis of variance between treatments using the least significant difference lsd with the significance level set at p 0 05 originpro 2020b learning edition originlab corporation northampton ma usa was used to draw the figures 3 results 3 1 effects of irrigation methods on the accumulation of above ground biomass in maize from the overall trend the above ground biomass growth of each treatment had a similar trend during the two study years 2018 2019 i e gradual growth at the jointing stage and the maintenance of a subsequently faster growth trend followed by slower growth at the later stage fig 3 no significant differences were observed between the different irrigation methods in terms of the accumulation of biomass at the jointing filling and maturity stages at the twelve collars and silking stages the accumulation of above ground biomass of the cdi treatment was significantly higher than that in the sdi and adi treatments at the maturity stage the accumulation of above ground biomass of the adi treatment was the largest the cdi treatment was the smallest and the sdi treatment was in the middle the two year average of biomass values under adi increased by 1 0 and 5 5 over those of sdi and cdi respectively 3 2 effects of irrigation methods on the translocation of biomass and its rate of contribution to grain based on the data from our 2 year study fig 4 there was a significant effect of irrigation methods on the ratio of pre silking and post silking biomass to the total biomass of summer maize a two year average of data indicated that the proportion of biomass accumulation to the total biomass of adi 42 6 was significantly higher than those of sdi and cdi 40 7 and 37 3 after the silking stage in terms of the contribution of post silking dry matter to grain numerically the two year data follow the order of adi sdi cdi but there was no significant difference between sdi and cdi in 2019 3 3 effects of irrigation methods on the grain filling process of maize 3 3 1 grain weight and grain filling rate the dynamic process of the growth of 100 kernel weight under different irrigation methods showed a regular curvilinear trend which can be seen as s shaped and the 100 kernel weight continually increased after the silking stage fig 5 after 42 days of silking the two year average of 100 kernel weight values in the adi treatment was higher than those in cdi and sdi but there were no significant differences between the adi and sdi treatments as shown in fig 5 the grain filling rate of each treatment increased first and then decreased with the developmental process all the treatments reached their highest values on the 24th day of silking and the peak value of grain filling rate was adi sdi cdi after reaching the peak of filling rate the grain filling rate of adi decreased the most slowly followed by sdi and the grain filling rate of cdi decreased the fastest the results of the two year study revealed very similar conclusions 3 3 2 based logistic model fitting of grain filling process and parametric analysis the logistic equation was used to fit the 100 kernel weight and the number of days after silking for each treatment and the grain filling rate and other parameters of the different treatments were obtained from table 3 it is clear that the coefficients of determination are between 0 984 and 0 999 which indicates that the logistic equation effectively mimics the seed grouting process of each treatment as shown in table 3 at each irrigation method there was a significant difference between the grain filling parameters in terms of the grain filling rate the maximum grain filling rate vmax and the mean grain filling rate vmean of the adi treatment were the highest followed by the sdi treatment and the cdi treatment was the smallest the analysis of the size of data value from the grain filling time was found to exhibit a similar pattern i e the values of active grain filling period p and the effective grain filling time t followed the order of adi sdi cdi the parameters including vmax vmean and t had the same statistically significant difference among the treatments during both study years the parameter p differed significantly between the three treatments in 2018 but the difference between sdi and cdi treatments in 2019 was not significant 3 4 effects of irrigation methods on hormonal contents of maize with regard to indole 3 acetic acid iaa content all the three treatment groups showed a single peak curve and the peak value appeared at 18 das fig 6a and b the peak value of iaa content between treatments was 170 8 221 2 ng g 1 in 2018 and 158 5 210 9 ng g 1 in 2019 during the whole grain filling stage the iaa content of the adi treatment was higher than that of the other treatments the gibberellic acid ga content in year 2018 had similar changing trends as in year 2019 that is the ga content decreased gradually as the number of days after silking increases fig 6c and d during the whole grain filling stage the ga of the adi treatment was higher than that of the other treatments on the contrary the cdi treatment was the lowest 3 5 effects of irrigation methods on the yield and yield components of maize as shown in table 4 in 2018 the grain yield was the highest in the adi treatment followed by sdi treatment while cdi was the lowest and all the treatments had statistically significant differences p 0 05 in 2019 the grain yield of adi treatment was significantly higher than that of the cdi treatment p 0 05 but it was not significantly different from that of the sdi treatment two years of mean data demonstrated that the grain yield of the adi was 6939 5 kg ha 1 which corresponded to increases of 4 8 and 13 3 from 6625 0 and 6126 5 kg ha 1 for sdi and cdi the grain number per spike over the two years of experimentation revealed that the highest and the lowest grain numbers per spike were identified in the cdi and adi treatments respectively the difference between cdi and adi was significant and sdi showed no significant difference in grain number per spike compared with that of cdi and adi the order of 100 kernel weight of the treatments was as follows adi sdi cdi and the differences between all treatments were significant at the 100 kernel weight the hi had the same statistically significant difference among the treatments during both study years and the minimum and maximum values of hi belonged to adi and cdi respectively and sdi exhibited intermediate values 3 6 correlation analysis from the correlation plot of fig 7 it was clear that grain yield positively correlated with t and rpbtb r 0 956 and 0 974 respectively at the 0 01 level and p and cbg r 0 886 and 0 823 respectively at the 0 05 level the grain yield positively correlated with vmax but negatively correlated with vmean and neither interaction effect was significant aside from a significant correlation between vmax and cbg all the other correlations were not significant fig 7 vmean positively correlated with vmax and cbg and none of the correlations were significant p was positively and statistically significantly correlated with t and cbg while p was positively and statistically extremely significantly correlated with rpbtb t had an extremely significantly positive correlation with rpbtb and a significantly positively correlation with cbg there was a significant positive correlation between t and rpbtb 3 7 effects of irrigation methods on the utilization of soil water for maize in the case of et cdi was the highest among the three treatments during the duration of 2 year study and its difference with sdi and adi reached a significant level p 0 05 while the difference between sdi and adi was not significant the wp had the same statistically significant difference among the treatments in the two study years and the minimum and maximum values of wp were found in adi and cdi respectively and si exhibited intermediate values the wpi values were in the order of adi sdi cdi in 2018 there were no significant differences between sdi and adi and between sdi and cdi but adi was significantly higher than cdi p 0 05 all the differences between treatments reached a significant level in 2019 the aforementioned results were noticeable in fig 8 4 discussion maize grain yield is calculated as the product of biomass and hi that is to say biomass and hi could be considered as factors determining the grain yield huang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 many studies concluded that it is difficult to increase the hi in maize production therefore the efforts to increase yields have primarily focused on increasing biomass di matteo et al 2016 other studies reached different conclusions they found that high yielding maize production was achieved as the result of an increase in both the hi and biomass echarte et al 2008 this study found that the high yielding treatments had higher biomass and hi than the other treatments i e both hi and biomass played a role in the increase in yield from conventional surface drip irrigation to alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation this was probably owing to the fact that alternate irrigation creates a soil water environment with dry wet cycles in the root zone in this environment both the upper and lower roots of maize can maintain the ability to generate and regulate deficit signals thus causing various physiological and chemical changes to adapt to the changes of soil moisture hu et al 2010 and ultimately promoting the growth of crops and improvement in biomass the adi treatment had the highest hi values table 4 probably because alternate irrigation reduces the luxury water use of crops and reduces the vigor of canopies du et al 2008a this results in an optimal distribution of biomass between the different organs of the crop and minimizes redundancy growth du et al 2008b previous studies had shown that the production and distribution of post silking biomass has an important impact on yield simmons and jones 1985 this study showed that there is a highly significant positive correlation between the ratio of post silking biomass to the total biomass and yield correlation coefficient of 0 974 p 0 01 and a significant positive correlation between the contribution of post silking biomass to grain and yield correlation coefficient of 0 823 p 0 05 fig 6 indeed the variation in differences in the accumulation and distribution of biomass between treatments was eventually mirrored in yield levels the ratio of post silking biomass to total biomass was significantly higher in the alternate drip irrigation treatments than in the other treatment groups and the ability to transfer and distribute post silking biomass to the grain was higher in the adi treatments than in the other treatment fig 4 these factors all resulted in higher yields the process by which biomass is distributed to the grain can be seen as a sink component of the crop s physiological process and grain filling is the result of the transport of biomass to the sink in this study the grain filling process showed an s shaped growth curve fig 3 which was ideally simulated using logistic functions similar to the study by li 2020 there are different theories on the effect of the grain filling process on yield one theory is that the main determinant of yield is the time of duration of grain filling bolaños 1995 the alternate theory is that the grain filling rate is the main limiting factor in yield improvement ottaviano and camussi 1981 however in contrast to these two theories there is also research that suggests that the grain weight is determined by both the grain filling duration time and grain filling rate li et al 2020 in this study the correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time and yield fig 6 combined with the fact that active grain filling period and effective grain filling time were higher in the adi treatment than in the other treatments table 3 this suggests that the time of duration of grain filling was an important factor in improving maize yield as proposed by bolaños 1995 studies have shown that plant hormone such as iaa and ga plays a crucial role in grain filling and they can significantly increase the duration of filling by regulating grain development and grain assimilation metabolism gao 2017 travaglia et al 2007 this explains the higher active grain filling period and effective grain filling time in the adi treatment than the other treatments at the level of hormone content the grain number per spike and kernel weight was an important constituent variable for yield in the context of sink in this study the grain number per spike of adi treatment was lower than that of the other treatment groups this was because more aba was produced in the root tips under alternate irrigation conditions tang et al 2010 and the core of the top ear area was aborted under the action of aba ober et al 1991 wang et al 2002 however the grain yield of adi treatment was the highest because the kernel weight of the treatment was significantly higher than that of other treatments table 4 and the kernel weight compensated for the loss of grain abortion hütsch et al 2015 hütsch and schubert 2017 one of the ultimate goals of agricultural irrigation is to maximize the production per unit of crop water consumption zhang et al 2017 previous studies indicated that different irrigation methods have varying water saving effects and there are two main pathways to improve the wp the first pathway is to obtain the same yield using less irrigation water zhang et al 2017 while the second pathway is to obtain a higher yield using the same amount of irrigation water xu et al 2018 in this study under the premise of applying the same amount of irrigation the wp of the adi treatment was significantly greater than that of the other irrigation treatments fig 7 owing to an increase in the maize grain yield table 4 and a decrease in the et fig 7 the possible reasons for the increase in yield have been discussed in the previous part and the reason for the decrease in et may be that alternate drip irrigation can reduce plant transpiration and soil evaporation kang et al 2002 tang et al 2010 the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system as a combination of surface and subsurface drip irrigation has two advantages one of which is that it can overcome the disadvantages of subsurface drip irrigation such as the delayed emergence of seedlings mo et al 2020 and the exposure of roots to hypoxia zhu et al 2019 the second is that it is characterized by alternate partial root zone irrigation which uses a root zone signal feedback mechanism to achieve physiological water savings additionally with the increasing stability and durability of underground drip irrigation systems there was no need to reinstall and dismantle tubes at the beginning and end of each growing season resulting in a relatively low annual production investment ayars et al 1999 on the other hand studies have established that fruit trees have wider root systems than general field crops and are better equipped for alternate partial root zone irrigation making them the focus of future research on alternate partial root zone irrigation du et al 2005 hence we hope that the exploration of this experiment can provide guidance for the application of this vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system to economic crops such as fruit trees in view of these findings the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system should have been highly applicable with strong prospects in the irrigation practice of grain and fruit trees in the semi arid region of northwest china 5 conclusions the present study demonstrated that alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation in soil vertical profile adi had positive effects on improving yield compared with the sdi and cdi treatments the adi treatment increased the ratio of post silking biomass to total biomass the contribution of post silking biomass to grain yield and extended the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time which provided the physiological basis to achieve a high yield of summer maize in addition the adi treatment was also significantly higher than those of sdi and cdi in terms of the wp these findings indicate that adi combines the advantages of both water savings and high yield so it is a feasible

9827,water scarcity adversely affects the growth and yield of summer maize in the semi arid region of northwest china and the application of irrigation technology to save water is an effective method for sustainable agricultural development in the area in order to evaluate the potential of different drip methods for increasing grain yield and water productivity wp a 2 year 2018 19 field experiments was conducted to study the effects of various drip irrigation methods on the biomass accumulation and translocation and grain filling progress the experiment involved three drip irrigation methods conventional surface drip irrigation cdi subsurface drip irrigation sdi and alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation in the soil vertical profile adi the results showed that the adi treatment had the highest above ground accumulation of biomass at the maturity stage however no statistically significant differences were observed in all the treatments the contribution of post silking biomass to grain yield was adi sdi cdi based on the two year average analysis of data the contribution of post silking biomass to the grain yield in adi was 3 6 and 7 0 higher than that in sdi and cdi respectively the maximum grain filling rate and the mean grain filling rate were the highest in the adi followed by sdi with cdi as the lowest the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time were the highest under adi and the lowest under cdi there was a positive correlation between the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time the adi treatment decreased the grain number per spike but significantly increased the kernel weight two years of mean data demonstrated that the grain yield of the adi was 6939 5 kg ha 1 which corresponded to increases of 4 8 and 13 3 from 6625 0 and 6126 5 kg ha 1 for sdi and cdi respectively for wp the difference between treatments followed a similar pattern in 2018 and 2019 i e the adi was significantly higher than the sdi while the sdi was significantly higher than the cdi taken together in addition to its potential for saving water adi has the additional advantage of promoting yield furthermore the findings can contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of biomass accumulation and grain filling process responses to drip irrigation methods keywords irrigation pattern biomass grain filling harvest index zea mays 1 introduction china is a populous country that contains approximately 25 of the world s population sial et al 2019 and this large population base increases the demand for food maize zea mays l is one of china s daily staple foods with an output of approximately 2 2 108 tonnes in 2017 gao et al 2020 and it plays a vital role in maintaining food security in china the guanzhong plain shaanxi province semiarid regions of northwest china is one of the traditional summer areas in which maize is produced yan et al 2020 however this region is characterized by limited irrigation water erratic rainfall and high evapotranspiration during the main growing period of summer maize all of which adversely affect the growth and yield formation of this crop yan et al 2020 therefore supplemental irrigation with efficient and reasonable water saving irrigation technology to improve crop yield and water productivity wp is a major initiative to safeguard agricultural production in the semiarid regions of china several new water saving irrigation techniques have been applied to improve the crop yield and wp including stage based deficit irrigation çakir 2004 subsurface drip irrigation al ghobari and dewidar 2018 and alternate partial root zone irrigation shu et al 2020 many studies have shown that stage based deficit irrigation can save water and produce relatively high yields by reducing the amount of irrigation at non critical growth stages of the crop igbadun et al 2007 subsurface drip irrigation has been found to enhance the photosynthetic activity of crops and significantly improve crop yield and wp ayars et al 1999 2015 xu et al 2011 controlled alternate root zone irrigation which alternately irrigates and dries the root zone of crops at a preset frequency is a representative method that saves water and results in optimal yields this irrigation method can regulate leaf stomatal openings by stimulating the production of abscisic acid aba and reducing the loss of water through transpiration resulting in the conservation of water and the maintenance of high photosynthetic product assimilation kang and zhang 2004 tang et al 2010 as shown by this analysis subsurface drip irrigation and controlled alternate root zone irrigation both effectively improved crop yields and wp therefore a new vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system can be formed by combining controlled alternate root zone irrigation with subsurface drip irrigation i e the alternate conduction of surface and subsurface drip irrigation we hypothesize that the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system will have the potential to further improve irrigation efficiency this is because the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system irrigates approximately half of the root system with a normal amount each time and the other half is always exposed to dry soil which is different from the traditional irrigation method chai et al 2015 this results in the stimulation of the generation and transmission of the signal for water deficit from the root zone of the dry part which induces the closure of the stomata as a means to reduce the water loss through transpiration liu et al 2006 sobeih et al 2004 alternatively the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system creates a stress rewater cycle pattern in the root zone of crops causing a compensatory effect of water uptake chai et al 2015 while also reducing the soil hypoxia caused by subsurface drip irrigation zhu et al 2019 the accumulation and distribution of biomass has a profound effect on plant growth and production and is influenced by soil water conditions poorter et al 2012 therefore the regulation of soil water conditions through different irrigation methods to optimize the accumulation of above ground biomass and its distribution between vegetative and reproductive organs is an effective way to maintain the high yield and stable production of plants particularly in semiarid environments kage et al 2004 poorter et al 2012 maize is a crop that uses the c4 photosynthetic pathway with a high yield potential xu et al 2009 and the study of its potential for high yield per plant is an important reference for grain yield per area improvement the grain filling stage is a vital phase during its growth cycle in which the final grain weight yield and quality of maize are determined li et al 2020 shen et al 2017 as information transfer substances plant hormones such as indole 3 acetic acid iaa and gibberellic acid ga play an essential role in crop growth and development especially grain filling endogenous grain hormones can significantly increase the rate and duration of filling by regulating grain development and grain assimilate metabolism ultimately increasing yield gao et al 2017 travaglia et al 2007 exploring the process of grain filling can contribute to both deepening the knowledge of process of grain weight formation and making effective interventions targeted for the critical process of grain filling thus the purpose of obtaining high yield and quality of maize would be achieved the effects of vertical alternating irrigation systems on grain irrigation and wp in field conditions have rarely been studied therefore in this study three irrigation methods namely surface drip irrigation subsurface drip irrigation and alternate drip irrigation in soil vertical profile were selected to investigate the effects of irrigation methods on biomass accumulation and transport grain filling characteristics yield and wp the purpose of this study was to reveal the differences in yield and wp of summer maize under different irrigation methods our results will be used to provide a scientific basis for the selection of water saving and high yield irrigation methods for summer maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil an orientation field plot experiment over a 2 year period 2018 2019 was conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of ministry of education 34 17 n 108 04 e altitude 521 m northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province china the experimental site has a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 630 mm an average annual temperature of 12 9 and an average evaporation of 1500 mm the depth of the groundwater table of this study area is located 5 m below the ground surface the field capacity of the 0 120 cm soil layer is 0 266 cm3 cm 3 the soil organic matter and total nitrogen of the 0 120 cm soil layer are 10 22 g kg 1and 0 64 g kg 1 respectively the main soil physical properties of the experimental site are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment established three irrigation methods including conventional surface drip irrigation cdi subsurface drip irrigation sdi and alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation in the soil vertical profile adi fig 1 all the experiments were repeated three times for each irrigation method and they were assigned to nine plots in a completely randomized block design the individual plots were 4 m long and 2 m wide the trial area was equipped with a movable rain proof rainout shelter which was closed during rainfall to eliminate the influence of rainfall on the results summer maize z mays l cv jixiang no 1 a local variety was planted in a wide narrow spacing pattern which was divided into wide 50 cm and narrow 40 cm row spacing fig 1 and the plants were spaced 30 cm within the row the planting dates were 15 june 2018 and 13 june 2019 and the harvest dates were 4 october 2018 and 30 september 2019 respectively a total of 180 35 and 50 kg ha 1 were the nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilization doses recommended for summer maize production in the local area and the fertilizer was applied using a fine trench which was dug 5 cm from the corn seeds and 8 cm deep yan et al 2020 the n p and k fertilizers used in the experiment were urea superphosphate and potassium chloride respectively the drip irrigation tubes 16 mm diameter and 0 38 mm wall thickness netafim limited company tel aviv hashalom israel were placed in the central part of each narrow row prior research has shown that driplines installed too deep are detrimental to the germination and development of shallow rooted crops lamm et al 2010 but installed too shallow may be disturbed by soil tillage lamm et al 2017 according to the investigation of farmers the commonly used rotary tillage depth in this study area is no more than 25 cm thus after comprehensive consideration the tubes used for subsurface drip irrigation were buried 30 cm below the ground a drip irrigation tube was used to irrigate two rows of maize fig 1 the emitter to emitter spacing was 30 cm and the flow rate under 0 1 mpa of each emitter was 1 05 l h 1 the discharge and pressure of the drip irrigation system were stable during the experiment each plot was connected with a high precision water meter and a control valve to control the irrigation water amount and each plot can be separately controlled since the moisture content of the top soil layer 0 30 cm was low before sowing to ensure uniform and rapid emergence and harden the seedlings each experimental plot was irrigated with 30 and 20 mm using the surface drip irrigation on 1 and 15 days after sowing respectively zhang et al 2017 zou et al 2020 the irrigation treatments were initiated using the three irrigation methods when summer maize was at the 6 leaf stage kang et al 2002 yan et al 2020 and discontinued prior to 10 20 days before harvest zou et al 2020 the maize was irrigated every 7 days during the treatment period and the amount of per irrigation was the sum of the daily crop evapotranspiration et c within 7 days of the last irrigation the scheme for irrigation implementation of summer maize in 2018 and 2019 is shown in table 2 et c was calculated as described in eq 1 1 e t c k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient for maize according to previous studies in local areas the k c was set to 0 7 from sowing to seeding stages yan et al 2020 to 1 04 from the jointing to filling stages wang et al 2020 and to 0 6 from the milk to maturity stages yan et al 2020 the daily et 0 reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 was determined by the penman monteith equation nakhforoosh et al 2016 the daily et 0 values of the experimental site during the two summer maize growth seasons are illustrated in fig 2 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpi a stainless steel soil auger was used to collect soil samples in each plot at the sowing and harvest stages the sampling depth was 0 120 cm and the sampling interval was 10 cm the soil samples were used to measure the moisture content of soil by oven drying for 48 h at 105 c moreover the soil samples were collected at distances of 0 20 between two plants and 45 cm from the midpoint of two emitters on a drip irrigation tube respectively the average value of three points was taken and repeated three times the water productivity wp kg m 3 and irrigation water productivity wpi kg m 3 were calculated as described by eqs 2 and 3 2 w p g y e t 3 w p i g y i where g y is the grain yield of summer maize in kg ha 1 i is the total amount of irrigation in the maize growth period m3 ha 1 and i in the growth period of summer maize in 2018 and 2019 was 309 2 and 301 8 mm respectively based on similar research in the same experimental area and considering that the water required for maize growth was supplied by irrigation water and that the depth of soil wetting after irrigation was shallow the amount of leakage into the lower boundary of the crop root layer could safely be ignored zou et al 2021 therefore et evapotranspiration can be calculated using eq 4 4 e t i 10 ρ h w 0 w 1 where ρ is the mean soli bulk density g cm 3 h is the soil sampling depth cm and w 0 and w 1 are the soil moisture content before sowing and after harvest g g 1 respectively 2 3 2 biomass accumulation and transport three randomly taken representative maize plants at the jointing twelve collars silking filling and maturity stages were used for measurements of the above ground dry weight through oven drying at 80 c for 48 h planchet et al 2011 the above ground parts were divided into culms leaves panicle axis and grains post silking biomass accumulation amount kg ha 1 was the difference between the biomass accumulation at silking stage and that at the maturity stage the contribution of biomass to grain cbg was defined as the biomass transfer amount as a percentage of the grain dry weight at the maturity stage qi et al 2020 2 3 3 grain filling process and endogenous hormones in grains three maize ears were randomly selected in the same plot and 100 kernels were taken from the middle of each ear the dry weight of kernels was determined using a microbalance sensitivity 1 10 000 after oven drying the samples were taken every 6 d at the beginning of the silking stage for a total of seven times a logistic equation y a 1 b e k t in which y and a are the measured and theoretical maximal value of the 100 kernel dry weight g respectively t is the days after silking d and b and k are the parameters that were fitted with the days after silking as the dependent variable and the 100 kernel dry weight as the independent variable fang et al 2020 li et al 2020 based on the logistic equation parameters obtained the following grain filling characteristic parameters were calculated as the following eqs 5 8

were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for 0 5 h and then kept in the fridge 40 c the content of indole 3 acetic acid iaa and gibberellic acid ga were was determined via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa liang et al 2017 2 3 4 grain yield and harvest index when the maize was mature the middle two rows of maize cobs in each plot were picked and threshed after air drying to determine the yield and yield components grain number per panicle and 100 kernel weight the harvest index hi was calculated as the grain yield divided by the total above ground biomass at physiological maturity hütsch and schubert 2017 2 4 statistical analysis spss 18 0 ibm inc armonk ny usa was used to carry out the analysis of variance between treatments using the least significant

methods on the accumulation of above ground biomass in maize from the overall trend the above ground biomass growth of each treatment had a similar trend during the two study years 2018 2019 i e gradual growth at the jointing stage and the maintenance of a subsequently faster growth trend followed by slower growth at the later stage fig 3 no significant differences were observed between the different irrigation methods in terms of the accumulation of biomass at the jointing filling and maturity stages at the twelve collars and silking stages the accumulation of above ground biomass of the cdi treatment was significantly higher than that in the sdi and adi treatments at the maturity stage the accumulation of above ground biomass of the adi treatment was the largest the cdi treatment was the smallest and the sdi treatment was in the middle the two year average of biomass values under adi increased by 1 0 and 5 5 over those of sdi and cdi respectively 3 2 effects of irrigation methods on the translocation of biomass and its rate of contribution to grain based on the data from our 2 year study fig 4 there was a significant effect of irrigation methods on the ratio of pre silking and post silking biomass to the total biomass of summer maize a two year average of data indicated that the proportion of biomass accumulation to the total biomass of adi 42 6 was significantly higher than those of sdi and cdi 40 7 and 37 3 after the silking stage in terms of the contribution of post silking dry matter to grain numerically the two year data follow the order of adi sdi cdi but there was no significant difference between sdi and cdi in 2019 3 3 effects of irrigation methods on the grain filling process of maize 3 3 1 grain weight and grain filling rate the dynamic process of the growth of 100 kernel weight under different irrigation methods showed a regular curvilinear trend which can be seen as s shaped and the 100 kernel weight continually increased after the silking stage fig 5 after 42 days of silking the two year average of 100 kernel weight values in the adi treatment was higher than those in cdi and sdi but there were no significant differences between the adi and sdi treatments as shown in fig 5 the grain filling rate of each treatment increased first and then decreased with the developmental process all the treatments reached their highest values on the 24th day of silking and the peak value of grain filling rate was adi sdi cdi after reaching the peak of filling rate the grain filling rate of adi decreased the most slowly followed by sdi and the grain filling rate of cdi decreased the fastest the results of the two year study revealed very similar conclusions 3 3 2 based logistic model fitting of grain filling process and parametric analysis the logistic equation was used to fit the 100 kernel weight and the number of days after silking for each treatment and the grain filling rate and other parameters of the different treatments were obtained from table 3 it is clear that the coefficients of determination are between 0 984 and 0 999 which indicates that the logistic equation effectively mimics the seed grouting process of each treatment as shown in table 3 at each irrigation method there was a significant difference between the grain filling parameters in terms of the grain filling rate the maximum grain filling rate vmax and the mean grain filling rate vmean of the adi treatment were the highest followed by the sdi treatment and the cdi treatment was the smallest the analysis of the size of data value from the grain filling time was found to exhibit a similar pattern i e the values of active grain filling period p and the effective grain filling time t followed the order of adi sdi cdi the parameters including vmax vmean and t had the same statistically significant difference among the treatments during both study years the parameter p differed significantly between the three treatments in 2018 but the difference between sdi and cdi treatments in 2019 was not significant 3 4 effects of irrigation methods on hormonal contents of maize with regard to indole 3 acetic acid iaa content all the three treatment groups showed a single peak curve and the peak value appeared at 18 das fig 6a and b the peak value of iaa content between treatments was 170 8 221 2 ng g 1 in 2018 and 158 5 210 9 ng g 1 in 2019 during the whole grain filling stage the iaa content of the adi treatment was higher than that of the other treatments the gibberellic acid ga content in year 2018 had similar changing trends as in year 2019 that is the ga content decreased gradually as the number of days after silking increases fig 6c and d during the whole grain filling stage the ga of the adi treatment was higher than that of the other treatments on the contrary the cdi treatment was the lowest 3 5 effects of irrigation methods on the yield and yield components of maize as shown in table 4 in 2018 the grain yield was the highest in the adi treatment followed by sdi treatment while cdi was the lowest and all the treatments had statistically significant differences p 0 05 in 2019 the grain yield of adi treatment was significantly higher than that of the cdi treatment p 0 05 but it was not significantly different from that of the sdi treatment two years of mean data demonstrated that the grain yield of the adi was 6939 5 kg ha 1 which corresponded to increases of 4 8 and 13 3 from 6625 0 and 6126 5 kg ha 1 for sdi and cdi the grain number per spike over the two years of experimentation revealed that the highest and the lowest grain numbers per spike were identified in the cdi and adi treatments respectively the difference between cdi and adi was significant and sdi showed no significant difference in grain number per spike compared with that of cdi and adi the order of 100 kernel weight of the treatments was as follows adi sdi cdi and the differences between all treatments were significant at the 100 kernel weight the hi had the same statistically significant difference among the treatments during both study years and the minimum and maximum values of hi belonged to adi and cdi respectively and sdi exhibited intermediate values 3 6 correlation analysis from the correlation plot of fig 7 it was clear that grain yield positively correlated with t and rpbtb r 0 956 and 0 974 respectively at the 0 01 level and p and cbg r 0 886 and 0 823 respectively at the 0 05 level the grain yield positively correlated with vmax but negatively correlated with vmean and neither interaction effect was significant aside from a significant correlation between vmax and cbg all the other correlations were not significant fig 7 vmean positively correlated with vmax and cbg and none of the correlations were significant p was positively and statistically significantly correlated with t and cbg while p was positively and statistically extremely significantly correlated with rpbtb t had an extremely significantly positive correlation with rpbtb and a significantly positively correlation with cbg there was a significant positive correlation between t and rpbtb 3 7 effects of irrigation methods on the utilization of soil water for maize in the case of et cdi was the highest among the three treatments during the duration of 2 year study and its difference with sdi and adi reached a significant level p 0 05 while the difference between sdi and adi was not significant the wp had the same statistically significant difference among the treatments in the two study years and the minimum and maximum values of wp were found in adi and cdi respectively and si exhibited intermediate values the wpi values were in the order of adi sdi cdi in 2018 there were no significant differences between sdi and adi and between sdi and cdi but adi was significantly higher than cdi p 0 05 all the differences between treatments reached a significant level in 2019 the aforementioned results were noticeable in fig 8 4 discussion maize grain yield is calculated as the product of biomass and hi that is to say biomass and hi could be considered as factors determining the grain yield huang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 many studies concluded that it is difficult to increase the hi in maize production therefore the efforts to increase yields have primarily focused on increasing biomass di matteo et al 2016 other studies reached different conclusions they found that high yielding maize production was achieved as the result of an increase in both the hi and biomass echarte et al 2008 this study found that the high yielding treatments had higher biomass and hi than the other treatments i e both hi and biomass played a role in the increase in yield from conventional surface drip irrigation to alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation this was probably owing to the fact that alternate irrigation creates a soil water environment with dry wet cycles in the root zone in this environment both the upper and lower roots of maize can maintain the ability to generate and regulate deficit signals thus causing various physiological and chemical changes to adapt to the changes of soil moisture hu et al 2010 and ultimately promoting the growth of crops and improvement in biomass the adi treatment had the highest hi values table 4 probably because alternate irrigation reduces the luxury water use of crops and reduces the vigor of canopies du et al 2008a this results in an optimal distribution of biomass between the different organs of the crop and minimizes redundancy growth du et al 2008b previous studies had shown that the production and distribution of post silking biomass has an important impact on yield simmons and jones 1985 this study showed that there is a highly significant positive correlation between the ratio of post silking biomass to the total biomass and yield correlation coefficient of 0 974 p 0 01 and a significant positive correlation between the contribution of post silking biomass to grain and yield correlation coefficient of 0 823 p 0 05 fig 6 indeed the variation in differences in the accumulation and distribution of biomass between treatments was eventually mirrored in yield levels the ratio of post silking biomass to total biomass was significantly higher in the alternate drip irrigation treatments than in the other treatment groups and the ability to transfer and distribute post silking biomass to the grain was higher in the adi treatments than in the other treatment fig 4 these factors all resulted in higher yields the process by which biomass is distributed to the grain can be seen as a sink component of the crop s physiological process and grain filling is the result of the transport of biomass to the sink in this study the grain filling process showed an s shaped growth curve fig 3 which was ideally simulated using logistic functions similar to the study by li 2020 there are different theories on the effect of the grain filling process on yield one theory is that the main determinant of yield is the time of duration of grain filling bolaños 1995 the alternate theory is that the grain filling rate is the main limiting factor in yield improvement ottaviano and camussi 1981 however in contrast to these two theories there is also research that suggests that the grain weight is determined by both the grain filling duration time and grain filling rate li et al 2020 in this study the correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time and yield fig 6 combined with the fact that active grain filling period and effective grain filling time were higher in the adi treatment than in the other treatments table 3 this suggests that the time of duration of grain filling was an important factor in improving maize yield as proposed by bolaños 1995 studies have shown that plant hormone such as iaa and ga plays a crucial role in grain filling and they can significantly increase the duration of filling by regulating grain development and grain assimilation metabolism gao 2017 travaglia et al 2007 this explains the higher active grain filling period and effective grain filling time in the adi treatment than the other treatments at the level of hormone content the grain number per spike and kernel weight was an important constituent variable for yield in the context of sink in this study the grain number per spike of adi treatment was lower than that of the other treatment groups this was because more aba was produced in the root tips under alternate irrigation conditions tang et al 2010 and the core of the top ear area was aborted under the action of aba ober et al 1991 wang et al 2002 however the grain yield of adi treatment was the highest because the kernel weight of the treatment was significantly higher than that of other treatments table 4 and the kernel weight compensated for the loss of grain abortion hütsch et al 2015 hütsch and schubert 2017 one of the ultimate goals of agricultural irrigation is to maximize the production per unit of crop water consumption zhang et al 2017 previous studies indicated that different irrigation methods have varying water saving effects and there are two main pathways to improve the wp the first pathway is to obtain the same yield using less irrigation water zhang et al 2017 while the second pathway is to obtain a higher yield using the same amount of irrigation water xu et al 2018 in this study under the premise of applying the same amount of irrigation the wp of the adi treatment was significantly greater than that of the other irrigation treatments fig 7 owing to an increase in the maize grain yield table 4 and a decrease in the et fig 7 the possible reasons for the increase in yield have been discussed in the previous part and the reason for the decrease in et may be that alternate drip irrigation can reduce plant transpiration and soil evaporation kang et al 2002 tang et al 2010 the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system as a combination of surface and subsurface drip irrigation has two advantages one of which is that it can overcome the disadvantages of subsurface drip irrigation such as the delayed emergence of seedlings mo et al 2020 and the exposure of roots to hypoxia zhu et al 2019 the second is that it is characterized by alternate partial root zone irrigation which uses a root zone signal feedback mechanism to achieve physiological water savings additionally with the increasing stability and durability of underground drip irrigation systems there was no need to reinstall and dismantle tubes at the beginning and end of each growing season resulting in a relatively low annual production investment ayars et al 1999 on the other hand studies have established that fruit trees have wider root systems than general field crops and are better equipped for alternate partial root zone irrigation making them the focus of future research on alternate partial root zone irrigation du et al 2005 hence we hope that the exploration of this experiment can provide guidance for the application of this vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system to economic crops such as fruit trees in view of these findings the vertical partial root zone alternative controlled drip irrigation system should have been highly applicable with strong prospects in the irrigation practice of grain and fruit trees in the semi arid region of northwest china 5 conclusions the present study demonstrated that alternate surface and subsurface drip irrigation in soil vertical profile adi had positive effects on improving yield compared with the sdi and cdi treatments the adi treatment increased the ratio of post silking biomass to total biomass the contribution of post silking biomass to grain yield and extended the active grain filling period and effective grain filling time which provided the physiological basis to achieve a high yield of summer maize in addition the adi treatment was also significantly higher than those of sdi and cdi in terms of the wp these findings indicate that adi combines the advantages of both water savings and high yield so it is a feasible

9828,plant physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought among jerusalem artichoke genotypes possessing different levels of drought resistance are still lacking we investigated the physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought of six jerusalem artichoke genotypes differing in drought resistance levels and evaluated the contribution of physiological and photosynthetic traits to tuber yield under drought condition the split plot in randomized complete block design with four replications was used six jerusalem artichoke genotypes as sub plots were nested in two water regimes 100 et and 50 et as main plots relative water content rwc was recorded at 30 60 and 90 days after transplanting dat while spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and leaf area la were recorded at 30 and 90 dat biomass and tuber yield were recorded at harvest stage water deficit restricted rwc by 20 45 la by 23 29 pn by 9 87 gs by 40 315 biomass by 42 62 and tuber yield by 46 13 yet increased scmr 6 74 of six genotypes the reductions observed on all traits of drought resistant genotypes were smaller than that of susceptible genotypes a drought resistant genotype kt 50 4 showed a low tuber yield reduction 36 59 and la 16 34 under water deficit condition whereas kt 50 4 ja 60 and ja 125 had low reductions of pn 7 06 9 75 and gs 15 40 42 86 under water deficit condition while la had a significant contribution to tuber yield under fully irrigated 80 11 and drought 85 57 pn and scmr had smaller contributions to tuber yield under drought condition 3 73 and 12 65 our results indicated that improvement of la could contribute to high tuber yield under limited water conditions keywords helianthus tuberosus mild drought photosynthesis chlorophyll drought resistant genotype 1 introduction increasing drought severity as a result of climate change endangers sustainable crop production and food security this phenomenon is the most detrimental compared to other abiotic stresses as it limits plant growth development and crop productivity zlatev and lidon 2012 ings et al 2013 the jerusalem artichoke is a tuber crop containing inulin a starch form that is popularly utilized as prebiotic and functional foods most jerusalem artichoke growing areas are under rainfed conditions in the semi arid tropics of thailand so that drought becomes a major constraint to achieve optimum plant growth tuber yield and inulin content puangbut et al 2015a ruttanaprasert et al 2016a the impact of drought on tuber yield varies depending upon the period and severity itself for example severe drought has been reported to strongly reduce tuber yield by 50 98 ruttanaprasert et al 2016a chaimala et al 2020 a drought resistant genotype of jerusalem artichoke has been identified to possess a low reduction of tuber yield and its morpho physiological adaptation to drought could be reasonable zhang et al 2011 puangbut et al 2017 plant responses to water stress are complex and different mechanisms are adopted when they encounter drought many mechanisms appear mostly for plant survival rather than for high productivity plant morpho physiological responses to drought might explain how plants could maintain high yield under limited water conditions several studies demonstrated that drought resistant traits such as spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr specific leaf area sla root length root distribution and water use efficiency wue contribute to tuber yield in jerusalem artichoke ruttanaprasert et al 2015 2016a puangbut et al 2017 2018 drought stress adversely affects both morpho physiology and photosynthesis of jerusalem artichoke and other plant species zhang et al 2011 zlatev and lidon 2012 zhao et al 2013 fghire et al 2015 orek et al 2020 several studies revealed that drought reduces leaf area specific leaf area and root length in jerusalem artichoke while spad and wue was increased monti et al 2005 ruttanaprasert et al 2015 puangbut et al 2017 while mild drought was small affected net photosynthesis under rainfed condition monti et al 2005 in contrast severe drought decreased photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance under rhizobox condition puangbut et al 2017 although photosynthetic response to drought has been reported these studies carried out in a short drought period in rhizobox culture and individual studies on a limited number of genotypes differing in drought resistance consequently there is limited information of photosynthetic response to long term drought in jerusalem artichoke differing in drought resistance under field condition drought resistant genotypes of the jerusalem artichoke have been recognized by maintaining high biomass root length and leaf water potential under short drought periods 30 45 days in both pot zhang et al 2011 ruttanaprasert et al 2015 and rhizobox puangbut et al 2017 2018 however further responses of the jerusalem artichoke with differing levels of drought resistance during experiencing prolonged water deficit on tuber yield have not been reported moreover no study reported the contribution of physiological and photosynthetic traits to the tuber yield of jerusalem artichoke under prolonged drought conditions the goals of this study were i to investigate the physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought of jerusalem artichoke differing in drought resistance levels and ii to estimate the contribution of physiological and photosynthetic traits to tuber yield under water deficit condition information on photosynthetic and physiological traits contributing to high tuber yield under water deficit might reveal the underlying plant mechanism to drought and could be adopted as selection criteria for breeders to increase the effectiveness of jerusalem artichoke improvements for drought resistance besides drought resistant genotypes with high yield retention obtained in this study are potentially exploited as source germplasm for breeding drought resilience in the jerusalem artichoke 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and plant material field experiment was conducted in the dry

levels of drought resistance kt 1 and kt 2 are susceptible genotypes with low drought tolerance index on root traits combined with high reduction of tuber yield ruttanaprasert et al 2016a while kt 50 4 is a drought resistant genotype with high water use efficiency and high potential tuber yield janket et al 2013 ruttanaprasert et al 2014 ja 5 has high root length and dried tuber weight under severe drought meanwhile ja 60 and ja 125 are drought resistant genotypes with high root length and high tuber yield under moderate drought ruttanaprasert et al 2015 2016a plot size was 18 0 m2 consisting of six rows with 6 0 m row length despite a large area of the experiment the whole experimental area was divided into four blocks homogeneous groups following the number of replications each block then was divided into several sub plots that was expected to possess higher soil homogeneity thus the assigned experimental design could reduce the undesirable variation due to soil heterogeneity and increase the precision of the experiment hoshmand 2006 2 2 crop management the transplanting procedures of jerusalem artichoke tuber follow puangbut et al 2015a method the seedling

nitrogen medium phosphorus and medium potassium however jerusalem artichoke can grow in poor soil under tropical area puangbut et al 2015c the weather data for field experiments were obtained from the nearest meteorological station in 2015 2016 there was a 4 1 mm rainfall at 84 dat drought period however the rainfall events did not interfere with the imposition of drought treatment because the amount of rainfall have a small however there was no interference from rain during the drought period in 2016 17 the means of maximum and minimum air temperatures ranged between 33 4 and 19 4 c in 2015 16 and 31 3 and 19 2 c in 2016 17 the means of solar radiations in 2015 2016 was 15 6 mj m 2 d 1 and it was 15 7 mj m 2 d 1 in 2016 17 the information indicated that solar radiation and daily

system was installed with 30 cm spacing between emitters and 40 cm spacing between drip lines the drip lines were placed on the soil surface midway between plant rows drip lines were fitted with a pressure valve and a water meter to ensure a uniform water supply water was supplied uniformly at field capacity fc at 0 35 cm depth from 0 to 30 dat for crop establishment soil moisture content at fc was set to be 12 7 by pressure plate method at 31 dat the water deficit treatment was imposed by withholding water at 50 of evapotranspiration et until harvest stage the irrigated treatment was maintained at 100 et throughout crop growth cycle and applied one day interval the calculation of amount of water applied was based on crop water requirement doorenbos and pruitt 1992 and soil surface evaporation singh and russell 1981 2 5 soil moisture content and plant water status monitoring of soil moisture levels was conducted using the gravimetric method soil moisture content at three depth levels 0 5 25 30 and 55 60 cm was determined by gravimetric method at 30 60 and 90 dat the procedures for measuring this parameter follow the method described by puangbut et al 2017 relative water content rwc of each plot was determined at 30 60 and 90 dat rwc was measured at 10 00 12 00 a m on the third fully expanded leaf from the top of the main stem rwc was calculated following the method described by puangbut et al 2017 2 6 spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and leaf area spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr was recorded from the third fully expanded leaf from the top of the main stem

leaf area la was obtained from five plants within each plot using the li 3100 area meter li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa at 30 and 90 dat 2 7 leaf gas exchange measurements leaf gas exchange was measured at 30 and 90 dat including net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance gs the third fully expanded leaf from the top of the main stem was selected for two plant

a ratio of pn e 2 8 tuber yield and biomass tuber yield and biomass were determined from a harvested area of 1 92 m2 the plants were cut at the soil surface and separated into shoots and tubers tubers were washed in tap water to remove the soil the samples were oven dried at 80 c for at least 72 h or until the weights were constant biomass was calculated by adding the dry weight of both shoots and tubers 2 9 statistical analysis analysis of variance in a split plot design was performed for each character within each year homogeneity of variance was tested for all characters hoshmand 2006 and combined analysis of variance of two year data was then performed differences between means were tested by least significant difference lsd these analyses were performed with statistix 10 software program multiple linear regression was used to estimate the contribution of leaf area la spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and net photosynthetic rate pn to tuber yield under both irrigated and water deficit conditions the model for a multiple linear regression is yi α β 1x1i β 2x2i β 3x3i δ i where yi tuber yield of genotype i α the y intercept β 1x1i β 2x2i and β 3x3i the regression coefficients of leaf area la spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and net photosynthetic rate pn of genotype i respectively δi the associated deviation from regression the influence level of each independent variable on the dependent variable was determined with a fitting full model the relative contributions of leaf area la spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and net photosynthetic rate pn to tuber yield under irrigated and water deficit conditions were calculated using the method described by ruttanaprasert et al 2016a 3 results 3 1 soil moisture and plant water status soil moisture content at three depth levels 0 5 25 30 and 55 60 cm is presented in fig 1 soil moisture content at 30 days after transplanting dat was similar between fully irrigated and water deficit conditions because drought had not yet started in this period however the soil moisture content at 60 and 90 dat showed clear distinctions between irrigated and drought treatments in both two years the results revealed that soil moistures under different two water regimes were managed well relative water content rwc showed no significant difference between two water regimes during the end of full irrigation in both years fig 2 rwc differed significantly between fully irrigated and drought treatments at 60 and 90 dat water deficit reduced rwc to 15 and 20 of fully irrigated treatment at 60 and 90 dat respectively these small reductions indicated mild water stress this water level might be enough for plants to survive and grow 3 2 combined analysis of variance the effects of genotype g and water regime w on physiological and photosynthetic traits biomass and tuber yield were significant table 1 genotype by water regime w g effect was significant for leaf area la and net photosynthetic rate pn indicating that each jerusalem artichoke genotype responded divergently to contrast two water regimes the interaction effects of genotype and year g y and g y w were not significant for all traits indicating that the performance of all tested genotypes on physiological and photosynthetic traits was relatively constant across years and water regimes 3 3 spad chlorophyll meter reading spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr under both fully irrigated 100 et and water deficit 50 et treatments was similar at 30 dat data not presented and it showed significantly different at 90 dat table 2 at 90 dat scmr of each tested genotype under 50 et was slightly higher than that under 100 et as a result treatment 50 et could raise the scmr value genotype ja 125 had the highest scmr under both 100 et 49 93 and 50 et 53 17 whereas three genotypes kt 1 kt 2 and kt 50 4 had the lowest scmr both 100 et 37 90 38 78 39 35 respectively and 50 et 40 12 42 01 42 72 respectively 3 4 leaf area leaf area la of both 100 et and 50 et treatments was similar at 30 dat data not presented once water regime at 50 et had been applied la of six genotypes significantly reduced in general la mean under 50 et was 23 29 lower than that under 100 et at 90 dat table 2 the results indicated that water deficit could reduce the leaf area of jerusalem artichoke genotypes three genotypes kt 1 kt 2 and kt 50 4 had the highest la while ja 60 and ja 125 had the lowest la at 90 dat 3 5 net photosynthetic rate net photosynthetic rate pn under fully irrigated and water deficit conditions were similar at 30 dat data not presented the imposition of water deficit at 50 et reduced pn by an average of 9 87 compared to the full irrigation treatment at 90 dat table 3 the reduction in pn was lower in drought resistant genotypes interestingly drought resistant genotypes ja 60 and ja 125 exhibited consistently high pn under both treatments 3 6 stomatal conductance stomatal conductance gs of fully irrigated and water deficit treatments were not significant at 30 dat data not presented reducing irrigation at 50 et resulted in 40 31 of average reduced gs at 90 dat table 3 stomatal conductance differed significantly among genotypes under both treatments the reduction of gs was more notable in two susceptible genotypes kt 1 and kt 2 ja 60 and ja 125 resistant genotypes showed less reductions of gs 21 10 and 15 40 respectively 3 7 biomass and tuber yield water deficit at 50 et significantly decreased biomass production and tuber yield by 42 62 and 46 13 respectively table 4 kt 50 4 showed low reductions of biomass 38 39 and tuber yield 36 59 while kt 1 revealed large reductions of biomass 49 57 and tuber yield 54 29 these results indicated that a drought resistant genotype could retain biomass and tuber yield under water deficit condition 3 8 analysis of factors determining tuber yield under drought conditions regression analysis demonstrated that the contribution of total observed variables to tuber yield was higher under drought 98 95 than under full irrigation 95 84 conditions table 5 the contribution of la to tuber yield was higher than that of scmr and pn under full irrigation 80 11 and water deficit 82 57 conditions meanwhile scmr and pn provided significant but minor contributions to tuber yield under both conditions 4 discussion the g e interaction is important because it could alter the ranks of tested genotypes based on certain selection criteria under multi environment trials this action might hinder the superior genotypes during selections in a crop improvement program this present study indicated that the genotypes rank on physiological and photosynthetic traits were more stable across two years and it corroborated the results of puangbut et al 2017 the result demonstrated the possibility of these traits as selection criteria for germplasm evaluations in jerusalem artichoke breeding program the physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought were significant among genotypes having different drought resistant levels moreover reductions of physiological and photosynthetic traits of resistant jerusalem artichoke genotypes were less than that of susceptible genotypes similar results have been reported in hybrid millet lu et al 2015 wheat subrahmanyam et al 2006 li et al 2017 and cassava orek et al 2020 drought significantly reduced la of both resistant and susceptible genotypes however the resistant genotypes could retain high leaf area when they were subjected to water deficit at 50 et and this evidence could explain to maintain biomass and tuber yield under water stress previous studies suggested that leaf area was associated with biomass production under drought in jerusalem artichoke puangbut et al 2017 but there is still limited information on the relationship between la and tuber yield the lowest reduction of la was found in drought resistant genotype kt 50 4 16 34 this genotype had high potential of leaf growth and could maintain high leaf area under water deficit resulting in a small reduction of leaf area when experiencing mild water stress retaining a high la corresponded to a large photosynthesis area leading to a higher growth rate similar evidences had been revealed in cereal crops richards 2000 quinoa fghire et al 2015 and jerusalem artichoke genotypes puangbut et al 2017 therefore we concluded that a larger leaf area is beneficial for photosynthesis capacity and plant growth additionally a high leaf area might be more favorable for plant growth if there is an increased capacity of water uptake illustrated by a greater root system under limited water zlatev and lidon 2012 puangbut et al 2018 previous reports demonstrated root length rl as an important trait contributing to maintaining high photosynthetic rate and biomass under drought conditions lavinsky et al 2016 puangbut et al 2018 this current study also revealed that water deficit at et 50 increased scmr of all tested jerusalem artichoke genotypes among tested genotypes drought resistant genotypes could maintain scmr under drought conditions that was similar to the finding of puangbut et al 2017 the increase of scmr was associated with high chlorophyll density under drought conditions ruttanaprasert et al 2012 scmr is a strongly correlated to photosynthetic rate monti et al 2005 puangbut et al 2017 jumrani and bhatia 2019 it was also suggested that the selection of genotype for high scmr might help to improve the photosynthetic rate it was reasonable to expect that jerusalem artichoke genotypes with high scmr have more photosynthetic capacity resulting in greater carbon assimilation under water deficit stomatal conductance is one of the most important factors affecting photosynthesis efficiency under drought conditions monti et al 2005 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 orek et al 2020 stomatal conductance would decrease as the drought was more severe in both resistant and susceptible genotypes however the stomata of drought resistant genotypes remained open under water deficient condition this fact was similar to previous findings in jerusalem artichoke puangbut et al 2017 hybrid millet lu et al 2015 chili pepper malika et al 2019 and cassava orek et al 2020 reduction of stomatal conductance directly declined transpiration and photosynthetic rates under water deficit subrahmanyam et al 2006 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 plants are able to prevent water loss via transpiration by limiting stomatal conductance but it may reduce co2 diffusion into the leaf and photosynthetic rate however wu et al 2018 demonstrated that responses of size and density of stomata to drought could create a balance between carbon gain in photosynthesis and the prevention of water loss by altering to a smaller stomatal size plants can optimize their co2 uptake for photosynthesis while minimizing water loss pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 wu et al 2018 bertolino et al 2019 furthermore tolerant plant species can control the status of their stomata to allow carbon fixation and photosynthesis as well as improving water use efficiency pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 li et al 2017 previous studies have illustrated drought resistant genotype showed a relatively high photosynthetic rate pn and less reduction in transpiration rate e under drought conditions sun et al 2013 lu et al 2015 li et al 2017 puangbut et al 2017 these two responses are crucial for optimizing water use efficiency wue in jerusalem artichoke wue was calculated as net photosynthetic rate divided by transpiration rate and thus plants can increase wue by maintaining high pn and low e in addition increasing of water use efficiency resulted in high tuber yield under water stress conditions janket et al 2013 the results also revealed that mild water stress reduced less pn according to results of fghire et al 2015 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 and istanbuli et al 2020 the present study suggests that irrigation at 50 et may be sufficient for jerusalem artichoke growth and promote high photosynthesis efficiency conducting deficit irrigation by reducing irrigation water use would be strategy to cope with water scarcity situations fereres and soriano 2007 the genotypes with low reduction in photosynthetic rate and high potential of photosynthetic rate under mild drought was observed in kt 50 4 ja 60 and ja 125 genotypes these were identified as highly drought resistant genotypes with maintaining high pn under water deficit conditions and the results supported previous findings of puangbut et al 2017 drought resistant jerusalem artichoke genotypes with good ability to maintain high pn may perform as well for high tuber yield under drought conditions selecting genotypes for high tuber yield potential and low yield reduction under drought is the main target for drought resistant breeding programs blum 2005 our results revealed that drought resistant genotype kt 50 4 appealed those criteria according to the results of ruttanaprasert et al 2016a and puangbut et al 2017 this genotype could be promoted as a parental source for high retention of tuber yield and greater photosynthesis area however the genotype with maintaining high biomass and tuber yield under water deficit may also be associated with several physiological and photosynthetic traits identified as drought resistant traits physiological traits such as scmr specific leaf area root length and wue have been identified as drought resistant traits ruttanaprasert et al 2016b puangbut et al 2017 2018 while stomatal conductance and pn were identified as photosynthetic drought tolerance in jerusalem artichoke and other species puangbut et al 2017 li et al 2017 orek et al 2020 a previous report revealed that pn was positively correlated with scmr and wue under drought conditions puangbut et al 2017 li et al 2017 orek et al 2020 pn has been shown to be strongly correlated with scmr monti et al 2005 puangbut et al 2017 selection of genotype for their ability to maintain high scmr may help to improve photosynthetic rate under drought conditions however physiological and photosynthetic traits associated with tuber yield of jerusalem artichoke genotypes differing in drought resistance under drought conditions are still lacking the result showed greater contribution of the physiological and photosynthetic traits to tuber yield under water deficit conditions although drought resistant genotype could maintain high photosynthetic efficiency under drought the contribution of pn to tuber yield was smaller than that of la the present finding was reasonable since pn is the net assimilation per unit leaf area while leaf area is the assimilation from a whole plant which is more effective to tuber yield the present study demonstrated that improved photosynthetic efficiency has played only a minor role in the remarkable increases in crop productivity according to the result of zhu et al 2010 the present results evidently showed that la is an important trait determinant for tuber yield under both irrigated and water deficit conditions these results are in agreement with those obtained in potatoes by dahal et al 2019 and in sweet potatoes by laurie et al 2015 the results suggested that increasing of la could be enhanced photosynthetic area coupled with higher biomass production and resulted in an increased tuber yield besides the negative correlation was found between stomatal conductance and tuber yield under water deficit conditions data not presented indicating the optimum reduction in stomatal conductance could help to maintain high photosynthesis and tuber yield under water deficit conditions this could be due to the reducing of the stomatal size which would allow stoma to remain open under drought conditions demonstrating a balance between carbon gain through photosynthesis and the prevention of water loss through transpiration franks and beerling 2009 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 li et al 2017 the information on the ability of drought resistant jerusalem artichoke genotypes to alter their physiological and photosynthetic traits contributing to high tuber yield under water deficit was useful for improved breeding strategies for drought resistance in jerusalem artichoke 5 conclusion the present study revealed a significant response to water deficit for physiological and photosynthetic traits among jerusalem artichoke genotypes differing in drought resistance levels in general drought resistant genotypes could retain leaf area la net photosynthesis rate pn and stomatal conductance gs and increase the scmr value genotype kt 50 4 showed high la and low gs while genotypes ja 60 and ja 125 had high scmr pn and gs kt 50 4 showed high tuber yield potential high la and low yield reduction under water deficit being an ideal genotype of jerusalem artichoke for drought resistant breeding in addition la is an important contributor for tuber yield under water deficit and drought tolerant genotypes such kt 50 4 could maintain the rate of photosynthesis leading to high tuber yield these traits could be used as selection criteria for improving actual yield under drought condition in addition breeders could adopt the drought resistant genotypes with high yield retention identified in this study as founder parents for routine breeding program in the

9828,plant physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought among jerusalem artichoke genotypes possessing different levels of drought resistance are still lacking we investigated the physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought of six jerusalem artichoke genotypes differing in drought resistance levels and evaluated the contribution of physiological and photosynthetic traits to tuber yield under drought condition the split plot in randomized complete block design with four replications was used six jerusalem artichoke genotypes as sub plots were nested in two water regimes 100 et and 50 et as main plots relative water content rwc was recorded at 30 60 and 90 days after transplanting dat while spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and leaf area la were recorded at 30 and 90 dat biomass and tuber yield were recorded at harvest stage water deficit restricted rwc by 20 45 la by 23 29 pn by 9 87 gs by 40 315 biomass by 42 62 and tuber yield by 46 13 yet increased scmr 6 74 of six genotypes the reductions observed on all traits of drought resistant genotypes were smaller than that of susceptible genotypes a drought resistant genotype kt 50 4 showed a low tuber yield reduction 36 59 and la 16 34 under water deficit condition whereas kt 50 4 ja 60 and ja 125 had low reductions of pn 7 06 9 75 and gs 15 40 42 86 under water deficit condition while la had a significant contribution to tuber yield under fully irrigated 80 11 and drought 85 57 pn and scmr had smaller contributions to tuber yield under drought condition 3 73 and 12 65 our results indicated that improvement of la could contribute to high tuber yield under limited water conditions keywords helianthus tuberosus mild drought photosynthesis chlorophyll drought resistant genotype 1 introduction increasing drought severity as a result of climate change endangers sustainable crop production and food security this phenomenon is the most detrimental compared to other abiotic stresses as it limits plant growth development and crop productivity zlatev and lidon 2012 ings et al 2013 the jerusalem artichoke is a tuber crop containing inulin a starch form that is popularly utilized as prebiotic and functional foods most jerusalem artichoke growing areas are under rainfed conditions in the semi arid tropics of thailand so that drought becomes a major constraint to achieve optimum plant growth tuber yield and inulin content puangbut et al 2015a ruttanaprasert et al 2016a the impact of drought on tuber yield varies depending upon the period and severity itself for example severe drought has been reported to strongly reduce tuber yield by 50 98 ruttanaprasert et al 2016a chaimala et al 2020 a drought resistant genotype of jerusalem artichoke has been identified to possess a low reduction of tuber yield and its morpho physiological adaptation to drought could be reasonable zhang et al 2011 puangbut et al 2017 plant responses to water stress are complex and different mechanisms are adopted when they encounter drought many mechanisms appear mostly for plant survival rather than for high productivity plant morpho physiological responses to drought might explain how plants could maintain high yield under limited water conditions several studies demonstrated that drought resistant traits such as spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr specific leaf area sla root length root distribution and water use efficiency wue contribute to tuber yield in jerusalem artichoke ruttanaprasert et al 2015 2016a puangbut et al 2017 2018 drought stress adversely affects both morpho physiology and photosynthesis of jerusalem artichoke and other plant species zhang et al 2011 zlatev and lidon 2012 zhao et al 2013 fghire et al 2015 orek et al 2020 several studies revealed that drought reduces leaf area specific leaf area and root length in jerusalem artichoke while spad and wue was increased monti et al 2005 ruttanaprasert et al 2015 puangbut et al 2017 while mild drought was small affected net photosynthesis under rainfed condition monti et al 2005 in contrast severe drought decreased photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance under rhizobox condition puangbut et al 2017 although photosynthetic response to drought has been reported these studies carried out in a short drought period in rhizobox culture and individual studies on a limited number of genotypes differing in drought resistance consequently there is limited information of photosynthetic response to long term drought in jerusalem artichoke differing in drought resistance under field condition drought resistant genotypes of the jerusalem artichoke have been recognized by maintaining high biomass root length and leaf water potential under short drought periods 30 45 days in both pot zhang et al 2011 ruttanaprasert et al 2015 and rhizobox puangbut et al 2017 2018 however further responses of the jerusalem artichoke with differing levels of drought resistance during experiencing prolonged water deficit on tuber yield have not been reported moreover no study reported the contribution of physiological and photosynthetic traits to the tuber yield of jerusalem artichoke under prolonged drought conditions the goals of this study were i to investigate the physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought of jerusalem artichoke differing in drought resistance levels and ii to estimate the contribution of physiological and photosynthetic traits to tuber yield under water deficit condition information on photosynthetic and physiological traits contributing to high tuber yield under water deficit might reveal the underlying plant mechanism to drought and could be adopted as selection criteria for breeders to increase the effectiveness of jerusalem artichoke improvements for drought resistance besides drought resistant genotypes with high yield retention obtained in this study are potentially exploited as source germplasm for breeding drought resilience in the jerusalem artichoke 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and plant material field experiment was conducted in the dry season november to march for two growing years 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 at the field crop research station of khon kaen university located in khon kaen province thailand latitude 16 28 n longitude 102 48 e 200 m above sea level the experiment was laid in a split plot in randomized complete block design rcbd with four replications two irrigation levels full irrigation with 100 evapotranspiration 100 et and deficit irrigation with 50 et were assigned as main plot whereas six jerusalem artichoke genotypes kt 1 kt 2 kt 50 4 ja 5 ja 60 ja 125 were assigned as sub plot these genotypes have different levels of drought resistance kt 1 and kt 2 are susceptible genotypes with low drought tolerance index on root traits combined with high reduction of tuber yield ruttanaprasert et al 2016a while kt 50 4 is a drought resistant genotype with high water use efficiency and high potential tuber yield janket et al 2013 ruttanaprasert et al 2014 ja 5 has high root length and dried tuber weight under severe drought meanwhile ja 60 and ja 125 are drought resistant genotypes with high root length and high tuber yield under moderate drought ruttanaprasert et al 2015 2016a plot size was 18 0 m2 consisting of six rows with 6 0 m row length despite a large area of the experiment the whole experimental area was divided into four blocks homogeneous groups following the number of replications each block then was divided into several sub plots that was expected to possess higher soil homogeneity thus the assigned experimental design could reduce the undesirable variation due to soil heterogeneity and increase the precision of the experiment hoshmand 2006 2 2 crop management the transplanting procedures of jerusalem artichoke tuber follow puangbut et al 2015a method the seedling tubers at the v4 stage were transplanted to the field puangbut et al 2015b one seedling per hill was performed at 20 days after transplanting dat a compound fertilizer of n p2o5 k2o 15 7 18 was applied at the rate of 156 kg ha 1 weeds were manually controlled at a week interval throughout the experiment fungicide terraclor was applied monthly for two months after transplanting to control stem rot sclerotium rolfsii disease pests were controlled by applying wood vinegar for two times per week 5 ml in 1 l of water until harvest stage 2 3 soil properties and weather conditions the soil

nitrogen medium phosphorus and medium potassium however jerusalem artichoke can grow in poor soil under tropical area puangbut et al 2015c the weather data for field experiments were obtained from the nearest meteorological station in 2015 2016 there was a 4 1 mm rainfall at 84 dat drought period however the rainfall events did not interfere with the imposition of drought treatment because the amount of rainfall have a small however there was no interference from rain during the drought period in 2016 17 the means of maximum and minimum air temperatures ranged between 33 4 and 19 4 c in 2015 16 and 31 3 and 19 2 c in 2016 17 the means of solar radiations in 2015 2016 was 15 6 mj m 2 d 1 and it was 15 7 mj m 2 d 1 in 2016 17 the information indicated that solar radiation and daily temperatures was suitable for plant growth and development of jerusalem artichoke grown in tropical regions according to report of puangbut et al 2015c 2 4 water management a surface drip irrigation system was installed with 30 cm spacing between emitters and 40 cm spacing between drip lines the drip lines were placed on the soil surface midway between plant rows drip lines were fitted with a pressure valve and a water meter to ensure a uniform water supply water was supplied uniformly at field capacity fc at 0 35 cm depth from 0 to 30 dat for crop establishment soil moisture content at fc was set to be 12 7 by pressure plate method at 31 dat the water deficit treatment was imposed by withholding water at 50 of evapotranspiration et until harvest stage the irrigated treatment was maintained at 100 et throughout crop growth cycle and applied one day interval the calculation of amount of water applied was based on crop water requirement doorenbos and pruitt 1992 and soil surface evaporation singh and russell 1981 2 5 soil moisture content and plant water status monitoring of soil moisture levels was conducted using the gravimetric method soil moisture content at three depth levels 0 5 25 30 and 55 60 cm was determined by gravimetric method at 30 60 and 90 dat the procedures for measuring this parameter follow the method described by puangbut et al 2017 relative water content rwc of each plot was determined at 30 60 and 90 dat rwc was measured at 10 00 12 00 a m on the third fully expanded leaf from the top of the main stem rwc was calculated following the method described by puangbut et al 2017 2 6 spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and leaf area spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr was recorded from the third fully expanded leaf from the top of the main stem was selected for two plant per plot per treatment using the minolta spad 502 m tokyo japan the measurement was taken from two leaves from a single plant between 09 00 and 11 00 a m at 30 and 90 dat leaf area la was obtained from five plants within each plot using the li 3100 area meter li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa at 30 and 90 dat 2 7 leaf gas exchange measurements leaf gas exchange was measured at 30 and 90 dat including net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance gs the third fully expanded leaf from the top of the main stem was selected for two plant per plot per treatment using the li 6400xt portable photosynthesis system li cor lincoln nebraska usa with a 6400 02b led source providing a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 the conditions during the measurement were set as follow temperature of 25 c relative humidity at 70 and co2 concentration at 400 μmol m 2 s 1 additionally water use efficiency wue was calculated as a ratio of pn e 2 8 tuber yield and biomass tuber yield and biomass were determined from a harvested area of 1 92 m2 the plants were cut at the soil surface and separated into shoots and tubers tubers were washed in tap water to remove the soil the samples were oven dried at 80 c for at least 72 h or until the weights were constant biomass was calculated by adding the dry weight of both shoots and tubers 2 9 statistical analysis analysis of variance in a split plot design was performed for each character within each year homogeneity of variance was tested for all characters hoshmand 2006 and combined analysis of variance of two year data was then performed differences between means were tested by least significant difference lsd these analyses were performed with statistix 10 software program multiple linear regression was used to estimate the contribution of leaf area la spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and net photosynthetic rate pn to tuber yield under both irrigated and water deficit conditions the model for a multiple linear regression is yi α β 1x1i β 2x2i β 3x3i δ i where yi tuber yield of genotype i α the y intercept β 1x1i β 2x2i and β 3x3i the regression coefficients of leaf area la spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and net photosynthetic rate pn of genotype i respectively δi the associated deviation from regression the influence level of each independent variable on the dependent variable was determined with a fitting full model the relative contributions of leaf area la spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and net photosynthetic rate pn to tuber yield under irrigated and water deficit conditions were calculated using the method described by ruttanaprasert et al 2016a 3 results 3 1 soil moisture and plant water status soil moisture content at three depth levels 0 5 25 30 and 55 60 cm is presented in fig 1 soil moisture content at 30 days after transplanting dat was similar between fully irrigated and water deficit conditions because drought had not yet started in this period however the soil moisture content at 60 and 90 dat showed clear distinctions between irrigated and drought treatments in both two years the results revealed that soil moistures under different two water regimes were managed well relative water content rwc showed no significant difference between two water regimes during the end of full irrigation in both years fig 2 rwc differed significantly between fully irrigated and drought treatments at 60 and 90 dat water deficit reduced rwc to 15 and 20 of fully irrigated treatment at 60 and 90 dat respectively these small reductions indicated mild water stress this water level might be enough for plants to survive and grow 3 2 combined analysis of variance the effects of genotype g and water regime w on physiological and photosynthetic traits biomass and tuber yield were significant table 1 genotype by water regime w g effect was significant for leaf area la and net photosynthetic rate pn indicating that each jerusalem artichoke genotype responded divergently to contrast two water regimes the interaction effects of genotype and year g y and g y w were not significant for all traits indicating that the performance of all tested genotypes on physiological and photosynthetic traits was relatively constant across years and water regimes 3 3 spad chlorophyll meter reading spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr under both fully irrigated 100 et and water deficit 50 et treatments was similar at 30 dat data not presented and it showed significantly different at 90 dat table 2 at 90 dat scmr of each tested genotype under 50 et was slightly higher than that under 100 et as a result treatment 50 et could raise the scmr value genotype ja 125 had the highest scmr under both 100 et 49 93 and 50 et 53 17 whereas three genotypes kt 1 kt 2 and kt 50 4 had the lowest scmr both 100 et 37 90 38 78 39 35 respectively and 50 et 40 12 42 01 42 72 respectively 3 4 leaf area leaf area la of both 100 et and 50 et treatments was similar at 30 dat data not presented once water regime at 50 et had been applied la of six genotypes significantly reduced in general la mean under 50 et was 23 29 lower than that under 100 et at 90 dat table 2 the results indicated that water deficit could reduce the leaf area of jerusalem artichoke genotypes three genotypes kt 1 kt 2 and kt 50 4 had the highest la while ja 60 and ja 125 had the lowest la at 90 dat 3 5 net photosynthetic rate net photosynthetic rate pn under fully irrigated and water deficit conditions were similar at 30 dat data not presented the imposition of water deficit at 50 et reduced pn by an average of 9 87 compared to the full irrigation treatment at 90 dat table 3 the reduction in pn was lower in drought resistant genotypes interestingly drought resistant genotypes ja 60 and ja 125 exhibited consistently high pn under both treatments 3 6 stomatal conductance stomatal conductance gs of fully irrigated and water deficit treatments were not significant at 30 dat data not presented reducing irrigation at 50 et resulted in 40 31 of average reduced gs at 90 dat table 3 stomatal conductance differed significantly among genotypes under both treatments the reduction of gs was more notable in two susceptible genotypes kt 1 and kt 2 ja 60 and ja 125 resistant genotypes showed less reductions of gs 21 10 and 15 40 respectively 3 7 biomass and tuber yield water deficit at 50 et significantly decreased biomass production and tuber yield by 42 62 and 46 13 respectively table 4 kt 50 4 showed low reductions of biomass 38 39 and tuber yield 36 59 while kt 1 revealed large reductions of biomass 49 57 and tuber yield 54 29 these results indicated that a drought resistant genotype could retain biomass and tuber yield under water deficit condition 3 8 analysis of factors determining tuber yield under drought conditions regression analysis demonstrated that the contribution of total observed variables to tuber yield was higher under drought 98 95 than under full irrigation 95 84 conditions table 5 the contribution of la to tuber yield was higher than that of scmr and pn under full irrigation 80 11 and water deficit 82 57 conditions meanwhile scmr and pn provided significant but minor contributions to tuber yield under both conditions 4 discussion the g e interaction is important because it could alter the ranks of tested genotypes based on certain selection criteria under multi environment trials this action might hinder the superior genotypes during selections in a crop improvement program this present study indicated that the genotypes rank on physiological and photosynthetic traits were more stable across two years and it corroborated the results of puangbut et al 2017 the result demonstrated the possibility of these traits as selection criteria for germplasm evaluations in jerusalem artichoke breeding program the physiological and photosynthetic responses to drought were significant among genotypes having different drought resistant levels moreover reductions of physiological and photosynthetic traits of resistant jerusalem artichoke genotypes were less than that of susceptible genotypes similar results have been reported in hybrid millet lu et al 2015 wheat subrahmanyam et al 2006 li et al 2017 and cassava orek et al 2020 drought significantly reduced la of both resistant and susceptible genotypes however the resistant genotypes could retain high leaf area when they were subjected to water deficit at 50 et and this evidence could explain to maintain biomass and tuber yield under water stress previous studies suggested that leaf area was associated with biomass production under drought in jerusalem artichoke puangbut et al 2017 but there is still limited information on the relationship between la and tuber yield the lowest reduction of la was found in drought resistant genotype kt 50 4 16 34 this genotype had high potential of leaf growth and could maintain high leaf area under water deficit resulting in a small reduction of leaf area when experiencing mild water stress retaining a high la corresponded to a large photosynthesis area leading to a higher growth rate similar evidences had been revealed in cereal crops richards 2000 quinoa fghire et al 2015 and jerusalem artichoke genotypes puangbut et al 2017 therefore we concluded that a larger leaf area is beneficial for photosynthesis capacity and plant growth additionally a high leaf area might be more favorable for plant growth if there is an increased capacity of water uptake illustrated by a greater root system under limited water zlatev and lidon 2012 puangbut et al 2018 previous reports demonstrated root length rl as an important trait contributing to maintaining high photosynthetic rate and biomass under drought conditions lavinsky et al 2016 puangbut et al 2018 this current study also revealed that water deficit at et 50 increased scmr of all tested jerusalem artichoke genotypes among tested genotypes drought resistant genotypes could maintain scmr under drought conditions that was similar to the finding of puangbut et al 2017 the increase of scmr was associated with high chlorophyll density under drought conditions ruttanaprasert et al 2012 scmr is a strongly correlated to photosynthetic rate monti et al 2005 puangbut et al 2017 jumrani and bhatia 2019 it was also suggested that the selection of genotype for high scmr might help to improve the photosynthetic rate it was reasonable to expect that jerusalem artichoke genotypes with high scmr have more photosynthetic capacity resulting in greater carbon assimilation under water deficit stomatal conductance is one of the most important factors affecting photosynthesis efficiency under drought conditions monti et al 2005 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 orek et al 2020 stomatal conductance would decrease as the drought was more severe in both resistant and susceptible genotypes however the stomata of drought resistant genotypes remained open under water deficient condition this fact was similar to previous findings in jerusalem artichoke puangbut et al 2017 hybrid millet lu et al 2015 chili pepper malika et al 2019 and cassava orek et al 2020 reduction of stomatal conductance directly declined transpiration and photosynthetic rates under water deficit subrahmanyam et al 2006 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 plants are able to prevent water loss via transpiration by limiting stomatal conductance but it may reduce co2 diffusion into the leaf and photosynthetic rate however wu et al 2018 demonstrated that responses of size and density of stomata to drought could create a balance between carbon gain in photosynthesis and the prevention of water loss by altering to a smaller stomatal size plants can optimize their co2 uptake for photosynthesis while minimizing water loss pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 wu et al 2018 bertolino et al 2019 furthermore tolerant plant species can control the status of their stomata to allow carbon fixation and photosynthesis as well as improving water use efficiency pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 li et al 2017 previous studies have illustrated drought resistant genotype showed a relatively high photosynthetic rate pn and less reduction in transpiration rate e under drought conditions sun et al 2013 lu et al 2015 li et al 2017 puangbut et al 2017 these two responses are crucial for optimizing water use efficiency wue in jerusalem artichoke wue was calculated as net photosynthetic rate divided by transpiration rate and thus plants can increase wue by maintaining high pn and low e in addition increasing of water use efficiency resulted in high tuber yield under water stress conditions janket et al 2013 the results also revealed that mild water stress reduced less pn according to results of fghire et al 2015 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 and istanbuli et al 2020 the present study suggests that irrigation at 50 et may be sufficient for jerusalem artichoke growth and promote high photosynthesis efficiency conducting deficit irrigation by reducing irrigation water use would be strategy to cope with water scarcity situations fereres and soriano 2007 the genotypes with low reduction in photosynthetic rate and high potential of photosynthetic rate under mild drought was observed in kt 50 4 ja 60 and ja 125 genotypes these were identified as highly drought resistant genotypes with maintaining high pn under water deficit conditions and the results supported previous findings of puangbut et al 2017 drought resistant jerusalem artichoke genotypes with good ability to maintain high pn may perform as well for high tuber yield under drought conditions selecting genotypes for high tuber yield potential and low yield reduction under drought is the main target for drought resistant breeding programs blum 2005 our results revealed that drought resistant genotype kt 50 4 appealed those criteria according to the results of ruttanaprasert et al 2016a and puangbut et al 2017 this genotype could be promoted as a parental source for high retention of tuber yield and greater photosynthesis area however the genotype with maintaining high biomass and tuber yield under water deficit may also be associated with several physiological and photosynthetic traits identified as drought resistant traits physiological traits such as scmr specific leaf area root length and wue have been identified as drought resistant traits ruttanaprasert et al 2016b puangbut et al 2017 2018 while stomatal conductance and pn were identified as photosynthetic drought tolerance in jerusalem artichoke and other species puangbut et al 2017 li et al 2017 orek et al 2020 a previous report revealed that pn was positively correlated with scmr and wue under drought conditions puangbut et al 2017 li et al 2017 orek et al 2020 pn has been shown to be strongly correlated with scmr monti et al 2005 puangbut et al 2017 selection of genotype for their ability to maintain high scmr may help to improve photosynthetic rate under drought conditions however physiological and photosynthetic traits associated with tuber yield of jerusalem artichoke genotypes differing in drought resistance under drought conditions are still lacking the result showed greater contribution of the physiological and photosynthetic traits to tuber yield under water deficit conditions although drought resistant genotype could maintain high photosynthetic efficiency under drought the contribution of pn to tuber yield was smaller than that of la the present finding was reasonable since pn is the net assimilation per unit leaf area while leaf area is the assimilation from a whole plant which is more effective to tuber yield the present study demonstrated that improved photosynthetic efficiency has played only a minor role in the remarkable increases in crop productivity according to the result of zhu et al 2010 the present results evidently showed that la is an important trait determinant for tuber yield under both irrigated and water deficit conditions these results are in agreement with those obtained in potatoes by dahal et al 2019 and in sweet potatoes by laurie et al 2015 the results suggested that increasing of la could be enhanced photosynthetic area coupled with higher biomass production and resulted in an increased tuber yield besides the negative correlation was found between stomatal conductance and tuber yield under water deficit conditions data not presented indicating the optimum reduction in stomatal conductance could help to maintain high photosynthesis and tuber yield under water deficit conditions this could be due to the reducing of the stomatal size which would allow stoma to remain open under drought conditions demonstrating a balance between carbon gain through photosynthesis and the prevention of water loss through transpiration franks and beerling 2009 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 li et al 2017 the information on the ability of drought resistant jerusalem artichoke genotypes to alter their physiological and photosynthetic traits contributing to high tuber yield under water deficit was useful for improved breeding strategies for drought resistance in jerusalem artichoke 5 conclusion the present study revealed a significant response to water deficit for physiological and photosynthetic traits among jerusalem artichoke genotypes differing in drought resistance levels in general drought resistant genotypes could retain leaf area la net photosynthesis rate pn and stomatal conductance gs and increase the scmr value genotype kt 50 4 showed high la and low gs while genotypes ja 60 and ja 125 had high scmr pn and gs kt 50 4 showed high tuber yield potential high la and low yield reduction under water deficit being an ideal genotype of jerusalem artichoke for drought resistant breeding in addition la is an important contributor for tuber yield under water deficit and drought tolerant genotypes such kt 50 4 could maintain the rate of photosynthesis leading to high tuber yield these traits could be used as selection criteria for improving actual yield under drought condition in addition breeders could adopt the drought resistant genotypes with high yield retention identified in this study as founder parents for routine breeding program in the

9829,egypt faces great challenges to manage its limited freshwater resources shortage in freshwater due to expected stresses of climatic changes and upper nile projects will have major impacts on egypt s water and food security about 85 of the annual total freshwater resource is consumed by agriculture the objective of this work is to assess the future water security situation of kafr el sheikh governorate nile delta egypt under climate change and urbanization stresses compared to the current situation main investigated water security elements for this study were the irrigation water requirements and agricultural land areas two different reference evapotranspiration equations were used to calculate the future irrigation water requirements under three different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios for the period 2010 2100 based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change s 5th assessment report remote sensing and geographical information system gis were used to generate a land use classification map which was used to estimate the losses in each land use category of the study area under 0 5 and 1 0 m relative sea level rise slr estimates combined scenarios of future changes in irrigation water consumption and agricultural land area were analysed the results show that the future water security situation of the governorate is highly sensitive to projected climatic changes moreover most future scenarios revealed that the agricultural land area would decrease which will cause serious food security problems the maximum decrease by about 55 9 of the agricultural land area for year 2095 compared to year 2016 is estimated due to the current annual decreasing rate of 0 4 and 1 0 m slr whatever the applied rcp scenario while the maximum increase in the required irrigation water would be about 6 due to the rcp85 scenario assuming no change in the irrigation land area with a mixing ratio of 1 34 freshwater 1 drainage water which would affect the crop yield productivity a regular assessment of water security elements for each of the egyptian governorates should be managed and an urgent integrated plan for food security to adapt with the future climate change impacts is essential keywords ipcc drainage water reuse nile delta reference evapotranspiration remote sensing slr 1 introduction egypt is consistently reported as a water stressed country the average available water per capita in egypt reached about 589 4 cubic meters in 2017 and it is expected to reach about 350 cubic meters by 2050 el agroudy et al 2016 fao 2019 about 85 of the annual total water resource is consumed by agriculture which is contributing with about 12 of the gross domestic product gdp capmas 2016 eeaa 2016 additionally it is expected that egypt will be affected by the impacts of climatic changes reflected in increasing temperatures sea level rise slr changing patterns of rainfall over egypt and the nile basin which in turn may affect its share of water booij et al 2011 conway 2005 elshamy et al 2009a 2009b elshemy 2017 fawaz and soliman 2016 fenta mekonnen and disse 2018 shalby et al 2021 2020 furthermore the renaissance dam construction has several repercussions that may result into reducing egypt s share of nile water 55 5 bcm thus a regular assessment for the current and future situation of water security is essential water security ws has been defined as the availability of an acceptable quality and quantity of water for health production ecosystems and livelihoods in addition to an acceptable level of water related risks to people economies and environments grey and sadoff 2007 ws could be directly or indirectly affected by climate change water demand land use and governmental management of water resources qin et al 2019 climate change cc is considered as one of the important factors affecting the egyptian water and food security predicted rise of air temperature will increase irrigation water requirements and reduce the productivity of major crops slr will affect coastal areas and its inhabitants especially the nile delta coast abdrabo and hassaan 2015 haggag et al 2013 about 12 of agricultural land areas in the nile delta would be affected by 1 0 m slr and salinization problems tolba and saab 2009 hassaan 2013 estimated that about 8 35 of the agricultural area in kafr el sheikh governorate would be inundated under the impact of global slr of 43 cm and the land subsidence global slr is mainly caused by the thermal expansion of sea water and thawing in the arctic and antarctic of ice sheets intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported that the global slr will continue during the 21st century with a faster rate than observed for the past period between 1971 and 2010 slr will be in the range between 0 26 and 0 82 m for the period 2081 2100 compared to a 1986 2005 baseline pachauri et al 2014 additionally for low sloping plains and deltas a small increase in sea level would lead to a large horizontal transgression moreover saline groundwater can reach large distances into freshwater aquifers sea water intrusion contaminating the freshwater supply of coastal communities for coastal areas the relative rate of slr compared to the land surface is more important than the absolute mean rate of global slr the land level of many coastal areas are decreasing and hence the effective rate of slr is the rate of global slr plus the rate of land subsidence wright et al 2019 despite several researches more than 70 that have estimated the projected values of slr due to cc its values are still uncertain and have a wide range garner et al 2018 understanding the potential impacts of cc is essential for developing adaptation strategies and plans to mitigate future cc induced risks according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the ipcc there are four representative concentration pathways rcps range from the best future situation to the worst one regarding cc rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 these rcps are labeled based on the possible range of radiative forcing values in 2100 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m2 respectively pachauri et al 2014 rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are considered for the current study as they represent the best moderate and worst cc scenarios in addition to cc the assessment of land use classification change is essential for understanding the current situation and the rates of change allowing us to predict what may happen in the future and thus making precautions to mitigate or avoid the expected negative impacts urban sprawl is a troubling problem for food security of egypt because egypt lost about 7 95 of the agricultural land area in the nile delta during the period from 1984 to 2007 in addition to the increase in population arc 2010 many studies used remote sensing rs and gis techniques for this purpose bakr and afifi 2019 congedo and munafò 2014 elagouz et al 2019 shalaby and tateishi 2007 allam et al 2019 future projections of irrigation water requirements are mainly represented by reference evapotranspiration et that is considered the most important parameter used to assess impacts of cc on water resources and hydrologic regimes many studies analyzed different impacts of climate change and land use change on water resources management for many spatial scales el khoury et al 2015 kim et al 2013 qin et al 2019 seung hwan et al 2013 tong et al 2012 tao et al 2015 analyzed the present and future spatial distribution of et in the xiangjiang river basin china et was calculated based on the fao penman monteith fao p m equation under two rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the authors reported that et would increase by 15 6 and 27 3 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively for the period between 2071 and 2100 relative to a 1961 1990 baseline kingston et al 2009 evaluated the performance of six different evapotranspiration equations to an increase of 2ºc in the global mean temperature compared to reference period between 1961 and 1990 five different gcms were used to remove the uncertainty associated with gcm all used methods indicated an increase in evapotranspiration however there were differences between results of more than 100 kingston et al 2009 hence choosing evapotranspiration method affect its future values and is considered an important source of uncertainty veettil and mishra 2018 assessed the individual and combined impacts of climatic changes water demand and land use on ws applying water footprint concept in savannah river basin usa integrated hydrological model was performed in order to calculate temporal and spatial change in ws indicators green water scarcity blue water scarcity hoekstra et al 2011 falkenmark index falkenmark et al 1989 and freshwater provision indicator qin et al 2019 investigated ws status for shandong and henan provinces in china where nine scenarios were generated combining future predictions of land and water use however changes in agricultural water consumption due to climate change were not taken into consideration in that study alkhawaga et al 2018 investigated the land use change for kafr el sheikh governorate egypt using supervised classification of landsat images between 1990 and 2018 the results show that the governorate is suffering from urban sprawl problem agricultural land area increased by about 228 07 km2 during the period from 1990 until 2010 and then the agricultural area started to gradually decrease with an average annual decreasing rate of 0 4 farag et al 2015 estimated that et using fao p m equation of the rice crop in kafr el sheikh governorate would increase by 5 9 and 15 for the summer season of the period 2071 2100 compared to the period 2011 2040 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and almost no change of et was detected under rcp2 6 between 2011 and 2100 in 2019 the effects of climatic and water supply changes on the water balance of the nile delta region were investigated ashour et al 2019 the water demands are expected to increase by 25 in 2050 and 29 in 2100 for b1 scenario while for a2 scenario the increase will be 32 in 2050 and 64 in 2100 assuming no land use changes according to ouda and zohry 2020 the evapotranspiration of kafr el sheikh governorate is expected to increase by about 20 in 2030 compared to that in 2014 based on the rcp6 0 scenario ccsm4 gcm the future impacts of climatic changes based on 2 6 4 5 8 5 rcps on the water footprint for two crops in the nile delta were investigated elbeltagi et al 2020a the study revealed that the future mean increase in 2040 in the required surface water for irrigation will be about 5 6 using neural networks the impacts of climatic changes on wheat evapotranspiration applying hargreaves method for three governorates of the nile delta based on two rcps 4 5 8 5 were investigated elbeltagi et al 2020b the results revealed that kafr el sheikh governorate will record the highest increase by about 11 31 based on the discussed literature the following aspects will be considered in this work to fill gaps of previous research deficits 1 combining the impacts of climatic and land use changes combining temperature slr and land use scenarios 2 using two different evapotranspiration equations 3 using 3 rcps and 3 slr scenarios and 4 investigating future quantities of reused agricultural drainage water and its mixing ratios the objective of this study is to investigate the potential influences of climatic and land use changes on the future ws status of kafr el sheikh governorate as an example of the nile delta governorates compared to the current situation four major water security elements are considered and estimated for the future agricultural land area required irrigation water quantity of agricultural drainage water reuse and water mix ratio between fresh and drainage water the current situation of base year of 2016 is firstly discussed then future water security assessment is performed and compared to the base year conditions two future periods are considered the first period is from 2051 to 2060 2055 while the second period is from 2091 to 2100 2095 combined scenarios of three different aspects are studied 1 future agricultural water consumption represented by reference evapotranspiration under three different rcps scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 according to ipcc ar5 2 slr impacts on the governorate area under 0 5 and 1 0 m relative slr scenarios by calculating resulting losses in the agricultural land areas and 3 the impacts of land use change 2 methodology 2 1 study area kafr el sheikh is an important governorate in egypt s nile delta it contributes by about 30 of the country s rice production and ranks as the first in production of sugar beet and fish the governorate is located between longitudes 30 21 53 e and 31 18 43 e and between latitudes 30 59 38 n and 31 36 7 n it is located along the nile delta coast between the nile river branches fig 1 the northern coast of the governorate lies on the mediterranean sea with a length of about 100 km making it fragile in the face of cc induced threats in particular slr the total area of kafr el sheikh governorate is about 3734 74 km2 in 2016 agricultural land area was reported as about 2500 18 km2 represents 66 9 of the governorate total area and about 7 5 of the total agricultural area in egypt alkhawaga et al 2018 mwri 2016 lake burullus is located at the northern part of the governorate with an area reaches about 453 km2 fig 1 the nile river represented by rosetta branch and main canals is the main freshwater source for the governorate activities winter rain showers that occur on the northern coast of the governorate cannot be relied on groundwater cannot be used due to its excessive salinity as a result of sea water intrusion and also to reduce its impacts applied surface irrigation system has an efficiency that does not exceed 60 mwri 2016 for the year of 2016 the study considered base year the governorate s share of available freshwater for agriculture was about 3 15 bcm and mixing of agricultural drainage water with canals freshwater is carried out to fulfil the agricultural water requirements mwri 2016 2 2 future evapotranspiration estimation future projections of evapotranspiration are of great importance in the assessment of potential impacts of cc on the water resources systems as well as water and food security for this purpose reference evapotranspiration was calculated for the case study kafr el sheikh governorate as a single value due to regional climate model rcm accuracy gcm spatial resolution is too coarse to use its outputs accordingly downscaling approaches are used to downscale gcm outputs to get finer temporal a daily average and spatial resolutions 0 44 latitude longitude resolution about 50 km rcms can be used for dynamically downscaling the global resolution of gcm into a regional scale there are many climate models coordinated in frameworks such as the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project cordex 2019 which produce growing output for ensembles of gcm and rcm combinations to be used in climatic studies as mentioned there are many climatic models the challenge is to select the most appropriate rcms for the study area which represent good fit with climatic variables in this study the outputs of mpi esm lr rca4 and gcm rcm available through cordex project cordex 2019 were used the used rcm was the most accurate among six rcm simulations over the north of nile delta based on the study of shalby et al 2017 for selection of the most accurate simulation the model outputs were compared with corresponding observations of daily maximum mean and minimum air temperature components under the historical experiment between 1994 and 2005 six statistical metrics root mean square error rmse percent of bias pbias absolute mean error ame coefficient of efficiency index of agreement and correlation coefficient were utilized to select the most accurate one shalby et al 2017 there are more than 50 different equations for et estimation lu et al 2005 two different et methods have been considered penman monteith and samani hargreaves equations penman monteith p m equation is recommended by the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 however fao p m equation eq 1 requires many metrological variables so in case of data limitation simplified equations such as samani hargreaves equation can be used et can be obtained according to fao p m equation as follows 1 et o 0 408 r n g 900 ϒ t 273 u 2 e s e a δ ϒ 1 0 34 u 2 where et is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height ºc u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 allen et al 1998 samani hargreaves equation eq 2 is based on mean maximum and minimum temperature and extra terrestrial solar radiation as follows 2 et o 0 0023 r a t max t min 0 5 t 17 8 where et is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mm day 1 tmax is the mean maximum temperature tmin is the mean minimum temperature and t is the mean temperature c hargreaves and samani 1985 this is a well known equation for the calculation of et if only mean maximum and minimum temperatures are available the extraterrestrial radiation ra for different latitudes and for each day of the year can be calculated from the solar declination the solar constant and the date using the following formula zotarelli et al 2010 3 ra 24 π x 60 gsc dr ωs sinφ sinδ cosφ cosδ sinωs where ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 gsc is the solar constant 0 0820 mj m 2 min 1 φ is the latitude rad and dr is the inverse relative distance earth sun given by eq 4 4 d r 1 0 033 cos 2π 365 j where j is the number of the day in the year from 1 1 january to 365 or 366 31 december ω s is the sunset hour angle rad given by eq 5 5 ω s arccos tanφ tanδ δ is the solar declination given by eq 6 6 δ 0 409 sin 2π 365 j 1 39 using the previous equations future et is estimated for three rcp scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 for the period till 2100 considering 2011 2020 as a base period based on ipcc ar5 for the selected rcm et is daily computed based on the available required daily climatic data through the selected rcm daily et values using fao p m equation are directly available however the daily mean maximum and minimum temperature are extracted from the selected rcm considering the latitude in the center of the governorate with a value of 31 2744 north for samani hargreaves equation 2 3 sea level rise classification land use map to assess the slr effects on kafr el sheikh governorate a classification land use map for the governorate should be firstly developed remote sensing represents the appropriate tool for this purpose as it freely provides many temporal and spatial data through the internet and it is considered as a fast easy and economical way especially in case of lack of field data united states geological survey usgs provides landsat images which were chosen to process the required land uses classification due to their multispectral resolution that allows the semi automatic classification usgs 2021 the classification was carried out for the year 2018 on a main captured image by landsat 8 operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor oli tirs on path raw 177 038 on july 23rd two other images for the same year for another agricultural season were selected for classification enhancement using vegetation indices alkhawaga et al 2018 there was no need for cloud masking as the land cloud cover did not exceed 0 08 atmospheric correction using the dos1 method dark object subtraction 1 was performed to the selected image congedo 2016 supervised classification technique was applied using maximum likelihood algorithm to perform land cover classification donia and farag 2012 fan et al 2007 four main land cover classes were identified in the study area 1 water bodies including the nile river branch rosetta branch canals and lake burullus 2 agricultural land which is cultivated with seasonal crops mainly summer and winter seasons vegetables and fruits 3 urban areas including main cities big and small villages roads bare lands and coastal sand areas and 4 fish farms which are artificial water ponds that are used for raising fishes usually for commercial purpose using image processing software qgis a set of input training areas were collected in the image representing the land cover classes based on user field knowledge of the study area each main class consists of sub classes for example water class consists of rosetta branch canals drains and lake burullus sub classes furthermore agricultural land class consists of agricultural fields and burullus vegetation sub classes this was performed to enhance the classification results as a result of the expected slr range which varied significantly over time and researches provided multiple estimates two sea level rise scenarios are frequently used and were chosen for this study a half meter and one meter relative slr 0 5 and 1 0 m these relative slr values are considered the effective rate which is the sum of both the rate of global slr and the rate of land subsidence the inundation maps for kafr el sheikh governorate were extracted after haggag et al 2013 inundated areas were identified and excluded to estimate the loss of each land use class especially for the agricultural lands 2 4 land use change kafr el sheikh governorate is suffering from unorganized high rate urban sprawl as all the nile delta areas rapid urban sprawl has two main impacts the first one is decreasing of the area of agricultural lands which in turn affects the food security status of egypt the second impact is displacement of many people and the loss of many important industrial areas due to slr changes in the agricultural land area of kafr el sheikh governorate was taken after alkhawaga et al 2018 land use change was investigated for the governorate using supervised classification of seven landsat images between 1990 and 2018 1990 1996 2000 2005 2010 2016 and 2018 results confirmed that the governorate is suffering from urban sprawl problem agricultural land area increased by about 228 07 km2 during the period between 1990 and 2010 starting from 2010 agricultural lands area started to decrease with an average annual rate of 0 4 alkhawaga et al 2018 agricultural area will be calculated for two future years of 2055 and 2095 assuming the current annual decreasing rate of agricultural land area 2 5 combined scenarios a set of 18 scenarios are generated combining different sub scenarios which represent future irrigation water demand indicated by et losses in agricultural land area due to slr and urban sprawl two future periods are considered the first period is from 2051 to 2060 2055 and the second is from 2091 to 2100 2095 four water security indicators for kafr el sheikh governorate are selected agricultural land area required irrigation water quantity of reused agricultural drainage water and overall water mix ratio between fresh and drainage water these four ws elements will be presented and discussed for 2016 as the considered base year for this study according to the agricultural water consumption scenarios the impacts of increasing temperature due to cc scenarios on agricultural water consumption based on estimated future values of evapotranspiration will be considered these values are the average of fao p m and samani hargreaves equations three agricultural water consumption sub scenarios et scenarios are adopted as following 1 the first one is based on rcp2 6 emission scenario labelled as rcp26 2 the second one is based on rcp4 5 emission scenario rcp45 3 the third one is based on rcp8 5 emission scenario rcp85 according to the relative slr three sub scenarios will be considered slr scenarios 1 the first sub scenario is assuming no impacts of slr which can be achieved by marine protection works or if the sea level does not rise as much as predicted noslr 2 the second sub scenario is a half meter relative slr 0 5 m by 2095 which means that in 2055 it will be approximately 0 25 m 0 5slr 3 the third sub scenario is one meter relative slr 1 0 m by 2095 i e slr 0 5 m in 2055 1 0slr while for the urban sprawl two sub scenarios will be taken into consideration 1 the first one is the current value of reduction in agricultural lands area 0 4 annually it will be abbreviated as 0 4 us 2 the second sub scenario is assuming no reduction in agricultural lands area which will be achieved if legislations are applied nous changes in land use whether due to urban sprawl or rising sea level and changes in agricultural water requirements are accounted for 18 scenarios of water security conditions in kafr el sheikh governorate in 2055 and in 2095 table 1 explains these combined scenarios its number and a given abbreviation for each one as an example scenario no 16 which is abbreviated as 0 4 us rcp85 noslr is a combination of three sub scenarios as can be seen in fig 2 these sub scenarios are the trend of 0 4 loss of agricultural land area future agricultural water consumption under rcp 8 5 and no impact of slr it should be mentioned that although slr scenarios are usually related to rcp scenarios for scenario no 16 as an example rcp8 5 and no slr are combined and this could exist in a case just like using of marine protection works moreover garner et al 2018 reported that future upper slr projections of rcp8 5 would range from 0 35 to 2 5 m in 2100 while kopp et al 2017 estimated that the upper value of global slr under rcp2 6 would reach 0 98 m by year 2100 due to this uncertainty in slr estimating values and other possible protection works the following combination between rcp and slr scenarios are considered 3 results 3 1 future evapotranspiration estimation in this section future estimates of agricultural water requirements indicated by et are presented fig 3 shows the projected mean et decadal estimates for rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios using fao p m and samani hargreaves equations for the period from 2010 to 2100 decadal values are the summation of the daily values of et mm day mean et estimates using fao p m equation are overestimated samani hargreaves equation by about 17 4 17 5 and 18 5 for rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively for rcp26 scenario no significant future changes can be noticed for both methods of calculations however for scenario rcp45 the mean et would increase by 3 4 for the period 2051 2060 and by 4 0 for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 using fao p m equation future mean et according to samani hargreaves equation would increase by 2 5 and 3 5 for the period 2051 2060 and period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period under rcp45 respectively regarding rcp85 the mean et using fao p m equation would increase by 3 4 for the period 2051 2060 and by 9 9 for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 future mean et according to samani hargreaves equation would increase by 3 3 for the period 2051 2060 and 8 1 for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 under rcp 85 3 2 sea level rise impacts classification results of the landsat 8 selected image captured in 2018 are shown in fig 4 that were generated applying supervised classification using maximum likelihood algorithm fig 5 shows the inundated areas under the 0 5 and 1 0 m relative slr scenarios regarding the half meter relative slr scenario an analysis of the inundated areas was performed to calculate the loss of area for each class the analysis revealed that the governorate would lose about 10 78 of its whole area about 9 31 of the agricultural land area would be inundated additionally the urban and bare land sector would decrease by 13 7 while fish farms would lose about 42 05 of its area as illustrated in table 2 for one meter relative slr scenario about one third of the governorate 32 22 would be inundated see fig 5 agricultural sector would lose about 840 78 km2 34 58 of its area the urban and bare land would lose about 204 19 km2 while fish farms would lose about 158 43 km2 representing 38 63 and 64 21 respectively as indicated in table 2 3 3 analysis of future combined scenarios in this section the results of combined scenarios for kafr el sheikh governorate for the two future periods 2051 2060 2055 and 2091 2100 2095 compared to the base year 2016 are presented agricultural land area was about 2500 18 km2 for the base year 2016 total quantity of mixed irrigation water was about 5 18 bcm 3 15 bcm fresh irrigation water from canals and 2 03 bcm reused agricultural drainage water i e overall mixing ratio is about 1 6 freshwater 1 drainage water mwri 2016 for future combined scenarios no 2 3 5 and 6 table 1 it is worthy to note that rcp26 scenario has been combined with different slr scenarios 0 5 and 1 0 m in order to assess the sensitivity of the water security system of the study area to changes in sea level scenarios solely as rcp26 scenario almost indicates that no changes in agricultural water consumption would occur during the period 2051 2060 2055 according to the water status table 3 illustrates relative changes in required water for agriculture and agricultural drainage water reuse for year 2055 compared to base year 2016 the required water would be 4 3 bcm about 17 1 reduction under the effect of urban sprawl represented by scenario no 4 0 4 us rcp26 noslr while it would be 4 57 bcm 11 8 reduction due to the effect of 1 0 m slr that represented by scenario no 3 changes in agricultural water consumption represented by evapotranspiration would not cause significant effect on the water requirements that would increase by about 0 5 under scenario nous rcp85 noslr no 13 reused water would decrease to reach 1 15 bcm about 43 5 reduction under the effect of urban sprawl only under scenario no 4 0 4 us rcp26 noslr while it would be 1 42 bcm 30 1 reduction due to the effect of 1 0 m slr only scenario no 3 changes in agricultural water consumption under rcp85 would not have significant effect on changes of reused water where it increased by about 1 3 only under scenario nous rcp85 noslr no 13 the maximum losses of agricultural land areas would occur by scenarios no 6 12 and 18 where it would decrease by 24 8 reaching 1880 57 km2 due to both of slr of 1 0 m slr in 2055 would be 0 5 m under the scenario of 1 0 m slr and urban sprawl scenario no 4 0 4 us rcp26 noslr shows the impact of urban sprawl where agricultural land area would decrease by about 17 1 on the other hand scenario no 3 nous rcp26 1 0slr shows the maximum impact of slr only where agricultural land area decreased by 11 8 this indicates that the impact of urban sprawl is greater and more serious than the impact of rising sea levels if climatic changes are considered that may or may not occur or even adaptable urban sprawl is already occurring and at an increasing rate additionally the minimum loss in agricultural land area is about 2 75 under scenarios no 1 7 and 13 as these scenarios assume that there is neither urban sprawl nor slr nous rcp26 noslr nous rcp45 noslr and nous rcp85 noslr this loss was already observed in the land use classification map of year 2018 regarding the period between 2091 and 2100 agricultural land area would significantly decrease under the combined scenarios maximum loss would occur under the combined effect of both urban sprawl and 1 0 m slr impacts it would lose about 1396 66 km2 i e 55 86 reduction under scenarios no 6 12 and 18 see table 3 these reductions would significantly affect the water balance and the food security of egypt agricultural area would decrease by 32 53 considering the impact of urbanization only scenario no 4 while it would decrease by 36 38 considering slr impacts only scenario no 3 this indicates that the impact of rising sea levels is greater and more serious than that of urban sprawl contrary to the results corresponding to the year 2055 where urban sprawl was more effective than slr impact 0 5 m slr maximum decrease in the agricultural required water would be 55 86 required water 2 29 bcm under scenario no 6 0 4 us rcp26 1 0slr as there will not be projected increase in et and the agricultural land area will be minimum while the maximum increase would be under scenario no 7 nous rcp85 noslr as cultivated areas would not almost change and et would have maximum increase under rcp 85 agricultural water requirements would increase to reach 5 49 bcm compared to 5 18 bcm for the base year 2016 which would represent an increase of 6 03 under that scenario in order to fulfil that increase in water requirements agricultural drainage reuse will be performed as it would increase by 15 39 compared to base year the water mix ratio fresh drainage would be 1 34 1 which means that more polluted water would be used this in turn would reduce the overall water quality of irrigation water as water quality of irrigation water decreases the crop yield productivity also decreases which may be considered as another type of agricultural area losses it is noticeable that most combined scenarios have a reduction in the water required and therefore lack of the need to reuse agricultural drainage water in irrigation operations this indicates that the shortage in the agricultural area whether due to urban sprawl or sea level rise has the greatest impact in determining the future water situation of kafr el sheikh governorate for scenario no 6 available freshwater would be more than required irrigation water by about 2 28 bcm which means that no agricultural drainage water will be reused and consequently the overall irrigation water quality will be improved of course it does not mean that it is a good scenario since this excess water is due to the sharp decrease in agricultural land area so required water will be minimum on the other hand decreased agricultural area will also lead to food shortage problem this excess water may be used in other reclamation projects but it is not enough and it will still a problem as a high fertile and productive soil will be lost 4 discussion the results clearly show that climate change has severe impacts on kafr el sheikh governorate egypt increasing air temperatures leads to an increasing in the agricultural water consumption which is represented by reference evapotranspiration et which would increase by about 9 9 and 8 1 according to fao p m and samani hargreaves equations respectively for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 under rcp8 5 these results are consistent with the previous studies of elbeltagi et al 2020b and farag et al 2015 where their estimated increases were about 11 3 and 15 respectively differences in the results returns to the uncertainty of climatic estimates there were differences in et estimates between the used equations reached to about 17 4 for rcp2 6 scenario and about 18 5 for rcp8 5 this agrees with the results of kingston et al 2009 who reported differences in evapotranspiration climate change signal of over 100 between different methods six different et equations the other effect associated with the climatic changes is the rise of sea water level in which two relative slr scenarios were considered 0 5 and 1 0 m relative slr the results showed that under 0 5 m relative slr scenario the governorate would lose about 9 31 226 37 km2 of agricultural land area and 42 05 of fish farms which is in line with the results of hassaan 2013 who estimated that about 208 82 km2 of the agricultural area in kafr el sheikh governorate would be inundated under the impact of global slr of 43 cm and land subsidence this in turn means that water and food security will be significantly affected for 1 0 m relative slr these values increased significantly to be 34 58 and 64 21 for agricultural land area and fish farms area respectively in addition to the increase of the effect of sea water intrusion with freshwater aquifer which will affect the agricultural land with salinity and pollution problems it is worth mentioning that the resulted inundated areas might be exaggerated due to the lack of modern high resolution topographic maps and neglecting the marine protection works urban sector will be negatively affected as it would lose about 13 7 and 38 63 under 0 5 m and 1 0 m relative slr scenarios respectively it is worth to mention that the governorate is suffering from high urban sprawl rate like all the nile delta areas which exacerbates the problem as it would lead to displacement of many people and the loss of many important industrial areas it also must be remembered that urban sprawl only without slr threat is contributing in decreasing the agricultural land area the results of future scenarios clearly show the importance of combining various impacts that the study area is exposed to for example taking the change in agricultural water consumption only in the future can give misleading results at first glance it is expected that required irrigation water will increase under rcp85 the worst scenario of increasing temperature however taking the change in land use due to slr and urban sprawl into consideration changes the future situation significantly as required water would decrease under rcp8 5 scenario because agricultural land area decreased sharply the increase in future required water still has the probability to occur under the combined scenarios nous rcp85 noslr and nous rcp45 noslr no 7 and 13 where the urbanization is controlled and effective slr protection works is applied the eighteen scenarios in this paper include the effects of urban sprawl as well as the impacts of cc represented by changes in evapotranspiration due to increasing temperature scenarios and slr these scenarios include many possibilities of water security status for kafr el sheikh governorate egypt these various scenarios can provide effective and scientific support for government departments and help make decisions and adopt future strategies 16 out of the eighteen combined scenarios suggested decreasing of the required irrigation water due to the decrease in agricultural area these situations will provide excess water that may be used in reclamation projects however it still a problem since the high productive and fertile land of the governorate will be lost this will lead to a shortage of agricultural production and under the conditions of population growth which requires increase in food production it will be a series of challenges to the water and food security of egypt more food would have to be imported to satisfy its own needs which in turn will affect the economic situation negatively hamza and mason 2004 future water security situation for kafr el sheikh governorate is highly sensitive to change in the area of agriculture whether due to urbanization or slr the most probable scenario is scenario no 10 0 4 us rcp45 noslr which assumes the current rate of urbanization moderate increase in agricultural water consumption and no impacts of slr this is because the urban sprawl is not controlled and still occur in this scenario no direct impacts of slr on the agricultural land area is assumed as the government is working on protection works against it however increasing sea level may cause salinity problems which will affect the crop productivity and cause soil deterioration and decrease its sustainability ayers and westcot 1985 under that scenario for year 2055 agricultural land area would decrease to be 2073 6 km2 17 06 reduction compared to 2500 18 km2 for the base year 2016 required irrigation water would decrease by 14 63 and reused drainage water would be 1 27 bcm compared to 2 03 bcm in the base year while agricultural sector would lose 813 4 km2 representing 32 53 reduction for year 2095 total required irrigation water and reused drainage water would decrease by 30 0 and 76 6 compared to year 2016 respectively the irrigation water mix ratio between fresh and reused polluted agricultural drainage water would be enhanced to reach 6 6 1 compared to 1 6 1 for the base year which means that overall water quality of irrigation water would be improved combined scenario of controlled urbanization nous no increase in evapotranspiration rcp26 and no effects of slr noslr i e scenario no 1 produce the best water security situation out of all 18 scenarios the agricultural area and required irrigation water will not almost be affected for both future periods 2055 and 2095 however it should be recognized that improving the efficiency of irrigation and seeking alternative water sources will greatly improve the situation the scenarios established in this study cannot address all possibilities for the future water security situation for the study area the water security status will be affected by various factors like change in available freshwater for the governorate additional set of sub scenarios of available freshwater could be studied for future work available freshwater is influenced by the impacts of cc on nrb or dams construction in upstream countries which will affect the water share of egypt and consequently affect the water share of each governorate it is strongly recommended that similar studies should be carried out for other governorates and the results of these studies should be integrated together providing a clear and an accurate description of the water situation of egypt it is also recommended to take into account the state of water quality and its effects on crop productivity 5 conclusions and policy suggestions this study investigated the effects of future climatic and land use changes on the water and food security of kafr el sheikh governorate egypt for future periods of 2055 and 2095 compared to the current situation eighteen combined scenarios of changes in water consumption scenarios rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 impacts of different slr scenarios no slr 0 5 m slr and 1 0 m slr scenarios and finally the impacts of various urbanization scenarios controlled and high rate of urban sprawl scenarios were generated and discussed current water security situation of kafr el sheikh governorate is critical there is no enough water for irrigation so agricultural drainage water is reused with overall mix ratio of 3 2 between fresh and reused drainage water respectively mwri 2016 most future scenarios suggested that agricultural land area would decrease due to urban sprawl and slr which will cause serious food security problem since the governorate contributes a large percentage to the egyptian agricultural production precautions and adaptation works must be performed to minimize climate change effects in order to reduce the impacts of potential slr marine protection works should be constructed as well as simple technologies such as feeding beaches with sand dredging sediments in waterways and also feeding beaches with these sediments optimization the use of water resources should be performed by improving irrigation water efficiency distribution and conveyance usage of laser land leveling and shifting to less water demanding crops a crop pattern map should be designed that is suitable for available water farmers should be provided with necessary information about new irrigation technology water saving and crop water productivity urban and rural areas should be covered by water sanitation services and industrial centers must be provided with water treatment projects in order to reduce water pollution and thus agricultural drainage water could be safely reused it is important to expand the use of non conventional water resources such as desalination of seawater and safe reuse of groundwater to reduce the impacts of sea water intrusion under integrated water management for sustainable agriculture legislation and laws must be applied to control urban sprawl and reduce the loss rate in the agricultural area the authors believe that the study results can be considered as indications and are not exact expectations due to the uncertainty of climatic estimates and the available resolution of topographic data for future works it is recommended to consider actual existing coastal line protection

9829,egypt faces great challenges to manage its limited freshwater resources shortage in freshwater due to expected stresses of climatic changes and upper nile projects will have major impacts on egypt s water and food security about 85 of the annual total freshwater resource is consumed by agriculture the objective of this work is to assess the future water security situation of kafr el sheikh governorate nile delta egypt under climate change and urbanization stresses compared to the current situation main investigated water security elements for this study were the irrigation water requirements and agricultural land areas two different reference evapotranspiration equations were used to calculate the future irrigation water requirements under three different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios for the period 2010 2100 based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change s 5th assessment report remote sensing and geographical information system gis were used to generate a land use classification map which was used to estimate the losses in each land use category of the study area under 0 5 and 1 0 m relative sea level rise slr estimates combined scenarios of future changes in irrigation water consumption and agricultural land area were analysed the results show that the future water security situation of the governorate is highly sensitive to projected climatic changes moreover most future scenarios revealed that the agricultural land area would decrease which will cause serious food security problems the maximum decrease by about 55 9 of the agricultural land area for year 2095 compared to year 2016 is estimated due to the current annual decreasing rate of 0 4 and 1 0 m slr whatever the applied rcp scenario while the maximum increase in the required irrigation water would be about 6 due to the rcp85 scenario assuming no change in the irrigation land area with a mixing ratio of 1 34 freshwater 1 drainage water which would affect the crop yield productivity a regular assessment of water security elements for each of the egyptian governorates should be managed and an urgent integrated plan for food security to adapt with the future climate change impacts is essential keywords ipcc drainage water reuse nile delta reference evapotranspiration remote sensing slr 1 introduction egypt is consistently reported as a water stressed country the average available water per capita in egypt reached about 589 4 cubic meters in 2017 and it is expected to reach about 350 cubic meters by 2050 el agroudy et al 2016 fao 2019 about 85 of the annual total water resource is consumed by agriculture which is contributing with about 12 of the gross domestic product gdp capmas 2016 eeaa 2016 additionally it is expected that egypt will be affected by the impacts of climatic changes reflected in increasing temperatures sea level rise slr changing patterns of rainfall over egypt and the nile basin which in turn may affect its share of water booij et al 2011 conway 2005 elshamy et al 2009a 2009b elshemy 2017 fawaz and soliman 2016 fenta mekonnen and disse 2018 shalby et al 2021 2020 furthermore the renaissance dam construction has several repercussions that may result into reducing egypt s share of nile water 55 5 bcm thus a regular assessment for the current and future situation of water security is essential water security ws has been defined as the availability of an acceptable quality and quantity of water for health production ecosystems and livelihoods in addition to an acceptable level of water related risks to people economies and environments grey and sadoff 2007 ws could be directly or indirectly affected by climate change water demand land use and governmental management of water resources qin et al 2019 climate change cc is considered as one of the important factors affecting the egyptian water and food security predicted rise of air temperature will increase irrigation water requirements and reduce the productivity of major crops slr will affect coastal areas and its inhabitants especially the nile delta coast abdrabo and hassaan 2015 haggag et al 2013 about 12 of agricultural land areas in the nile delta would be affected by 1 0 m slr and salinization problems tolba and saab 2009 hassaan 2013 estimated that about 8 35 of the agricultural area in kafr el sheikh governorate would be inundated under the impact of global slr of 43 cm and the land subsidence global slr is mainly caused by the thermal expansion of sea water and thawing in the arctic and antarctic of ice sheets intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported that the global slr will continue during the 21st century with a faster rate than observed for the past period between 1971 and 2010 slr will be in the range between 0 26 and 0 82 m for the period 2081 2100 compared to a 1986 2005 baseline pachauri et al 2014 additionally for low sloping plains and deltas a small increase in sea level would lead to a large horizontal transgression moreover saline groundwater can reach large distances into freshwater aquifers sea water intrusion contaminating the freshwater supply of coastal communities for coastal areas the relative rate of slr compared to the land surface is more important than the absolute mean rate of global slr the land level of many coastal areas are decreasing and hence the effective rate of slr is the rate of global slr plus the rate of land subsidence wright et al 2019 despite several researches more than 70 that have estimated the projected values of slr due to cc its values are still uncertain and have a wide range garner et al 2018 understanding the potential impacts of cc is essential for developing adaptation strategies and plans to mitigate future cc induced risks according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the ipcc there are four representative concentration pathways rcps range from the best future situation to the worst one regarding cc rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 these rcps are labeled based on the possible range of radiative forcing values in 2100 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m2 respectively pachauri et al 2014 rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are considered for the current study as they represent the best moderate and worst cc scenarios in addition to cc the assessment of land use classification change is essential for understanding the current situation and the rates of change allowing us to predict what may happen in the future and thus making precautions to mitigate or avoid the expected negative impacts urban sprawl is a troubling problem for food security of egypt because egypt lost about 7 95 of the agricultural land area in the nile delta during the period from 1984 to 2007 in addition to the increase in population arc 2010 many studies used remote sensing rs and gis techniques for this purpose bakr and afifi 2019 congedo and munafò 2014 elagouz et al 2019 shalaby and tateishi 2007 allam et al 2019 future projections of irrigation water requirements are mainly represented by reference evapotranspiration et that is considered the most important parameter used to assess impacts of cc on water resources and hydrologic regimes many studies analyzed different impacts of climate change and land use change on water resources management for many spatial scales el khoury et al 2015 kim et al 2013 qin et al 2019 seung hwan et al 2013 tong et al 2012 tao et al 2015 analyzed the present and future spatial distribution of et in the xiangjiang river basin china et was calculated based on the fao penman monteith fao p m equation under two rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the authors reported that et would increase by 15 6 and 27 3 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively for the period between 2071 and 2100 relative to a 1961 1990 baseline kingston et al 2009 evaluated the performance of six different evapotranspiration equations to an increase of 2ºc in the global mean temperature compared to reference period between 1961 and 1990 five different gcms were used to remove the uncertainty associated with gcm all used methods indicated an increase in evapotranspiration however there were differences between results of more than 100 kingston et al 2009 hence choosing evapotranspiration method affect its future values and is considered an important source of uncertainty veettil and mishra 2018 assessed the individual and combined impacts of climatic changes water demand and land use on ws applying water footprint concept in savannah

index falkenmark et al 1989 and freshwater provision indicator qin et al 2019 investigated ws status for shandong and henan provinces in china where nine scenarios were generated combining future predictions of land and water use however changes in agricultural water consumption due to climate change were not taken into consideration in that study alkhawaga et al 2018 investigated the land use change for kafr el sheikh governorate egypt using supervised classification of landsat images between 1990 and 2018 the results show that the governorate is suffering from urban sprawl problem agricultural land area increased by about 228 07 km2 during the period from 1990 until 2010 and then the agricultural area started to gradually decrease with an average annual decreasing rate of 0 4 farag et al 2015 estimated that et using fao p m equation of the rice crop in kafr el sheikh governorate would increase by 5 9 and 15 for the summer season of the period 2071 2100 compared to the period 2011 2040 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and almost no change of et was detected under rcp2 6 between 2011 and 2100 in 2019 the effects of climatic and water supply changes on the water balance of the nile delta region were investigated ashour et al 2019 the water demands are expected to increase by 25 in 2050 and 29 in 2100 for b1 scenario while for a2 scenario the increase will be 32 in 2050 and 64 in 2100 assuming no land use changes according to ouda and zohry 2020 the evapotranspiration of kafr el sheikh governorate is expected to increase by about 20 in 2030 compared to that in 2014 based on the rcp6 0 scenario ccsm4 gcm the future impacts of climatic changes based on 2 6 4 5 8 5 rcps on the water footprint for two crops in the nile delta were investigated elbeltagi et al 2020a the study revealed that the future mean increase in 2040 in the required surface water for irrigation will be about 5 6 using neural networks the impacts of climatic changes on wheat evapotranspiration applying hargreaves method for three governorates of the nile delta based on two rcps 4 5 8 5 were investigated elbeltagi et al 2020b the results revealed that kafr el sheikh governorate will record the highest increase by about 11 31 based on the discussed literature the following aspects will be considered in this work to fill gaps of previous research deficits 1 combining the impacts of climatic and land use changes combining temperature slr and land use scenarios 2 using two different evapotranspiration equations 3 using 3 rcps and 3 slr scenarios and 4 investigating future quantities of reused agricultural drainage water and its mixing ratios the objective of this study is to investigate the potential influences of climatic and land use changes on the future ws status of kafr el sheikh governorate as an example of the nile delta governorates compared to the current situation four major water security elements are considered and estimated for the future agricultural land area required irrigation water quantity of agricultural drainage water reuse and water mix ratio between fresh and drainage water the current situation of base year of 2016 is firstly discussed then future water security assessment is performed and compared to the base year conditions two future periods are considered the first period is from 2051 to 2060 2055 while the second period is from 2091 to 2100 2095 combined scenarios of three different aspects are studied 1 future agricultural water consumption represented by reference evapotranspiration under three different rcps scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 according to ipcc ar5 2 slr impacts on the governorate area under 0 5 and 1 0 m relative slr scenarios by calculating resulting losses in the agricultural land areas and 3 the impacts of land use change 2 methodology 2 1 study area kafr el sheikh is an important governorate in egypt s nile delta it contributes by about 30 of the country s rice production and ranks as the first in production of sugar beet and fish the governorate is located between longitudes 30 21 53 e and 31 18 43 e and between latitudes 30 59 38 n and 31 36 7 n it is located along the nile delta coast between the nile river branches fig 1 the northern coast of the governorate lies on the mediterranean sea with a length of about 100 km making it fragile in the face of cc induced threats in particular slr the total area of kafr el sheikh governorate is about 3734 74 km2 in 2016 agricultural land area was reported as about 2500 18 km2 represents 66 9 of the governorate total area and about 7 5 of the total agricultural area in egypt alkhawaga et al 2018 mwri 2016 lake burullus is located at the northern part of the governorate with an area reaches about 453 km2 fig 1 the nile river represented by rosetta branch and main canals is the main freshwater source for the governorate activities winter rain showers that occur on the northern coast of the governorate cannot be relied on groundwater cannot be used due to its excessive salinity as a result of sea water intrusion and also to reduce its impacts applied surface irrigation system has an efficiency that does not exceed 60 mwri 2016 for the year of 2016 the study considered base year the governorate s share of available freshwater for agriculture was about 3 15 bcm and mixing of agricultural drainage water with canals freshwater is carried out to fulfil the agricultural water requirements mwri 2016 2 2 future evapotranspiration estimation future projections of evapotranspiration are of great importance in the assessment of potential impacts of cc on the water resources systems as well as water and food security for this purpose reference evapotranspiration was calculated for the case study kafr el sheikh governorate as a single value due to regional climate model rcm accuracy gcm spatial resolution is too coarse to use its outputs accordingly downscaling approaches are used to downscale gcm outputs to get finer temporal a daily average and spatial resolutions 0 44 latitude longitude resolution about 50 km rcms can be used for dynamically downscaling the global resolution of gcm into a regional scale there are many climate models coordinated in frameworks such as the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex project cordex 2019 which produce growing output for ensembles of gcm and rcm combinations to be used in climatic studies as mentioned there are many climatic models the challenge is to select the most appropriate rcms for the study area which represent good fit with climatic variables in this study the outputs of mpi esm lr rca4 and gcm rcm available through cordex project cordex 2019 were used the used rcm was the most accurate among six rcm simulations over the north of nile delta based on the study of shalby et al 2017 for selection of the most accurate simulation the model outputs were compared with corresponding observations of daily maximum mean and minimum air temperature components under the historical experiment between 1994 and 2005 six statistical metrics root mean square error rmse percent of bias pbias absolute mean error ame coefficient of efficiency index of agreement and correlation coefficient were utilized to select the most accurate one shalby et al 2017 there are more than 50 different equations for et estimation lu et al 2005 two different et methods have been considered penman monteith and samani hargreaves equations penman monteith p m equation is recommended by the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 however fao p m equation eq 1 requires many metrological variables so in case of data limitation simplified equations such as samani hargreaves equation can be used et can be obtained according to fao p m equation as follows 1 et o 0 408 r n g 900 ϒ t 273 u 2 e s e a δ ϒ 1 0 34 u 2 where et is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is

equation for the calculation of et if only mean maximum and minimum temperatures are available the extraterrestrial radiation ra for different latitudes and for each day of the year can be calculated from the solar declination the solar constant and the date using the following formula zotarelli et al 2010 3 ra 24 π x 60 gsc dr ωs sinφ sinδ cosφ cosδ sinωs where ra is the extraterrestrial

365 j 1 39 using the previous equations future et is estimated for three rcp scenarios 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 for the period till 2100 considering 2011 2020 as a base period based on ipcc ar5 for the selected rcm et is daily computed based on the available required daily climatic data through the selected rcm daily et values using fao p m equation are directly available however the daily mean maximum and minimum temperature are extracted from the selected rcm considering the latitude in the center of the governorate with a value of 31 2744 north for samani hargreaves equation 2 3 sea level rise classification land use map to assess the slr effects on kafr el sheikh governorate a classification land use map for the governorate should be firstly developed remote sensing represents the appropriate tool for this purpose as it freely provides many temporal and spatial data through the internet and it is considered as a fast easy and economical way especially in case of lack of field data united states geological survey usgs provides landsat images which were chosen to process the required land uses classification due to their multispectral resolution that allows the semi automatic classification usgs 2021 the classification was carried out for the year 2018 on a main captured image by landsat 8 operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor oli tirs on path raw 177 038 on july 23rd two other images for the same year for another agricultural season were selected for classification enhancement using vegetation indices alkhawaga et al 2018 there was no need for cloud masking as the land cloud cover did not exceed 0 08 atmospheric correction using the dos1 method dark object subtraction 1 was performed to the selected image congedo 2016 supervised classification technique was applied using maximum likelihood algorithm to perform land cover classification donia and farag 2012 fan et al 2007 four main land cover classes were identified in the study area 1 water bodies including the nile river branch rosetta branch canals and lake burullus 2 agricultural land which is cultivated with seasonal crops mainly summer and winter seasons vegetables and fruits 3 urban areas including main cities big and small villages roads bare lands and coastal sand areas and 4 fish farms which are artificial water ponds that are used for raising fishes usually for commercial purpose using image processing software qgis a set of input training areas were collected in the image representing the land cover classes based on user field knowledge of the study area each main class consists of sub classes for example water class consists of rosetta branch canals drains and lake burullus sub classes furthermore agricultural land class consists of agricultural fields and burullus vegetation sub classes this was performed to enhance the classification results as a result of the expected slr range which varied significantly over time and researches provided multiple estimates two sea level rise scenarios are frequently used and were chosen for this study a half meter and one meter relative slr 0 5 and 1 0 m these relative slr values are considered the effective rate which is the sum of both the rate of global slr and the rate of land subsidence the inundation maps for kafr el sheikh governorate were extracted after haggag et al 2013 inundated areas were identified and excluded to estimate the loss of each land use class especially for the agricultural lands 2 4 land use change kafr el sheikh governorate is suffering from unorganized high rate urban sprawl as all the nile delta areas rapid urban sprawl has two main impacts the first one is decreasing of the area of agricultural lands which in turn affects the food security status of egypt the second impact is displacement of many people and the loss of many important industrial areas due to slr changes in the agricultural land area of kafr el sheikh governorate was taken after alkhawaga et al 2018 land use change was investigated for the governorate using supervised classification of seven landsat images between 1990 and 2018 1990 1996 2000 2005 2010 2016 and 2018 results confirmed that the governorate is suffering from urban sprawl problem agricultural land area increased by about 228 07 km2 during the period between 1990 and 2010 starting from 2010 agricultural lands area started to decrease with an average annual rate of 0 4 alkhawaga et al 2018 agricultural area will be calculated for two future years of 2055 and 2095 assuming the current annual decreasing rate of agricultural land area 2 5 combined scenarios a set of 18 scenarios are generated combining different sub scenarios which represent future irrigation water demand indicated by et losses in agricultural land area due to slr and urban sprawl two future periods are considered the first period is from 2051 to 2060 2055 and the second is from 2091 to 2100 2095 four water security indicators for kafr el sheikh governorate are selected agricultural land area required irrigation water quantity of reused agricultural drainage water and overall water mix ratio between fresh and drainage water these four ws elements will be presented and discussed for 2016 as the considered base year for this study according to the agricultural water consumption scenarios the impacts of increasing temperature due to cc scenarios on agricultural water consumption based on estimated future values of evapotranspiration will be considered these values are the average of fao p m and samani hargreaves equations three agricultural water consumption sub scenarios et scenarios are adopted as following 1 the first one is based on rcp2 6 emission scenario labelled as rcp26 2 the second one is based on rcp4 5 emission scenario rcp45 3 the third one is based on rcp8 5 emission scenario rcp85 according to the relative slr three sub scenarios will be considered slr scenarios 1 the first sub scenario is assuming no impacts of slr which can be achieved by marine protection works or if the sea level does not rise as much as predicted noslr 2 the second sub scenario is a half meter relative slr 0 5 m by 2095 which means that in 2055 it will be approximately 0 25 m 0 5slr 3 the third sub scenario is one meter relative slr 1 0 m by 2095 i e slr 0 5 m in 2055 1 0slr while for the urban sprawl two sub scenarios will be taken into consideration 1 the first one is the current value of reduction in agricultural lands area 0 4 annually it will be abbreviated as 0 4 us 2 the second sub scenario is assuming no reduction in agricultural lands area which will be achieved if legislations are applied nous changes in land use whether due to urban sprawl or rising sea level and changes in agricultural water requirements are accounted for 18 scenarios of water security conditions in kafr el sheikh governorate in 2055 and in 2095 table 1 explains these combined scenarios its number and a given abbreviation for each one as an example scenario no 16 which is abbreviated as 0 4 us rcp85 noslr is a combination of three sub scenarios as can be seen in fig 2 these sub scenarios are the trend of 0 4 loss of agricultural land area future agricultural water consumption under rcp 8 5 and no impact of slr it should be mentioned that although slr scenarios are usually related to rcp scenarios for scenario no 16 as an example rcp8 5 and no slr are combined and this could exist in a case just like using of marine protection works moreover garner et al 2018 reported that future upper slr projections of rcp8 5 would range from 0 35 to 2 5 m in 2100 while kopp et al 2017 estimated that the upper value of global slr under rcp2 6 would reach 0 98 m by year 2100 due to this uncertainty in slr estimating values and other possible protection works the following combination between rcp and slr scenarios are considered 3 results 3 1 future evapotranspiration estimation in this section future estimates of agricultural water requirements indicated by et are presented fig 3 shows the projected mean et decadal estimates for rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios using fao p m and samani hargreaves equations for the period from 2010 to 2100 decadal values are the summation of the daily values of et mm day mean et estimates using fao p m equation are overestimated samani hargreaves equation by about 17 4 17 5 and 18 5 for rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively for rcp26 scenario no significant future changes can be noticed for both methods of calculations however for scenario rcp45 the mean et would increase by 3 4 for the period 2051 2060 and by 4 0 for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 using fao p m equation future mean et according to samani hargreaves equation would increase by 2 5 and 3 5 for the period 2051 2060 and period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period under rcp45 respectively regarding rcp85 the mean et using fao p m equation would increase by 3 4 for the period 2051 2060 and by 9 9 for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 future mean et according to samani hargreaves equation would increase by 3 3 for the period 2051 2060 and 8 1 for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 under rcp 85 3 2 sea level rise impacts classification results of the landsat 8 selected image captured in 2018 are shown in fig 4 that were generated applying supervised classification using maximum likelihood algorithm fig 5 shows the inundated areas under the 0 5 and 1 0 m relative slr scenarios regarding the half meter relative slr scenario an analysis of the inundated areas was performed to calculate the loss of area for each class the analysis revealed that the governorate would lose about 10 78 of its whole area about 9 31 of the agricultural land area would be inundated additionally the urban and bare land sector would decrease by 13 7 while fish farms would lose about 42 05 of its area as illustrated in table 2 for one meter relative slr scenario about one third of the governorate 32 22 would be inundated see fig 5 agricultural sector would lose about 840 78 km2 34 58 of its area the urban and bare land would lose about 204 19 km2 while fish farms would lose about 158 43 km2 representing 38 63 and 64 21 respectively as indicated in table 2 3 3 analysis of future combined scenarios in this section the results of combined scenarios for kafr el sheikh governorate for the two future periods 2051 2060 2055 and 2091 2100 2095 compared to the base year 2016 are presented agricultural land area was about 2500 18 km2 for the base year 2016 total quantity of mixed irrigation water was about 5 18 bcm 3 15 bcm fresh irrigation water from canals and 2 03 bcm reused agricultural drainage water i e overall mixing ratio is about 1 6 freshwater 1 drainage water mwri 2016 for future combined scenarios no 2 3 5 and 6 table 1 it is worthy to note that rcp26 scenario has been combined with different slr scenarios 0 5 and 1 0 m in order to assess the sensitivity of the water security system of the study area to changes in sea level scenarios solely as rcp26 scenario almost indicates that no changes in agricultural water consumption would occur during the period 2051 2060 2055 according to the water status table 3 illustrates relative changes in required water for agriculture and agricultural drainage water reuse for year 2055 compared to base year 2016 the required water would be 4 3 bcm about 17 1 reduction under the effect of urban sprawl represented by scenario no 4 0 4 us rcp26 noslr while it would be 4 57 bcm 11 8 reduction due to the effect of 1 0 m slr that represented by scenario no 3 changes in agricultural water consumption represented by evapotranspiration would not cause significant effect on the water requirements that would increase by about 0 5 under scenario nous rcp85 noslr no 13 reused water would decrease to reach 1 15 bcm about 43 5 reduction under the effect of urban sprawl only under scenario no 4 0 4 us rcp26 noslr while it would be 1 42 bcm 30 1 reduction due to the effect of 1 0 m slr only scenario no 3 changes in agricultural water consumption under rcp85 would not have significant effect on changes of reused water where it increased by about 1 3 only under scenario nous rcp85 noslr no 13 the maximum losses of agricultural land areas would occur by scenarios no 6 12 and 18 where it would decrease by 24 8 reaching 1880 57 km2 due to both of slr of 1 0 m slr in 2055 would be 0 5 m under the scenario of 1 0 m slr and urban sprawl scenario no 4 0 4 us rcp26 noslr shows the impact of urban sprawl where agricultural land area would decrease by about 17 1 on the other hand scenario no 3 nous rcp26 1 0slr shows the maximum impact of slr only where agricultural land area decreased by 11 8 this indicates that the impact of urban sprawl is greater and more serious than the impact of rising sea levels if climatic changes are considered that may or may not occur or even adaptable urban sprawl is already occurring and at an increasing rate additionally the minimum loss in agricultural land area is about 2 75 under scenarios no 1 7 and 13 as these scenarios assume that there is neither urban sprawl nor slr nous rcp26 noslr nous rcp45 noslr and nous rcp85 noslr this loss was already observed in the land use classification map of year 2018 regarding the period between 2091 and 2100 agricultural land area would significantly decrease under the combined scenarios maximum loss would occur under the combined effect of both urban sprawl and 1 0 m slr impacts it would lose about 1396 66 km2 i e 55 86 reduction under scenarios no 6 12 and 18 see table 3 these reductions would significantly affect the water balance and the food security of egypt agricultural area would decrease by 32 53 considering the impact of urbanization only scenario no 4 while it would decrease by 36 38 considering slr impacts only scenario no 3 this indicates that the impact of rising sea levels is greater and more serious than that of urban sprawl contrary to the results corresponding to the year 2055 where urban sprawl was more effective than slr impact 0 5 m slr maximum decrease in the agricultural required water would be 55 86 required water 2 29 bcm under scenario no 6 0 4 us rcp26 1 0slr as there will not be projected increase in et and the agricultural land area will be minimum while the maximum increase would be under scenario no 7 nous rcp85 noslr as cultivated areas would not almost change and et would have maximum increase under rcp 85 agricultural water requirements would increase to reach 5 49 bcm compared to 5 18 bcm for the base year 2016 which would represent an increase of 6 03 under that scenario in order to fulfil that increase in water requirements agricultural drainage reuse will be performed as it would increase by 15 39 compared to base year the water mix ratio fresh drainage would be 1 34 1 which means that more polluted water would be used this in turn would reduce the overall water quality of irrigation water as water quality of irrigation water decreases the crop yield productivity also decreases which may be considered as another type of agricultural area losses it is noticeable that most combined scenarios have a reduction in the water required and therefore lack of the need to reuse agricultural drainage water in irrigation operations this indicates that the shortage in the agricultural area whether due to urban sprawl or sea level rise has the greatest impact in determining the future water situation of kafr el sheikh governorate for scenario no 6 available freshwater would be more than required irrigation water by about 2 28 bcm which means that no agricultural drainage water will be reused and consequently the overall irrigation water quality will be improved of course it does not mean that it is a good scenario since this excess water is due to the sharp decrease in agricultural land area so required water will be minimum on the other hand decreased agricultural area will also lead to food shortage problem this excess water may be used in other reclamation projects but it is not enough and it will still a problem as a high fertile and productive soil will be lost 4 discussion the results clearly show that climate change has severe impacts on kafr el sheikh governorate egypt increasing air temperatures leads to an increasing in the agricultural water consumption which is represented by reference evapotranspiration et which would increase by about 9 9 and 8 1 according to fao p m and samani hargreaves equations respectively for the period 2091 2100 compared to the referenced period 2011 2020 under rcp8 5 these results are consistent with the previous studies of elbeltagi et al 2020b and farag et al 2015 where their estimated increases were about 11 3 and 15 respectively differences in the results returns to the uncertainty of climatic estimates there were differences in et estimates between the used equations reached to about 17 4 for rcp2 6 scenario and about 18 5 for rcp8 5 this agrees with the results of kingston et al 2009 who reported differences in evapotranspiration climate change signal of over 100 between different methods six different et equations the other effect associated with the climatic changes is the rise of sea water level in which two relative slr scenarios were considered 0 5 and 1 0 m relative slr the results showed that under 0 5 m relative slr scenario the governorate would lose about 9 31 226 37 km2 of agricultural land area and 42 05 of fish farms which is in line with the results of hassaan 2013 who estimated that about 208 82 km2 of the agricultural area in kafr el sheikh governorate would be inundated under the impact of global slr of 43 cm and land subsidence this in turn means that water and food security will be significantly affected for 1 0 m relative slr these values increased significantly to be 34 58 and 64 21 for agricultural land area and fish farms area respectively in addition to the increase of the effect of sea water intrusion with freshwater aquifer which will affect the agricultural land with salinity and pollution problems it is worth mentioning that the resulted inundated areas might be exaggerated due to the lack of modern high resolution topographic maps and neglecting the marine protection works urban sector will be negatively affected as it would lose about 13 7 and 38 63 under 0 5 m and 1 0 m relative slr scenarios respectively it is worth to mention that the governorate is suffering from high urban sprawl rate like all the nile delta areas which exacerbates the problem as it would lead to displacement of many people and the loss of many important industrial areas it also must be remembered that urban sprawl only without slr threat is contributing in decreasing the agricultural land area the results of future scenarios clearly show the importance of combining various impacts that the study area is exposed to for example taking the change in agricultural water consumption only in the future can give misleading results at first glance it is expected that required irrigation water will increase under rcp85 the worst scenario of increasing temperature however taking the change in land use due to slr and urban sprawl into consideration changes the future situation significantly as required water would decrease under rcp8 5 scenario because agricultural land area decreased sharply the increase in future required water still has the probability to occur under the combined scenarios nous rcp85 noslr and nous rcp45 noslr no 7 and 13 where the urbanization is controlled and effective slr protection works is applied the eighteen scenarios in this paper include the effects of urban sprawl as well as the impacts of cc represented by changes in evapotranspiration due to increasing temperature scenarios and slr these scenarios include many possibilities of water security status for kafr el sheikh governorate egypt these various scenarios can provide effective and scientific support for government departments and help make decisions and adopt future strategies 16 out of the eighteen combined scenarios suggested decreasing of the required irrigation water due to the decrease in agricultural area these situations will provide excess water that may be used in reclamation projects however it still a problem since the high productive and fertile land of the governorate will be lost this will lead to a shortage of agricultural production and under the conditions of population growth which requires increase in food production it will be a series of challenges to the water and food security of egypt more food would have to be imported to satisfy its own needs which in turn will affect the economic situation negatively hamza and mason 2004 future water security situation for kafr el sheikh governorate is highly sensitive to change in the area of agriculture whether due to urbanization or slr the most probable scenario is scenario no 10 0 4 us rcp45 noslr which assumes the current rate of urbanization moderate increase in agricultural water consumption and no impacts of slr this is because the urban sprawl is not controlled and still occur in this scenario no direct impacts of slr on the agricultural land area is assumed as the government is working on protection works against it however increasing sea level may cause salinity problems which will affect the crop productivity and cause soil deterioration and decrease its sustainability ayers and westcot 1985 under that scenario for year 2055 agricultural land area would decrease to be 2073 6 km2 17 06 reduction compared to 2500 18 km2 for the base year 2016 required irrigation water would decrease by 14 63 and reused drainage water would be 1 27 bcm compared to 2 03 bcm in the base year while agricultural sector would lose 813 4 km2 representing 32 53 reduction for year 2095 total required irrigation water and reused drainage water would decrease by 30 0 and 76 6 compared to year 2016 respectively the irrigation water mix ratio between fresh and reused polluted agricultural drainage water would be enhanced to reach 6 6 1 compared to 1 6 1 for the base year which means that overall water quality of irrigation water would be improved combined scenario of controlled urbanization nous no increase in evapotranspiration rcp26 and no effects of slr noslr i e scenario no 1 produce the best water security situation out of all 18 scenarios the agricultural area and required irrigation water will not almost be affected for both future periods 2055 and 2095 however it should be recognized that improving the efficiency of irrigation and seeking alternative water sources will greatly improve the situation the scenarios established in this study cannot address all possibilities for the future water security situation for the study area the water security status will be affected by various factors like change in available freshwater for the governorate additional set of sub scenarios of available freshwater could be studied for future work available freshwater is influenced by the impacts of cc on nrb or dams construction in upstream countries which will affect the water share of egypt and consequently affect the water share of each governorate it is strongly recommended that similar studies should be carried out for other governorates and the results of these studies should be integrated together providing a clear and an accurate description of the water situation of egypt it is also recommended to take into account the state of water quality and its effects on crop productivity 5 conclusions and policy suggestions this study investigated the effects of future climatic and land use changes on the water and food security of kafr el sheikh governorate egypt for future periods of 2055 and 2095 compared to the current situation eighteen combined scenarios of changes in water consumption scenarios rcp26 rcp45 and rcp85 impacts of different slr scenarios no slr 0 5 m slr and 1 0 m slr scenarios and finally the impacts of various urbanization scenarios controlled and high rate of urban sprawl scenarios were generated and discussed current water security situation of kafr el sheikh governorate is critical there is no enough water for irrigation so agricultural drainage water is reused with overall mix ratio of 3 2 between fresh and reused drainage water respectively mwri 2016 most future scenarios suggested that agricultural land area would decrease due to urban sprawl and slr which will cause serious food security problem since the governorate contributes a large percentage to the egyptian agricultural production precautions and adaptation works must be performed to minimize climate change effects in order to reduce the impacts of potential slr marine protection works should be constructed as well as simple technologies such as feeding beaches with sand dredging sediments in waterways and also feeding beaches with these sediments optimization the use of water resources should be performed by improving irrigation water efficiency distribution and conveyance usage of laser land leveling and shifting to less water demanding crops a crop pattern map should be designed that is suitable for available water farmers should be provided with necessary information about new irrigation technology water saving and crop water productivity urban and rural areas should be covered by water sanitation services and industrial centers must be provided with water treatment projects in order to reduce water pollution and thus agricultural drainage water could be safely reused it is important to expand the use of non conventional water resources such as desalination of seawater and safe reuse of groundwater to reduce the impacts of sea water intrusion under integrated water management for sustainable agriculture legislation and laws must be applied to control urban sprawl and reduce the loss rate in the agricultural area the authors believe that the study results can be considered as indications and are not exact expectations due to the uncertainty of climatic estimates and the available resolution of topographic data for future works it is recommended to consider actual existing coastal line protection
