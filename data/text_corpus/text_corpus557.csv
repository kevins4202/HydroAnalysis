2785,it becomes necessary to identify the role of openings in the impact of floods on porous buildings to better set up effective strategies for people security within buildings and implement engineering measures for building safety in this study a 3d numerical model is applied to identify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building under different opening configurations including different porosities of the front and back walls various porosities of the back wall and various positions and sizes of the side window i an increasing size of the front and back doors leads to a reduced maximum water level upstream of the building and a reduced area of the wake zone behind the back wall the maximum longitudinal impact force significantly decays with the porosity in terms of a quadratic function form ii a variation in the size of the back door plays a role in controlling the outflow discharge of floodwater from the building however it yields no clear difference in the resultant longitudinal impact force iii in the short term the presence of the side window plays no clear role in affecting the flow field around the building however in the moderate timeframe there is a clear lateral exchange the positions of the side windows play a clear role whereas the size of the lower side window seems to be less important the existence of the side window greatly decreases the lateral impact force especially for the lower sidewall these results are of value to better understand the physical mechanism of the impact process on a porous building for implementing tailored measures for people security and structural safety keywords flood building opening impact numerical simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction between 1994 and 2013 floods accounted for 43 of global natural disaster events affecting 2 5 billion people and leading to 0 16 million deaths cred 2015 hu et al 2018b liu et al 2022 based on a careful estimation by tellman et al 2021 using satellite datasets the total number of global inhabitants living in flood prone areas during 2000 2015 has increased by 58 86 million and the flood affected population ratio has risen by 20 24 in particular this trend is increasing by 2030 tellman et al 2021 in addition by 2030 there will be 43 megacities with a population above ten million all over the world most of which will be in developing countries with rapid urbanization the global population within urban areas will reach 2 5 billion and 68 of the people will even reside in urban areas world urbanization prospects 2018 this situation leads to an increasing flood risk especially within highly populated urban areas chen et al 2015 liu et al 2015 mudashiru et al 2021 performing an urban flood risk assessment and implementing effective risk reduction strategies either engineering or non engineering measures is becoming increasingly urgent hartnett and nash 2017 mudashiru et al 2021 paquier et al 2015 ren et al 2022 tong et al 2021 thus it is necessary to understand that the interaction between flooding processes and elements at risk is a prerequisite in a rapidly changing environment milanesi et al 2014 2018 papathoma köhle et al 2022 shah et al 2021 the interaction of flood and disaster bearing bodies comprises complex processes in general hydraulic characteristics of the flood hazard process and physics of elements at risk are two important factors to characterize this interaction effect mignot et al 2019 mudashiru et al 2021 papathoma köhle et al 2022 numerious studies have been conducted to contribute to the stability of pedestrians milanesi et al 2014 xia et al 2014 safety of parked or movable vehicles martínez gomariz et al 2018 shah et al 2021 damage to buildings fuchs et al 2019 mazzorana et al 2014 milanesi et al 2018 operation of subway or metro systems lyu et al 2020 2019 xu and zhou 2022 maintenance of urban lifeline systems dong et al 2020b a and security of other urban furniture in urban flooding farahmand et al 2021 in particular many vulnerability functions for each type of disaster bearing body have been proposed martínez gomariz et al 2018 milanesi et al 2018 papathoma köhle et al 2022 either physics based or indicator based they showed reliability and feasibility to be incorporated into urban flooding models to quantify the spatial and temporal distributions of flood hazards towards various objects liu et al 2015 musolino et al 2020 wang et al 2021 particularly regarding buildings at flooding risks most previous urban flooding studies considered the façade of the building to be impervious i e nonporous building structure either experimentally or numerically mejía morales et al 2021 mignot et al 2020 however real world urban blocks and individual buildings often comprise some openings e g doors windows gates shafts on their surfaces manawasekara et al 2016 mignot et al 2020 wüthrich et al 2018a as mignot et al 2020 stated during strong flood events although some openings are initially closed they are prone to being partially destroyed or even removed which makes these structures to behave like a passage to allow floodwater intrusion into buildings furthermore no evidence has demonstrated that the lateral exchange between the street network and urban blocks can be discarded mignot et al 2020 furthermore there were some reported casualty events due to material or floodwater intrusion into buildings in flooding events for example a torrential flood event occurred on june 12 2020 in bifeng town zhengan county of guizhou province southwest china report on 2020 6 12 flash flood disaster in zhengan county guizhou province of china 2020 precipitation began at 0 39 in bifeng town and intensified from 2 10 reaching a magnitude of torrential rain 52 mm at 2 50 the maximum hourly precipitation was 163 3 mm at 3 00 4 00 the cumulative precipitation approached 200 3 mm by 3 36 234 6 mm by 4 00 and 266 mm by 9 00 the return periods were deduced to be 1000 and 500 years in terms of the maximum hourly precipitation and a precipitation within 24 h report on 2020 6 12 flash flood disaster in zhengan county guizhou province of china 2020 as shown in fig 1 a i floods in the wujia ditch and the caijia ditch converged together to generate a large flood peak in the middle and lower parts of the river causing serious inundation especially along the a b reach lu 2022 this event has led to 21 124 affected people 2 190 destroyed houses 115 damaged vehicles and 6 500 acres of ruined cropland as well as a 93 8 million rmb economic loss zhou et al 2021 report on flash flood disaster on june 12 2020 in zhengan county guizhou province of china 2020 more seriously 13 persons in their own houses along the a b reach including 9 children drowned which was attributed to an abrupt floodwater invasion into the houses through damaged doors or windows while the trapped people had not enough time to take any preventive and self saving measures especially at night according to a post flood event field survey zhou et al 2021 lu 2022 see fig 1 a ii and iii for a clear flood level mark within a damaged house and that outside of a house respectively from lu 2022 fig 1 a iv show flood debris in the lower reach also from lu 2022 another example was a rainstorm event during august 19 20 2021 in lantian county xi an city of shaanxi province northwest china report on 20210 8 19 flash flood disaster in lantian county xi an city of china 2021 the maximum daily cumulative rainfall reached 203 7 mm in jiujianfang town a rapid water level rise in mountainous rivers created a serious threat to the safety of villagers along the river this event has led to 145 ruined bridges 540 damaged houses and 11 000 acres of destroyed croplands report on 20210 8 19 flash flood disaster in lantian county xi an city of china 2021 in particular as shown in fig 1 b some houses along the river bank have been damaged the floodwater carried with mud violently rushed into the interior of the house and broke house furniture such as beds cabinets and wheel chairs luckily the trapped villagers within the house were successfully saved however the consequent economic loss remained high report on lantian torrential disaster in xi an city of china 2021 therefore it is particularly relevant to investigate the material intrusion process towards urban blocks and individual buildings by considering the facades of building arrays and individual houses as permeable in urban flooding studies evaluating the impact of the material invasion process on buildings is receiving increasing attention from some scholars either experimentally or numerically mazzorana et al 2014 proposed a physics based assessment concept for the vulnerability function of a residential building at the alluvial cone of the grossberg torrent in the italian alps mazzorana et al 2014 their study pointed out that the vulnerability of buildings is greatly dependent on the patterns of material invasion towards the building through doors windows and light shafts in a subsequent study gems et al 2016 numerically investigated the flooding process within the interior of a single family house in the lower reach of the rio vallarsa torrent in the village of laives in italy specifically the hydrodynamic forces on the interior and exterior walls were estimated and flow field characteristics around and within the building were also clarified gems et al 2016 the laboratory physical scaled experiment of sturm et al 2018 also highlighted the influence of the flow passing through the openings of the building on the impact forces on buildings exposed to fluvial hazards including clear water hyper concentrated or debris flow sturm et al 2018 furthermore in urban flooding physical modelling zhou et al 2016 experimentally determined the relationship between the blockage ratio corresponding to different arrangements of pervious and impervious building blocks and flow field characteristics in a simplified urban district zhou et al 2016 whereas a dam break experimental study by liu et al 2018 clearly indicated that the locked unlocked condition of the front door of a simplified house led to a clear water depth discrepancy around and within the house and various associated impact forces on the front door liu et al 2018 focusing on the lateral water exchange between a street network and an urban block in a well controlled laboratory experiment mignot et al 2020 identified the impact of obstacles in a flooded street such as trees cars and traffic lights on the hydraulic characteristics of the flow intrusion process mignot et al 2020 and mejía morales et al 2021 quantified the effect of the porosity of a simplified urban block on the depth and velocity and associated risk for pedestrians in a surrounding street network and within the urban block mejía morales et al 2021 despite this progress how the geometrical configurations of the openings of individual buildings play a role in the flooding process around and within buildings in terms of kinematic and dynamic characteristics remains to be elucidated the objective of this study is to identify and quantify the role of openings in the impact of a flood on a porous isolated building structure by taking a typical dam break induced flood as an example a dam break can occur for various reasons including overtopping foundation defect conduit and valve failure pipeline and seepage damage and as a secondary outcome due to other natural disasters such as earthquakes landslides extreme storms and snow melting peng et al 2021 soares frazão and zech 2007 the idealized porous building adopted in this study represents a typical isolated residential building on the floodplain and its size is reduced in a ratio of 1 10 to that of a real world building peng et al 2021 the structure of this study is arranged as follows section 2 outlines the methodology adopted in this study including the mathematical model the turbulence closure models and the meshing technique by validating the model with an existing dam break flood experimental dataset physical scenario setups for the numerical study are elaborated in section 3 section 4 discusses the simulation results pertaining to the impact of floods on a porous building from the perspective of a kinematic analysis including the flow field around a porous building the impact of porosities of the front and back walls the effect of the porosity of the back wall and the effect of the side window furthermore section 5 interprets the role of openings in the impact of a dam break flood on a porous building in terms of a dynamic analysis i e resultant force and pressure at various configurations of the front and back doors and the side windows the main conclusions are finally drawn in section 6 2 methodology the general computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys fluent is adopted in this study to quantify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building fig 2 illustrates the flow chart of this study including i validating the cfd simulation results with experimental datasets ii different scenario setups of a porous building and a dam break induced flood and iii implementing simulations for each scenario under various configurations and analysing the kinematics and dynamics for different case studies each step will be interpreted in what follows 2 1 mathematical model three governing equations i e continuity equation momentum equation and energy equation are pillars for any cfd modelling study biscarini et al 2010 kang et al 2020 toparlar et al 2017 in this study only mass conservation and momentum conservation equations are adopted because heat transfer is not mentioned in the interaction between dam break floods and buildings biscarini et al 2010 haider et al 2020 considering that the dam break flood propagates rapidly and the flow is strongly turbulent especially when the flood hits the building lobovský et al 2014 soares frazão and zech 2007 tassin et al 2012 the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are used to characterize the impact characteristics of the flood on the building in this study in the cartesian coordinate system the continuity and rans equations for an incompressible homogeneous and viscous fluid can be expressed as hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 kleefsman et al 2005 peng et al 2021 1 v i s i 0 2 v i t v j v i s j 1 ρ p s i s j ν ν t v i s j v j s i g i where s i denotes the coordinates here x y and z denote the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions in the cartesian coordinate system v i is the time averaged velocity here v x v y and v z denotes the longitudinal lateral and vertical components of the velocity t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density g i is the gravitational acceleration ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and ν t is the eddy kinematic viscosity due to the boussinesq assumptions some two equation turbulence closure models pertaining to the turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ε have been proposed to calculate the eddy viscosity ν t for various engineering cases over several decades using the following formula ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ is a constant having different values depending on various models biscarini et al 2010 hien and chien 2021 three typical models that are commonly adopted in previous modelling studies are the standard k ε model rng k ε model which is derived from navier stokes equations using the statistical technique called the renormalization group rng theory and realizable k ε model biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 koutsourakis et al 2012 peng et al 2021 the standard k ε model was proposed by launder and spalding 1972 and has shown its wide applicability for some complex turbulent flows in practical engineering cases cai et al 2020 hien and chien 2021 in this model the turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ε can be calculated by the following equations 3 k t k v i s i s j ν ν t σ k k s j g k ε 4 ε t s i ε v i s j ν ν t σ ε ε s j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ε 2 k where σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ε respectively σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 3 c 1 ε and c 2 ε are two constants c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 and g k denotes the generated turbulence kinetic energy due to the mean velocity and can be estimated by g k ν t v j s i v i s j v j s i compared with the standard k ε model the rng k ε model benefits from the use of an additional term in the ε equation and a presentation of an analytical formula for turbulent prandtl numbers and effective viscosity for both low and high reynolds flows which renders it more accurate and reliable especially for some complicated flows with a high strain rate and a large curvature koutsourakis et al 2012 papageorgakis and assanis 1999 peng et al 2021 in this model the k equation is the same as that in the standard k ε model that is eq 3 except for some different constants however the ε equation turns out to be 5 ε t s i ε v i s j ν ν t σ ε ε s j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ε 2 k r e r e c μ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k η k ε g k ν t where an addition term that can characterize the sheared turbulence r e has been added the constants are taken as the following values in this model c μ 0 0845 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 68 σ k σ ε 0 7179 β 0 012 and η 0 4 38 compared with the standard k ε model the realizable k ε model on the one hand comprises a new formulation for the eddy viscosity and on the other hand the ε equation has been generated from the mean square vorticity fluctuation equation biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 particularly the k equation is again the same as that in the standard k ε model except for different constants nevertheless the ε equation has the following form 6 ε t s i ε v i s j ν ν t σ ε ε s j c 1 s ε c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 η s k η s v j s i v i s j in this model the constants are c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 in this study the dam break induced flood propagates rapidly downstream and there exists a clear interface between the air phase and water phase the flow is strongly turbulent especially when interacting with the building consequently the free surface varies significantly and a large amount of air has been entrained into the flow lobovský et al 2014 soares frazão and zech 2007 for this characteristic the volume of fluid vof method embedded into the software shows its capability to capture the free surface during simulation processes hirt and nichols 1981 kleefsman et al 2005 vignesh and bakshi 2013 the vof model can model both air and water by solving a single set of momentum equations and tracking the volume fraction of each of the fluids throughout the computational domain kleefsman et al 2005 vignesh and bakshi 2013 the transient tracking of the air water interface is performed by solving a continuity equation for the volume fraction of each fluid phase furthermore for each computational cell a function f is defined to be the ratio of the volume occupied by water to that of the whole cell and the following characteristic can be identified the cell is full of water for f 1 otherwise the cell is occupied by air at f 0 and the cell contains the air water interface i e free surface for 0 f 1 hirt and nichols 1981 hu et al 2018a peng et al 2021 the abovementioned governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method for the spatial scale and the forward euler method for the temporal scale the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm is employed to solve the coupling between velocity and pressure in the governing equations hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 peng et al 2021 the second order upwind scheme is used for the discretization of convective and diffusion terms the calculation iterations are continued until the relative error is below a given small value of 10 5 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 more introduction regarding the model formulation model convergence and model efficiency can be found in some studies biscarini et al 2010 ansys fluent theory guide 2018 2 2 validation of the model by experimental datasets computational accuracy and efficiency are two important aspects in numerical modelling studies koutsourakis et al 2012 toparlar et al 2017 the former relies on many factors such as mesh quality turbulence closure model and wall function formulation while the latter is often dependent on the grid size adopted in the study a fine grid size leads to simulation results that can reproduce observational datasets well but at a cost of increasing computational time and data storage requirements haider et al 2020 hu et al 2018a kang et al 2020 papageorgakis and assanis 1999 therefore it is necessary to identify an efficient numerical simulation method while maintaining a high computational accuracy depending on different engineering cases in this study we adopt the dam break flow experimental datasets of kleefsman et al 2005 to validate the numerical model in terms of the turbulence model chosen mesh classification and mesh size a simple dam break flow experiment was performed at the maritime research institute netherlands marin by kleefsman et al 2005 which has been frequently adopted to validate some numerical models by previous researchers issakhov et al 2018 methods et al 2011 tassin et al 2012 xin et al 2022 as shown in the left panel in fig 3 a water tank its dimensions are 3 22 m in length 1 m in width and 1 m in depth with an open roof and a horizontal bottom was adopted in their experiment the tank is divided into two parts by a moveable vertical door on the right side there exists a water body column with a depth of 0 55 m while on the left side a solid box with dimensions of 0 403 m length 0 161 m width 0 161 m depth has been placed to represent an isolated solid building the instantaneous release of the left water column can be realized by rapidly pulling the door up to impact the solid building downstream during the experiment kleefsman et al 2005 used four vertical height probes to measure instantaneous water depths at different cross sections one is in the reservoir h4 and the other three are in the left tank h1 h2 and h3 eight pressure sensors four on the front of the building s1 s4 and four on the top s5 s8 were used to measure the pressures at different points of the building when the flood interacts with it see the right panel in fig 3 2 2 1 turbulence model for validation study this study adopts rans equations to model the dam break flows around a building considering a trade off between computational efficiency and operational accuracy this is one of the most commonly used methods for turbulent flow modelling as shown by previous numerical studies biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 peng et al 2021 toparlar et al 2017 as already mentioned in the last section for rans equations there are two equation turbulence models to calculate the eddy viscosity coefficient including standard k ε rng k ε and realizable k ε in this study these three turbulence models are compared in terms of simulation accuracy against experimental datasets in the numerical setups the geometry of the computational domain remains the same as in the experimental case see the left panel in fig 3 the chosen grid size is 10 80 mm the wall function is set to be an enhanced wall treatment and the surface tension is 0 073 n m the two phase fluid module using vof is activated the nonslip condition is applied to the bottom and the sidewalls of the domain without water inflow outflow while the pressure outlet is set to be the top of the domain i e air can enter freely a fixed 0 001 s time step is implemented in the entire modelling fig 4 compares the water depth h using three turbulence models and measured values at four cross sections it is clear that either of the turbulence models can capture the variation trend of water depth with time well and they are almost coincident with each other however there is also a clear deviation at h1 especially when t 1 2 5 s where the rng k ε model leads to a water depth fluctuation and cannot reproduce the first peak value on the other hand fig 5 compares the predicted pressures p against the experimental datasets at s1 s3 s5 and s7 three turbulence models predict a similar result showing good agreement with experimental data points especially for s1 and s3 nevertheless for s5 and s7 both the standard k ε and realizable k ε models overpredict the pressure peak value at t 1 5 2 5 s whereas the rng k ε model clearly underestimates it therefore by comprehensively considering the simulation effect of these models computational costs and practical guidelines from previous studies biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 papageorgakis and assanis 1999 peng et al 2021 this study applies the realizable k ε turbulence model to simulate the dam break flow around a porous structure later 2 2 2 mesh size for validation study mesh size is one of the most considerable aspects in numerical modelling studies fondelli et al 2015 liu and niu 2019 2016 toparlar et al 2017 this study chooses five types of mesh classification techniques to investigate the sensitivity of simulation results to mesh configurations as listed in table 1 scenarios 1 2 and 3 correspond to a coarse mesh size of 80 mm for the entire computational domain however they differ in depicting the surface of the building the local refined mesh sizes are 10 20 and 30 mm respectively they are set up here to validate the effect of a local mesh refinement hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 peng et al 2021 scenario 4 is set to be further double refined based on scenario 1 that is the mesh size reduces to 40 mm for the total domain while the mesh size for the surface of the building turns out to be 5 mm additionally in scenario 5 an adaptation function based on the gradient of the volume fraction was defined for the grid configuration at the water air interface fondelli et al 2015 because the refinement level is 2 scenario 5 has the same mesh configuration as that for scenario 4 the maximum mesh size is 40 mm whereas the minimum mesh size is reduced to 5 mm fig 6 shows the comparison of modelled water depths using scenarios 1 2 and 3 and experimental datasets at h1 h2 h3 and h4 respectively in general these scenarios can capture the temporal variation in water depth within the water tank despite some small lags and discrepancies when the movable door is pulled up the floodwater wave propagates downstream which leads to a rapid decrease in the water level at h4 and a gradual increase in the water level at h3 h2 and h1 after the wave interacts with the left wall of the tank the floodwater begins to climb upwards along the wall surface later after a jet like flow drops under gravity on the underlying flow the reflected wave propagates upstream which induces water levels at h1 and h2 to reach the peak at almost t 1 5 s and t 2 s respectively finally after some time the free surface varies violently and the floodwater flows back and forth within the tank kleefsman et al 2005 lobovský et al 2014 it is noted that scenario 1 can predict the peak value of the water level of h1 at t 1 2 2 s better than scenarios 2 and 3 for h3 scenario 3 overestimates the depth much more than the other scenarios especially for the peak modelled positions of the peak water depth using scenarios 1 2 and 3 also have a lag in relation to experimental points especially for the second crests of h1 h2 and h4 and the third crest of h3 which occurs possibly because the effect of the instantaneous opening of the door is difficult to identify in the numerical modelling kees et al 2011 kleefsman et al 2005 lobovský et al 2014 the predicted pressures and experimental datasets at s1 s3 s5 and s7 are compared in fig 7 by and large either scenario 1 2 or 3 can mimic the pressure variation pattern at different points on the building surface in particular the modelled results show a higher peak value than the experimental data at s1 and s3 which shows the sensitivity of the modelled results to grid size furthermore the modelled result slightly lags behind the experimental data in terms of the occurrence time of the pressure peak and this phenomenon has also been revealed by kankanamge et al 2020 for s5 and s7 the model yields an additional pressure peak at almost t 1 2 s that does not yet appear in the experimental data this occurs possibly because there is a pocket of air between the top of the building and splashing water which causes the pressures at s5 and s7 to gradually increase until the flow hits the surface of the building as mentioned by colomés et al 2021 however the numerical model in this study does not consider this effect the water depths and pressures predicted using scenarios 1 4 and 5 against the experimental datasets are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively from fig 8 all three mesh configurations generally lead to good prediction accuracy against the experimental datasets in fig 9 either of three mesh configurations can capture the pressure well for s1 and s3 however for s5 and s7 a coarse grid configuration scenario 1 overestimates the pressure peak value in contrast those refined mesh structures scenarios 4 and 5 show a better prediction accuracy in summary those chosen mesh configurations can depict well the kinematics and impact dynamics regarding the effect of a dam break flood on a solid building however of note a refined grid also leads to an increasing computational cost while improving the modelling accuracy as listed by the fourth column in table 1 the total consumption times by scenarios 1 2 and 3 when modelling the flood routing around the building for 6 s are 43 544 s 38 504 s and 31 477 s respectively whereas for a refined mesh case scenario 4 it increases to 82 271 s in contrast the adaptive meshing technique scenario 5 only consumes 35 393 s while maintaining a high modelling accuracy which is even shorter than a coarse mesh configuration case i e scenario 2 therefore the adaptive meshing technique is validated to be an efficient method that guarantees both modelling accuracy and computational resource savings and will be adopted in subsequent numerical calculations 3 application of the numerical model according to a survey of single story building structures in china liu et al 2018 manawasekara et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 design code for residential buildings 2020 a typical building with a length of 8 m a width of 6 m a height of 5 m a wall thickness of 240 mm and a roof thickness of 120 mm is adopted in this study in numerical setups the building is configured with a reduced dimension of 1 10 fig 10 a and b show the top view and side view of the building respectively nine scenarios for different opening configurations are implemented in this study fig 10 c and d illustrate the geometrical dimensions of the front door and the middle side window of the building and fig 10 e shows a side window that lies in the lower part of the façade of the building table 2 presents all nine opening configurations adopted in this study scenario 1 points to an open door with dimensions of 180 mm width 200 mm height corresponding to a door with 1 8 m 2 m at the prototype scale on the front wall and a door with the same dimensions on the back wall design code for residential buildings 2020 the porosity n is the ratio of the opening area to the total wall area scenarios 2 3 and 4 gradually increase the porosities of the front and back walls n 15 63 28 13 54 69 to investigate the effect of the porosities of the front and back walls design code for residential buildings 2020 by maintaining a fixed porosity of the front wall n 11 25 scenarios 5 and 6 change the porosity of the back wall mignot et al 2020 scenario 7 adds two side windows in the middle of the sidewalls of the building in comparison to scenario 1 scenario 8 places the side windows in the lower part of the sidewall to allow a free lateral flow exchange scenario 9 increases the sizes of the side windows to study the impact of the porosities of the sidewalls mejía morales et al 2021 following some previous suggestions in urban flooding studies and guidelines biscarini et al 2010 liu et al 2018 soares frazão and zech 2007 the computational domain is set as follows as illustrated in fig 11 the x y and z axes denote the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively let h be the characteristic length which is equal to the height of the building the distance between the building and the breach is set to 12 h liu et al 2018 soares frazão and zech 2007 and the length from the building to the outlet boundary is 8 h aureli et al 2015 soares frazão and zech 2007 the distance between the building and each side boundary is 5 h wüthrich et al 2018a b zhou et al 2016 whereasthe vertical distance between the roof and the upper boundary is limited to 2 h as shown by the blue colour in fig 11 the length and width of the reservoir on the left side of the domain are 14 h and 10 h respectively biscarini et al 2010 lobovský et al 2014 peng et al 2021 soares frazão and zech 2007 toparlar et al 2017 in total the computational domain has dimensions of 17 m in length 5 m in width and 1 5 m in height the initial water depth in the reservoir is simply adopted to be 0 8 m as in wen 2015 regarding the boundary conditions a free outflow boundary is applied to the lower boundary while on the bottom and two sides of the domain a nonslip condition is employed as well as a pressure outlet for the top boundary the realizable k ε turbulence model is adopted to simulate the flooding impact and an adaptive meshing technique is used for the subdivision of the computation domain biscarini et al 2010 fondelli et al 2015 the simulation time in this study is adapted to be 9 s comprising a complete process of the impact an initial impact phase a rising phase and a final receding phase which is applicable for characterizing the impact of a dam break flood on a porous building flow field the maximum resultant horizontal impact force the pressure distribution on the façade of the building etc as will be presented in all details in the following sections section 4 and section 5 this simulation time is also analogous to the numerical work of peng et al 2021 and the flood impact experimental works of wüthrich et al 2018a 2018b 2020 which could be valid for the real world cases 4 results and discussion kinematic analysis 4 1 effect of openings on the flow field around a porous building first to investigate the effect of openings on the flow field around a building the flow field around a solid building i e without any door and window on its facade is also modelled in this study all numerical configurations for the solid building are the same as those of the porous building mentioned above except for the porosity of the building fig 12 shows the contours of the longitudinal velocity component v x near the solid building at three different times t in general the variation in the flow field can be classified into three phases i impact phase t 0 3 s when a dam break occurs the floodwater wave rapidly propagates downstream and it almost hits the front end of the building at t 1 45 s as shown in fig 12 a at t 2 4 s due to the hindrance of the building the floodwater is separated into two parts one part continually rises on the front wall of the building and after climbing up to the eave it splashes upwards and subsequently drops onto the underlying fluid due to gravity which leads to a reflected wave that propagates upstream it interacts with an upstream incoming flow which causes the free water surface with entrainment of air to vary violently upstream of the building another part of floodwater flows around the building downstream forming two symmetrical flows relative to the longitudinal centerline of the domain these two flows intersect at an approximate distance of 0 6 m at t 2 4 s behind the building to group again to form a stream of floodwater as illustrated in fig 12 b there is a triangular vacant region between the back wall of the building and the intersection point ii rising phase t 3 6 s as shown in fig 12 c and d at t 5 s floodwater accumulates in front of the frontal wall due to the hindrance effect of the building and an upstream incoming flow leading to a rapidly rising water level in particular a bow wave forms at t 3 s as also revealed by goseberg and schlurmann 2014 see fig 12 d and when the water level reaches the highest value at t 5 s there is still a small part of floodwater that flows through the eave towards the back of the building see fig 12 d furthermore with an increasing amount of floodwater around the building converging at a longitudinal distance from the back wall the triangular wake zone is gradually occupied by floodwater iii receding state t 6 9 s more upstream regions are affected by the bow wave that propagates upstream leading to a reduced water level in front of the building as shown in fig 12 e and f at t 8 s the longitudinal velocity especially downstream of the domain begins to attenuate until the floodwater flows completely out from the domain see fig 12 f some of these characteristics have also been revealed by previous studies for example soares frazão and zech 2007 aureli et al 2015 lobovský et al 2014 and peng et al 2021 in contrast taking the case of a porous building with porosities of both the front and back walls of 11 25 as an example fig 13 shows the contours of the longitudinal velocity component v x near the porous building at three different times t 2 5 and 8 s the flow field around a porous building can also be characterized by three phases i impact phase t 0 3 s for the case of a porous building as shown in fig 13 a floodwater that impacts the building is divided into three parts due to the blocking effect one part of the floodwater stops moving downstream and climbs upwards on the façade of the front wall subsequently experiencing a reflection and dropping onto the underlying fluid compared to the case of a solid building wüthrich et al 2018b the reflected flow is weak so that the water level upstream of the building varies gently wüthrich et al 2018a the second part of floodwater can enter and leave the interior of the building through the front and back doors in terms of a jet like flow respectively chek et al 2020 chinnarasri et al 2013 wüthrich et al 2018a as a large quantity of floodwaters rapidly enters the building while there is not enough time for those floodwaters already existing within the building to flow out through the back door floodwater accumulates in the interior of the building leading to an increasing water level within the building the last part of floodwater flows around the building and two pieces of flows finally converge at a position behind the back wall to form a piece of floodwater which is analogous to the case of a solid building it is clear that because a jet like flow passes through the front and back doors the convergence time progresses earlier t 2 s and the triangular wake zone is greatly reduced in terms of area fig 13b ii rising phase t 3 6 s as shown in fig 13 c and d at t 5 s a large amount of floodwater accumulates in front of the front wall because the door is so small that not all floodwater can enter the building which leads to an uplifted water level upstream of the building especially at t 3 s a bow wave forms and the water level reaches the roof at t 5 s however by comparing fig 13 d and fig 12 d it is clear that the area affected by the bow wave is reduced as the jet like flow passes through the front and back walls and part of the floodwater around the building converges the triangular wake zone almost vanishes fig 13 d iii receding state t 6 9 s as described by fig 13 e and f at t 8 s the longitudinal velocity slows and the water level begins to decrease upstream of the building as time progresses in particular the velocity in the centre part of the interior of the building is higher than that in other regions within the building this implies that the floodwater can steadily flow through the back door and the velocity begins to attenuate until the floodwater flows out completely from the domain 4 2 impact of porosities of the front and back walls on flow field to investigate the impact of porosities of the front and back walls on the flow field around a porous building fig 14 a1 f3 show the cfd simulated contours of the longitudinal velocity component v x near the porous building at three times t 2 5 and 8 s for three porosity cases n 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively by comparing them as well as fig 13 for n 11 25 the following conclusion can be made an increasing size of the front door leads to a reduced area of the impervious part of the wall generating a weak reflected wave when the floodwater impacts the frontal wall it has a weak effect on the water level upstream of the building in particular a large size of the front door allows more floodwater to flow through it and consequently there is a small amount of floodwater that accumulates in front of the frontal wall therefore the formed bow wave has a small influence on the upstream flow for example the formed maximum water levels decrease to be approximately 0 52 0 50 0 48 and 0 45 m at n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively see fig 13 c fig 14 c1 c2 and c3 while the affected range by the bow wave towards the upstream flow decreases to be almost 0 72 0 7 0 65 and 0 30 m at n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively see fig 13 d 14 d1 14 d2 and 14 d3 it is also evident by comparing fig 13 b d and f fig 14 b1 d1 and f1 fig 14 b2 d2 and f2 and fig 14 b3 d3 and f3 that the volume of the floodwater that enters the interior of the building is almost proportional to the size of the front door for those cases of large front and back doors more parts of floodwater can easily pass through the building through them in terms of a jet like flow lukkunaprasit et al 2008 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 wüthrich et al 2018a this finally leads to a reduced area of the wake zone behind the back wall of the building 4 3 effect of the porosity of the back wall the size of the back door plays a role in controlling the outflow discharge hence affecting the flow field within the building even that in front of the front wall lukkunaprasit et al 2008 manawasekara et al 2016 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 wüthrich et al 2018a keeping a fixed porosity of the front wall n 11 25 fig 15 shows the simulated flow field around the building when the porosity of the back wall is n 6 25 and 15 63 at three times t 2 5 and 8 s respectively the modelled flow field for n 11 25 is shown in fig 13 by pairwise comparing fig 15 a1 f1 and fig 13 a f it is observed that in the short term for the case of n 6 25 the floodwaters that enter the interior of the building through the front door do not completely flow out from the building through the black door this leads to an accumulation of floodwater within the building there is also strong turbulence within the building because the floodwater velocity is high and varies rapidly in contrast fig 15 a2 f2 and fig 13 a f show that a large back door allows more floodwaters to discharge from the building which generates a lower water level within the building and a higher water level behind the back wall as time progresses the flow entering the building and leaving the building become relatively quasi stable for the case of a small back door the water level is higher in front of the building and the area affected by the bow wave is slightly larger because there is a limited size for the floodwater to discharge from the building in comparison to the case of a larger back door fig 15 d1 and f1 and fig 15 d2 and f2 4 4 impact of opening of the sidewall this section explores the possible effect of the sidewall opening on the flow field around a porous building lukkunaprasit et al 2008 wüthrich et al 2018a using the case of both porosities of the front and back walls being 11 25 but without any windows on the sidewalls of the building as shown in fig 13 as a reference fig 16 a1 e3 show the cfd simulated contours of the lateral velocity v y in y z section of the building along the lateral centerline at five times t 2 3 4 5 and 8 s for three porosity cases of sidewalls n 12 5 the window is in the middle of either of the sidewalls 12 5 the window lies in the lower part of either of the sidewalls and extends to the building s bottom and 25 the doubled window still lies in the lower part of either of the sidewalls and extends to the building s bottom respectively the floodwater velocity is high in the short term for example t 2 s after the dam break occurs a part of the floodwater enters the interior of the building through the front door and finally leaves the building through the back door except for the middle passage where floodwater rapidly moves there is little floodwater within the building see fig 16 a1 a2 and a3 specifically because another part of floodwater flows rapidly around the building downstream there is no large amount of floodwater near the two sidewalls of the building because the water level does not reach the lower bound of the side window fig 16 a1 outer floodwater does not flow into the interior of the building even for the case of the side window that lies in the lower part of the sidewall there is little floodwater that can enter the building fig 16 a2 and a3 this occurs because when a dam break occurs floodwater waves rapidly propagate downstream and there is a small lateral velocity which leads to a weak lateral exchange of floodwater between outside and inside the building wüthrich et al 2018a for this case opening of the sidewall in terms of position and size plays no clear role in reshaping the flow field around the porous building with an increasing upstream flow floodwater accumulates and spreads out in the interior of the building fig 16 b1 b2 and b3 for the case of the middle side window fig 16 d1 the water level in the building rises to 0 125 m at t 4 s which is near the upper bound of the side window however the outer water level around the side window is low therefore floodwater inside the building flows towards outside the building in contrast for both cases of the side window that lies in the lower part of the sidewall the water level outside the side window surpasses that inside the window earlier at t 3 s see fig 16 c2 and d2 and fig 16 c3 and d3 consequently floodwater outside the building can flow into the interior of the building by comparing fig 16 d2 and d3 there exists a clear trend the larger is the size of the side window the larger the lateral water exchange discharge becomes finally after a longer period of time for example t 8 s there may be an approximate equilibrium between the water level outside the window and that inside the window implying that there is little lateral exchange of floodwater within the domain as shown in fig 16 e1 e2 and e3 respectively particularly fig 17 a d present the temporal variations in estimated discharges q of the floodwater that enters or leaves the building through the front and back doors respectively and a lateral exchange discharge through two side windows for a porous building with porosities of the front and back walls of 11 25 but without a side window a porous building with two side windows in the middle of the sidewalls a porous building with two side windows in the lower part of the sidewalls and a porous building with two double sized side windows in the lower part of the sidewalls here the discharge q is calculated by integrating the normal velocity over corresponding areas of the door or the window it is noticeable that the flow discharges through the front and back doors are much larger than the lateral exchange discharge through side windows regardless of any configuration of the side window mejía morales et al 2021 mignot et al 2020 regarding the lateral exchange discharge fig 17 e shows all data for three configurations of the side window it is observed that the positions of the side windows play a clear role in affecting the lateral exchange discharge for the case of the side window that lies in the middle of the sidewall the floodwater outside the building begins to flow towards the building at approximately t 2 s through the side window and the maximum discharge reaches almost 0 0039 m3 s in contrast for both cases of the side windows in the lower part of the sidewall a lateral exchange occurs earlier at approximately t 1 6 s and the maximum discharge can increase to 0 0107 m3 s additionally by comparing both cases of side windows in the lower part of the sidewall it is found that the size of the side window seems to play no role in affecting the lateral exchange discharge 5 results and discussion dynamics analysis 5 1 impact force the impact force of a dam break induced flood on a building is an important parameter for formulating the safety criterion of the building in actual engineering applications linton et al 2013 manawasekara et al 2016 sha et al 2016 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 wüthrich et al 2020 2018a this study calculates the impact force on a porous building exerted by floodwater by integrating the simulated pressures over different areas of the facades of the building for example the resultant longitudinal impact force f x on the building is calculated using the following formula 7 f x p d s where p is the pressure in the longitudinal direction s is the area and the integral is taken over the front and back walls of the building the following results show the effects of porosities of the front and back walls porosity of the back wall and opening of the wide wall on a resultant impact force of the building exerted by the floodwater 5 1 1 effect of the porosity of the front and back walls fig 18 a shows the calculated longitudinal impact force f x on the building for five porosity cases of the front and back walls of the building with time n 0 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 for three cases of n 0 11 25 and 15 63 after the floodwater hits the building s front wall t 1 5 s f x first increases to a peak value almost at t 2 2 5 s and then decreases to a trough before rising again to the second peak value almost at t 4 5 5 s followed by a rapid attenuation after t 5 s however for both cases of n 28 13 and 54 69 f x exhibits a steadily rising trend until reaching a peak value one peak merely occurs and significantly decays with time a possible interpretation is presented as follows for an impervious or less porous building n 0 11 25 15 63 the area of the front wall impacted by the incoming floodwater is large when the floodwater hits the frontal wall at t 1 5 s it yields a large impact force on the wall meanwhile a part of floodwater climbs up on the façade of the front wall and there is a reflected flow due to the hindrance of the eave of the building lukkunaprasit et al 2008 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 in this case the longitudinal force f x on the building exerted by the floodwater reaches a peak value later the reflected flow drops onto the underlying fluid due to gravity which affects the upstream flow to decrease its velocity consequently f x begins to decline a continually incoming upstream flow leads to an accumulation of more floodwaters in the front of the front wall and a bow wave occurs it raises the water level to surpass the eave and even rises to the roof which again increases the impacted area of the front wall by the floodwater and thereby leads to an occurrence of the second peak of f x furthermore the water level behind the back wall gradually rises as more floodwaters around the building begin to converge along with a jet like flow through the small front and back doors these comprehensively contribute to a negative impact force on the back wall i e the impact force points upstream meanwhile with a decreasing water level and a slower velocity upstream of the building due to attenuation of a bow wave the impact force on the frontal wall by the floodwater also declines as a result the resultant longitudinal impact force f x on the building rapidly decays with time however for those larger porous buildings n 28 13 and 54 69 the impacted area of the front wall by the floodwater becomes much smaller which yields a comparatively small impact force on the other hand a large part of floodwater can enter and leave the building through large doors more floodwater accumulates behind the back wall leading to a large negative impact force on the building as a result only a peak value of f x may occur and it occurs when a large amount of backwater is present in front of the front wall furthermore it is clear from fig 18 a that in the initial period t 1 5 2 5 s of the impact process f x decreases with increasing n this occurs because in the early period of the impact process a part of the floodwater can flow through the front door to the inner building which decreases the climbing velocity and height of the rest of the floodwater on the front wall in addition a large n also results in a reduced area of the front wall impacted by the floodwater consequently leading to a decreased f x on the building at the recession period of f x when t 5 s it is also clear that f x is lower at a large n this occurs because a large front and back door allows a large amount of floodwater to enter and leave the building on the one hand this implies a small hindrance effect of the front wall on the floodwater which causes the water level before the front wall due to the formed bow wave to decrease and reduces the impacting area of the front wall on the other hand the outflow of more floodwaters from the building causes the water level behind the back wall to rise generating a large negative longitudinal force on the building as a result the resultant force on the front and back walls significantly reduces with an increasing n at t 5 s there are some previous experimental and or numerical simulation studies to investigate the dependence of the impact force reduction of the building on openings in the context of coastal engineering such as lukkunaprasit et al 2008 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 chinnarasri et al 2013 and wüthrich et al 2018a as well as the asce guideline 2016 however most previous studies often conceptualize the real world building to be a simple cuboid even sometimes neglecting a possible effect due to a real world roof configuration liu et al 2018 wüthrich et al 2018a a recent work by moon et al 2020a 2020b indicated that the existence of the building s roof increases the upstream water level even leading to an enhancement of the impact force on the building by 11 hence it may be necessary to configure the building with a sloping roof that is more consistent with typical houses to investigate the maximum impact force on the building exerted by the dam break induced flood for an engineering maintenance as conducted in this study fig 18 b shows the calculated reduction ratio σ of the peak value of the longitudinal impact force f x for different porosities of the building here in the vertical axis f x 0 is the peak value of the longitudinal impact force for a solid building n 0 at t 4 5 s while f x max is the peak value of the longitudinal impact force for porous buildings n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 at t 4 5 s as shown by the red square symbols with increasing sizes of the front and back doors the maximum impact force significantly decays the reduction ratio σ is 3 2 12 44 24 2 and 55 8 at n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively a quadratic polynomial function σ 0 0083 n 2 0 57 n can fit these data points well with a high correlation coefficient r 2 0 99403 in this figure the experimental data points of lukkunaprasit et al 2009 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 chinnarasri et al 2013 asce guideline 2016 and wuthrich et al 2018a are also plotted the experimental data points in this study also lie within the range of previous studies 5 1 2 impact of the porosity of the back wall fig 19 a shows the calculated longitudinal impact force f x on the building for four porosity cases of the back wall of the building with time n 6 25 11 25 and 15 63 when the porosity of the front wall is fixed n 11 25 as well as n 0 as a reference a solid building i e there are no front and back doors in general the three curves of n 6 25 11 25 and 15 63 are always lower than the curve of n 0 and there is no clear difference between them however in terms of the first peak value f x max 1 at the early period t 2 2 5 s and the second peak f x max 2 at the recession period t 4 5 5 s fig 19 b shows the estimated reduction ratio σ of f x max 1 and f x max 2 for three cases of n 6 25 11 25 and 15 63 relative to the case of a solid building i e n 0 no front and back doors here n 1 and n 2 denote the porosities of the front and back walls respectively it is found that a large back door indeed facilitates the reduction of the peak impact force for either f x max 1 or f x max 2 when keeping a fixed porosity of the front wall the reduction degree for f x max 1 is higher than that for f x max 2 a possible reason is presented as follows f x max 1 in the early period is proportional to the area of the frontal wall impacted by the floodwater in particular when the porosity of the front wall is fixed the impact force f x max 1 is related to the climbing height of the floodwater when hitting the front wall a large back door allows more floodwaters to leave the building which causes the incoming upstream flow to easily enter the interior of the building through the front door this leads to a low climbing height of the rest floodwater and consequently results in a greater reduction of f x max 1 in comparison to a small back door at the recession period t 4 5 s f x max 2 is related to the pressure difference on the front and back walls a large amount of floodwater flows out from the building through a large back door leading to an increasingly negative impact force on the back wall meanwhile a large outflow discharge also contributes to a declined water level upstream of the front wall thereby resulting in a small positive impact force on the front wall these effects comprehensively give rise to a decreased f x max 2 5 1 3 effect of opening of the sidewall additionally fig 20 a shows the calculated lateral impact force f y on the building at three different configurations of the side windows n 0 i e a porous building without any side windows as a reference n 12 5 in the middle of the sidewall n 12 5 in the lower part of the sidewall and n 25 a double sized window in the lower part of the sidewall when porosities of the front and back walls are kept at n 11 25 it is seen that the existence of the side window greatly decreases the lateral impact force in comparison to the case without any side window especially when the side window lies in the lower part of the sidewall in particular fig 20 b estimates the reduction ratio σ of the maximum lateral impact force for three side window configurations relative to the case without the side window within a certain time here f y 0 denotes the maximum lateral impact force in the case without any side window i e n 0 and f y max is the peak value of the lateral impact force for those cases with side windows it is clear that the existence of side windows in the middle of the sidewalls reduces the peak lateral impact force by 45 38 while side windows in the lower parts of the sidewalls and double sized lower side windows weaken the impact force up to 75 06 and 77 07 respectively 5 2 pressure the dam break induced flood moves downstream and hits first the front wall of the building leading to a large impact force on the front wall from the perspective of engineering protection it is necessary to determine the variation characteristics of pressure at different positions on the front wall aureli et al 2015 ghosh et al 2016 jansen et al 2020 lobovský et al 2014 postacchini et al 2019a sha et al 2016 wüthrich et al 2018a for this purpose in this section we set up different measuring points on the frontal wall to investigate spatial and temporal variations in pressure on the front wall these points are labelled in fig 21 a taking an impervious front wall as an example first taking an impervious front wall as a reference fig 21 b shows the temporal variations of pressures at different vertical positions by taking b 0 b 7 in the vertical line as an example the temporal variation in pressure at different points obeys the same trend aureli et al 2015 lobovský et al 2014 peng et al 2021 when the floodwater wave front hits the frontal wall a large impact force peak forms at t 1 5 s due to the hindrance effect of the front wall these peak values are almost 1 5 3 times the pressure at a longer time t 4 s later the pressure on the front wall comprises a dynamic pressure due to the floodwater velocity and a static pressure due to the water depth before the front wall the former slightly varies along the vertical direction on the front wall while the latter is larger at the bottom positions of the front wall postacchini et al 2019 consequently by summing up the abovementioned contributions it is clear that the closer to the bottom is the point the larger is the total pressure i e b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 at t 3 5 s second we choose four typical points b 1 b 3 b 5 and b 7 of the vertical line on the front wall at four porosity cases of the frontal and back walls n 0 11 25 15 63 and 28 13 respectively as labelled in fig 22 a d to discuss the influence of porosity on the spatial and temporal variations in the pressure liu et al 2018 the obtained results are presented in fig 22 e h here four cases of porosity of the front and back walls are analysed and other cases such as different porosities of the back wall and different side window configurations are not mentioned because they yield a minor effect on flow characteristics before the front wall as presented in the abovementioned sections fig 22 e h show that the temporal variation trends of the pressure for different porosity cases are almost the same irrespective of any position especially during the recession period t 5 s however there is a clear discrepancy among n 0 11 25 15 63 and 28 13 when t increases from 1 5 to 4 s for the three cases of n 11 25 15 63 and 28 13 at t 1 5 4 s the larger is n the higher is the pressure this occurs possibly because for a large door on the front wall points b 1 b 3 b 5 and b 7 are nearer to the edge of the door when the floodwater hits the front wall more floodwaters can enter the building through the large front door which leads to a large velocity on the door therefore velocities at b 1 b 3 b 5 and b 7 are larger for a high porosity case than for a low porosity case this yields a large dynamic pressure contributing to a higher total pressure at a large porosity case of the front wall nevertheless after a long period of time t 5 s the floodwater velocity becomes slow before the building in this case the static pressure comprises most of the total pressure therefore the porosity of the front wall plays little role and the pressure at the bottom of the front wall is higher than that at the top i e b 1 b 7 furthermore we also plot the pressure peak values at different vertical positions b 1 b 7 for four different porosity cases in fig 22 i here the upper panel shows the maximum pressure value at an initial impact period i e almost at t 1 5 s whereas the lower panel denotes the maximum pressure value at the recession period almost at t 5 s in general the pressure peak value gradually decreases from the bottom to the top and there is no large discrepancy between different porosity cases for the first pressure peak the maximum peak difference 973 95 pa occurs between n 15 63 and n 0 at b 2 while for the second pressure peak the maximum peak difference occurs between n 11 25 and n 0 at b 6 269 03 pa implying that porosity has a minor effect on the resultant pressure peak value finally in the middle vertical line of the front wall we choose three representative points c 5 c 6 and c 7 as labelled in fig 23 a c at three porosity cases of the frontal and back walls n 0 11 25 and 15 63 to identify a possible effect of porosity on the spatial and temporal variations of pressure above the front door the obtained results are shown in fig 23 d f except for t 1 5 5 s the temporal variation trends of pressure are similar for any porosity at any point c 5 c 6 and c 7 implying little effect of porosity the exception is n 15 63 at c 5 because c 5 lies on the top edge of the large front door see fig 23 c however the pressure is different at t 1 5 5 s for those porosity cases at the initial period of the impact process a part of the floodwater enters the building due to the existence of the front door which creates little impact above the door therefore no large pressure peak occurs at those porosity cases in comparison to the impervious case i e n 0 specifically some floodwaters climb up along two sides of the door on the front wall to reach the eave part of the building when they interact with the eave the floodwaters begin to drop towards two sides and a part of floodwater converges above the door the first point where the converged floodwaters flow above the door is c 7 followed by c 6 and the final point is c 5 as a result the pressure at c 7 is the largest at c 5 is the lowest and at c 6 is between the abovementioned values as shown in fig 23 d f for example at t 2 s p at c 7 p at c 6 p at c 5 furthermore a large front door may lead to convergence of smaller floodwaters above the door as well as a slow convergence velocity which causes the pressure peak to occur later this point is clearly shown in fig 23 e the occurrence times of the pressure peak for the three cases of n 0 11 25 and 15 63 are 1 5 1 8 and 2 s respectively during the recession period of the impact process t 5 s the water level in front of the front wall is slightly higher than the door height and the floodwater velocity is slow in this case the static pressure comprises most of the total pressure due to a low position of c 5 relative to c 7 the total pressure at c 5 is higher than that at c 7 as shown in fig 23 d f for example at t 7 s p at c5 is 2000 pa p at c6 is 1200 pa and p at c7 is 750 pa for this case the porosity no longer has any influence on the pressure variation 6 concluding remarks this study aims to quantify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building using the cfd numerical model based on the rans equations first the model is adopted to simulate the water depth and pressure in an existing dam break flood experiment a comparison of simulation results against experimental datasets shows the robustness and validity of the numerical model in particular a realizable k ε turbulence closure model and an adaptive meshing technique are validated to be a much more efficient method that guarantees both modelling accuracy and computational resource savings and is adopted in subsequent numerical calculations next the numerical model is applied to identify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building in terms of kinematic analysis and dynamics analysis nine scenarios of opening configurations have been implemented including different porosities of the front and back walls various porosities of the back wall while maintaining a fixed porosity of the front wall and various positions and sizes of the side window the following main three findings can be made from this work 1 an increasing size of the front and back doors allows more floodwater to flow through the building which leads to a reduced maximum water level upstream of the building and a reduced area of the wake zone behind the back wall for three cases of porosity of 0 11 25 and 15 63 the resultant longitudinal impact force on the building shows two peak values with time whereas it only has a peak for both large porosity cases of 28 13 and 54 69 furthermore the maximum longitudinal impact force significantly decays with the porosity of the front and back walls in terms of a quadratic function form which indicates that applicably allowing the floodwater to flow through the building can facilitate the mechanical safety of building structures in actual flood disaster prevention and mitigation the porosity of the front wall has an influence on the pressure distribution along either an acentric vertical line or the middle vertical line at a short time since the floodwater hits the building but plays little role after a long period of time 2 a variation in the size of the back door when maintaining a fixed porosity of the front wall plays a role in controlling the outflow discharge of floodwater from the building hence affecting the flow field within the building even that in front of the front wall however it yields no clear difference in the resultant longitudinal impact force nevertheless regarding the first peak and the second peak of impact force a larger back door facilitates a reduction of the peak impact force and the reduction degree for the first peak is higher than that for the second peak 3 at a short period of time after the dam break occurs the presence of the side window in terms of position and size plays no clear role in affecting the flow field around the building however at a moderate period of time there is a clear lateral exchange between floodwaters outside the building and those within the building the larger is the window the greater the lateral exchange discharge becomes finally there is little lateral exchange of floodwater due to water level equality after a long period of time furthermore the discharge of the floodwater that enter the building through the front and back doors are much larger than the lateral exchange discharge through side windows regardless of any configuration of the side window in terms of the lateral exchange discharge the positions of the side windows play a clear role the discharge for the middle side window is much larger than that for the lower side window by one order of magnitude whereas the size of the lower side window seems to play little role additionally the existence of the side window greatly decreases the lateral impact force in comparison to the case without any side window especially when the side window lies in the lower part of the sidewall finally of note an idealized porous building and a dam break induced flood as an incoming flow are adopted in this study however there are complicated opening configurations in some real world buildings furthermore the floodwater pathway is often intricate particularly in an actual urban street canyon these effects are worthy of further investigation in subsequent studies although this study merely focused on the hydrodynamic process modelling of a dam break induced flood on an isolated pervious building it might show a possibility of being further extended to investigate the impact of watershed or urban landscape pattern on the flood severity from the hydrology perspective in future researches for example against the background of global climate change and urbanization the watershed or urban landscape land use land cover

2785,it becomes necessary to identify the role of openings in the impact of floods on porous buildings to better set up effective strategies for people security within buildings and implement engineering measures for building safety in this study a 3d numerical model is applied to identify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building under different opening configurations including different porosities of the front and back walls various porosities of the back wall and various positions and sizes of the side window i an increasing size of the front and back doors leads to a reduced maximum water level upstream of the building and a reduced area of the wake zone behind the back wall the maximum longitudinal impact force significantly decays with the porosity in terms of a quadratic function form ii a variation in the size of the back door plays a role in controlling the outflow discharge of floodwater from the building however it yields no clear difference in the resultant longitudinal impact force iii in the short term the presence of the side window plays no clear role in affecting the flow field around the building however in the moderate timeframe there is a clear lateral exchange the positions of the side windows play a clear role whereas the size of the lower side window seems to be less important the existence of the side window greatly decreases the lateral impact force especially for the lower sidewall these results are of value to better understand the physical mechanism of the impact process on a porous building for implementing tailored measures for people security and structural safety keywords flood building opening impact numerical simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction between 1994 and 2013 floods accounted for 43 of global natural disaster events affecting 2 5 billion people and leading to 0 16 million deaths cred 2015 hu et al 2018b liu et al 2022 based on a careful estimation by tellman et al 2021 using satellite datasets the total number of global inhabitants living in flood prone areas during 2000 2015 has increased by 58 86 million and the flood affected population ratio has risen by 20 24 in particular this trend is increasing by 2030 tellman et al 2021 in addition by 2030 there will be 43 megacities with a population above ten million all over the world most of which will be in developing countries with rapid urbanization the global population within urban areas will reach 2 5 billion and 68 of the people will even reside in urban areas world urbanization prospects 2018 this situation leads to an increasing flood risk especially within highly populated urban areas chen et al 2015 liu et al 2015 mudashiru et al 2021 performing an urban flood risk assessment and implementing effective risk reduction strategies either engineering or non engineering measures is becoming increasingly urgent hartnett and nash 2017 mudashiru et al 2021 paquier et al 2015 ren et al 2022 tong et al 2021 thus it is necessary to understand that the interaction between flooding processes and elements at risk is a prerequisite in a rapidly changing environment milanesi et al 2014 2018 papathoma köhle et al 2022 shah et al 2021 the interaction of flood and disaster bearing bodies comprises complex processes in general hydraulic characteristics of the flood hazard process and physics of elements at risk are two important factors to characterize this interaction effect mignot et al 2019 mudashiru et al 2021 papathoma köhle et al 2022 numerious studies have been conducted to contribute to the stability of pedestrians milanesi et al 2014 xia et al 2014 safety of parked or movable vehicles martínez gomariz et al 2018 shah et al 2021 damage to buildings fuchs et al 2019 mazzorana et al 2014 milanesi et al 2018 operation of subway or metro systems lyu et al 2020 2019 xu and zhou 2022 maintenance of urban lifeline systems dong et al 2020b a and security of other urban furniture in urban flooding farahmand et al 2021 in particular many vulnerability functions for each type of disaster bearing body have been proposed martínez gomariz et al 2018 milanesi et al 2018 papathoma köhle et al 2022 either physics based or indicator based they showed reliability and feasibility to be incorporated into urban flooding models to quantify the spatial and temporal distributions of flood hazards towards various objects liu et al 2015 musolino et al 2020 wang et al 2021 particularly regarding buildings at flooding risks most previous urban flooding studies considered the façade of the building to be impervious i e nonporous building structure either experimentally or numerically mejía morales et al 2021 mignot et al 2020 however real world urban blocks and individual buildings often comprise some openings e g doors windows gates shafts on their surfaces manawasekara et al 2016 mignot et al 2020 wüthrich et al 2018a as mignot et al 2020 stated during strong flood events although some openings are initially closed they are prone to being partially destroyed or even removed which makes these structures to behave like a passage to allow floodwater intrusion into buildings furthermore no evidence has demonstrated that the lateral exchange between the street network and urban blocks can be discarded mignot et al 2020 furthermore there were some reported casualty events due to material or floodwater intrusion into buildings in flooding events for example a torrential flood event occurred on june 12 2020 in bifeng town zhengan county of guizhou province southwest china report on 2020 6 12 flash flood disaster in zhengan county guizhou province of china 2020 precipitation began at 0 39 in bifeng town and intensified from 2 10 reaching a magnitude of torrential rain 52 mm at 2 50 the maximum hourly precipitation was 163 3 mm at 3 00 4 00 the cumulative precipitation approached 200 3 mm by 3 36 234 6 mm by 4 00 and 266 mm by 9 00 the return periods were deduced to be 1000 and 500 years in terms of the maximum hourly precipitation and a precipitation within 24 h report on 2020 6 12 flash flood disaster in zhengan county guizhou province of china 2020 as shown in fig 1 a i floods in the wujia ditch and the caijia ditch converged together to generate a large flood peak in the middle and lower parts of the river causing serious inundation especially along the a b reach lu 2022 this event has led to 21 124 affected people 2 190 destroyed houses 115 damaged vehicles and 6 500 acres of ruined cropland as well as a 93 8 million rmb economic loss zhou et al 2021 report on flash flood disaster on june 12 2020 in zhengan county guizhou province of china 2020 more seriously 13 persons in their own houses along the a b reach including 9 children drowned which was attributed to an abrupt floodwater invasion into the houses through damaged doors or windows while the trapped people had not enough time to take any preventive and self saving measures especially at night according to a post flood event field survey zhou et al 2021 lu 2022 see fig 1 a ii and iii for a clear flood level mark within a damaged house and that outside of a house respectively from lu 2022 fig 1 a iv show flood debris in the lower reach also from lu 2022 another example was a rainstorm event during august 19 20 2021 in lantian county xi an city of shaanxi province northwest china report on 20210 8 19 flash flood disaster in lantian county xi an city of china 2021 the maximum daily cumulative rainfall reached 203 7 mm in jiujianfang town a rapid water level rise in mountainous rivers created a serious threat to the safety of villagers along the river this event has led to 145 ruined bridges 540 damaged houses and 11 000 acres of destroyed croplands report on 20210 8 19 flash flood disaster in lantian county xi an city of china 2021 in particular as shown in fig 1 b some houses along the river bank have been damaged the floodwater carried with mud violently rushed into the interior of the house and broke house furniture such as beds cabinets and wheel chairs luckily the trapped villagers within the house were successfully saved however the consequent economic loss remained high report on lantian torrential disaster in xi an city of china 2021 therefore it is particularly relevant to investigate the material intrusion process towards urban blocks and individual buildings by considering the facades of building arrays and individual houses as permeable in urban flooding studies evaluating the impact of the material invasion process on buildings is receiving increasing attention from some scholars either experimentally or numerically mazzorana et al 2014 proposed a physics based assessment concept for the vulnerability function of a residential building at the alluvial cone of the grossberg torrent in the italian alps mazzorana et al 2014 their study pointed out that the vulnerability of buildings is greatly dependent on the patterns of material invasion towards the building through doors windows and light shafts in a subsequent study gems et al 2016 numerically investigated the flooding process within the interior of a single family house in the lower reach of the rio vallarsa torrent in the village of laives in italy specifically the hydrodynamic forces on the interior and exterior walls were estimated and flow field characteristics around and within the building were also clarified gems et al 2016 the laboratory physical scaled experiment of sturm et al 2018 also highlighted the influence of the flow passing through the openings of the building on the impact forces on buildings exposed to fluvial hazards including clear water hyper concentrated or debris flow sturm et al 2018 furthermore in urban flooding physical modelling zhou et al 2016 experimentally determined the relationship between the blockage ratio corresponding to different arrangements of pervious and impervious building blocks and flow field characteristics in a simplified urban district zhou et al 2016 whereas a dam break experimental study by liu et al 2018 clearly indicated that the locked unlocked condition of the front door of a simplified house led to a clear water depth discrepancy around and within the house and various associated impact forces on the front door liu et al 2018 focusing on the lateral water exchange between a street network and an urban block in a well controlled laboratory experiment mignot et al 2020 identified the impact of obstacles in a flooded street such as trees cars and traffic lights on the hydraulic characteristics of the flow intrusion process mignot et al 2020 and mejía morales et al 2021 quantified the effect of the porosity of a simplified urban block on the depth and velocity and associated risk for pedestrians in a surrounding street network and within the urban block mejía morales et al 2021 despite this progress how the geometrical configurations of the openings of individual buildings play a role in the flooding process around and within buildings in terms of kinematic and dynamic characteristics remains to be elucidated the objective of this study is to identify and quantify the role of openings in the impact of a flood on a porous isolated building structure by taking a typical dam break induced flood as an example a dam break can occur for various reasons including overtopping foundation defect conduit and valve failure pipeline and seepage damage and as a secondary outcome due to other natural disasters such as earthquakes landslides extreme storms and snow melting peng et al 2021 soares frazão and zech 2007 the idealized porous building adopted in this study represents a typical isolated residential building on the floodplain and its size is reduced in a ratio of 1 10 to that of a real world building peng et al 2021 the structure of this study is arranged as follows section 2 outlines the methodology adopted in this study including the mathematical model the turbulence closure models and the meshing technique by validating the model with an existing dam break flood experimental dataset physical scenario setups for the numerical study are elaborated in section 3 section 4 discusses the simulation results pertaining to the impact of floods on a porous building from the perspective of a kinematic analysis including the flow field around a porous building the impact of porosities of the front and back walls the effect of the porosity of the back wall and the effect of the side window furthermore section 5 interprets the role of openings in the impact of a dam break flood on a porous building in terms of a dynamic analysis i e resultant force and pressure at various configurations of the front and back doors and the side windows the main conclusions are finally drawn in section 6 2 methodology the general computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys fluent is adopted in this study to quantify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building fig 2 illustrates the flow chart of this study including i validating the cfd simulation results with experimental datasets ii different scenario setups of a porous building and a dam break induced flood and iii implementing simulations for each scenario under various configurations and analysing the kinematics and dynamics for different case studies each step will be interpreted in what follows 2 1 mathematical model three governing equations i e continuity equation momentum equation and energy equation are pillars for any cfd modelling study biscarini et al 2010 kang et al 2020 toparlar et al 2017 in this study only mass conservation and momentum conservation equations are adopted because heat transfer is not mentioned in the interaction between dam break floods and buildings biscarini et al 2010 haider et al 2020 considering that the dam break flood propagates rapidly and the flow is strongly turbulent especially when the flood hits the building lobovský et al 2014 soares frazão and zech 2007 tassin et al 2012 the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are used to characterize the impact characteristics of the flood on the building in this study in the cartesian coordinate system the continuity and rans equations for an incompressible homogeneous and viscous fluid can be expressed as hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 kleefsman et al 2005 peng et al 2021 1 v i s i 0 2 v i t v j v i s j 1 ρ p s i s j ν ν t v i s j v j s i g i where s i denotes the coordinates here x y and z denote the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions in the cartesian coordinate system v i is the time averaged velocity here v x v y and v z denotes the longitudinal lateral and vertical components of the velocity t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density g i is the gravitational acceleration ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and ν t is the eddy kinematic viscosity due to the boussinesq assumptions some two equation turbulence closure models pertaining to the turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ε have been proposed to calculate the eddy viscosity ν t for various engineering cases over several decades using the following formula ν t c μ k 2 ε where c μ is a constant having different values depending on various models biscarini et al 2010 hien and chien 2021 three typical models that are commonly adopted in previous modelling studies are the standard k ε model rng k ε model which is derived from navier stokes equations using the statistical technique called the renormalization group rng theory and realizable k ε model biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 koutsourakis et al 2012 peng et al 2021 the standard k ε model was proposed by launder and spalding 1972 and has shown its wide applicability for some complex turbulent flows in practical engineering cases cai et al 2020 hien and chien 2021 in this model the turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ε can be calculated by the following equations 3 k t k v i s i s j ν ν t σ k k s j g k ε 4 ε t s i ε v i s j ν ν t σ ε ε s j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ε 2 k where σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ε respectively σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 3 c 1 ε and c 2 ε are two constants c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 and g k denotes the generated turbulence kinetic energy due to the mean velocity and can be estimated by g k ν t v j s i v i s j v j s i compared with the standard k ε model the rng k ε model benefits from the use of an additional term in the ε equation and a presentation of an analytical formula for turbulent prandtl numbers and effective viscosity for both low and high reynolds flows which renders it more accurate and reliable especially for some complicated flows with a high strain rate and a large curvature koutsourakis et al 2012 papageorgakis and assanis 1999 peng et al 2021 in this model the k equation is the same as that in the standard k ε model that is eq 3 except for some different constants however the ε equation turns out to be 5 ε t s i ε v i s j ν ν t σ ε ε s j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ε 2 k r e r e c μ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k η k ε g k ν t where an addition term that can characterize the sheared turbulence r e has been added the constants are taken as the following values in this model c μ 0 0845 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 68 σ k σ ε 0 7179 β 0 012 and η 0 4 38 compared with the standard k ε model the realizable k ε model on the one hand comprises a new formulation for the eddy viscosity and on the other hand the ε equation has been generated from the mean square vorticity fluctuation equation biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 particularly the k equation is again the same as that in the standard k ε model except for different constants nevertheless the ε equation has the following form 6 ε t s i ε v i s j ν ν t σ ε ε s j c 1 s ε c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 η s k η s v j s i v i s j in this model the constants are c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 in this study the dam break induced flood propagates rapidly downstream and there exists a clear interface between the air phase and water phase the flow is strongly turbulent especially when interacting with the building consequently the free surface varies significantly and a large amount of air has been entrained into the flow lobovský et al 2014 soares frazão and zech 2007 for this characteristic the volume of fluid vof method embedded into the software shows its capability to capture the free surface during simulation processes hirt and nichols 1981 kleefsman et al 2005 vignesh and bakshi 2013 the vof model can model both air and water by solving a single set of momentum equations and tracking the volume fraction of each of the fluids throughout the computational domain kleefsman et al 2005 vignesh and bakshi 2013 the transient tracking of the air water interface is performed by solving a continuity equation for the volume fraction of each fluid phase furthermore for each computational cell a function f is defined to be the ratio of the volume occupied by water to that of the whole cell and the following characteristic can be identified the cell is full of water for f 1 otherwise the cell is occupied by air at f 0 and the cell contains the air water interface i e free surface for 0 f 1 hirt and nichols 1981 hu et al 2018a peng et al 2021 the abovementioned governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method for the spatial scale and the forward euler method for the temporal scale the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm is employed to solve the coupling between velocity and pressure in the governing equations hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 peng et al 2021 the second order upwind scheme is used for the discretization of convective and diffusion terms the calculation iterations are continued until the relative error is below a given small value of 10 5 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 more introduction regarding the model formulation model convergence and model efficiency can be found in some studies biscarini et al 2010 ansys fluent theory guide 2018 2 2 validation of the model by experimental datasets computational accuracy and efficiency are two important aspects in numerical modelling studies koutsourakis et al 2012 toparlar et al 2017 the former relies on many factors such as mesh quality turbulence closure model and wall function formulation while the latter is often dependent on the grid size adopted in the study a fine grid size leads to simulation results that can reproduce observational datasets well but at a cost of increasing computational time and data storage requirements haider et al 2020 hu et al 2018a kang et al 2020 papageorgakis and assanis 1999 therefore it is necessary to identify an efficient numerical simulation method while maintaining a high computational accuracy depending on different engineering cases in this study we adopt the dam break flow experimental datasets of kleefsman et al 2005 to validate the numerical model in terms of the turbulence model chosen mesh classification and mesh size a simple dam break flow experiment was performed at the maritime research institute netherlands marin by kleefsman et al 2005 which has been frequently adopted to validate some numerical models by previous researchers issakhov et al 2018 methods et al 2011 tassin et al 2012 xin et al 2022 as shown in the left panel in fig 3 a water tank its dimensions are 3 22 m in length 1 m in width and 1 m in depth with an open roof and a horizontal bottom was adopted in their experiment the tank is divided into two parts by a moveable vertical door on the right side there exists a water body column with a depth of 0 55 m while on the left side a solid box with dimensions of 0 403 m length 0 161 m width 0 161 m depth has been placed to represent an isolated solid building the instantaneous release of the left water column can be realized by rapidly pulling the door up to impact the solid building downstream during the experiment kleefsman et al 2005 used four vertical height probes to measure instantaneous water depths at different cross sections one is in the reservoir h4 and the other three are in the left tank h1 h2 and h3 eight pressure sensors four on the front of the building s1 s4 and four on the top s5 s8 were used to measure the pressures at different points of the building when the flood interacts with it see the right panel in fig 3 2 2 1 turbulence model for validation study this study adopts rans equations to model the dam break flows around a building considering a trade off between computational efficiency and operational accuracy this is one of the most commonly used methods for turbulent flow modelling as shown by previous numerical studies biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 peng et al 2021 toparlar et al 2017 as already mentioned in the last section for rans equations there are two equation turbulence models to calculate the eddy viscosity coefficient including standard k ε rng k ε and realizable k ε in this study these three turbulence models are compared in terms of simulation accuracy against experimental datasets in the numerical setups the geometry of the computational domain remains the same as in the experimental case see the left panel in fig 3 the chosen grid size is 10 80 mm the wall function is set to be an enhanced wall treatment and the surface tension is 0 073 n m the two phase fluid module using vof is activated the nonslip condition is applied to the bottom and the sidewalls of the domain without water inflow outflow while the pressure outlet is set to be the top of the domain i e air can enter freely a fixed 0 001 s time step is implemented in the entire modelling fig 4 compares the water depth h using three turbulence models and measured values at four cross sections it is clear that either of the turbulence models can capture the variation trend of water depth with time well and they are almost coincident with each other however there is also a clear deviation at h1 especially when t 1 2 5 s where the rng k ε model leads to a water depth fluctuation and cannot reproduce the first peak value on the other hand fig 5 compares the predicted pressures p against the experimental datasets at s1 s3 s5 and s7 three turbulence models predict a similar result showing good agreement with experimental data points especially for s1 and s3 nevertheless for s5 and s7 both the standard k ε and realizable k ε models overpredict the pressure peak value at t 1 5 2 5 s whereas the rng k ε model clearly underestimates it therefore by comprehensively considering the simulation effect of these models computational costs and practical guidelines from previous studies biscarini et al 2010 hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 papageorgakis and assanis 1999 peng et al 2021 this study applies the realizable k ε turbulence model to simulate the dam break flow around a porous structure later 2 2 2 mesh size for validation study mesh size is one of the most considerable aspects in numerical modelling studies fondelli et al 2015 liu and niu 2019 2016 toparlar et al 2017 this study chooses five types of mesh classification techniques to investigate the sensitivity of simulation results to mesh configurations as listed in table 1 scenarios 1 2 and 3 correspond to a coarse mesh size of 80 mm for the entire computational domain however they differ in depicting the surface of the building the local refined mesh sizes are 10 20 and 30 mm respectively they are set up here to validate the effect of a local mesh refinement hadavi and pasdarshahri 2020 peng et al 2021 scenario 4 is set to be further double refined based on scenario 1 that is the mesh size reduces to 40 mm for the total domain while the mesh size for the surface of the building turns out to be 5 mm additionally in scenario 5 an adaptation function based on the gradient of the volume fraction was defined for the grid configuration at the water air interface fondelli et al 2015 because the refinement level is 2 scenario 5 has the same mesh configuration as that for scenario 4 the maximum mesh size is 40 mm whereas the minimum mesh size is reduced to 5 mm fig 6 shows the comparison of modelled water depths using scenarios 1 2 and 3 and experimental datasets at h1 h2 h3 and h4 respectively in general these scenarios can capture the temporal variation in water depth within the water tank despite some small lags and discrepancies when the movable door is pulled up the floodwater wave propagates downstream which leads to a rapid decrease in the water level at h4 and a gradual increase in the water level at h3 h2 and h1 after the wave interacts with the left wall of the tank the floodwater begins to climb upwards along the wall surface later after a jet like flow drops under gravity on the underlying flow the reflected wave propagates upstream which induces water levels at h1 and h2 to reach the peak at almost t 1 5 s and t 2 s respectively finally after some time the free surface varies violently and the floodwater flows back and forth within the tank kleefsman et al 2005 lobovský et al 2014 it is noted that scenario 1 can predict the peak value of the water level of h1 at t 1 2 2 s better than scenarios 2 and 3 for h3 scenario 3 overestimates the depth much more than the other scenarios especially for the peak modelled positions of the peak water depth using scenarios 1 2 and 3 also have a lag in relation to experimental points especially for the second crests of h1 h2 and h4 and the third crest of h3 which occurs possibly because the effect of the instantaneous opening of the door is difficult to identify in the numerical modelling kees et al 2011 kleefsman et al 2005 lobovský et al 2014 the predicted pressures and experimental datasets at s1 s3 s5 and s7 are compared in fig 7 by and large either scenario 1 2 or 3 can mimic the pressure variation pattern at different points on the building surface in particular the modelled results show a higher peak value than the experimental data at s1 and s3 which shows the sensitivity of the modelled results to grid size furthermore the modelled result slightly lags behind the experimental data in terms of the occurrence time of the pressure peak and this phenomenon has also been revealed by kankanamge et al 2020 for s5 and s7 the model yields an additional pressure peak at almost t 1 2 s that does not yet appear in the experimental data this occurs possibly because there is a pocket of air between the top of the building and splashing water which causes the pressures at s5 and s7 to gradually increase until the flow hits the surface of the building as mentioned by colomés et al 2021 however the numerical model in this study does not consider this effect the water depths and pressures predicted using scenarios 1 4 and 5 against the experimental datasets are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively from fig 8 all three mesh configurations generally lead to good prediction accuracy against the experimental datasets in fig 9 either of three mesh configurations can capture the pressure well for s1 and s3 however for s5 and s7 a coarse grid configuration scenario 1 overestimates the pressure peak value in contrast those refined mesh structures scenarios 4 and 5 show a better prediction accuracy in summary those chosen mesh configurations can depict well the kinematics and impact dynamics regarding the effect of a dam break flood on a solid building however of note a refined grid also leads to an increasing computational cost while improving the modelling accuracy as listed by the fourth column in table 1 the total consumption times by scenarios 1 2 and 3 when modelling the flood routing around the building for 6 s are 43 544 s 38 504 s and 31 477 s respectively whereas for a refined mesh case scenario 4 it increases to 82 271 s in contrast the adaptive meshing technique scenario 5 only consumes 35 393 s while maintaining a high modelling accuracy which is even shorter than a coarse mesh configuration case i e scenario 2 therefore the adaptive meshing technique is validated to be an efficient method that guarantees both modelling accuracy and computational resource savings and will be adopted in subsequent numerical calculations 3 application of the numerical model according to a survey of single story building structures in china liu et al 2018 manawasekara et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 design code for residential buildings 2020 a typical building with a length of 8 m a width of 6 m a height of 5 m a wall thickness of 240 mm and a roof thickness of 120 mm is adopted in this study in numerical setups the building is configured with a reduced dimension of 1 10 fig 10 a and b show the top view and side view of the building respectively nine scenarios for different opening configurations are implemented in this study fig 10 c and d illustrate the geometrical

study the impact of the porosities of the sidewalls mejía morales et al 2021 following some previous suggestions in urban flooding studies and guidelines biscarini et al 2010 liu et al 2018 soares frazão and zech 2007 the computational domain is set as follows as illustrated in fig 11 the x y and z axes denote the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively let h be the characteristic length which is equal to the height of the building the distance between the building and the breach is set to 12 h liu et al 2018 soares frazão and zech 2007 and the length from the building to the outlet boundary is 8 h aureli et al 2015 soares frazão and zech 2007 the distance between the building and each side boundary is 5 h wüthrich et al 2018a b zhou et al 2016 whereasthe vertical distance between the roof and the upper boundary is limited to 2 h as shown by the blue colour in fig 11 the length and width of the reservoir on the left side of the domain are 14 h and 10 h respectively biscarini et al 2010 lobovský et al 2014 peng et al 2021 soares frazão and zech 2007 toparlar et al 2017 in total the computational domain has dimensions of 17 m in length 5 m in width and 1 5 m in height the initial water depth in the reservoir is simply adopted to be 0 8 m as in wen 2015 regarding the boundary conditions a free outflow boundary is applied to the lower boundary while on the bottom and two sides of the domain a nonslip condition is employed as well as a pressure outlet for the top boundary the realizable k ε turbulence model is adopted to simulate the flooding impact and an adaptive meshing technique is used for the subdivision of the computation domain biscarini et al 2010 fondelli et al 2015 the simulation time in this study is adapted to be 9 s comprising a complete process of the impact an initial impact phase a rising phase and a final receding phase which is applicable for characterizing the impact of a dam break flood on a porous building flow field the maximum resultant horizontal impact force the pressure distribution on the façade of the building etc as will be presented in all details in the following sections section 4 and section 5 this simulation time is also analogous to the numerical work of peng et al 2021 and the flood impact experimental works of wüthrich et al 2018a 2018b 2020 which could be valid for the real world cases 4 results and discussion kinematic analysis 4 1 effect of openings on the flow field around a porous building first to investigate the effect of openings on the flow field around a building the flow field around a solid building i e without any door and window on its facade is also modelled in this study all numerical configurations for the solid building are the same as those of the porous building mentioned above except for the porosity of the building fig 12 shows the contours of the longitudinal velocity component v x near the solid building at three different times t in general the variation in the flow field can be classified into three phases i impact phase t 0 3 s when a dam break occurs the floodwater wave rapidly propagates downstream and it almost hits the front end of the building at t 1 45 s as shown in fig 12 a at t 2 4 s due to the hindrance of the building the floodwater is separated into two parts one part continually rises on the front wall of the building and after climbing up to the eave it splashes upwards and subsequently drops onto the underlying fluid due to gravity which leads to a reflected wave that propagates upstream it interacts with an upstream incoming flow which causes the free water surface with entrainment of air to vary violently upstream of the building another part of floodwater flows around the building downstream forming two symmetrical flows relative to the longitudinal centerline of the domain these two flows intersect at an approximate distance of 0 6 m at t 2 4 s behind the building to group again to form a stream of floodwater as illustrated in fig 12 b there is a triangular vacant region between the back wall of the building and the intersection point ii rising phase t 3 6 s as shown in fig 12 c and d at t 5 s floodwater accumulates in front of the frontal wall due to the hindrance effect of the building and an upstream incoming flow leading to a rapidly rising water level in particular a bow wave forms at t 3 s as also revealed by goseberg and schlurmann 2014 see fig 12 d and when the water level reaches the highest value at t 5 s there is still a small part of floodwater that flows through the eave towards the back of the building see fig 12 d furthermore with an increasing amount of floodwater around the building converging at a longitudinal distance from the back wall the triangular wake zone is gradually occupied by floodwater iii receding state t 6 9 s more upstream regions are affected by the bow wave that propagates upstream leading to a reduced water level in front of the building as shown in fig 12 e and f at t 8 s the longitudinal velocity especially downstream of the domain begins to attenuate until the floodwater flows completely out from the domain see fig 12 f some of these characteristics have also been revealed by previous studies for example soares frazão and zech 2007 aureli et al 2015 lobovský et al 2014 and peng et al 2021 in contrast taking the case of a porous building with porosities of both the front and back walls of 11 25 as an example fig 13 shows the contours of the longitudinal velocity component v x near the porous building at three different times t 2 5 and 8 s the flow field around a porous building can also be characterized by three phases i impact phase t 0 3 s for the case of a porous building as shown in fig 13 a floodwater that impacts the building is divided into three parts due to the blocking effect one part of the floodwater stops moving downstream and climbs upwards on the façade of the front wall subsequently experiencing a reflection and dropping onto the underlying fluid compared to the case of a solid building wüthrich et al 2018b the reflected flow is weak so that the water level upstream of the building varies gently wüthrich et al 2018a the second part of floodwater can enter and leave the interior of the building through the front and back doors in terms of a jet like flow respectively chek et al 2020 chinnarasri et al 2013 wüthrich et al 2018a as a large quantity of floodwaters rapidly enters the building while there is not enough time for those floodwaters already existing within the building to flow out through the back door floodwater accumulates in the interior of the building leading to an increasing water level within the building the last part of floodwater flows around the building and two pieces of flows finally converge at a position behind the back wall to form a piece of floodwater which is analogous to the case of a solid building it is clear that because a jet like flow passes through the front and back doors the convergence time progresses earlier t 2 s and the triangular wake zone is greatly reduced in terms of area fig 13b ii rising phase t 3 6 s as shown in fig 13 c and d at t 5 s a large amount of floodwater accumulates in front of the front wall because the door is so small that not all floodwater can enter the building which leads to an uplifted water level upstream of the building especially at t 3 s a bow wave forms and the water level reaches the roof at t 5 s however by comparing fig 13 d and fig 12 d it is clear that the area affected by the bow wave is reduced as the jet like flow passes through the front and back walls and part of the floodwater around the building converges the triangular wake zone almost vanishes fig 13 d iii receding state t 6 9 s as described by fig 13 e and f at t 8 s the longitudinal velocity slows and the water level begins to decrease upstream of the building as time progresses in particular the velocity in the centre part of the interior of the building is higher than that in other regions within the building this implies that the floodwater can steadily flow through the back door and the velocity begins to attenuate until the floodwater flows out completely from the domain 4 2 impact of porosities of the front and back walls on flow field to investigate the impact of porosities of the front and back walls on the flow field around a porous building fig 14 a1 f3 show the cfd simulated contours of the longitudinal velocity component v x near the porous building at three times t 2 5 and 8 s for three porosity cases n 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively by comparing them as well as fig 13 for n 11 25 the following conclusion can be made an increasing size of the front door leads to a reduced area of the impervious part of the wall generating a weak reflected wave when the floodwater impacts the frontal wall it has a weak effect on the water level upstream of the building in particular a large size of the front door allows more floodwater to flow through it and consequently there is a small amount of floodwater that accumulates in front of the frontal wall therefore the formed bow wave has a small influence on the upstream flow for example the formed maximum water levels decrease to be approximately 0 52 0 50 0 48 and 0 45 m at n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively see fig 13 c fig 14 c1 c2 and c3 while the affected range by the bow wave towards the upstream flow decreases to be almost 0 72 0 7 0 65 and 0 30 m at n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively see fig 13 d 14 d1 14 d2 and 14 d3 it is also evident by comparing fig 13 b d and f fig 14 b1 d1 and f1 fig 14 b2 d2 and f2 and fig 14 b3 d3 and f3 that the volume of the floodwater that enters the interior of the building is almost proportional to the size of the front door for those cases of large front and back doors more parts of floodwater can easily pass through the building through them in terms of a jet like flow lukkunaprasit et al 2008 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 wüthrich et al 2018a this finally leads to a reduced area of the wake zone behind the back wall of the building 4 3 effect of the porosity of the back wall the size of the back door plays a role in controlling the outflow discharge hence affecting the flow field within the building even that in front of the front wall lukkunaprasit et al 2008 manawasekara et al 2016 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 wüthrich et al 2018a keeping a fixed porosity of the front wall n 11 25 fig 15 shows the simulated flow field around the building when the porosity of the back wall is n 6 25 and 15 63 at three times t 2 5 and 8 s respectively the modelled flow field for n 11 25 is shown in fig 13 by pairwise comparing fig 15 a1 f1 and fig 13 a f it is observed that in the short term for the case of n 6 25 the floodwaters that enter the interior of the building through the front door do not completely flow out from the building through the black door this leads to an accumulation of floodwater within the building there is also strong turbulence within the building because the floodwater velocity is high and varies rapidly in contrast fig 15 a2 f2 and fig 13 a f show that a large back door allows more floodwaters to discharge from the building which generates a lower water level within the building and a higher water level behind the back wall as time progresses the flow entering the building and leaving the building become relatively quasi stable for the case of a small back door the water level is higher in front of the building and the area affected by the bow wave is slightly larger because there is a limited size for the floodwater to discharge from the building in comparison to the case of a larger back door fig 15 d1 and f1 and fig 15 d2 and f2 4 4 impact of opening of the sidewall this section explores the possible effect of the sidewall opening on the flow field around a porous building lukkunaprasit et al 2008 wüthrich et al 2018a using the case of both porosities of the front and back walls being 11 25 but without any windows on the sidewalls of the building as shown in fig 13 as a reference fig 16 a1 e3 show the cfd simulated contours of the lateral velocity v y in y z section of the building along the lateral centerline at five times t 2 3 4 5 and 8 s for three porosity cases of sidewalls n 12 5 the window is in the middle of either of the sidewalls 12 5 the window lies in the lower part of either of the sidewalls and extends to the building s bottom and 25 the doubled window still lies in the lower part of either of the sidewalls and extends to the building s bottom respectively the floodwater velocity is high in the short term for example t 2 s after the dam break occurs a part of the floodwater enters the interior of the building through the front door and finally leaves the building through the back door except for the middle passage where floodwater rapidly moves there is little floodwater within the building see fig 16 a1 a2 and a3 specifically because another part of floodwater flows rapidly around the building downstream there is no large amount of floodwater near the two sidewalls of the building because the water level does not reach the lower bound of the side window fig 16 a1 outer floodwater does not flow into the interior of the building even for the case of the side window that lies in the lower part of the sidewall there is little floodwater that can enter the building fig 16 a2 and a3 this occurs because when a dam break occurs floodwater waves rapidly propagate downstream and there is a small lateral velocity which leads to a weak lateral exchange of floodwater between outside and inside the building wüthrich et al 2018a for this case opening of the sidewall in terms of position and size plays no clear role in reshaping the flow field around the porous building with an increasing upstream flow floodwater accumulates and spreads out in the interior of the building fig 16 b1 b2 and b3 for the case of the middle side window fig 16 d1 the water level in the building rises to 0 125 m at t 4 s which is near the upper bound of the side window however the outer water level around the side window is low therefore floodwater inside the building flows towards outside the building in contrast for both cases of the side window that lies in the lower part of the sidewall the water level outside the side window surpasses that inside the window earlier at t 3 s see fig 16 c2 and d2 and fig 16 c3 and d3 consequently floodwater outside the building can flow into the interior of the building by comparing fig 16 d2 and d3 there exists a clear trend the larger is the size of the side window the larger the lateral water exchange discharge becomes finally after a longer period of time for example t 8 s there may be an approximate equilibrium between the water level outside the window and that inside the window implying that there is little lateral exchange of floodwater within the domain as shown in fig 16 e1 e2 and e3 respectively particularly fig 17 a d present the temporal variations in estimated discharges q of the floodwater that enters or leaves the building through the front and back doors respectively and a lateral exchange discharge through two side windows for a porous building with porosities of the front and back walls of 11 25 but without a side window a porous building with two side windows in the middle of the sidewalls a porous building with two side windows in the lower part of the sidewalls and a porous building with two double sized side windows in the lower part of the sidewalls here the discharge q is calculated by integrating the normal velocity over corresponding areas of the door or the window it is noticeable that the flow discharges through the front and back doors are much larger than the lateral exchange discharge through side windows regardless of any configuration of the side window mejía morales et al 2021 mignot et al 2020 regarding the lateral exchange discharge fig 17 e shows all data for three configurations of the side window it is observed that the positions of the side windows play a clear role in affecting the lateral exchange discharge for the case of the side window that lies in the middle of the sidewall the floodwater outside the building begins to flow towards the building at approximately t 2 s through the side window and the maximum discharge reaches almost 0 0039 m3 s in contrast for both cases of the side windows in the lower part of the sidewall a lateral exchange occurs earlier at approximately t 1 6 s and the maximum discharge can increase to 0 0107 m3 s additionally by comparing both cases of side windows in the lower part of the sidewall it is found that the size of the side window seems to play no role in affecting the lateral exchange discharge 5 results and discussion dynamics analysis 5 1 impact force the impact force of a dam break induced flood on a building is an important parameter for formulating the safety criterion of the building in actual engineering applications linton et al 2013 manawasekara et al 2016 sha et al 2016 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 wüthrich et al 2020 2018a this study calculates the impact force on a porous building exerted by floodwater by integrating the simulated pressures over different areas of the facades of the building for example the resultant longitudinal impact force f x on the building is calculated using the following formula 7 f x p d s where p is the pressure in the longitudinal direction s is the area and the integral is taken over the front and back walls of the building the following results show the effects of porosities of the front and back walls porosity of the back wall and opening of the wide wall on a resultant impact force of the building exerted by the floodwater 5 1 1 effect of the porosity of the front and back walls fig 18 a shows the calculated longitudinal impact force f x on the building for five porosity cases of the front and back walls of the building with time n 0 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 for three cases of n 0 11 25 and 15 63 after the floodwater hits the building s front wall t 1 5 s f x first increases to a peak value almost at t 2 2 5 s and then decreases to a trough before rising again to the second peak value almost at t 4 5 5 s followed by a rapid attenuation after t 5 s however for both cases of n 28 13 and 54 69 f x exhibits a steadily rising trend until reaching a peak value one peak merely occurs and significantly decays with time a possible interpretation is presented as follows for an impervious or less porous building n 0 11 25 15 63 the area of the front wall impacted by the incoming floodwater is large when the floodwater hits the frontal wall at t 1 5 s it yields a large impact force on the wall meanwhile a part of floodwater climbs up on the façade of the front wall and there is a reflected flow due to the hindrance of the eave of the building lukkunaprasit et al 2008 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 in this case the longitudinal force f x on the building exerted by the floodwater reaches a peak value later the reflected flow drops onto the underlying fluid due to gravity which affects the upstream flow to decrease its velocity consequently f x begins to decline a continually incoming upstream flow leads to an accumulation of more floodwaters in the front of the front wall and a bow wave occurs it raises the water level to surpass the eave and even rises to the roof which again increases the impacted area of the front wall by the floodwater and thereby leads to an occurrence of the second peak of f x furthermore the water level behind the back wall gradually rises as more floodwaters around the building begin to converge along with a jet like flow through the small front and back doors these comprehensively contribute to a negative impact force on the back wall i e the impact force points upstream meanwhile with a decreasing water level and a slower velocity upstream of the building due to attenuation of a bow wave the impact force on the frontal wall by the floodwater also declines as a result the resultant longitudinal impact force f x on the building rapidly decays with time however for those larger porous buildings n 28 13 and 54 69 the impacted area of the front wall by the floodwater becomes much smaller which yields a comparatively small impact force on the other hand a large part of floodwater can enter and leave the building through large doors more floodwater accumulates behind the back wall leading to a large negative impact force on the building as a result only a peak value of f x may occur and it occurs when a large amount of backwater is present in front of the front wall furthermore it is clear from fig 18 a that in the initial period t 1 5 2 5 s of the impact process f x decreases with increasing n this occurs because in the early period of the impact process a part of the floodwater can flow through the front door to the inner building which decreases the climbing velocity and height of the rest of the floodwater on the front wall in addition a large n also results in a reduced area of the front wall impacted by the floodwater consequently leading to a decreased f x on the building at the recession period of f x when t 5 s it is also clear that f x is lower at a large n this occurs because a large front and back door allows a large amount of floodwater to enter and leave the building on the one hand this implies a small hindrance effect of the front wall on the floodwater which causes the water level before the front wall due to the formed bow wave to decrease and reduces the impacting area of the front wall on the other hand the outflow of more floodwaters from the building causes the water level behind the back wall to rise generating a large negative longitudinal force on the building as a result the resultant force on the front and back walls significantly reduces with an increasing n at t 5 s there are some previous experimental and or numerical simulation studies to investigate the dependence of the impact force reduction of the building on openings in the context of coastal engineering such as lukkunaprasit et al 2008 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 chinnarasri et al 2013 and wüthrich et al 2018a as well as the asce guideline 2016 however most previous studies often conceptualize the real world building to be a simple cuboid even sometimes neglecting a possible effect due to a real world roof configuration liu et al 2018 wüthrich et al 2018a a recent work by moon et al 2020a 2020b indicated that the existence of the building s roof increases the upstream water level even leading to an enhancement of the impact force on the building by 11 hence it may be necessary to configure the building with a sloping roof that is more consistent with typical houses to investigate the maximum impact force on the building exerted by the dam break induced flood for an engineering maintenance as conducted in this study fig 18 b shows the calculated reduction ratio σ of the peak value of the longitudinal impact force f x for different porosities of the building here in the vertical axis f x 0 is the peak value of the longitudinal impact force for a solid building n 0 at t 4 5 s while f x max is the peak value of the longitudinal impact force for porous buildings n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 at t 4 5 s as shown by the red square symbols with increasing sizes of the front and back doors the maximum impact force significantly decays the reduction ratio σ is 3 2 12 44 24 2 and 55 8 at n 11 25 15 63 28 13 and 54 69 respectively a quadratic polynomial function σ 0 0083 n 2 0 57 n can fit these data points well with a high correlation coefficient r 2 0 99403 in this figure the experimental data points of lukkunaprasit et al 2009 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 chinnarasri et al 2013 asce guideline 2016 and wuthrich et al 2018a are also plotted the experimental data points in this study also lie within the range of previous studies 5 1 2 impact of the porosity of the back wall fig 19 a shows the calculated longitudinal impact force f x on the building for four porosity cases of the back wall of the building with time n 6 25 11 25 and 15 63 when the porosity of the front wall is fixed n 11 25 as well as n 0 as a reference a solid building i e there are no front and back doors in general the three curves of n 6 25 11 25 and 15 63 are always lower than the curve of n 0 and there is no clear difference between them however in terms of the first peak value f x max 1 at the early period t 2 2 5 s and the second peak f x max 2 at the recession period t 4 5 5 s fig 19 b shows the estimated reduction ratio σ of f x max 1 and f x max 2 for three cases of n 6 25 11 25 and 15 63 relative to the case of a solid building i e n 0 no front and back doors here n 1 and n 2 denote the porosities of the front and back walls respectively it is found that a large back door indeed facilitates the reduction of the peak impact force for either f x max 1 or f x max 2 when keeping a fixed porosity of the front wall the reduction degree for f x max 1 is higher than that for f x max 2 a possible reason is presented as follows f x max 1 in the early period is proportional to the area of the frontal wall impacted by the floodwater in particular when the porosity of the front wall is fixed the impact force f x max 1 is related to the climbing height of the floodwater when hitting the front wall a large back door allows more floodwaters to leave the building which causes the incoming upstream flow to easily enter the interior of the building through the front door this leads to a low climbing height of the rest floodwater and consequently results in a greater reduction of f x max 1 in comparison to a small back door at the recession period t 4 5 s f x max 2 is related to the pressure difference on the front and back walls a large amount of floodwater flows out from the building through a large back door leading to an increasingly negative impact force on the back wall meanwhile a large outflow discharge also contributes to a declined water level upstream of the front wall thereby resulting in a small positive impact force on the front wall these effects comprehensively give rise to a decreased f x max 2 5 1 3 effect of opening of the sidewall additionally fig 20 a shows the calculated lateral impact force f y on the building at three different configurations of the side windows n 0 i e a porous building without any side windows as a reference n 12 5 in the middle of the sidewall n 12 5 in the lower part of the sidewall and n 25 a double sized window in the lower part of the sidewall when porosities of the front and back walls are kept at n 11 25 it is seen that the existence of the side window greatly decreases the lateral impact force in comparison to the case without any side window especially when the side window lies in the lower part of the sidewall in particular fig 20 b estimates the reduction ratio σ of the maximum lateral impact force for three side window configurations relative to the case without the side window within a certain time here f y 0 denotes the maximum lateral impact force in the case without any side window i e n 0 and f y max is the peak value of the lateral impact force for those cases with side windows it is clear that the existence of side windows in the middle of the sidewalls reduces the peak lateral impact force by 45 38 while side windows in the lower parts of the sidewalls and double sized lower side windows weaken the impact force up to 75 06 and 77 07 respectively 5 2 pressure the dam break induced flood moves downstream and hits first the front wall of the building leading to a large impact force on the front wall from the perspective of engineering protection it is necessary to determine the variation characteristics of pressure at different positions on the front wall aureli et al 2015 ghosh et al 2016 jansen et al 2020 lobovský et al 2014 postacchini et al 2019a sha et al 2016 wüthrich et al 2018a for this purpose in this section we set up different measuring points on the frontal wall to investigate spatial and temporal variations in pressure on the front wall these points are labelled in fig 21 a taking an impervious front wall as an example first taking an impervious front wall as a reference fig 21 b shows the temporal variations of pressures at different vertical positions by taking b 0 b 7 in the vertical line as an example the temporal variation in pressure at different points obeys the same trend aureli et al 2015 lobovský et al 2014 peng et al 2021 when the floodwater wave front hits the frontal wall a large impact force peak forms at t 1 5 s due to the hindrance effect of the front wall these peak values are almost 1 5 3 times the pressure at a longer time t 4 s later the pressure on the front wall comprises a dynamic pressure due to the floodwater velocity and a static pressure due to the water depth before the front wall the former slightly varies along the vertical direction on the front wall while the latter is larger at the bottom positions of the front wall postacchini et al 2019 consequently by summing up the abovementioned contributions it is clear that the closer to the bottom is the point the larger is the total pressure i e b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 at t 3 5 s second we choose four typical points b 1 b 3 b 5 and b 7 of the vertical line on the front wall at four porosity cases of the frontal and back walls n 0 11 25 15 63 and 28 13 respectively as labelled in fig 22 a d to discuss the influence of porosity on the spatial and temporal variations in the pressure liu et al 2018 the obtained results are presented in fig 22 e h here four cases of porosity of the front and back walls are analysed and other cases such as different porosities of the back wall and different side window configurations are not mentioned because they yield a minor effect on flow characteristics before the front wall as presented in the abovementioned sections fig 22 e h show that the temporal variation trends of the pressure for different porosity cases are almost the same irrespective of any position especially during the recession period t 5 s however there is a clear discrepancy among n 0 11 25 15 63 and 28 13 when t increases from 1 5 to 4 s for the three cases of n 11 25 15 63 and 28 13 at t 1 5 4 s the larger is n the higher is the pressure this occurs possibly because for a large door on the front wall points b 1 b 3 b 5 and b 7 are nearer to the edge of the door when the floodwater hits the front wall more floodwaters can enter the building through the large front door which leads to a large velocity on the door therefore velocities at b 1 b 3 b 5 and b 7 are larger for a high porosity case than for a low porosity case this yields a large dynamic pressure contributing to a higher total pressure at a large porosity case of the front wall nevertheless after a long period of time t 5 s the floodwater velocity becomes slow before the building in this case the static pressure comprises most of the total pressure therefore the porosity of the front wall plays little role and the pressure at the bottom of the front wall is higher than that at the top i e b 1 b 7 furthermore we also plot the pressure peak values at different vertical positions b 1 b 7 for four different porosity cases in fig 22 i here the upper panel shows the maximum pressure value at an initial impact period i e almost at t 1 5 s whereas the lower panel denotes the maximum pressure value at the recession period almost at t 5 s in general the pressure peak value gradually decreases from the bottom to the top and there is no large discrepancy between different porosity cases for the first pressure peak the maximum peak difference 973 95 pa occurs between n 15 63 and n 0 at b 2 while for the second pressure peak the maximum peak difference occurs between n 11 25 and n 0 at b 6 269 03 pa implying that porosity has a minor effect on the resultant pressure peak value finally in the middle vertical line of the front wall we choose three representative points c 5 c 6 and c 7 as labelled in fig 23 a c at three porosity cases of the frontal and back walls n 0 11 25 and 15 63 to identify a possible effect of porosity on the spatial and temporal variations of pressure above the front door the obtained results are shown in fig 23 d f except for t 1 5 5 s the temporal variation trends of pressure are similar for any porosity at any point c 5 c 6 and c 7 implying little effect of porosity the exception is n 15 63 at c 5 because c 5 lies on the top edge of the large front door see fig 23 c however the pressure is different at t 1 5 5 s for those porosity cases at the initial period of the impact process a part of the floodwater enters the building due to the existence of the front door which creates little impact above the door therefore no large pressure peak occurs at those porosity cases in comparison to the impervious case i e n 0 specifically some floodwaters climb up along two sides of the door on the front wall to reach the eave part of the building when they interact with the eave the floodwaters begin to drop towards two sides and a part of floodwater converges above the door the first point where the converged floodwaters flow above the door is c 7 followed by c 6 and the final point is c 5 as a result the pressure at c 7 is the largest at c 5 is the lowest and at c 6 is between the abovementioned values as shown in fig 23 d f for example at t 2 s p at c 7 p at c 6 p at c 5 furthermore a large front door may lead to convergence of smaller floodwaters above the door as well as a slow convergence velocity which causes the pressure peak to occur later this point is clearly shown in fig 23 e the occurrence times of the pressure peak for the three cases of n 0 11 25 and 15 63 are 1 5 1 8 and 2 s respectively during the recession period of the impact process t 5 s the water level in front of the front wall is slightly higher than the door height and the floodwater velocity is slow in this case the static pressure comprises most of the total pressure due to a low position of c 5 relative to c 7 the total pressure at c 5 is higher than that at c 7 as shown in fig 23 d f for example at t 7 s p at c5 is 2000 pa p at c6 is 1200 pa and p at c7 is 750 pa for this case the porosity no longer has any influence on the pressure variation 6 concluding remarks this study aims to quantify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building using the cfd numerical model based on the rans equations first the model is adopted to simulate the water depth and pressure in an existing dam break flood experiment a comparison of simulation results against experimental datasets shows the robustness and validity of the numerical model in particular a realizable k ε turbulence closure model and an adaptive meshing technique are validated to be a much more efficient method that guarantees both modelling accuracy and computational resource savings and is adopted in subsequent numerical calculations next the numerical model is applied to identify the role of openings in the impact of a dam break induced flood on a porous building in terms of kinematic analysis and dynamics analysis nine scenarios of opening configurations have been implemented including different porosities of the front and back walls various porosities of the back wall while maintaining a fixed porosity of the front wall and various positions and sizes of the side window the following main three findings can be made from this work 1 an increasing size of the front and back doors allows more floodwater to flow through the building which leads to a reduced maximum water level upstream of the building and a reduced area of the wake zone behind the back wall for three cases of porosity of 0 11 25 and 15 63 the resultant longitudinal impact force on the building shows two peak values with time whereas it only has a peak for both large porosity cases of 28 13 and 54 69 furthermore the maximum longitudinal impact force significantly decays with the porosity of the front and back walls in terms of a quadratic function form which indicates that applicably allowing the floodwater to flow through the building can facilitate the mechanical safety of building structures in actual flood disaster prevention and mitigation the porosity of the front wall has an influence on the pressure distribution along either an acentric vertical line or the middle vertical line at a short time since the floodwater hits the building but plays little role after a long period of time 2 a variation in the size of the back door when maintaining a fixed porosity of the front wall plays a role in controlling the outflow discharge of floodwater from the building hence affecting the flow field within the building even that in front of the front wall however it yields no clear difference in the resultant longitudinal impact force nevertheless regarding the first peak and the second peak of impact force a larger back door facilitates a reduction of the peak impact force and the reduction degree for the first peak is higher than that for the second peak 3 at a short period of time after the dam break occurs the presence of the side window in terms of position and size plays no clear role in affecting the flow field around the building however at a moderate period of time there is a clear lateral exchange between floodwaters outside the building and those within the building the larger is the window the greater the lateral exchange discharge becomes finally there is little lateral exchange of floodwater due to water level equality after a long period of time furthermore the discharge of the floodwater that enter the building through the front and back doors are much larger than the lateral exchange discharge through side windows regardless of any configuration of the side window in terms of the lateral exchange discharge the positions of the side windows play a clear role the discharge for the middle side window is much larger than that for the lower side window by one order of magnitude whereas the size of the lower side window seems to play little role additionally the existence of the side window greatly decreases the lateral impact force in comparison to the case without any side window especially when the side window lies in the lower part of the sidewall finally of note an idealized porous building and a dam break induced flood as an incoming flow are adopted in this study however there are complicated opening configurations in some real world buildings furthermore the floodwater pathway is often intricate particularly in an actual urban street canyon these effects are worthy of further investigation in subsequent studies although this study merely focused on the hydrodynamic process modelling of a dam break induced flood on an isolated pervious building it might show a possibility of being further extended to investigate the impact of watershed or urban landscape pattern on the flood severity from the hydrology perspective in future researches for example against the background of global climate change and urbanization the watershed or urban landscape land use land cover configurations have been changed a lot leading to an increasing impervious surfaces from the headwaters to the mouth of the hydrological network how these variations contribute the floodwater

2786,multi objective flood control operation of cascade reservoirs is a vital issue in river basin management however traditional multi objective approaches commonly provide one operation scheme only and fail to offer decision makers with more pareto front options this study explores a multi objective cluster decomposition framework for optimizing the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs in a river basin the proposed framework involves a multi objective optimization module a cluster decomposition module and an evaluation and sorting module the multi objective cluster decomposition framework simultaneously deals with three objectives to minimize the flood peaks of flood control points o1 to minimize the reservoir capacity used for flood control o2 and to minimize the flood diversion volume of the flood detention area o3 the complex flood control system composed of two cascade reservoirs four navigation power junctions one flood detection area and three flood control points in the ganjiang river basin of china constitutes the case study the results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the comprehensive benefits of the cascade reservoirs where the maximum reduction in objectives o1 o3 is 2071 m3 s the improvement rate is 2 64 219 million m3 the improvement rate is 44 60 and 167 million m3 the improvement rate is 78 13 respectively furthermore in contrast to the traditional multi attribute evaluation method the proposed framework can effectively identify compromised decisions through a cluster decomposition module which provides beneficial trade off guidance in making a sound decision upon pareto front options keywords flood control operation multi objective optimization cluster decomposition nsga ii k means

prominent effects on human lives and properties aerts et al 2014 li et al 2019 luo et al 2021 ridolfi et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the annual economic loss caused by floods exceeds 30 billion dollars worldwide roxy et al 2017 due to climate change and increasing human activities extreme precipitation events become more frequent and severe which will lead to more severe flood disasters peng et al 2017 zhou 2020 beylich et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 filipova et al 2022 water projects such as reservoirs flood detention areas and levees have been constructed and real time reservoir operation for flood control is considered to be an efficient non engineering countermeasure to alleviate flood stress along rivers huang et al 2022 labadie 2004 wang et al 2021 the traditional real time flood control operation of reservoirs follows the procedure involving 1 establishing a flood control operation model that consists of objectives and constraints to reflect the topological structure of reservoirs and flood control points 2 utilizing optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal results or pareto front alternatives according to reservoir inflow and 3 determining the final discharge scheme of reservoirs in consideration of flood forecast information and other factors li et al 2019 luo et al 2015 wei and hsu 2008 zhu et al 2017 therefore relevant research on flood control models optimization methods and operation scheme evaluation has been carried out jia et al 2015 explored a decomposition coordination model to optimize the real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system li et al 2019 alleviated the curse of dimensionality encountered in a multi reservoir system s real time flood control operation by establishing a criteria system to assess the effect of flood control on reservoirs and identify effective reservoirs zhang et al 2019b presented a two tier analytical method to assess flood risks and evaluate the risk of real time flood control operation to cascade reservoirs meng et al 2019 proposed a framework that integrates real time flood control operation risk assessment and adjustment components of floodwater release to reduce the flood risk caused by the flood control operation of cascade reservoirs chen et al 2020 established a multi objective flood control risk management model to achieve the optimal real time operation of a parallel reservoir system yu et al 2022 proposed a reverse order impoundment method for cascade reservoirs which tackled the curse of dimensionality faced in reservoirs flood control operation over the yangtze river basin of china the models addressed above can improve the flood control effect of real time reservoir operation however it is still difficult to establish a generic model applicable to multi reservoir systems especially for the flood defense systems composed of cascade reservoirs multiple flood control points flood storage and other water projects to better guide decision makers or reservoir operators on regulating the discharge of reservoirs in practice researchers consider deriving optimal scheduling rules for reservoirs since flood control rules play an essential role in reservoir management kim et al 2021 currently the optimization of reservoir operation rules can be classified into two types implicit stochastic optimization iso and parameterization simulation optimization pso celeste and billib 2009 pan et al 2020 iso uses optimization methods to regulate reservoir discharge under several inflow scenarios and derives operation rules according to the optimal results obtained from regression methods such as the linear regression method karamouz and houck 1982 ostadrahimi et al 2012 as computing technology evolves artificial intelligence ai techniques machine learning algorithms and decision tree algorithms have been broadly used to derive reservoir operation rules in consideration of multiple objectives kumar et al 2013 liu et al 2019 tsai et al 2015 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 compared with the linear regression method these methods are capable of addressing the complex nonlinear relationship of decision variables water levels discharge processes etc and input variables inflow information however they require massive optimization results under different inflow scenarios to serve as input samples for developing rules without giving explicit expressions making them hard to apply in practice alternatively the pso predesigns the reservoir operating rules on the forms of parameters and optimizes the parameters by heuristic algorithms to obtain the optimal operation rules which alleviate the above issues and therefore gradually attracts more researchers attention zhang et al 2019a chang and chang 2009 employed the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to optimize the water supply rule curve of the feitsui shimen parallel reservoir system for minimizing storage indices and demonstrated the pareto front solutions could improve joint operational strategies wang et al 2011 explored a multi tier interactive genetic algorithm to optimize the water supply operation rules of the shimen reservoir for alleviating the optimization complexity of high dimensional variables caused by the long term operation fu et al 2016 adopted a genetic algorithm to optimize the flood control operation rules for a single reservoir system by defining the parameters of rules in response to the inflow and water levels of the reservoir zhang et al 2019a classified flood types by the predesigned parameters of flood classification aggregation decomposition operation rules and adopted the nsga ii to search pareto front solutions based on the trade offs of flood loss between the tributaries and the mainstream in addition implementing the iso or pso to derive or optimize the scheduling rules of the flood defense system is a multi objective problem which considers the coordinated operation of multiple reservoirs and the conflicting relationship between the reservoir flood control capacity and flood peak of flood control points the traditional procedure of the multi objective flood control operation usually includes i establishing a model ii applying an optimization algorithm to obtain pareto front solutions iii ranking the operational schemes and iv choosing an operational scheme jia et al 2016 this procedure usually selects only one option from multiple operational schemes but can t offer more options for different objectives the novelty of this study relies upon the optimization of the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs in a river basin using a multi objective cluster decomposition framework meanwhile its application for the first time to provide beneficial trade off information in making a sound decision upon alternative options main contributions can be attributed to three aspects first aiming at cascade reservoirs in a river basin a mathematical model is established to simultaneously tackle three objectives that minimize flood peak at the downstream sections the reservoir capacity used for flood control and the flood diversion volume of the flood detention area second a multi objective cluster decomposition framework consisting of multi objective optimization cluster decomposition and evaluation and sorting modules is proposed to optimize the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs and to analyze the coordinating and conflicting relationship among different objectives third three types of compromising decisions acquired from the pareto front solutions outperform the conventional flood control operation cfco rules in flood control effect and provide desired options to decision makers a complex flood control system in the ganjiang river basin of china forms a case study 2 methodology fig 1 presents the multi objective cluster decomposition framework proposed in this study which contains three modules related to multi objective optimization cluster decomposition as well as evaluation and sorting in the multi objective optimization module the nsga ii is employed to optimize the parameterized flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs to obtain pareto front solutions in the cluster decomposition module the pareto front solutions are petitioned into several clusters according to the corresponding fitness values by using the k means method in the evaluation and sorting module each cluster of pareto front solutions is assessed to acquire the optimal flood control operation ofco rules through the cumulative prospect theory cpt combined with the criteria importance given by intercriteria correlation critic and the entropy weight method ewm the methods adopted in this study are described as follows 2 1 mathematical model of flood control operation 2 1 1 multi objective functions a multi objective model is established for coping with three objectives to minimize the flood peaks of flood control points o1 to minimize the reservoir capacity used for flood control o2 and to minimize the flood diversion volume of the flood detention area o3 due to the complex system involving multi reservoirs in multi horizons a multi objective optimization algorithm is implemented to optimize the three objectives for reducing the possible flood loss of a worst case scenario these flood control objectives are formulated and shown below o1 to minimize the flood peaks of flood control points 1 a f 1 m i n i 1 i q i max 1 b q i

flood diversion volume of the flood detention area 3 a f 3 m i n s 1 s w s max 3 b w s max max t 1 t w s 1 w s 2 w s t w s t where qi t is the river flow of the ith flood control point at time t vp t and ws t represent the water storage of the pth reservoir and the sth flood detention area at time t respectively qi max is the flood peak of the ith flood control point during period t of flood control operation vp max is the maximum capacity of the pth reservoir used for flood control operation ws max is maximum storage of the sth flood detention area and i p and s are the numbers of flood

where ip t and op t represent the inflow and outflow of the pth reservoir at time t respectively and δt is calculation time interval 2 reservoir outflow limitation 5 o p t o p max z p t where op max zp t means the allowable maximal outflow of the pth reservoir when the water level reaches zp t at time t 3 water level limitation 6 z p min z p t z p max where zp min and zp max represent the minimal and maximal water levels of the pth reservoir during flood control operation respectively 4 start and end water level limitation 7 z p 0 z p start z p t z p end where zp start and zp end represent the initial and final water levels of the pth reservoir respectively 5 flood routing constraints 8 q i t φ i o p t o p t 1 o p t τ i δ q i t where φi is the flood routing function between the pth reservoir at the upstream area and the ith flood control point at the downstream area τi is the time lag of the flood routing and δqi t is the lateral flow of the ith flood control point at time t the muskingum method gill 1978 is commonly used for flood routing calculation which is shown as follows 9 q k 1 t 1 c 0 k q k t 1 c 1 k q k t c 2 k q k 1 t δ q k t c 0 k c 1 k c 2 k 1 where qk t is the river flow of the kth channel segment at time t c 0 k c 1 k and c 2 k are the muskingum coefficients and δqk t is the lateral flow of the kth channel segment at time t 6 constraints of other water projects more and more different types of water projects constructed along the river have gradually made hydraulic connections more complicated some of them such as flood detention areas can reduce downstream flood peaks while some of them such as navigation power junctions and sluice gates are built for other applications rather than flood control operation the constraints of these water projects can be simulated according to the operation rules shown as follows 10 o n t ψ n i n t z n t where on t in t and zn t represent the outflow inflow and water level of the nth water project respectively and ψn is operation rules of the nth water project 7 boundary limitations of parameters for flood control operation rules are show below the reservoir cfco rules can be described as follows 11 o p t q 1 p i p t i 1 p low i 1 p up a n d z p t z 1 p low z 1 p up q 2 p i p t i 2 p low i 2 p up a n d z p t z 2 p low z 2 p up q j p p i p t i j p p low i j p p up a n d z p t z j p p low z j p p up q j p p i p t i j p p low i j p p up a n d z p t z j p p low z j p p up where q j p p is the jp th level discharge of the pth reservoir i j p p low and z j p p low are the jp th level lower limit for the inflow and the current water level of the pth reservoir respectively and i j p p up and z j p p up are the jp th level upper limit for the inflow and the current water level of the pth reservoir respectively in this study q j p p and i j p p low i j p p up are parameterized which commonly follow the constraints shown as follows 12 x j p p up min x j p p up x j p p up max x j p p

max are the boundary limitations of x j p p x j p p low min and x j p p low max are the boundary limitations of x j p p low and x j p p up min and x j p p up max are the boundary limitations of x j p p up 2 2 multi objective optimization module by virtue of the fast convergence of the uniform distribution of pareto front solutions the nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2000 is a mature intelligent algorithm capable of handling multi objective issues wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in this study three objectives o1 o3 as shown in equations 1 3 are selected in the multi objective mathematical model of flood control operation it is obvious that there is a conflictive relationship among the three objectives which indicates the improvement of o1 may lead to a reduction in the benefits of o2 or o3 therefore this study incorporates the nsga ii into the multi objective optimization module to obtain the pareto front strategies that balance the benefit among three objectives while quantifying the trade offs for satisfying different objectives the decision variables are x j p p x j p p low and x j p p up shown in equation 12 and the number of decision variables is p 1 p j 1 j p j p since chaos is known for its characteristics of ergodicity regularity and randomicity the one dimension logistic mapping model is implemented to generate initial solutions for enlarging the space of exploration and increasing the diversity of population xu and mei 2018 the one dimension logistic mapping model xu and mei 2018 can be described as follows 13 x i 1 j c 4 x i j c 1 x i j c x i j a j x i j c b j a j i 1 n j 1 r x i j c 0 1 where xi j c is the chaotic variable which falls between 0 and 1 n and r represent the numbers of populations and variables respectively xi j is the initial solution mapped from the chaotic variable xi j c which falls between aj and bj and aj and bj are lower and upper limitations for the jth variable respectively the processes of the nsga ii can be described as follows step 1 set up the parameters of the nsga ii including the maximal number of iterations k the crossover and mutation rates and the population size np the tournament selection is implemented as the selection operator step 2 set the iteration k 1 initialize the parent population p k x 1 1 1 x j p p 1 x 1 1 1 l o w x j p p 1 l o w x 1 1 1 u p x j p p 1 u p x 1 1 np x j p p np x 1 1 np l o w x j p p np l o w x 1 1 np u p x j p p np u p k based on the one dimension logistic mapping model as shown in equation 13 and each row of p k represent a set of solutions composed of x j p p x j p p low and x j p p up jp 1 2 jp then calculate their fitness values of o1 o3 through the mathematical model of flood control operation and rank each set of solutions in the population p k through the fast non dominated sorting step 3 apply the selection crossover and mutation operators to generate an offspring population q k of size np step 4 integrate populations p k and q k into a population r k of size 2np and rank each set of solutions in the population r k through the fast non dominated sorting and calculate their crowding distances deb et al 2002 step 5 choose the new parent population p k 1 of size np from the population r k and generate the offspring population q k 1 through the selection crossover and mutation operators calculate their fitness values of o1 o3 through the mathematical model of flood control operation and then k k 1 step 6 repeat steps 4 and 5 until iteration k achieves k the population size i e the number of individuals is set to be 200 different numbers of iterations such as 100 300 500 and 800 iterations were tested on the convergence effect it is found that the pareto front hardly varied when the number of iterations exceeded over 500 therefore the number of iterations is set to be 500 the crossover and mutation rates are set to be 0 8 and 0 1 respectively consequently the fitness values of o1 o3 shown in equations 1 3 to the pareto front solutions can be calculated by simulating flood control operation using the mathematical model which are used as inputs for the cluster decomposition module 2 3 cluster decomposition module the cluster decomposition module is applied to partitioning the fitness values of pareto front solutions into several clusters each cluster of fitness values reflects preferences for the corresponding objective the k means method with advantages of simplicity and fast convergence has been widely implemented in the fields of pattern detection signal processing and machine learning aytac 2020 feng et al 2019 jain et al 1999 sun et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 therefore it is adopted in this study the cluster decomposition processes are shown as follows step 1 arrange the fitness values into an l m matrix x with l samples and m objectives 14 x x 1 1 x 1 m x 2 1 x 2 m x l 1 x l m step 2 normalize matrix x to make it dimensionless 15 x i j x i j x j min x j max x j min x i j i s t h e b e n e f i t t y p e i n d e x x j max x i j x j max x j min x i j i s t h e c o s t t y p e i n d e x where x i j is the normalized index and x j min and x j max are the minimal and maximal values of the jth column respectively step 3 determine the number of clusters and randomly generate initial cluster centroids considering the number of objectives is m the cluster number is preset to be m then the initial centroids can be denoted as u u 1 u m u m here u m x m 1 x m m t step 4 calculate the distance between objects and centroids 16 f u x m 1 m l 1 l d u m x l m 2 d u m x l m m 1 m u m x l m 2 step 5 update the centroids u and repeat steps 3 and 4 until minimizing the f u x then the centroids u arg min f u x and the pareto front solutions are partitioned into m clusters through the k means method the clusters of fitness values are obtained to serve as inputs for the evaluation and sorting module 2 4 evaluation and sorting module the evaluation and sorting module is used to assess and rank the fitness values for choosing the ofco rules of each cluster since the fitness values of pareto front solutions are partitioned into m clusters m types of ofco rules with preferences for the corresponding objectives can be provided to decision makers the cpt proposed by tversky and kahneman 1992 is applicable to addressing multi attribute issues and has been widely utilized in finance decision making risk management and scheme evaluation gurtler and stolpe 2017 zhao et al 2018 therefore it is applied in this module and the procedure is described as follows step 1 establish a normalized decision matrix for the mth cluster the decision matrix x m x i j l m m is normalized by equation 15 and denoted as u m u i j l m m step 2 determine positive and negative ideal solutions as reference points according to the following equation 17 a max i 1 l m u i j j j min i 1 l m u i j j j u 1 u 2 u j u m a min i 1 l m u i j j j max i 1 l m u i j j j u 1 u 2 u j u m where a and a are positive ideal and negative ideal schemes respectively j and j represent the subscript sets for benefit type and cost type indices respectively and uj and uj represent the positive and negative ideal values of the jth index respectively step 3 establish the gray correlation coefficient matrix 18 r i j min i 1 l m min j 1 m u i j u j ρ max i 1 l m max j 1 m u i j u j u i j u j ρ max i 1 l m max j 1

coefficients respectively and ρ is the resolution coefficient commonly equal to 0 5 step 4 establish the positive and negative prospect value matrices according to the value function of the prospect theory 19 v v 1 1 v 1 m v 2 1 v 1 m v i j v i m v l m 1 v l m m 20 v v 1 1 v 1 m v 2 1 v 1 m v i j v i m v l m 1 v l m m where vi j and vi j are positive and negative prospect values respectively which are calculated as follows 21 v i j 1 r i j α v i j θ r i j 1 β where θ α and β are the coefficients of the loss aversion risk preference and risk aversion respectively the values of these coefficients are obtained according to luo et al 2021 i e θ 2 25 and α β 0 88 step 5 establish the prospect theory model 22 max v i 1 l m j 1 m v i j π ω j i 1 l m j 1 m v i j π ω j where ωj is the weight coefficient for the jth index ωj min and ωj max are the lower and upper boundary limitations of ωj respectively and π and π are the weighting functions for gains and losses which can be calculated as follows 23 π ω j ω j γ ω j γ 1 ω j γ 1 γ π ω j ω j γ ω j γ 1 ω j γ 1 γ where γ and γ describe the concave and convex curvatures of the functions commonly γ 0 61 and γ 0 69 to determine ωj min and ωj max the critic diakoulaki et al 1995 and ewm juang and huang 1992 are applied to the normalized matrix um to obtain weight coefficients 24 ω j min min ω j critic ω j ewm ω j max max ω j critic ω j ewm where ωj critic and ωj ewm are weight coefficients of the jth index for the normalized matrix um using the critic and ewm respectively step 6 solve the above model by the genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 and obtain the optimal weight coefficients ω ω 1 ω 2 ωm then the optimal prospect value of each scheme can be calculated as follows 25 v i j 1 m v i j π ω j j 1 m v i j π ω j where vi is the optimal prospect value of the ith scheme all the schemes are sorted according to the value of vi vi with a larger value means the corresponding scheme is better than the others the aforementioned steps are repeated until all the clusters are evaluated and the ofco rules of each cluster are obtained 3 study area and materials the ganjiang river with a length of 766 km is one of the five main tributaries of the poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china the basin area of the ganjiang river is 83 500 km2 which accounts for nearly half the area of the jiangxi province in china therefore the ganjiang river has a significant impact on the socioeconomic development of the jiangxi province flood hazards have occurred every 3 5 years on average in the ganjiang river basin since the 1950s which has damaged human lives and properties in 2010 flood disasters happened in the ganjiang river basin due to a heavy rainstorm which affected over 7 6 million residents and resulted in direct losses exceeding 2 billion u s dollars a flood defense system has been constructed in the middle and lower reaches of the ganjiang rive for coping with flood threats fig 2 illustrates the flood defense system which contains cascade reservoirs a flood detention area navigation power junctions and flood control points the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs are the two largest reservoirs in the jiangxi province and their joint flood storage capacity achieves 1 17 billion m3 the navigation power junctions are constructed mainly for inland water transportation and power generation and no flood storage capacity is reserved therefore the operation of navigation power junctions influences flood routing between upstream and downstream channel segments but hardly affects downstream flood peaks the quangang flood detention area located in the lower reach of the ganjiang river is constructed for alleviating the flood stress of the downstream areas by storing flood the characteristic parameters of these water projects are listed in table 1 the river channel is divided into eight channel segments by water projects and lateral flow according to fig 2 in this study it is assumed that the hydraulic system responds to the equations of the mathematical flood model the calibrated parameters of the hydraulic equations are provided by the jiangxi academy of water science and engineering comprehensive planning of ganjiang river basin 2015 table 2 lists the muskingum parameters of each channel segment and the calculation time step is 6 h according to this comprehensive planning for the design floods with 200 year return periods and or shorter ones the quangang flood detention area doesn t divert flood water therefore in this study based on the characteristics of the flood region composition four typical flood hydrographs shown in fig a1 which are 1973 representing the upstream type 1982 representing the downstream type and 1968 and 1992 typical floods representing the whole basin type are employed to derive the design floods with 300 year and 500 year return periods using the peak and volume amplitude method xiao et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 the ofco rules acquired from the 300 year design floods are applied to the 500 year design floods to verify the applicability of the proposed framework 4 results and discussion the cfco rules of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs are parameterized as decision variables in tables 3 and 4 respectively the boundary limits of these variables are presented in table 5 the values of variables set in the cfco rules comprehensively consider the reservoirs characteristics and the requirements of flood control operation therefore the original values of variables x 1 x 13 are subject to a certain sort order for example the sort order for the original values of variables x 7 x 9 is x 7 x 8 x 9 and the differences of these variables are 1500 2000 given this the boundary limits of these variables presented in table 5 cannot be set very large the variation ranges of variables x 1 x 13 in table 5 can be divided into three categories the first kind including variables x 1 x 4 and x 13 has large search spaces of 2000 the second kind including variables x 3 x 5 x 6 and x 10 x 12 have moderate search spaces which are equal to 2000 the third kind with small search spaces of 2000 includes variables x 2 and x 7 x 9 4 1 results of multi objective flood control operation the pareto front solutions of the multi objective flood control operation obtained from the nsga ii concerning the 300 year design floods calculated based on the typical floods in 1968 1972 1982 and 1992 are shown in fig 3 to better display the distribution pattern of the pareto front a surface is interpolated from these discrete pareto front points for each design flood besides the results of three objectives created by the cfco are also displayed in comparison with the pareto front solutions in fig 3 a the distribution of pareto points displays a tri layers phenomenon from the top layer to the bottom one the flood peak of flood control points o1 decreases as the other two objectives o2 o3 increase which demonstrates the competitive relationship between the flood peak of flood control points the coordinated operation of the cascade reservoirs and the flood detention area that is to say larger reservoir capacity used for flood control o2 and more flood diversion of the flood detention area o3 can make smaller flood peaks of flood control points o1 in fig 3 b and 3 c the distributions of pareto points for the design floods based on 1973 and 1982 typical floods are similar for the designed flood based on the 1973 typical flood the pareto points are formed into an upward convex curve while the pareto points of the designed flood based on the 1982 typical flood are shaped into a downward concave curve in fig 3 d the pareto front of the designed flood based on the 1992 typical flood is similar to an inclined triangular plane and the range of the flood peak is from 7 62 104 m3 s to 7 68 104 m3 s which is narrower than that of the other design floods in addition it is found that the points of cfco rules stay far away from the pareto front in fig 3 a 3 b and 3 d especially for the design floods based on 1968 and 1992 typical floods shown in fig 3 a and 3 d where the flood peak regulated by the cfco rules is larger than that of pareto front solutions this means that the pareto front solutions can achieve better flood control effects with larger flood peak reductions and smaller reservoir capacities used for flood control but a smaller flood diversion volume than the cfco rules to illustrate the multi objective optimization for the cfco rules table 6 compares the values of objective functions between the nsga ii and the cfco rules the values of the nsga ii in table 6 are the average fitness values of pareto front solutions it appears that the pareto front solutions acquired by the nsga ii outperform the cfco rules at minimizing three objectives except for the designed flood based on 1982 flood the pareto front solutions can simultaneously decrease the outcomes of the three objectives averagely reduce 0 55 2 55 of o1 0 94 6 19 of o2 and 10 52 51 40 of o3 compared with those of the cfco rules for the designed flood based on the 1982 typical flood the average of o3 of the pareto front solutions is 0 51 billion m3 which is more than that of the cfco rules but causes a decrease of 12 45 in o2 the lateral flow from downstream of the wan an reservoir in 1982 is the largest than those of all design floods thereby more flood diversion volume is used for reducing the flood peaks of flood control points 4 2 results of cluster cluster decomposition for pareto front solutions since the study has three objectives the cluster number is set to be three the cluster decomposition module partitions the pareto front solutions into three clusters with a certain preference for the objective which are identified as clusters i ii and iii fig 4 shows the cluster decomposition results for the 300 year design floods based on 1968 1973 1982 and 1992 typical floods which are taken as an instance for illustration in fig 4 the o2 and o3 are selected as x and y axes respectively meanwhile the colors of pareto front points reflect the o1 the clusters of pareto front points are distinguished according to the fitness values of o1 o3 the pareto front points with the similar fitness values are partitioned into the same cluster by the k means method which indicates that these points to the corresponding ofco rules have the similar flood control effect fig 4 a displays the cluster decomposition results for the design floods based on the 1968 typical flood cluster i is the gathering of pareto front points with larger o1 7 34 104 m3 s 7 38 104 m3 s and smaller o2 9 49 108 m3 10 27 108 m3 cluster ii is the assembly of pareto front points with the characteristics of smaller o3 0 42 108 m3 0 96 108 m3 and larger o2 10 34 108 m3 11 10 108 m3 cluster iii with the phenomenon of layers is the aggregation of pareto front points with smaller o1 7 31 104 m3 s 7 33 104 m3 s as well as larger o2 10 24 108 m3 11 10 108 m3 and o3 0 97 108 m3 1 73 108 m3 the results of the cluster decomposition module for the other design floods are shown in fig 4 b to d the distribution of the pareto front solutions for various floods differs greatly for the design floods based on the 1973 and 1982 typical floods shown in fig 4 b and c the pareto front solutions display a linear distribution the smaller flood peak is accompanied with a more reservoir capacity used for flood control but a less diversion volume and vice versa for the designed flood based on the 1992 typical flood the points of the pareto front solutions present a v shape distribution in fig 4 d the points of the blue portion form a line nearly parallel to the y axis where the flood peak decreases as the diversion volume increases the points of clusters i and iii in fig 4 d constitute an oblique line that presents the complementary effect of the flood peak reduction between o2 and o3 where the flood peak hardly varies however o3 decreases from 2 54 108 m3 to 1 48 108 m3 with the increase in o2 from 11 30 108 m3 to 12 06 108 m3 to illustrate the characteristic preferences of pareto front solutions in each cluster table 7 lists the average objective values of pareto front solutions according to table 7 the average objective values in each cluster indicate the preference of the cluster for the corresponding objective taking the designed flood based on the 1968 typical flood as an example the average of o1 in cluster iii is minimal due to the largest average of the diversion volume and a larger reservoir flood storage capacity compared with those of the other clusters this means that the pareto front solutions in cluster iii have the preference for o1 similarly for the designed flood based on the 1968 typical flood the pareto front solutions in cluster ii with the minimal average diversion volume are inclined to minimize o3 and those in cluster i are inclined to minimizing reservoir capacity used for flood control additionally a similar analysis can be applied to the other design floods 4 3 results of pareto front solution sorting and selection the ofco rules of each cluster are determined through the evaluation and sorting module the ofco rules of three clusters for the 300 year design floods are listed in table 8 the three optimization objectives are presented furthermore the power generation indicator pgi risk indicator ri and vulnerability indicator vi are also introduced for the comparative analysis of the flood control effect of the ofco rules and cfco rules the definitions of pgi ri and vi are listed in appendix performance indicators the differences between the cfco rules and ofco rules on three optimization objectives and the aforementioned indicators for the 300 year floods are listed in table 9 in addition the ofco rules in table 8 are applied to regulating the 500 year design floods and the corresponding results are listed in table 10 in table 8 x1 x 6 are the cfco rule variables of the wan an reservoir and x 7 x 13 are those of the xiajiang reservoir combined with the variation ranges of parameters in table 5 it is found that the values of variables in the ofco rules are not close to the upper or lower boundary limit for most clusters in different design floods that is to say the search spaces of variables are set adequate for the multi objective flood control optimization variables x 3 and x 10 x 12 with moderate search spaces occur in the late rising period preceding the inflow peak of the ofco rules which mainly influence the peak reduction of reservoirs variables x 1 and x 13 with large search spaces mainly affect the inflow reduction because they occur in the early rising period of the ofco rules of the wan an reservoir and the recession period of the ofco rules of the xiajiang reservoir respectively variables with small search spaces such as x 7 x 9 occur in the early rising period of the ofco rules of the xiajiang reservoir on the whole variables with large and small search spaces mainly affect the reservoir storage and water levels before and after the inflow peak respectively while those with moderate search spaces can reduce the flood peak of the reservoir to certain extent in table 9 for the 300 year design floods based on 1968 1973 and 1992 nearly all the ofco rules of each cluster achieve better flood control effects with smaller values of optimization objectives o1 can be reduced by up to 2071 m3 s with the improvement rate of 2 64 when using the ofco rules of cluster ii for the 300 year design flood based on 1992 for the 300 year design flood based on 1982 flood the ofco rules of cluster iii can be decreased by 2 19 108 m3 the corresponding improvement rate is 44 60 of o2 which is the maximum value the maximum decrease of o3 is achieved by the ofco rules of cluster ii for the 300 year design flood based on 1968 which is 1 67 108 m3 with the improvement rate of 78 13 the ri and vi of ofco rules for most of the design floods are obviously smaller than those of the cfco rules which means the ofco rules can reduce the flood defense system s flood control risk and vulnerability for example the minimum values of ri and vi are 0 when using the ofco rules of cluster i for the 300 year design flood based on 1973 as for pgi the differences between the ofco rules and cfco rules are small for the same design flood hydropower generation ranges from 2 42 108 to 3 14 108 kw h for different 300 year design floods the ofco rules of a specific cluster reveal a preference for the corresponding objective for example in table 9 for the designed flood based on 1968 flood the ofco rules of cluster i are more concerned about the safe operation of reservoirs since the minimum reservoir capacity is utilized to achieve the minimum flood peak reduction compared with the ofco rules of the other clusters the ofco rules of cluster ii concentrate more on minimizing o3 and the utilization of the flood storage capacity is the largest among those of all clusters the ofco rules of cluster iii focus more on the flood control effect so a more diversion volume and a more reservoir flood capacity are used to reduce downstream flood peaks a similar analysis can be applied to the other design floods listed in the last column of table 9 compared with the traditional multi objective reservoir operation the results in table 9 reveal the objective evaluation of ofco rules and provide decision makers with desired options on flood control operation of reservoirs the variables of the cfco rules in tables 3 and 4 can be replaced with the ofco rules of a particular preference in table 8 if the decision makers concentrate more on the flood control effect minimizing flood peak of the flood control points the ofco rules that have a preference for o1 can be accepted if they care more about the safe operation of water projects minimizing the maximum flood storage capacity of reservoirs or the diversion volume of the flood detention area the ofco rules that prefer o2 or o3 can be adopted the results in table 10 further verify the applicability of the ofco rules to the other design floods in table 10 for the 500 year design floods the values of o1 o2 o3 ri and vi become more prominent which means greater flood control stress when applying the ofco rules in table 8 the values of o1 ri and vi are smaller than those of the cfco rules for most of the design floods this indicates that the flood control risk and stress can be further decreased by the ofco rules however for o2 and o3 the results of ofco rules are little worse than those of the cfco rules especially for the design floods based on the 1968 and 1992 typical floods this is related to flood types since the 1968 and 1992 typical floods represent the whole basin type floods when they are magnified to larger design floods the lateral flow becomes larger compared with that of the upstream type or downstream type floods therefore the better effect of flood control on reducing the values of o1 ri and vi needs a larger reservoir flood control capacity to divert the flood volume leading to increasing the values of o2 and o3 the variation of the pgi ranges from 2 44 108 to 3 13 108 kw h which is not significantly different from that of the 300 year design floods this is because the inflow of the reservoirs and navigation power junctions is so large that the hydropower generation plants are at the full load capacity during the flood control operation overall the ofco rules can be applied to other design floods for improving the flood control effect of the cfco rules 4 4 operation processes of the ofco and cfco rules since the designed flood based on 1992 has large o1 o2 ri and vi values it is selected for further analyzing the operation processes of reservoirs and flood hydrographs at the flood control points fig 5 shows the comparison of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs using the ofco rules of cluster iii and cfco rules for the 300 year designed flood based on 1992 fig 6 shows the comparison of the flood hydrographs at the flood control points under the conditions of the natural regime no flood control operation ofco and cfco rules fig 5 a and b show that the maximum water levels of the wan an reservoir using the cfco and ofco rules are similar which are close to 94 6 m the maximum discharge of the ofco rules is also close to that of the cfco rules in fig 5 c and d being affected by the regulation of the wan an reservoir the maximum inflow of the xiajiang reservoir with the ofco rules is 610 m3 s which is less than that of the cfco rules therefore the ofco rules can reduce the maximum discharge of the xiajiang reservoir by 2706 m3 s which is more than that of the cfco rules besides the maximum water level of the xiajiang reservoir with the ofco rules is 0 2 m which is lower than that of the cfco rules thus the ofco rules can utilize a less flood control capacity to achieve a larger flood peak reduction than the cfco rules in fig 6 a compared with the natural regime the occurrence time of the flood peak at the ji an flood control point is delayed from the 32nd time period to the 43rd using the ofco rules and 44th time periods using the cfco rules in fig 6 b the flood peak at the shishang flood control point can be reduced to 24000 m3 s when using the ofco rules which is equal to its safety flow in fig 6 c the flood peaks of the cfco and ofco rules at the waizhou flood control point are close to each other i e about 3400 m3 s which is less than that of the natural regime compared with the cfco rules the ofco rules are more efficient in utilizing the flood control capacity and the flood diversion volume as well as improving the flood control effect especially in decreasing the flood peak of the shishang flood control point for the designed flood based on the 1992 typical flood 5 conclusions as more and more water projects such as reservoirs levees and flood detention areas have been implemented in river basins the collaborative operation of the flood defense system in consideration of flood peak reduction and flood water storage can be defined as a multi objective issue therefore it is crucial to determine a flood control operation scheme that makes trade offs between the safety of flood control points and water projects for flood management the traditional multi attribute evaluation method selects one scheme from multiple operation schemes but fails to provide more types of objective oriented ofco rules which may not match decision makers preferences this study aims to effectively identify multi objective flood control operation schemes for achieving the collaborative operation of multiple reservoirs in a flood defense system a multi objective cluster decomposition framework is proposed for optimizing the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs in a river basin through simultaneously tackling the minimum flood peaks of flood control points the minimum reservoir capacity used for flood control and the minimum flood diversion volume of the flood detention area a flood control system composed of two cascade reservoirs three flood control points four navigation power junctions and one flood detention area in the middle and lower reaches of the ganjiang river in china is selected as a case study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 for the 300 year design floods the multi objective cluster decomposition framework can significantly improve the performance of the cfco rules of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs with reductions in flood peaks reservoir capacities used for flood control and the diversion volume of the flood detention area reaching 2071 m3 s 2 18 108 m3 and 1 67 108 m3 respectively the ri and vi of the ofco rules are smaller than those of the cfco rules which indicates the ofco rules can improve the flood control vulnerability and risk for multi reservoir systems the differences in pgi between the ofco and cfco rules are minor with variations from 2 42 108 kw h to 3 14 108 kw h 2 the 500 year design floods are selected to verify the ofco rules applicability compared with the cfco rules ri and vi could be decreased by the ofco rules with a larger reservoir capacity used for flood control and a larger flood diversion volume of the flood detention area in addition the ranges of pgi are close to those of the 300 year design floods 3 the traditional multi objective reservoir operation selects one operation scheme from the pareto front solutions by using the multi attribute evaluation method in contrast the proposed framework can offer more ofco rules that prefer specific objectives as a result the ofco rules outperform the cfco rules of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs in balancing the benefits of the three objectives therefore decision makers can choose the ofco rules subject to particular objectives the study selects design floods to verify how the proposed framework affects the optimization of the cfco rules for reservoirs the corresponding ofco rules can be obtained if the flood hydrograph is available in practice however this study does not take the uncertainty in reservoir operation and flood forecasting into account future research may consider the transferability of uncertainty when optimizing the cfco rules of reservoirs which can further improve flood risk management of the flood defense system credit authorship contribution statement di zhu data curation investigation conceptualization

like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that greatly contributed to improving the manuscript appendix performance indicators the excess flood volume originated from the water volume exceeding the safety flow of flood control points causes flood damages larger stream flow increases the flood control risk and vulnerability of the flood defense system which endangers human lives and properties in this study the risk indicator ri and vulnerability indicator vi are used for the comparative analysis of the flood control performance for the ofco and cfco rules dau and adeloye 2021 the risk indicator ri is defined as the ratio of the number of occasions when the stream flow exceeds the safety flow to the total number of time periods the vulnerability indicator vi is to measure the impact of the flood peak at the flood control points and is estimated as the ratio of the excessive water volume to the safety flow in addition since there are navigation power junctions in the case study the power generation indicator pgi is defined as the hydropower generation during the flood control operation these indicators are calculated as follows a1 pgi p 1 p t 1 t n p t δ t a2 ri max t 1 t f q 1 t t t 1 t f q i t t t 1 t f q i t t 100 a3 vi max q 1 max q 1 s q 1 s q i max q i s q i s q i max q i s q i s 100 where np t is the average hydropower generation of the pth reservoir at time t qi s is the safety flow of the ith flood control point and f qi t is the function to count the time periods when stream flow exceeds the safety flow at the ith flood control point which can be calculated as follows a4 f q i t 1 q i t q i s 0 q i t q i s the typical flood hydrographs the four typical flood hydrographs adopted in this study are displayed in fig a1 it is shown that the peak value and the magnitude of the 1982 typical flood at the wan an reservoir are obviously smaller than those of the other typical floods in the downstream flood control points of the wan an reservoir the 1982 typical flood becomes larger and its peak values at the shishang and waizhou flood control points are bigger than those of 1973 and 1992 typical floods this means that the lateral flow at the downstream areas accounts for a larger proportion of the 1982 typical flood for the 1973 typical flood the shapes of flood hydrographs at upstream and downstream are similar displaying the bimodal types and the differences of peak values in fig a1 a d are slight this indicates that the magnitude of the later flow in the downstream area of the wan an reservoir is not too large for the 1973 typical flood for the 1968 and 1992 typical floods the shapes of flood hydrographs vary a lot in the upstream and downstream areas which represent the whole basin type floods 
2786,multi objective flood control operation of cascade reservoirs is a vital issue in river basin management however traditional multi objective approaches commonly provide one operation scheme only and fail to offer decision makers with more pareto front options this study explores a multi objective cluster decomposition framework for optimizing the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs in a river basin the proposed framework involves a multi objective optimization module a cluster decomposition module and an evaluation and sorting module the multi objective cluster decomposition framework simultaneously deals with three objectives to minimize the flood peaks of flood control points o1 to minimize the reservoir capacity used for flood control o2 and to minimize the flood diversion volume of the flood detention area o3 the complex flood control system composed of two cascade reservoirs four navigation power junctions one flood detection area and three flood control points in the ganjiang river basin of china constitutes the case study the results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the comprehensive benefits of the cascade reservoirs where the maximum reduction in objectives o1 o3 is 2071 m3 s the improvement rate is 2 64 219 million m3 the improvement rate is 44 60 and 167 million m3 the improvement rate is 78 13 respectively furthermore in contrast to the traditional multi attribute evaluation method the proposed framework can effectively identify compromised decisions through a cluster decomposition module which provides beneficial trade off guidance in making a sound decision upon pareto front options keywords flood control operation multi objective optimization cluster decomposition nsga ii k means

prominent effects on human lives and properties aerts et al 2014 li et al 2019 luo et al 2021 ridolfi et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the annual economic loss caused by floods exceeds 30 billion dollars worldwide roxy et al 2017 due to climate change and increasing human activities extreme precipitation events become more frequent and severe which will lead to more severe flood disasters peng et al 2017 zhou 2020 beylich et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 filipova et al 2022 water projects such as reservoirs flood detention areas and levees have been constructed and real time reservoir operation for flood control is considered to be an efficient non engineering countermeasure to alleviate flood stress along rivers huang et al 2022 labadie 2004 wang et al 2021 the traditional real time flood control operation of reservoirs follows the procedure involving 1 establishing a flood control operation model that consists of objectives and constraints to reflect the topological structure of reservoirs and flood control points 2 utilizing optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal results or pareto front alternatives according to reservoir inflow and 3 determining the final discharge scheme of reservoirs in consideration of flood forecast information and other factors li et al 2019 luo et al 2015 wei and hsu 2008 zhu et al 2017 therefore relevant research on flood control models optimization methods and operation scheme evaluation has been carried out jia et al 2015 explored a decomposition coordination model to optimize the real time flood control operation of a multi reservoir system li et al 2019 alleviated the curse of dimensionality encountered in a multi reservoir system s real time flood control operation by establishing a criteria system to assess the effect of flood control on reservoirs and identify effective reservoirs zhang et al 2019b presented a two tier analytical method to assess flood risks and evaluate the risk of real time flood control operation to cascade reservoirs meng et al 2019 proposed a framework that integrates real time flood control operation risk assessment and adjustment components of floodwater release to reduce the flood risk caused by the flood control operation of cascade reservoirs chen et al 2020 established a multi objective flood control risk management model to achieve the optimal real time operation of a parallel reservoir system yu et al 2022 proposed a reverse order impoundment method for cascade reservoirs which tackled the curse of dimensionality faced in reservoirs flood control operation over the yangtze river basin of china the models addressed above can improve the flood control effect of real time reservoir operation however it is still difficult to establish a generic model applicable to multi reservoir systems especially for the flood defense systems composed of cascade reservoirs multiple flood control points flood storage and other water projects to better guide decision makers or reservoir operators on regulating the discharge of reservoirs in practice researchers consider deriving optimal scheduling rules for reservoirs since flood control rules play an essential role in reservoir management kim et al 2021 currently the optimization of reservoir operation rules can be classified into two types implicit stochastic optimization iso and parameterization simulation optimization pso celeste and billib 2009 pan et al 2020 iso uses optimization methods to regulate reservoir discharge under several inflow scenarios and derives operation rules according to the optimal results obtained from regression methods such as the linear regression method karamouz and houck 1982 ostadrahimi et al 2012 as computing technology evolves artificial intelligence ai techniques machine learning algorithms and decision tree algorithms have been broadly used to derive reservoir operation rules in consideration of multiple objectives kumar et al 2013 liu et al 2019 tsai et al 2015 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 compared with the linear regression method these methods are capable of addressing the complex nonlinear relationship of decision variables water levels discharge processes etc and input variables inflow information however they require massive optimization results under different inflow scenarios to serve as input samples for developing rules without giving explicit expressions making them hard to apply in practice alternatively the pso predesigns the reservoir operating rules on the forms of parameters and optimizes the parameters by heuristic algorithms to obtain the optimal operation rules which alleviate the above issues and therefore gradually attracts more researchers attention zhang et al 2019a chang and chang 2009 employed the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to optimize the water supply rule curve of the feitsui shimen parallel reservoir system for minimizing storage indices and demonstrated the pareto front solutions could improve joint operational strategies wang et al 2011 explored a multi tier interactive genetic algorithm to optimize the water supply operation rules of the shimen reservoir for alleviating the optimization complexity of high dimensional variables caused by the long term operation fu et al 2016 adopted a genetic algorithm to optimize the flood control operation rules for a single reservoir system by defining the parameters of rules in response to the inflow and water levels of the reservoir zhang et al 2019a classified flood types by the predesigned parameters of flood classification aggregation decomposition operation rules and adopted the nsga ii to search pareto front solutions based on the trade offs of flood loss between the tributaries and the mainstream in addition implementing the iso or pso to derive or optimize the scheduling rules of the flood defense system is a multi objective problem which considers the coordinated operation of multiple reservoirs and the conflicting relationship between the reservoir flood control capacity and flood peak of flood control points the traditional procedure of the multi objective flood control operation usually includes i establishing a model ii applying an optimization algorithm to obtain pareto front solutions iii ranking the operational schemes and iv choosing an operational scheme jia et al 2016 this procedure usually selects only one option from multiple operational schemes but can t offer more options for different objectives the novelty of this study relies upon the optimization of the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs in a river basin using a multi objective cluster decomposition framework meanwhile its application for the first time to provide beneficial trade off information in making a sound decision upon alternative options main contributions can be attributed to three aspects first aiming at cascade reservoirs in a river basin a mathematical model is established to simultaneously tackle three objectives that minimize flood peak at the downstream sections the reservoir capacity used for flood control and the flood diversion volume of the flood detention area second a multi objective cluster decomposition framework consisting of multi objective optimization cluster decomposition and evaluation and sorting modules is proposed to optimize the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs and to analyze the coordinating and conflicting relationship among different objectives third three types of compromising decisions acquired from the pareto front solutions outperform the conventional flood control operation cfco rules in flood control effect and provide desired options to decision makers a complex flood control system in the ganjiang river basin of china forms a case study 2 methodology fig 1 presents the multi objective cluster decomposition framework proposed in this study which contains three modules related to multi objective optimization cluster decomposition as well as evaluation and sorting in the multi objective optimization module the nsga ii is employed to optimize the parameterized flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs to obtain pareto front solutions in the cluster decomposition module the pareto front solutions are petitioned into several clusters according to the corresponding fitness values by using the k means method in the evaluation and sorting module each cluster of pareto front solutions is assessed to acquire the optimal flood control operation ofco rules through the cumulative prospect theory cpt combined with the criteria importance given by intercriteria correlation critic and the entropy weight method ewm the methods adopted in this study are described as follows 2 1 mathematical model of flood control operation 2 1 1 multi objective functions a multi objective model is established for coping with three objectives to minimize the flood peaks of flood control points o1 to minimize the reservoir capacity used for flood control o2 and to minimize the flood diversion volume of the flood detention area o3 due to the complex system involving multi reservoirs in multi horizons a multi objective optimization algorithm is implemented to optimize the three objectives for reducing the

and ws t represent the water storage of the pth reservoir and the sth flood detention area at time t respectively qi max is the flood peak of the ith flood control point during period t of flood control operation vp max is the maximum capacity of the pth reservoir used for flood control operation ws max is maximum storage of the sth flood detention area and i p and s are the numbers of flood

and maximal water levels of the pth reservoir during flood control operation respectively 4 start and end water level limitation 7 z p 0 z p start z p t z p end where zp start and zp end represent the initial and final water levels of the pth reservoir respectively 5 flood routing constraints 8 q i t φ i o p t o p t 1 o p t τ i δ q i t where φi is the flood routing function between the pth reservoir at the upstream area and the ith flood control point at the downstream area τi is the time lag of the flood routing and δqi t is the lateral flow of the ith flood control point at time t the muskingum method gill 1978 is commonly used for flood routing calculation which is shown as follows 9 q k 1 t 1 c 0 k q k t 1 c 1 k q k t c 2 k q k 1 t δ q k t c 0 k c 1 k c 2 k 1 where qk t is the river flow of the kth channel segment at time t c 0 k c 1 k and c 2 k are the muskingum coefficients and δqk t is the lateral flow of the kth channel segment at time t 6 constraints of other water projects more and more different types of water projects constructed along the river have gradually made hydraulic connections more complicated some of them such as flood detention areas can reduce downstream flood peaks while some of them such as navigation power junctions and sluice gates are built for other applications rather than flood control operation the constraints of these water projects can be simulated according to the operation rules shown as follows 10 o n t ψ n i n t z n t where on t in t and zn t represent the outflow inflow and water level of the nth water project respectively and ψn is operation rules of the nth water project 7 boundary limitations of parameters for flood control operation rules are show below the reservoir cfco rules can be described as

lower limit for the inflow and the current water level of the pth reservoir respectively and i j p p up and z j p p up are the jp th level upper limit for the inflow and the current water level of the pth reservoir respectively in this study q j p p and i j p p low i j p p up are parameterized which commonly follow the constraints shown as follows 12 x j p p up min x j p p up x j p p up max x j p p

max are the boundary limitations of x j p p x j p p low min and x j p p low max are the boundary limitations of x j p p low and x j p p up min and x j p p up max are the boundary limitations of x j p p up 2 2 multi objective optimization module by virtue of the fast convergence of the uniform distribution of pareto front solutions the nsga ii proposed by deb et al 2000 is a mature intelligent algorithm capable of handling multi objective issues wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in this study three objectives o1 o3 as shown in equations 1 3 are selected in the multi objective mathematical model of flood control operation it is obvious that there is a conflictive relationship among the three objectives which indicates the improvement of o1 may lead to a reduction in the benefits of o2 or o3 therefore this study incorporates the nsga ii into the multi objective optimization module to obtain the pareto front strategies that balance the benefit among three objectives while quantifying the trade offs for satisfying different objectives the decision variables are x j p p x j p p low and x j p p up shown in equation 12 and the number of decision variables is p 1 p j 1 j p j p since chaos is known for its characteristics of ergodicity regularity and randomicity the one dimension logistic mapping model is implemented to generate initial solutions for enlarging the space of exploration and increasing the diversity of population xu and mei 2018 the one dimension logistic mapping model xu and mei 2018 can be described as follows 13 x i 1 j c 4 x i j c 1 x i j c x i j a j x i j c b j a j i 1 n j 1 r x i j c 0 1 where xi j c is the chaotic variable which falls between 0 and 1 n and r represent the numbers of populations and variables respectively xi j is the initial solution mapped from the chaotic variable xi j c which falls between aj and bj and aj and bj are lower and upper limitations for the jth variable respectively the processes of the nsga ii can be described as follows step 1 set up the parameters of the nsga ii including the maximal number of iterations k the crossover and mutation rates and the population size np the tournament selection is implemented as the selection operator step 2 set the iteration k 1 initialize the parent population p k x 1 1 1 x j p p 1 x 1 1 1 l o w x j p p 1 l o w x 1 1 1 u p x j p p 1 u p x 1 1 np x j p p np x 1 1 np l o w x j p p np l o w x 1 1 np u p x j p p np u p k based on the one dimension logistic mapping model as shown in equation 13 and each row of p k represent a set of solutions composed of x j p p x j p p low and x j p p up jp 1 2 jp then calculate their fitness values of o1 o3 through the mathematical model of flood control operation and rank each set of solutions in the population p k through the fast non dominated sorting step 3 apply the selection crossover and mutation operators to generate an offspring population q k of size np step 4 integrate populations p k and q k into a population r k of size 2np and rank each set of solutions in the population r k through the fast non dominated sorting and calculate their crowding distances deb et al 2002 step 5 choose the new parent population p k 1 of size np from the population r k and generate the offspring population q k 1 through the selection crossover and mutation operators calculate their fitness values of o1 o3 through the mathematical model of flood control operation and then k k 1 step 6 repeat steps 4 and 5 until iteration k achieves k the population size i e the number of individuals is set to be 200 different numbers of iterations such as 100 300 500 and 800 iterations were tested on the convergence effect it is found that the pareto front hardly varied when the number of iterations exceeded over 500 therefore the number of iterations is set to be 500 the crossover and mutation rates are set to be 0 8 and 0 1 respectively consequently the fitness values of o1 o3 shown in equations 1 3 to the pareto front solutions can be calculated by simulating flood control operation using the mathematical model which are used as inputs for the cluster decomposition module 2 3 cluster decomposition module the cluster decomposition module is applied to partitioning the fitness values of pareto front solutions into several clusters each cluster of fitness values reflects preferences for the corresponding objective the k means method with advantages of simplicity and fast convergence has been widely implemented in the fields of pattern detection signal processing and machine learning aytac 2020 feng et al 2019 jain et al 1999 sun et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 therefore it is adopted in this study the cluster decomposition processes are shown as follows step 1 arrange the fitness values into an l m matrix x with l samples and m objectives 14 x x 1 1 x 1 m x 2 1 x 2 m x l 1 x l m step 2 normalize matrix x to make it dimensionless 15 x i j x i j x j min x j max x j min x i j i s t h e b e n e f i t t y p e i n d e x x j max x i j x j max x j min x i j i s t h e c o s t t y p e i n d e x where x i j is the normalized index and x j min and x j max are the minimal and maximal values of the jth column respectively step 3 determine the number of clusters and randomly generate initial cluster centroids considering the number of objectives is m the cluster number is preset to be m then the initial centroids can be denoted as u u 1 u m u m here u m x m 1 x m m t step 4 calculate the distance between objects and centroids 16 f u x m 1 m l 1 l d u m x l m 2 d u m x l m m 1 m u m x l m 2 step 5 update the centroids u and repeat steps 3 and 4 until minimizing the f u x then the centroids u arg min f u x and the pareto front solutions are partitioned into m clusters through the k means method the clusters of fitness values are obtained to serve as inputs for the evaluation and sorting module 2 4 evaluation and sorting module the evaluation and sorting module is used to assess and rank the fitness values for choosing the ofco rules of each cluster since the fitness values of pareto front solutions are partitioned into m clusters m types of ofco rules with preferences for the corresponding objectives can be provided to decision makers the cpt proposed by tversky and kahneman 1992 is applicable to addressing multi attribute issues and has been widely utilized in finance decision making risk management and scheme evaluation gurtler and stolpe 2017 zhao et al 2018 therefore it is applied in this module and the procedure is described as follows step 1 establish a normalized decision matrix for the mth cluster the decision matrix x m x i j l m m is normalized by equation 15 and denoted as u m u i j l m m step 2 determine positive and negative ideal solutions as reference points according to the following equation 17 a max i 1 l m u i j j j min i 1 l m u i j j j u 1 u 2 u j u m a min i 1 l m u i j j j max i 1 l m u i j j j u 1 u 2 u j u m where a and a are positive ideal and negative ideal schemes respectively j and j represent the subscript sets for benefit type and cost type indices respectively and uj and uj represent the positive and negative ideal values of the jth index respectively step 3 establish the gray correlation coefficient matrix 18 r i j min i 1 l m min j 1 m u i j u j ρ max i 1 l m max j 1 m u i j u j u i j u j ρ max i 1 l m max j 1 m u i j u j r i j min i 1 l m min j 1 m u i j u j ρ max i 1 l m max j 1 m u i j u j u i j u j ρ max i 1 l m max j 1 m u i j u j where ri j and ri j represent the positive and negative gray correlation coefficients respectively and ρ is the resolution coefficient commonly equal to 0 5 step 4 establish the positive and negative prospect value matrices according to the value function of the prospect theory 19 v v 1 1 v 1 m v 2 1 v 1 m v i j v i m v l m 1 v l m m 20 v v 1 1 v 1 m v 2 1 v 1 m v i j v i m v l m 1 v l m m where vi j and vi j are positive and negative prospect values respectively which are calculated as follows 21 v i j 1 r i j α v i j θ r i j 1 β where θ α and β are the coefficients of the loss aversion risk preference and risk aversion respectively the values of these coefficients are obtained according to luo et al 2021 i e θ 2 25 and α β 0 88 step 5 establish the prospect theory model 22 max v i 1 l m j 1 m v i j π ω j i 1 l m j 1 m v i j π ω j where ωj is the weight coefficient for the jth index ωj min and ωj max are the lower and upper boundary limitations of ωj respectively and π and π are the weighting functions for gains and losses which can be calculated as follows 23 π ω j ω j γ ω j γ 1 ω j γ 1 γ π ω j ω j γ ω j γ 1 ω j γ 1 γ where γ and γ describe the concave and convex curvatures of the functions commonly γ 0 61 and γ 0 69 to determine ωj min and ωj max the critic diakoulaki et al 1995 and ewm juang and huang 1992 are applied to the normalized matrix um to obtain weight coefficients 24 ω j min min ω j critic ω j ewm ω j max max ω j critic ω j ewm where ωj critic and ωj ewm are weight coefficients of the jth index for the normalized matrix um using the critic and ewm respectively step 6 solve the above model by the genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 and obtain the optimal weight coefficients ω ω 1 ω 2 ωm then the optimal prospect value of each scheme can be calculated as follows 25 v i j 1 m v i j π ω j j 1 m v i j π ω j where vi is the optimal prospect value of the ith scheme all the schemes are sorted according to the value of vi vi with a larger value means the corresponding scheme is better than the others the aforementioned steps are repeated until all the clusters are evaluated and the ofco rules of each cluster are obtained 3 study area and materials the ganjiang river with a length of 766 km is one of the five main tributaries of the poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china the basin area of the ganjiang river is 83 500 km2 which accounts for nearly half the area of the jiangxi province in china therefore the ganjiang river has a significant impact on the socioeconomic development of the jiangxi province flood hazards have occurred every 3 5 years on average in the ganjiang river basin since the 1950s which has damaged human lives and properties in 2010 flood disasters happened in the ganjiang river basin due to a heavy rainstorm which affected over 7 6 million residents and resulted in direct losses exceeding 2 billion u s dollars a flood defense system has been constructed in the middle and lower reaches of the ganjiang rive for coping with flood threats fig 2 illustrates the flood defense system which contains cascade reservoirs a flood detention area navigation power junctions and flood control points the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs are the two largest reservoirs in the jiangxi province and their joint flood storage capacity achieves 1 17 billion m3 the navigation power junctions are constructed mainly for inland water transportation and power generation and no flood storage capacity is reserved therefore the operation of navigation power junctions influences flood routing between upstream and downstream channel segments but hardly affects downstream flood peaks the quangang flood detention area located in the lower reach of the ganjiang river is constructed for alleviating the flood stress of the downstream areas by storing flood the characteristic parameters of these water projects are listed in table 1 the river channel is divided into eight channel segments by water projects and lateral flow according to fig 2 in this study it is assumed that the hydraulic system responds to the equations of the mathematical flood model the calibrated parameters of the hydraulic equations are provided by the jiangxi academy of water science and engineering comprehensive planning of ganjiang river basin 2015 table 2 lists the muskingum parameters of each channel segment and the calculation time step is 6 h according to this comprehensive planning for the design floods with 200 year return periods and or shorter ones the quangang flood detention area doesn t divert flood water therefore in this study based on the characteristics of the flood region composition four typical flood hydrographs shown in fig a1 which are 1973 representing the upstream type 1982 representing the downstream type and 1968 and 1992 typical floods representing the whole basin type are employed to derive the design floods with 300 year and 500 year return periods using the peak and volume amplitude method xiao et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 the ofco rules acquired from the 300 year design floods are applied to the 500 year design floods to verify the applicability of the proposed framework 4 results and discussion the cfco rules of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs are parameterized as decision variables in tables 3 and 4 respectively the boundary limits of these variables are presented in table 5 the values of variables set in the cfco rules comprehensively consider the reservoirs characteristics and the requirements of flood control operation therefore the original values of variables x 1 x 13 are subject to a certain sort order for example the sort order for the original values of variables x 7 x 9 is x 7 x 8 x 9 and the differences of these variables are 1500 2000 given this the boundary limits of these variables presented in table 5 cannot be set very large the variation ranges of variables x 1 x 13 in table 5 can be divided into three categories the first kind including variables x 1 x 4 and x 13 has large search spaces of 2000 the second kind including variables x 3 x 5 x 6 and x 10 x 12 have moderate search spaces which are equal to 2000 the third kind with small search spaces of 2000 includes variables x 2 and x 7 x 9 4 1 results of multi objective flood control operation the pareto front solutions of the multi objective flood control operation obtained from the nsga ii concerning the 300 year design floods calculated based on the typical floods in 1968 1972 1982 and 1992 are shown in fig 3 to better display the distribution pattern of the pareto front a surface is interpolated from these discrete pareto front points for each design flood besides the results of three objectives created by the cfco are also displayed in comparison with the pareto front solutions in fig 3 a the distribution of pareto points displays a tri layers phenomenon from the top layer to the bottom one the flood peak of flood control points o1 decreases as the other two objectives o2 o3 increase which demonstrates the competitive relationship between the flood peak of flood control points the coordinated operation of the cascade reservoirs and the flood detention area that is to say larger reservoir capacity used for flood control o2 and more flood diversion of the flood detention area o3 can make smaller flood peaks of flood control points o1 in fig 3 b and 3 c the distributions of pareto points for the design floods based on 1973 and 1982 typical floods are similar for the designed flood based on the 1973 typical flood the pareto points are formed into an upward convex curve while the pareto points of the designed flood based on the 1982 typical flood are shaped into a downward concave curve in fig 3 d the pareto front of the designed flood based on the 1992 typical flood is similar to an inclined triangular plane and the range of the flood peak is from 7 62 104 m3 s to 7 68 104 m3 s which is narrower than that of the other design floods in addition it is found that the points of cfco rules stay far away from the pareto front in fig 3 a 3 b and 3 d especially for the design floods based on 1968 and 1992 typical floods shown in fig 3 a and 3 d where the flood peak regulated by the cfco rules is larger than that of pareto front solutions this means that the pareto front solutions can achieve better flood control effects with larger flood peak reductions and smaller reservoir capacities used for flood control but a smaller flood diversion volume than the cfco rules to illustrate the multi objective optimization for the cfco rules table 6 compares the values of objective functions between the nsga ii and the cfco rules the values of the nsga ii in table 6 are the average fitness values of pareto front solutions it appears that the pareto front solutions acquired by the nsga ii outperform the cfco rules at minimizing three objectives except for the designed flood based on 1982 flood the pareto front solutions can simultaneously decrease the outcomes of the three objectives averagely reduce 0 55 2 55 of o1 0 94 6 19 of o2 and 10 52 51 40 of o3 compared with those of the cfco rules for the designed flood based on the 1982 typical flood the average of o3 of the pareto front solutions is 0 51 billion m3 which is more than that of the cfco rules but causes a decrease of 12 45 in o2 the lateral flow from downstream of the wan an reservoir in 1982 is the largest than those of all design floods thereby more flood diversion volume is used for reducing the flood peaks of flood control points 4 2 results of cluster cluster decomposition for pareto front solutions since the study has three objectives the cluster number is set to be three the cluster decomposition module partitions the pareto front solutions into three clusters with a certain preference for the objective which are identified as clusters i ii and iii fig 4 shows the cluster decomposition results for the 300 year design floods based on 1968 1973 1982 and 1992 typical floods which are taken as an instance for illustration in fig 4 the o2 and o3 are selected as x and y axes respectively meanwhile the colors of pareto front points reflect the o1 the clusters of pareto front points are distinguished according to the fitness values of o1 o3 the pareto front points with the similar fitness values are partitioned into the same cluster by the k means method which indicates that these points to the corresponding ofco rules have the similar flood control effect fig 4 a displays the cluster decomposition results for the design floods based on the 1968 typical flood cluster i is the gathering of pareto front points with larger o1 7 34 104 m3 s 7 38 104 m3 s and smaller o2 9 49 108 m3 10 27 108 m3 cluster ii is the assembly of pareto front points with the characteristics of smaller o3 0 42 108 m3 0 96 108 m3 and larger o2 10 34 108 m3 11 10 108 m3 cluster iii with the phenomenon of layers is the aggregation of pareto front points with smaller o1 7 31 104 m3 s 7 33 104 m3 s as well as larger o2 10 24 108 m3 11 10 108 m3 and o3 0 97 108 m3 1 73 108 m3 the results of the cluster decomposition module for the other design floods are shown in fig 4 b to d the distribution of the pareto front solutions for various floods differs greatly for the design floods based on the 1973 and 1982 typical floods shown in fig 4 b and c the pareto front solutions display a linear distribution the smaller flood peak is accompanied with a more reservoir capacity used for flood control but a less diversion volume and vice versa for the designed flood based on the 1992 typical flood the points of the pareto front solutions present a v shape distribution in fig 4 d the points of the blue portion form a line nearly parallel to the y axis where the flood peak decreases as the diversion volume increases the points of clusters i and iii in fig 4 d constitute an oblique line that presents the complementary effect of the flood peak reduction between o2 and o3 where the flood peak hardly varies however o3 decreases from 2 54 108 m3 to 1 48 108 m3 with the increase in o2 from 11 30 108 m3 to 12 06 108 m3 to illustrate the characteristic preferences of pareto front solutions in each cluster table 7 lists the average objective values of pareto front solutions according to table 7 the average objective values in each cluster indicate the preference of the cluster for the corresponding objective taking the designed flood based on the 1968 typical flood as an example the average of o1 in cluster iii is minimal due to the largest average of the diversion volume and a larger reservoir flood storage capacity compared with those of the other clusters this means that the pareto front solutions in cluster iii have the preference for o1 similarly for the designed flood based on the 1968 typical flood the pareto front solutions in cluster ii with the minimal average diversion volume are inclined to minimize o3 and those in cluster i are inclined to minimizing reservoir capacity used for flood control additionally a similar analysis can be applied to the other design floods 4 3 results of pareto front solution sorting and selection the ofco rules of each cluster are determined through the evaluation and sorting module the ofco rules of three clusters for the 300 year design floods are listed in table 8 the three optimization objectives are presented furthermore the power generation indicator pgi risk indicator ri and vulnerability indicator vi are also introduced for the comparative analysis of the flood control effect of the ofco rules and cfco rules the definitions of pgi ri and vi are listed in appendix performance indicators the differences between the cfco rules and ofco rules on three optimization objectives and the aforementioned indicators for the 300 year floods are listed in table 9 in addition the ofco rules in table 8 are applied to regulating the 500 year design floods and the corresponding results are listed in table 10 in table 8 x1 x 6 are the cfco rule variables of the wan an reservoir and x 7 x 13 are those of the xiajiang reservoir combined with the variation ranges of parameters in table 5 it is found that the values of variables in the ofco rules are not close to the upper or lower boundary limit for most clusters in different design floods that is to say the search spaces of variables are set adequate for the multi objective flood control optimization variables x 3 and x 10 x 12 with moderate search spaces occur in the late rising period preceding the inflow peak of the ofco rules which mainly influence the peak reduction of reservoirs variables x 1 and x 13 with large search spaces mainly affect the inflow reduction because they occur in the early rising period of the ofco rules of the wan an reservoir and the recession period of the ofco rules of the xiajiang reservoir respectively variables with small search spaces such as x 7 x 9 occur in the early rising period of the ofco rules of the xiajiang reservoir on the whole variables with large and small search spaces mainly affect the reservoir storage and water levels before and after the inflow peak respectively while those with moderate search spaces can reduce the flood peak of the reservoir to certain extent in table 9 for the 300 year design floods based on 1968 1973 and 1992 nearly all the ofco rules of each cluster achieve better flood control effects with smaller values of optimization objectives o1 can be reduced by up to 2071 m3 s with the improvement rate of 2 64 when using the ofco rules of cluster ii for the 300 year design flood based on 1992 for the 300 year design flood based on 1982 flood the ofco rules of cluster iii can be decreased by 2 19 108 m3 the corresponding improvement rate is 44 60 of o2 which is the maximum value the maximum decrease of o3 is achieved by the ofco rules of cluster ii for the 300 year design flood based on 1968 which is 1 67 108 m3 with the improvement rate of 78 13 the ri and vi of ofco rules for most of the design floods are obviously smaller than those of the cfco rules which means the ofco rules can reduce the flood defense system s flood control risk and vulnerability for example the minimum values of ri and vi are 0 when using the ofco rules of cluster i for the 300 year design flood based on 1973 as for pgi the differences between the ofco rules and cfco rules are small for the same design flood hydropower generation ranges from 2 42 108 to 3 14 108 kw h for different 300 year design floods the ofco rules of a specific cluster reveal a preference for the corresponding objective for example in table 9 for the designed flood based on 1968 flood the ofco rules of cluster i are more concerned about the safe operation of reservoirs since the minimum reservoir capacity is utilized to achieve the minimum flood peak reduction compared with the ofco rules of the other clusters the ofco rules of cluster ii concentrate more on minimizing o3 and the utilization of the flood storage capacity is the largest among those of all clusters the ofco rules of cluster iii focus more on the flood control effect so a more diversion volume and a more reservoir flood capacity are used to reduce downstream flood peaks a similar analysis can be applied to the other design floods listed in the last column of table 9 compared with the traditional multi objective reservoir operation the results in table 9 reveal the objective evaluation of ofco rules and provide decision makers with desired options on flood control operation of reservoirs the variables of the cfco rules in tables 3 and 4 can be replaced with the ofco rules of a particular preference in table 8 if the decision makers concentrate more on the flood control effect minimizing flood peak of the flood control points the ofco rules that have a preference for o1 can be accepted if they care more about the safe operation of water projects minimizing the maximum flood storage capacity of reservoirs or the diversion volume of the flood detention area the ofco rules that prefer o2 or o3 can be adopted the results in table 10 further verify the applicability of the ofco rules to the other design floods in table 10 for the 500 year design floods the values of o1 o2 o3 ri and vi become more prominent which means greater flood control stress when applying the ofco rules in table 8 the values of o1 ri and vi are smaller than those of the cfco rules for most of the design floods this indicates that the flood control risk and stress can be further decreased by the ofco rules however for o2 and o3 the results of ofco rules are little worse than those of the cfco rules especially for the design floods based on the 1968 and 1992 typical floods this is related to flood types since the 1968 and 1992 typical floods represent the whole basin type floods when they are magnified to larger design floods the lateral flow becomes larger compared with that of the upstream type or downstream type floods therefore the better effect of flood control on reducing the values of o1 ri and vi needs a larger reservoir flood control capacity to divert the flood volume leading to increasing the values of o2 and o3 the variation of the pgi ranges from 2 44 108 to 3 13 108 kw h which is not significantly different from that of the 300 year design floods this is because the inflow of the reservoirs and navigation power junctions is so large that the hydropower generation plants are at the full load capacity during the flood control operation overall the ofco rules can be applied to other design floods for improving the flood control effect of the cfco rules 4 4 operation processes of the ofco and cfco rules since the designed flood based on 1992 has large o1 o2 ri and vi values it is selected for further analyzing the operation processes of reservoirs and flood hydrographs at the flood control points fig 5 shows the comparison of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs using the ofco rules of cluster iii and cfco rules for the 300 year designed flood based on 1992 fig 6 shows the comparison of the flood hydrographs at the flood control points under the conditions of the natural regime no flood control operation ofco and cfco rules fig 5 a and b show that the maximum water levels of the wan an reservoir using the cfco and ofco rules are similar which are close to 94 6 m the maximum discharge of the ofco rules is also close to that of the cfco rules in fig 5 c and d being affected by the regulation of the wan an reservoir the maximum inflow of the xiajiang reservoir with the ofco rules is 610 m3 s which is less than that of the cfco rules therefore the ofco rules can reduce the maximum discharge of the xiajiang reservoir by 2706 m3 s which is more than that of the cfco rules besides the maximum water level of the xiajiang reservoir with the ofco rules is 0 2 m which is lower than that of the cfco rules thus the ofco rules can utilize a less flood control capacity to achieve a larger flood peak reduction than the cfco rules in fig 6 a compared with the natural regime the occurrence time of the flood peak at the ji an flood control point is delayed from the 32nd time period to the 43rd using the ofco rules and 44th time periods using the cfco rules in fig 6 b the flood peak at the shishang flood control point can be reduced to 24000 m3 s when using the ofco rules which is equal to its safety flow in fig 6 c the flood peaks of the cfco and ofco rules at the waizhou flood control point are close to each other i e about 3400 m3 s which is less than that of the natural regime compared with the cfco rules the ofco rules are more efficient in utilizing the flood control capacity and the flood diversion volume as well as improving the flood control effect especially in decreasing the flood peak of the shishang flood control point for the designed flood based on the 1992 typical flood 5 conclusions as more and more water projects such as reservoirs levees and flood detention areas have been implemented in river basins the collaborative operation of the flood defense system in consideration of flood peak reduction and flood water storage can be defined as a multi objective issue therefore it is crucial to determine a flood control operation scheme that makes trade offs between the safety of flood control points and water projects for flood management the traditional multi attribute evaluation method selects one scheme from multiple operation schemes but fails to provide more types of objective oriented ofco rules which may not match decision makers preferences this study aims to effectively identify multi objective flood control operation schemes for achieving the collaborative operation of multiple reservoirs in a flood defense system a multi objective cluster decomposition framework is proposed for optimizing the flood control operation rules of cascade reservoirs in a river basin through simultaneously tackling the minimum flood peaks of flood control points the minimum reservoir capacity used for flood control and the minimum flood diversion volume of the flood detention area a flood control system composed of two cascade reservoirs three flood control points four navigation power junctions and one flood detention area in the middle and lower reaches of the ganjiang river in china is selected as a case study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 for the 300 year design floods the multi objective cluster decomposition framework can significantly improve the performance of the cfco rules of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs with reductions in flood peaks reservoir capacities used for flood control and the diversion volume of the flood detention area reaching 2071 m3 s 2 18 108 m3 and 1 67 108 m3 respectively the ri and vi of the ofco rules are smaller than those of the cfco rules which indicates the ofco rules can improve the flood control vulnerability and risk for multi reservoir systems the differences in pgi between the ofco and cfco rules are minor with variations from 2 42 108 kw h to 3 14 108 kw h 2 the 500 year design floods are selected to verify the ofco rules applicability compared with the cfco rules ri and vi could be decreased by the ofco rules with a larger reservoir capacity used for flood control and a larger flood diversion volume of the flood detention area in addition the ranges of pgi are close to those of the 300 year design floods 3 the traditional multi objective reservoir operation selects one operation scheme from the pareto front solutions by using the multi attribute evaluation method in contrast the proposed framework can offer more ofco rules that prefer specific objectives as a result the ofco rules outperform the cfco rules of the wan an and xiajiang reservoirs in balancing the benefits of the three objectives therefore decision makers can choose the ofco rules subject to particular objectives the study selects design floods to verify how the proposed framework affects the optimization of the cfco rules for reservoirs the corresponding ofco rules can be obtained if the flood hydrograph is available in practice however this study does not take the uncertainty in reservoir operation and flood forecasting into account future research may consider the transferability of uncertainty when optimizing the cfco rules of reservoirs which can further improve flood risk management of the flood defense system credit authorship contribution statement di zhu data curation investigation conceptualization

like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that greatly contributed to improving the manuscript appendix performance indicators the excess flood volume originated from the water volume exceeding the safety flow of flood control points causes flood damages larger stream flow increases the flood control risk and vulnerability of the flood defense system which endangers human lives and properties in this study the risk indicator ri and vulnerability indicator vi are used for the comparative analysis of the flood control performance for the ofco and cfco rules dau and adeloye 2021 the risk indicator ri is defined as the ratio of the number of occasions when the stream flow exceeds the safety flow to the total number of time periods the vulnerability indicator vi is to measure the impact of the flood peak at the flood control points and is estimated as the ratio of the excessive water volume to the safety flow in addition since there are navigation power junctions in the case study the power generation indicator pgi is defined as the hydropower generation during the flood control operation these indicators are calculated as follows a1 pgi p 1 p t 1 t n p t δ t a2 ri max t 1 t f q 1 t t t 1 t f q i t t t 1 t f q i t t 100 a3 vi max q 1 max q 1 s q 1 s q i max q i s q i s q i max q i s q i s 100 where np t is the average hydropower generation of the pth reservoir at time t qi s is the safety flow of the ith flood control point and f qi t is the function to count the time periods when stream flow exceeds the safety flow at the ith flood control point which can be calculated as follows a4 f q i t 1 q i t q i s 0 q i t q i s the typical flood hydrographs the four typical flood hydrographs adopted in this study are displayed in fig a1 it is shown that the peak value and the magnitude of the 1982 typical flood at the wan an reservoir are obviously smaller than those of the other typical floods in the downstream flood control points of the wan an reservoir the 1982 typical flood becomes larger and its peak values at the shishang and waizhou flood control points are bigger than those of 1973 and 1992 typical floods this means that the lateral flow at the downstream areas accounts for a larger proportion of the 1982 typical flood for the 1973 typical flood the shapes of flood hydrographs at upstream and downstream are similar displaying the bimodal types and the differences of peak values in fig a1 a d are slight this indicates that the magnitude of the later flow in the downstream area of the wan an reservoir is not too large for the 1973 typical flood for the 1968 and 1992 typical floods the shapes of flood hydrographs vary a lot in the upstream and downstream areas which represent the whole basin type floods 
2787,groundwater is the main water source for agricultural irrigation in arid semi arid agricultural region overexploitation of groundwater inevitably leads to permanent loss of aquifer and ground subsidence the oasis agricultural area in the southern junggar basin jsoaa is one of the largest oasis agricultural areas in western china in this study we for the first time recover the regional scale ground displacements time series of jsoaa using all alos 1 palsar 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 2015 2020 data the results show that there are multiple subsidence areas related to groundwater overexploitation from 2007 to 2010 the area with a subsidence rate greater than 10 mm yr is about 5876 2 km2 accounting for 13 2 of the total area of jsoaa from 2015 to 2020 these values are about 16146 7 km2 and 36 3 in the areas with concentrated groundwater exploitation the small separate subsidence areas grew larger and became connected and finally developed into giant subsidence clusters the maximum cumulative deformation of jsoaa exceeded 400 mm from 2007 to 2010 and 500 mm from 2015 to 2020 we modeled the surface subsidence caused by the permanent aquifer loss and estimated the volume strain of aquifer in jsoaa the total volume strain of the aquifer is 2 73 km3 between 2007 and 2020 moreover we estimated the aquifer storage coefficient and the net groundwater deficit of jsoaa the results of this study will serve for jsoaa aquifer health detection ecological environment stability assessment and sustainable development of the agricultural economy keywords junggar basin oasis planting overexploitation of groundwater time series insar subsidence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of the irrigation water in agricultural planting areas with few surface water resources especially in the flat alluvial basins formed by unconsolidated sediments and the urban or agricultural areas developed in temperate or arid climates with prolonged dry periods herrera garcía et al 2021 the huge demand for freshwater leads to long term overpumping of groundwater in these areas groundwater overpumping will cause permanent damage to the aquifer and irreversible surface settlement which reduce the water storage capacity of the aquifer system cause earth fissures damage buildings and may trigger a series of geological disasters such as microearthquakes and floods foulger et al 2018 gonzález et al 2012 hoffmann et al 2003 therefore in such regions it is important to monitor the groundwater overpumping related ground settlement and conduct aquifer damage identification and geological disaster assessment xinjiang china is located in the arid semi arid temperate climate zone it has a large number of irrigated agricultural planting areas which were mostly developed after 2000 following the policy of the development of the western region in china junggar basin located in northern xinjiang is the second largest inland basin in china one of the largest oasis agricultural growing areas in western china is distributed on the southern area of junggar basin with an area of 4 45 104 km2 hereafter this area is named as the oasis agricultural area in the southern junggar basin jsoaa the jsoaa is the most densely populated and active region in xinjiang du et al 2013 feng et al 2013 published the gravity anomaly of the terrestrial water storage changes in china and surrounding regions obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data from 2003 to 2010 the large scale gravity anomaly data show there is a large area of water deficit region in the area near tien shan including the jsoaa although the development of the agricultural economy and the caused net loss of aquifers in the jsoaa have been paid much attention the monitoring of regional scale deformation and the investigation of aquifer deficit in this area are rarely reported with the rapid development of the jsoaa s agricultural economy in recent years it is necessary to use wide area deformation monitoring technologies to trackback the ground subsidence history in jsoaa and make modeling and quantitative analysis on groundwater overexploitation status considering local hydrogeological conditions to evaluate the health of aquifers and the sustainable potential of the agricultural economy in jsoaa interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar an active remote sensing technique can obtain millimeter accuracy and high spatio temporal resolution of surface deformation hanssen 2001 osmanoğlu et al 2016 xue et al 2020 insar has achieved great achievements in geodesy and remote sensing fields such as earthquake volcanic eruption glacier movement urban surface subsidence and mining subsidence li et al 2017 ma et al 2019 massonnet et al 1993 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2015 ground displacements in an arid agricultural area are usually caused by the change of head pressure of regional aquifer induced by exploitation recharge of groundwater galloway et al 1998 first applied insar to monitor the ground subsidence over an aquifer system in antelope valley california and explained the observed subsidence as aquifer system compaction since then insar has been widely used in monitoring and modeling the ground subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation some scholars used insar to monitor the land subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation or overexploitation at regional or valley scale and analyzed the spatio temporal evolution of land subsidence and the relationship with geological structures chaussard et al 2014 dong et al 2021 hoffmann et al 2001 hu and bürgmann 2020 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2022 some built physical models of groundwater head and aquifer volume change to estimate the spatially varying compaction time constants elastic inelastic specific skeletal storage coefficients long term decay coefficient using the information of ground subsidence and groundwater head height by geodetic means such as insar and leveling chen et al 2016b hoffmann et al 2003 hu et al 2018 reeves et al 2014 smith et al 2017 at present from the perspective of geodesy the studies on groundwater overexploitation and ground subsidence monitoring in jsoaa mainly used a few local and short term measured data of wells or insar he 2019 kan et al 2019 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2020a there are still no quantitative and systematic research results on the spatio temporal evolution of ground subsidence and groundwater overexploitation at a regional scale in jsoaa in other words the current status of aquifer material deficit and ground subsidence at the regional scale of the jsoaa is still unknown in this paper we collected all available alos 1 palsar data 13 tracks and 28 frames 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 data 6 tracks 2015 2020 covering the whole jsoaa then an improved regional scale time series insar processing strategy is adopted to process all the insar datasets the insar deformation results of jsoaa along the radar line of sight los and vertical directions are obtained combining the insar deformation results with the spatio temporal distribution of the agricultural planting areas the seasonal groundwater exploitation information and the geological structure we quantitatively analyze the spatio temporal evolution characteristics and the area of subsidence caused by groundwater overpumping and the relationships between ground subsidence geological structure and human activities finally an analytical model of the volume strain of the aquifer is established based on the subsidence and hydrogeological data of jsoaa the storage coefficient and the net loss of aquifer from 2007 to 2020 are estimated 2 the geological setting of jsoaa the junggar basin is an ancient platform located in the south of the paleo asian ocean tectonic domain and is an important part of the central asian orogenic belt junggar basin is at the northern foot of tien shan and has been formed since hercynian after plate reengineering since the late paleozoic li et al 2015 there are many uplift and depression units due to tectonic movement and geological deposition and many faults are distributed among the strata fig 1 a he et al 2018 the east west geological profile of the trans junggar basin shows thick argillic sandstones and mudstones in the shallow crust of the basin the basin center is thicker than the edge fig 1 c we collected a hydrogeological profile model with a north south distribution across the manas river basin fig 1 b it is denoted by the black dotted line in fig 1 a the model presents the spatial distribution of hydrogeology and groundwater transport routes in the jsoaa as can be seen from fig 1 b aquifers in the junggar basin are mainly divided into two layers submerged aquifers with a depth of about 200 m below the surface and confined aquifers with a depth of more than 200 m the head height of submerged aquifers is relatively shallow usually less than 100 m as marked by the blue line in fig 1 b wang 2020 the junggar basin has an arid semi arid temperate continental climate it has stable snow fall in winter the water vapor in the basin mainly comes from the westerly flow winter and spring precipitation account for 30 45 of the annual total after frequent conversion surface water and groundwater flow into oasis agricultural areas in the form of surface water subsurface flow and bedrock lateral runoff atmospheric precipitation is extremely scarce in the central plain and the northern desert where the evaporation is strong siltstone and silty clay are the main lithologies in the desert low plains and the lower part of the plain therefore seepage of surface water such as river infiltration irrigation infiltration and channel leakage is the main recharge source of groundwater in these areas of which irrigation infiltration and channel leakage can occupy more than 40 of the total recharge of groundwater the vadose zone the stratum between the surface of the groundwater and the surface of the earth in these areas dissipates a lot in evaporation during the infiltration process therefore it is difficult to form an effective recharge for groundwater artificial exploitation and plant transpiration are the main ways of groundwater excretion accounting for 63 and 25 of the total groundwater excretion respectively wang 2020 the deficit and recharge of the groundwater have obvious seasonality they occur almost at the same time which jointly affects the dynamic balance of regional groundwater by 2018 xinjiang had an agricultural region of 5 24 106 ha of which 4 98 106 ha are irrigated land accounting for 95 of the total gao and han 2019 irrigation water relies heavily on the groundwater from subaqueous aquifers agricultural water has long accounted for more than 95 of xinjiang s total water consumption jsoaa as shown by the yellow line in fig 1 is the main agricultural area in the junggar basin and one of the largest agricultural planting areas in western china in recent 20 years the agricultural economy in this region has developed rapidly jsoaa has become an important grain production base in xinjiang and the main cotton production base in china since the beginning of the 21st century the scale of agricultural irrigation has been expanding agricultural water is increasingly crowding out ecological water which endangers the fragile ecological environment zhang et al 2021 the regional scale long term groundwater extraction results in the decline of groundwater levels in plain areas the natural dynamic changes of groundwater have been replaced by the dynamic changes caused by groundwater exploitation the wet period has become the dry period and the original dry period has become the recovery period of groundwater level du et al 2013 all rivers within jsoaa are inland rivers which end up in the low lying part of jsoaa and disappear in the irrigated area jsoaa is mainly surrounded by ebinur lake and manas lake due to the diversion of water to the irrigation area the water into the lake has been sharply reduced at present manas lake has dried up and the water area of ebinur lake has also been reduced 3 insar data and methods 3 1 alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 sar data over jsoaa to conduct comprehensive monitoring for the regional scale ground subsidence in jsoaa we collected a total of 1116 sar images covering the whole region of jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 including alos 1 palsar data of 13 ascending tracks and 28 frames 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 data of 4 ascending tracks and 2 descending tracks 2015 2020 table 1 among them the ascending alos 1 palsar and ascending sentinel 1 data achieved full coverage of jsoaa due to the short time coverage the descending sentinel 1 data in the western part of jsoaa is not processed e g dt92 and dt165 the coverage of all insar data used in this study is shown in fig 2 3 2 retrieval of time series los displacements to obtain the ts insar displacements we first selected a sar image from insar data of each frame as the master image and registered and re sampled the other images under the same frame to the spatial reference system of the master image then by setting the spatio temporal baseline threshold i e 1500 m and 900 days for alos 1 palsar data and 100 m and 36 days for sentinel 1 data we obtain the multi temporal insar pairs under each frame the reference point in each frame is selected in the built up area far from agricultural regions the two pass differential insar dinsar approach is applied to process the insar pairs zebker et al 1994 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 1 arcsec resolution farr et al 2007 is employed to remove the topographic phases the multi looking operations range azimuth 7 16 and 20 4 are applied to suppress the decorrelation noise in the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 datasets respectively all of the small baseline insar pairs in the datasets are sequentially processed by an improved interferometric point target analysis ipta method wang et al 2021b the achieved resolution of the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 datasets after geocoding are about 50 m and 56 m respectively monitoring regional scale deformation usually uses multiple tracks and or frames sar images to fully cover the target region so one point may have two or more deformation values in the overlapping area this will bother the subsequent deformation interpretation especially for non expert users we choose the best and the denser set of measurements from one of the frames and only a single piece of information is kept in the overlapping areas costantini et al 2017 to generate the overall los displacements of jsoaa 3 3 estimation of the overall vertical deformation studies have shown that the change of aquifer head is coupled with ground subsidence chen et al 2016b hoffmann 2003 miller et al 2017 which makes us more interested in the vertical observation from insar however the insar monitored deformation is the projection of the three dimensional 3 d surface deformation of vertical d u east west d e and north south d n directions into los direction d los hu et al 2014 i e 1 d los cos θ i d u sin θ i cos α i d e sin θ i sin α i d n θ i and α i represent the radar incidence and flight direction angles at the i th point of the frames respectively fig 3 as the sar satellites fly along the near polar orbit their monitoring results are less sensitive to the north south deformation therefore the contribution of d n to d los is usually low and can be ignored fig 3 we can calculate the surface deformations along the vertical and east west directions using the ascending and descending insar data with the same acquisition time samsonov and d oreye 2012 samsonov et al 2014 i e 2 d los asc cos θ asc i d u sin θ asc i cos α asc i d e d los des cos θ des i d u sin θ des i cos α des i d e if no ascending descending tracks insar data were acquired at the same time the above method does not work for example the west part of jsoaa is well covered by the sentinel 1 ascending data in the study period but the corresponding descending data is not available fig 2 in such case we usually ignore the contribution of horizontal movement d e and d n to los deformation fig 3 and transform the los deformation into the vertical direction smith et al 2017 by 3 d los cos θ i d u by introducing insar data with different observation geometry to solve the vertical deformation we can get the vertical deformation with higher accuracy therefore we propose an optimal vertical deformation solution strategy to make full use of the los observations of different geometries to obtain more accurate vertical deformation in this study the spatial coverage of the ascending tracks sentinel 1 data is taken as the reference according to the spatial coverage of the sentinel 1 descending datasets in each ascending reference frame we use equations 2 or 3 to calculate the vertical deformation at each point specifically if a point is covered by both the ascending and descending observations equation 3 is used to solve the vertical deformation otherwise equation 2 is used in this way higher accuracy of vertical deformation results will be obtained at the points with different sar imaging geometries when the monitoring area is large we have to splice the results of multiple insar frames to obtain the ground deformation in the whole region the spatial coverage of adjacent frames have overlaps as wide as 23 km and 95 km along the range direction for alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 respectively fig 2 this feature provides a good condition for mosaicking the insar results however in the overlapping part the observation geometry of the adjacent frame at each point is different moreover due to the wide sar frame the incident angles of the perigee and apogee in the same frame are quite different which is nearly 20 in the sentinel 1 data hence only simple splicing can be done for each los deformation costantini et al 2017 after convert the insar los results of each frame to the vertical direction the vertical results should be the same at the same observation time for the adjacent frames of the overlapping part theoretically using the independent solution results of each frame in the overlapping part for overall adjustment we can effectively solve the problem of inconsistent reference datum among the results of each frame and obtain the regional scale ground subsidence results as for the redundant observation in the overlapping areas of the adjacent frames the best and denser set of the results will be retained to fill the overlapping area as in section 3 2 4 results 4 1 the los deformation from insar data using all the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 data covering jsoaa we obtained the regional scale ground displacements along the los direction in jsoaa during 2007 2010 fig 4 a and 2015 2020 fig 4 b c there are multiple subsidence areas in jsoaa checked with the corresponding optical images the subsidence areas fig 4 in closed dotted line are consistent with the agricultural planting area in spatial scope and is positively correlated with the planting area and planting intensity while negatively correlated with the distribution density of surface runoff that is the subsidence areas are more significant in the areas with high planting intensity and insufficient surface water supply the comparison between the ground subsidence from 2007 to 2010 and that from 2015 to 2020 shows that the spatial distribution range of subsidence areas are expended and the corresponding magnitude are intensified many subsidence areas are in the eastern part of jsoaa where there was no settlement previously fig 4 b3 to highlight the spatio temporal distribution characteristics of ground deformation settlement profiles at the same blue line in fig 4 a and fig 4 b were successively drawn in fig 5 a and b there were two independent subsidence areas distributed in this profile during 2007 2010 during 2015 2020 these two subsidence areas gradually expanded and finally merged into a large settlement region the maximum accumulative settlement reached about 400 mm from 2007 to 2010 and about 500 mm from 2015 to 2020 the subsidence rate of the main subsidence area of the section remains unchanged to better display the distribution characteristics of deformation in the time domain we plotted the time series deformation at a common point p1 in fig 4 fig 5 c the deformation at p1 keeps decreasing during the whole period the settlement rate remains unchanged due to the low temporal resolution 46 days of alos 1 palsar data the periodicity of ground deformation is not well represented during 2007 2010 however the sentinel 1 data with higher temporal resolution 12 days can capture the periodic signals of ground deformation well the subsidence occurred between march and september each year and the subsidence deceleration and surface recovery occurred between october and february this is consistent with the exploitation and recharge of groundwater caused by seasonal agricultural irrigation in jsoaa the results confirm the advantages and potential of sentinel 1 data in monitoring regional scale periodic ground deformation caused by groundwater extraction 4 2 the transformed vertical deformation as mentioned in section 3 1 alos 1 palsar data from 28 frames and sentinel 1 data from 6 frames were used to survey the surface deformation of jsoaa based on the los deformation of each frame we use the method described in section 3 3 to convert the los results to vertical and unify the reference datum of all the frames obtained at the same time the vertical deformation after unifying the reference datum was resampled into a standard coordinate grid with a spatial resolution of 100 m fig 6 for alos 1 palsar data only the ascending tracks data are available we use eq 3 to transform the los deformation into the vertical direction under the assumption of no horizontal displacements both ascending and descending sentinel 1 data cover the eastern part of jsoaa for this part we calculate the vertical deformation by eq 2 assuming that the north south deformation component is ignorable for the western part of jsoaa without descending track insar data coverage we use the same strategy as alos 1 palsar to obtain the vertical deformation the spatial coverage of the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 data has exceeded jsoaa and most of the detected deformation regions are distributed within jsoaa the yellow line in fig 6 most of the areas that experienced subsidence during 2007 2010 have connected and formed large subsidence regions during 2015 2020 what worse some new subsidence areas have appeared in some areas that had no subsidence such as eastern jsoaa the information of the subsidence areas is shown in table 2 which quantified the amplification of the subsidence areas in jsoaa during 2007 2010 alos 1 palsar and 2015 2020 sentinel 1 the total area of jsoaa is 4 45 104 km2 during the alos 1 monitoring period the area with a subsidence rate greater than 10 mm yr accounted for 13 2 of the total area of jsoaa however during the sentinel 1 monitoring period the corresponding ratio reached 36 3 in different statistical intervals of subsidence rate the subsidence area detected by sentinel 1 is generally 2 3 times larger than that of alos 1 4 3 accuracy assessment the deformation results of each adjacent insar dataset are obtained independently the spatial overlaps between adjacent frames can be used for reliability test we test the reliability of insar results by comparing the consistency of results in the overlapping regions as fig 6 shows after splicing the regional scale settlement results of jsoaa have good continuity in space two common areas as shown in the black rectangular box in fig 4 a and b were selected from the overlapping parts of alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 datasets for cross correlation calculations the selected overlap area of alos 1 palsar datasets is covered by three frames i e t500f870 t500f880 and t501f880 the selected overlap area of sentinel 1 datasets is covered by two ascending coverage at114 and at41 and one descending coverage dt19 cross correlation analysis was conducted on the subsidence rates in the overlapping regions as fig 7 shows the results from different frames have a good consistency the cross correlation coefficient between t500f870 and t500f880 t500f870 and t501f880 t500f880 and t501f880 and at114 and at41 are 0 97 0 99 0 98 and 0 99 respectively and the corresponding root mean square errors rmses are 6 5 4 2 4 6 and 3 6 mm yr respectively there are three global navigation satellite system gnss continuous monitoring stations htbc htc1 and htc2 distributed within jsoaa the black dots in fig 4 c the monitoring results of htbc were projected to the los directions of at114 and dt19 frames fig 8 a b the rmses between the gnss monitoring and the two insar results are 25 3 mm and 15 6 mm respectively the monitoring results of htc1 were projected to the los directions of at114 and dt19 frames respectively fig 8 c d the rmses between the gnss monitoring and the two insar results are 10 6 mm and 9 4 mm respectively the monitoring results of htc2 were projected to the los directions of at114 and dt19 respectively fig 8 e f the rmses between the gnss monitoring and the two insar results are 17 6 mm and 12 3 mm respectively 5 estimation of the volume strain in the aquifer 5 1 analytic modeling of the permanent loss of the aquifers the exploitation and recharge of underground fluid are mainly shown as subsidence and uplift on the ground surface this phenomenon is usually assumed to be caused by volume strain within the subsurface fluid in a half space hu and bürgmann 2020 mossop and segall 1999 shirzaei et al 2016 hydraulic diffusivity of aquifers at different depths is usually considered in the ground deformation modeling based on the pore elasticity theory jiang et al 2020 shirzaei et al 2019 however it is difficult to obtain accurate local hydrogeological parameters in most groundwater overexploited areas even in subaqueous aquifers the hydraulic diffusivity varies greatly over depths wang and kümpel 2003 which seriously affects the accuracy of the constructed hydrogeological models at present a common way for modeling and estimating the groundwater deficit or the change of aquifer head height is to establish the corresponding relationship between the ground subsidence and the change of aquifer head or volume by linear simplification argus et al 2014 chen et al 2016b smith et al 2017 in jsoaa agricultural irrigation mainly exploits the shallow groundwater resources for the ground deformation caused by such shallow source volume strain we discretized the volume into a horizontal square grid in a half space hereafter referred to as the horizontal dislocation model hd model according to the elastic half space theory okada 1992 and the modeling idea of volume strain of underground fluid by mossop and segall 1999 and shirzaei et al 2016 jsoaa is large 4 45 104 km2 and the subsidence area only accounts for 16 02 37 75 of the total area in addition jsoaa has multiple depression and uplift tectonic units fig 1 a so the hydrogeological conditions corresponding to different depression and uplift units should be different and the groundwater exploitation depth and intensity are also different therefore it is unreasonable to use the same volume strain parameters for joint inversion of all subsidence areas in the whole jsoaa to accurately estimate the volume strain caused by groundwater overexploitation in jsoaa we constructed a discrete hd model and estimated the parameters of each subsidence region in 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 in turn considering the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the subsidence regions according to the vertical deformation results in the two periods fig 6 19 and 18 subsidence areas were delineated respectively the spatial distribution range of each subsidence area and its hd model is shown in the black rectangle in fig 6 the classical dislocation model includes seven geometric parameters which are length width depth dip angle strike angle and position information east and north and three motion parameters which are strike slip dip slip and tensile okada 1992 in this study for each subsidence area each square in the hd model has the same length and width and the dip angle of zero fig 9 since the stress changes caused by overexploitation of aquifers mainly occur in the vertical direction we assume the horizontal strike slip and dip slip of each square in the hd model as zero and use the changes of vertical tensile components of each horizontal square to represent the volume strain of aquifers fig 9 strike angle has no physical significance in this study and can be manually adjusted according to the spatial shape of each subsidence area therefore the unknown parameters of the constructed hd model are the depth and the volume strain we set up a local coordinate system centered at a point 44 328 n 87 026 e in jsoaa and unified all the subsidence areas and hd models into the local coordinate system then for each subsidence area we set the appropriate strike angle according to the range of its outer rectangle divide the enclosed rectangles into several squares according to a certain side length to better describe the deformation of each subsidence area the square length is usually less than 500 m 5 2 inversion of equivalent volume strain based on the ground subsidence the depth and intensity of groundwater exploitation are closely related to the local actual groundwater spatial distribution and the demand for groundwater the local groundwater is usually considered to be spatially continuous and have approximately the same depth therefore we assume that the equivalent exploitation depth of the hd model is different for different subsidence areas for the same subsidence area its corresponding model depth is the same we take a subsidence area located in jsoaa fig 6 a 10 as an example to illustrate the specific modeling process firstly the quad tree method was used to down sample the settlement data in the covered subsidence area fig 10 a then according to the scope of the subsidence area the hd model space is discretized into a horizontal square grid under the elastic half space each square has the same model depth and the same grid size the nonlinear simulated annealing estimation algorithm is used to obtain the optimal model depth cervelli et al 2001 a linear inversion was performed to estimate the volume strain of each square in the hd model based on the optimal model depth and the fast non negative constrained least algorithm bro and jong 1997 in practice to save time and avoid non convergence of nonlinear search caused by excessive model parameters we first use a large square grid size usually set the length and width as 1 5 km and 1 5 km to construct the hd model during the nonlinear search to obtain the optimal model depth the subsidence area is divided into 13 rows and 10 columns a total of 130 grids in this model the unknown parameters are the depth of the hd model d and the volume strain of each grid u i i 1 2 130 with a total of 1 130 unknown parameters then based on the optimal depth of the model d 129 m the hd model was reconstructed with a length and width of 0 5 km the grid is divided into 38 rows and 33 columns with a total of 1254 cells in such case the unknown parameters are the volume strain of each grid i e 1254 unknown parameters u i i 1 2 1254 finally the u i of each grid was solved by linear inversion fig 10 d based on the constructed hd model and the corresponding parameters we can accurately simulate the settlement of the subsidence area fig 10 b under the same coordinate system we model all subsidence areas in turn and carry out the above inversion then we can obtain the equivalent exploitation depth and volume strain of the aquifer in the whole range of jsoaa table 3 figs s1 and s2 combining all the constructed hd models we can simulate the ground subsidence caused by groundwater overexploitation in jsoaa fig s3 as shown by the residual diagram of fig s3 b d the hd model accurately reproduces the subsidence of most subsidence areas in jsoaa the average annual volume strain rate of aquifer caused by groundwater overexploitation in jsoaa is 0 074 km3 yr from 2007 to 2010 and 0 271 km3 yr from 2015 to 2020 5 3 estimation of the aquifer parameters and groundwater volume deficit studies have estimated the annual groundwater exploitation in changji city and shawan county of jsoaa using multi year groundwater head height data from several wells a dozen to two dozen he 2019 kan et al 2019 the approximate spatial distribution of groundwater wells in these two areas is shown in black squares in fig 11 the representative storage coefficient of aquifers represents the relationship between the groundwater exploitation estimated from the change of groundwater head observed by monitoring wells and the volume strain caused by groundwater loss in the aquifer this can be estimated by the ratio between the volume strain of the aquifer and the actual groundwater production hu and bürgmann 2020 changji city and shawan county are located in two different depression basins i e fukang depression and shawan depression fig 1 their aquifer storage coefficients may be significantly different therefore we estimate the storage parameters of aquifers in changji and shawan based on the groundwater logging data and the aquifer volume strain estimated by the hd model the average annual groundwater exploitation in changji city from 2007 to 2010 was 2 32 108 m3 he 2019 in that period there were seven subsidence areas near changji fig 6 a 11 17 the volume strain rate of these seven areas is 0 21 108 m3 table 3 we calculate that the aquifer storage coefficient of fukang depression represented by changji is 0 0894 according to the groundwater logging data in shawan county the average annual groundwater production was about 1 25 108 m3 between 2007 and 2010 and 3 0 108 m3 between 2015 and 2017 kan et al 2019 there were three and two subsidence areas in shawan county during the corresponding period fig 6 a 3 5 6 and b 2 3 we calculate that the aquifer storage coefficient of shawan depression represented by shawan county is 0 1878 based on the obtained aquifer storage coefficient and volume strain we estimate that the groundwater volume deficit of jsoaa during 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 is 2 42 km3 and 11 97 km3 respectively 6 discussion 6 1 the relationship between ground subsidence and geological structure the tectonic framework of the basin basement is based on the fault structures of the basin and its surroundings studies have shown that there are 47 major faults in the junggar basin zhao et al 2008 after long term tectonic movement and deposition several uplift and depression geological units were formed in jsoaa fig 1 a according to the geological background information in section 2 thick argillaceous sandstone and mudstone are distributed in the shallow crust of jsoaa the maximum thickness more than 2 km is roughly located in the middle of the basin fig 1 b the head height of submerged aquifers is relatively shallow usually less than 100 m jsoaa s main source of agricultural irrigation water is the submerged aquifers the exploitation intensity of groundwater geological structure and the characteristics of the aquifer will affect the water storage and recharge in the aquifer and directly determine the spatio temporal distribution and migration of local groundwater it can be seen from table 3 that the depth of the estimated volume strain of the aquifer is mostly between 100 and 200 m which is consistent with the actual exploitation hydrogeological conditions of jsoaa the ground subsidence results and the hd model depth of each subsidence area were superimposed on the spatial distribution of geological tectonic units and faults as shown in fig 11 the spatial distribution of the subsidence areas is relatively concentrated and mainly concentrated in the depression units the depth of the adjacent groundwater deficit areas is roughly the same the average exploitation depth in fukang depression is greater than that in shawan depression with the passage of time subsidence areas expand and gradually become connected and the depth of groundwater deficit increases fig 11 this indicates that with the continuous loss of aquifers the head height gradually decreases and the water level of subaqueous aquifers declines agricultural irrigation has to extract groundwater from deeper aquifers in addition the ground subsidence of jsoaa is also related to the spatial distribution of local water resources jsoaa s fresh water supply mainly comes from precipitation and snow melt in the tien shan part of the fresh water is transported to jsoaa by surface runoff to recharge the basin ecosystem and for agricultural irrigation fig 4 the other part replenishes the jsoaa aquifer as groundwater fig 1 b if surface fresh water is sufficient the intensity of local groundwater exploitation will be significantly reduced moreover even if there are local groundwater exploitation activities the surface will not show obvious subsidence due to the rapid recharge of surface water and groundwater to the aquifer for example in the northern part of shihezi city and urumqi there are dense water networks and reservoirs therefore the surface of these areas is relatively stable though there are densely distributed farmlands however the jsoaa with a temperate continental climate is short of surface water resources for most agricultural regions the surface runoff volume and water supply capacity cannot meet agricultural irrigation water demand agricultural irrigation in jsoaa is highly dependent on groundwater this dependence is more obvious with the increase of the distance from the tien shan and the main surface runoff fig 4 the groundwater replenishment is less than the exploitation resulting in the net loss of the aquifer and the increase of the stress in the upper crust which leads to the formation of dense subsidence areas in the depression tectonic units far away from tien shan 6 2 the relationship between ground subsidence and human activities since 2000 the agricultural economy in western china especially xinjiang province has ushered in a period of rapid development due to the national policy of the development of the western region in china jsoaa has developed into the largest oasis type agricultural area in xinjiang the rapid development of the agricultural economy which relies on an intensive labor force is inseparable from population increase urban construction and farmland expansion we collected the distribution data of land cover types of jsoaa in 2000 2010 and 2020 fig 12 1 1 data from global land cover data product and service website of national basic geographic information center of china https www globallandcover com the dataset is developed from multi spectral images with a resolution of 30 m and it contains the spatial distribution information and area of 10 first level types such as farmland grassland waters and artificial surface the surface formed by artificial construction activities the classification accuracy is more than 83 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016a the area of all land cover types of jsoaa in different periods was counted successively table 4 the change of farmland area can reflect the size and the expansion speed of the agricultural economy the change of artificial surface area can reflect the spatio temporal distribution characteristics and change of population as well as the local economic development level as can be seen from fig 12 and table 4 the area of farmland and artificial surface in jsoaa keeps increasing over time with an average annual growth rate of more than 1 and 3 6 respectively in the past two decades the expansion rate in the last decade is about 50 faster than that in the previous decade with the expansion of farmland and artificial land the area of grassland and shrubland continues to decrease this phenomenon can also be seen in the spatio temporal evolution of ground objects in fig 12 this suggests that farmland and artificial land are converted from grassland and shrubland mainly from the grassland along with the expansion of farmland areas the fresh water resource demand increases but the area of waters and wetland in jsoaa is generally stable table 4 the spatial distribution of waters is relatively concentrated mostly in the area near the northern margin of tien shan we think that there are three reasons for the small change of waters area 1 due to the construction of water conservancy projects such as rivers and reservoirs the infiltration rate of surface water is slowed down which improves the efficiency of water storage and transportation 2 these areas are close to the tien shan and have a sufficient water supply 3 with global warming the water supply capacity of the tien shan will increase due to the melting of ice and snow li et al 2017 we superimposed the spatial distribution of the main subsidence areas in jsoaa monitored during 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 to the distribution map of land cover types fig 12 b and c in blue dotted lines it can be found that the subsidence areas are generally distributed far from the surface water compared with the ground cover in 2000 a large amount of farmland appeared in and around the subsidence areas the distribution of surface water in these areas is generally little in the area with subsidence regions farmland increases fast the amplification of artificial land is outside these regions this indicates that the formation and expansion of the subsidence areas are mainly related to the overexploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation the spatial distribution of subsidence areas and geological units fig 11 show that the geological unit of the depression suiting for enriching the groundwater in the submerged aquifer also have intensive agricultural planting and expansion fig 12 therefore the spatio temporal distribution and development intensity of the subsidence regions are strongly correlated with the geological units of the depression under the condition of constant groundwater supply these data confirm that jsoaa has made great progress in regional economic development in the past 20 years through rapid development of the agricultural economy and the area of agricultural cultivation continues to expand however the existing water supply can hardly support the continuous expansion of the agricultural economy and the shortage is increasingly serious 6 3 estimation of the regional groundwater net deficit in jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 jsoaa is an inland basin in which groundwater is in a closed loop dynamic state the surface runoff from the tien shan into jsoaa is all inland rivers and disappears in the irrigated areas and the northern deserts section 2 during the irrigation season the groundwater is mainly extracted from several wells in the planting areas there will be large subsidence near the groundwater exploitation area at the same time the groundwater deficit of the aquifer is replenished by the inflow of water from the surrounding aquifer and the infiltration of surface irrigation this will slow down subsidence and even cause ground uplift therefore the study of groundwater loss recharge in a single groundwater exploitation recharge period will show a relatively strong surface subsidence uplift signal reflecting the dynamic amplitude change of groundwater volume in a single cycle hu and bürgmann 2020 to estimate the long term deficit of regional aquifers however we will not focus only on the cyclical changes of aquifers but estimate the net deficit of aquifers after long term exploitation and recharge smith et al 2017 in other words we no longer focus on the periodic deformation corresponding to aquifer exploitation e g the blue dotted line in fig 5 c but carry out a linear fitting for the periodic deformation over a long period e g the magenta line in fig 5 c the net loss of aquifer is estimated from the net accumulation of ground subsidence this is why the average deformation rate of long period deformation is used as the input value to estimate the volume strain of the aquifer on the basis of the ground subsidence in jsoaa between 2007 and 2010 and 2015 and 2020 we estimate that the volume strain rates of the aquifers caused by groundwater overexploitation in these two periods are 0 074 km3 yr and 0 271 km3 yr respectively section 5 2 feng et al 2013 published a water loss rate of about 1 2 cm yr in jsoaa from 2003 to 2010 the area with a subsidence rate greater than 10 mm yr monitored by alos 1 palsar data is 5876 2 km2 table 2 the product of the deformation area and the water loss rate estimated by the gravity survey 0 071 km3 yr is comparable to the estimated volume strain between 2007 and 2010 due to the lack of insar data from 2011 to 2014 we cannot obtain the ground subsidence of jsoaa during this period nor the corresponding aquifer volume strain during this period to estimate the total volume strain of the aquifer between 2007 and 2020 we need to recover the volume strain of the aquifer from 2011 to 2014 by analyzing the time series insar deformation of jsoaa we found that the subsidence rate of the main deformation area in jsoaa was roughly equal in the two periods from 2007 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2020 fig 5 the well measured data suggests that the annual groundwater exploitation in changji city during 2006 2015 approximately shows a linearly increasing relationship fig 13 he 2019 kan et al 2019 the net loss of groundwater is positively correlated with ground subsidence in elastic half space the volume strain of the aquifer is linearly correlated with ground subsidence chen et al 2016b therefore we can estimate the volume strain rate of the aquifer between 2011 and 2014 using the volume strain rate of the aquifer from 2007 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2020 by the following formula 4 r 2 r 3 t 3 r 1 t 1 t 2 where t i is the time of the i th observation period r i represents the volume strain rate in t i the estimated volume strain rate from 2011 to 2014 is 0 239 km3 yr by multiplying and summing the volume strain rates of the three periods and the time of the corresponding periods i e vs i 1 3 r i t i we calculate that the total volume strain of the aquifer vs from 2007 to 2020 which is 2 73 km3 subsequently based on the aquifer storage coefficients in fukang and shawan depression obtained in section 5 3 and the aquifer volume strain we estimate that the total groundwater deficit of jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 is 23 95 km3 it should be noted that the data used for estimating the volume strain of the aquifer are the ground subsidence in the major subsidence areas obtained by insar we do not model the deformation regions with sporadic distribution and small magnitude this may lead to some deviation from the actual loss of groundwater although gravity satellite data can reflect the annual net loss of the terrestrial water its spatial resolution is low for example the spatial smoothing of grace satellite data is carried out for 200 km in feng et al 2013 therefore this method cannot reflect the spatio temporal evolution and distribution of regional surface subsidence areas insar technology with high spatial and temporal resolution can not only well reflect the spatio temporal development and evolution characteristics of subsidence areas but also achieve accurate estimation of net groundwater volume loss through refined volume strain modeling of the aquifer therefore insar has unique advantages in diagnosing the health of aquifers in agricultural areas 7 conclusions in this study we proposed an improved regional scale time series insar algorithm we also proposed an optimized vertical deformation solution strategy to convert the insar los deformation into the vertical direction and obtain the global vertical deformation rate using 1116 sar images covering the whole area of jsoaa including alos 1 palsar data from 13 tracks and 28 frames 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 data from 4 ascending tracks and 2 descending tracks 2015 2020 we obtained the first long term insar los deformation and regional scale subsidence results in jsoaa then we conducted a quantitative statistical analysis on the ground subsidence area and its change in jsoaa during 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 after analyzing the surface cover types the spatio temporal evolution characteristics of subsidence areas and the hydrogeological conditions we reveal the correlation between the ground subsidence caused by groundwater overexploitation and geographical location hydrogeological conditions and human activities in jsoaa an analytical model was used to model the ground subsidence areas associated with groundwater overexploitation based on groundwater exploitation data in fukang and shawan depression from the well we estimate the aquifer storage coefficients of these two depressions as 0 0894 and 0 1878 respectively by analyzing jsoaa s long term groundwater exploitation history we obtained the volume strain of the aquifer from 2011 to 2014 the total volume strain of aquifer in jsoaa during 2007 2020 is 2 73 km3 this result is comparable to the net loss of surface water volume estimated by satellite gravimetry then we calculated that the total aquifer deficit of jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 as 23 95 km3 the process of groundwater exploitation and recovery is complex in this study we obtained the spatio temporal evolution features of the ground deformation caused by aquifer overexploitation in jsoaa over a large time scale the volume strain caused by the net loss of jsoaa s aquifer is estimated by an analytical model due to the lack of high density groundwater exploitation data we used the groundwater exploitation volume obtained by several wells scattered in the agricultural area which inevitably has a certain deviation from the real groundwater exploitation volume to estimate the aquifer storage coefficients so our estimation may differ from the net loss of groundwater however we believe that this difference is acceptable and decreases with the accuracy improvement of the measured data the net loss of aquifer obtained by insar can directly reflect the contradiction between the rapid development and expansion of the jsoaa agricultural economy in recent years and the shortage of local water supply this study will serve for the rational development and utilization of groundwater resources in jsoaa and the sustainable development of the agricultural economy credit authorship contribution statement yuedong wang conceptualization methodology software project administration writing original draft guangcai

2787,groundwater is the main water source for agricultural irrigation in arid semi arid agricultural region overexploitation of groundwater inevitably leads to permanent loss of aquifer and ground subsidence the oasis agricultural area in the southern junggar basin jsoaa is one of the largest oasis agricultural areas in western china in this study we for the first time recover the regional scale ground displacements time series of jsoaa using all alos 1 palsar 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 2015 2020 data the results show that there are multiple subsidence areas related to groundwater overexploitation from 2007 to 2010 the area with a subsidence rate greater than 10 mm yr is about 5876 2 km2 accounting for 13 2 of the total area of jsoaa from 2015 to 2020 these values are about 16146 7 km2 and 36 3 in the areas with concentrated groundwater exploitation the small separate subsidence areas grew larger and became connected and finally developed into giant subsidence clusters the maximum cumulative deformation of jsoaa exceeded 400 mm from 2007 to 2010 and 500 mm from 2015 to 2020 we modeled the surface subsidence caused by the permanent aquifer loss and estimated the volume strain of aquifer in jsoaa the total volume strain of the aquifer is 2 73 km3 between 2007 and 2020 moreover we estimated the aquifer storage coefficient and the net groundwater deficit of jsoaa the results of this study will serve for jsoaa aquifer health detection ecological environment stability assessment and sustainable development of the agricultural economy keywords junggar basin oasis planting overexploitation of groundwater time series insar subsidence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of the irrigation water in agricultural planting areas with few surface water resources especially in the flat alluvial basins formed by unconsolidated sediments and the urban or agricultural areas developed in temperate or arid climates with prolonged dry periods herrera garcía et al 2021 the huge demand for freshwater leads to long term overpumping of groundwater in these areas groundwater overpumping will cause permanent damage to the aquifer and irreversible surface settlement which reduce the water storage capacity of the aquifer system cause earth fissures damage buildings and may trigger a series of geological disasters such as microearthquakes and floods foulger et al 2018 gonzález et al 2012 hoffmann et al 2003 therefore in such regions it is important to monitor the groundwater overpumping related ground settlement and conduct aquifer damage identification and geological disaster assessment xinjiang china is located in the arid semi arid temperate climate zone it has a large number of irrigated agricultural planting areas which were mostly developed after 2000 following the policy of the development of the western region in china junggar basin located in northern xinjiang is the second largest inland basin in china one of the largest oasis agricultural growing areas in western china is distributed on the southern area of junggar basin with an area of 4 45 104 km2 hereafter this area is named as the oasis agricultural area in the southern junggar basin jsoaa the jsoaa is the most densely populated and active region in xinjiang du et al 2013 feng et al 2013 published the gravity anomaly of the terrestrial water storage changes in china and surrounding regions obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data from 2003 to 2010 the large scale gravity anomaly data show there is a large area of water deficit region in the area near tien shan including the jsoaa although the development of the agricultural economy and the caused net loss of aquifers in the jsoaa have been paid much attention the monitoring of regional scale deformation and the investigation of aquifer deficit in this area are rarely reported with the rapid development of the jsoaa s agricultural economy in recent years it is necessary to use wide area deformation monitoring technologies to trackback the ground subsidence history in jsoaa and make modeling and quantitative analysis on groundwater overexploitation status considering local hydrogeological conditions to evaluate the health of aquifers and the sustainable potential of the agricultural economy in jsoaa interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar an active remote sensing technique can obtain millimeter accuracy and high spatio temporal resolution of surface deformation hanssen 2001 osmanoğlu et al 2016 xue et al 2020 insar has achieved great achievements in geodesy and remote sensing fields such as earthquake volcanic eruption glacier movement urban surface subsidence and mining subsidence li et al 2017 ma et al 2019 massonnet et al 1993 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2015 ground displacements in an arid agricultural area are usually caused by the change of head pressure of regional aquifer induced by exploitation recharge of groundwater galloway et al 1998 first applied insar to monitor the ground subsidence over an aquifer system in antelope valley california and explained the observed subsidence as aquifer system compaction since then insar has been widely used in monitoring and modeling the ground subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation some scholars used insar to monitor the land subsidence caused by groundwater exploitation or overexploitation at regional or valley scale and analyzed the spatio temporal evolution of land subsidence and the relationship with geological structures chaussard et al 2014 dong et al 2021 hoffmann et al 2001 hu and bürgmann 2020 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2022 some built physical models of groundwater head and aquifer volume change to estimate the spatially varying compaction time constants elastic inelastic specific skeletal storage coefficients long term decay coefficient using the information of ground subsidence and groundwater head height by geodetic means such as insar and leveling chen et al 2016b hoffmann et al 2003 hu et al 2018 reeves et al 2014 smith et al 2017 at present from the perspective of geodesy the studies on groundwater overexploitation and ground subsidence monitoring in jsoaa mainly used a few local and short term measured data of wells or insar he 2019 kan et al 2019 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2020a there are still no quantitative and systematic research results on the spatio temporal evolution of ground subsidence and groundwater overexploitation at a regional scale in jsoaa in other words the current status of aquifer material deficit and ground subsidence at the regional scale of the jsoaa is still unknown in this paper we collected all available alos 1 palsar data 13 tracks and 28 frames 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 data 6 tracks 2015 2020 covering the whole jsoaa then an improved regional scale time series insar processing strategy is adopted to process all the insar datasets the insar deformation results of jsoaa along the radar line of sight los and vertical directions are obtained combining the insar deformation results with the spatio temporal distribution of the agricultural planting areas the seasonal groundwater exploitation information and the geological structure we quantitatively analyze the spatio temporal evolution characteristics and the area of subsidence caused by groundwater overpumping and the relationships between ground subsidence geological structure and human activities finally an analytical model of the volume strain of the aquifer is established based on the subsidence and hydrogeological data of jsoaa the storage coefficient and the net loss of aquifer from 2007 to 2020 are estimated 2 the geological setting of jsoaa the junggar basin is an ancient platform located in the south of the paleo asian ocean tectonic domain and is an important part of the central asian orogenic belt junggar basin is at the northern foot of tien shan and has been formed since hercynian after plate reengineering since the late paleozoic li et al 2015 there are many uplift and depression units due to tectonic movement and geological deposition and many faults are distributed among the strata fig 1 a he et al 2018 the east west geological profile of the trans junggar basin shows thick argillic sandstones and mudstones in the shallow crust of the basin the basin center is thicker than the edge fig 1 c we collected a hydrogeological profile model with a north south distribution across the manas river basin fig 1 b it is denoted by the black dotted line in fig 1 a the model presents the spatial distribution of hydrogeology and groundwater transport routes in the jsoaa as can be seen from fig 1 b aquifers in the junggar basin are mainly divided into two layers submerged aquifers with a depth of about 200 m below the surface and confined aquifers with a depth of more than 200 m the head height of submerged aquifers is relatively shallow usually less than 100 m as marked by the blue line in fig 1 b wang 2020 the junggar basin has an arid semi arid temperate continental climate it has stable snow fall in winter the water vapor in the basin mainly comes from the westerly flow winter and spring precipitation account for 30 45 of the annual total after frequent conversion surface water and groundwater flow into oasis agricultural areas in the form of surface water subsurface flow and bedrock lateral runoff atmospheric precipitation is extremely scarce in the central plain and the northern desert where the evaporation is strong siltstone and silty clay are the main lithologies in the desert low plains and the lower part of the plain therefore seepage of surface water such as river infiltration irrigation infiltration and channel leakage is the main recharge source of groundwater in these areas of which irrigation infiltration and channel leakage can occupy more than 40 of the total recharge of groundwater the vadose zone the stratum between the surface of the groundwater and the surface of the earth in these areas dissipates a lot in evaporation during the infiltration process therefore it is difficult to form an effective recharge for groundwater artificial exploitation and plant transpiration are the main ways of groundwater excretion accounting for 63 and 25 of the total groundwater excretion respectively wang 2020 the deficit and recharge of the groundwater have obvious seasonality they occur almost at the same time which jointly affects the dynamic balance of regional groundwater by 2018 xinjiang had an agricultural region of 5 24 106 ha of which 4 98 106 ha are irrigated land accounting for 95 of the total gao and han 2019 irrigation water relies heavily on the groundwater from subaqueous aquifers agricultural water has long accounted for more than 95 of xinjiang s total water consumption jsoaa as shown by the yellow line in fig 1 is the main agricultural area in the junggar basin and one of the largest agricultural planting areas in western china in recent 20 years the agricultural economy in this region has developed rapidly jsoaa has become an important grain production base in xinjiang and the main cotton production base in china since the beginning of the 21st century the scale of agricultural irrigation has been expanding agricultural water is increasingly crowding out ecological water which endangers the fragile ecological environment zhang et al 2021 the regional scale long term groundwater extraction results in the decline of groundwater levels in plain areas the natural dynamic changes of groundwater have been replaced by the dynamic changes caused by groundwater exploitation the wet period has become the dry period and the original dry period has become the recovery period of groundwater level du et al 2013 all rivers within jsoaa are inland rivers which end up in the low lying part of jsoaa and disappear in the irrigated area jsoaa is mainly surrounded by ebinur lake and manas lake due to the diversion of water to the irrigation area the water into the lake has been sharply reduced at present manas lake has dried up and the water area of ebinur lake has also been reduced 3 insar data and methods 3 1 alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 sar data over jsoaa to conduct comprehensive monitoring for the regional scale ground subsidence in jsoaa we collected a total of 1116 sar images covering the whole region of jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 including alos 1 palsar data of 13 ascending tracks and 28 frames 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 data of 4 ascending tracks and 2 descending tracks 2015 2020 table 1 among them the ascending alos 1 palsar and ascending sentinel 1 data achieved full coverage of jsoaa due to the short time coverage the descending sentinel 1 data in the western part of jsoaa is not processed e g dt92 and dt165 the coverage of all insar data used in this study is shown in fig 2 3 2 retrieval of time series los displacements to obtain the ts insar displacements we first selected a sar image from insar data of each frame as the master image and registered and re sampled the other images under the same frame to the spatial reference system of the master image then by setting the spatio temporal baseline threshold i e 1500 m and 900 days for alos 1 palsar data and 100 m and 36 days for sentinel 1 data we obtain the multi temporal insar pairs under each frame the reference point in each frame is selected in the built up area far from agricultural regions the two pass differential insar dinsar approach is applied to process the insar pairs zebker et al 1994 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem at 1 arcsec resolution farr et al 2007 is employed to remove the topographic phases the multi looking operations range azimuth 7 16 and 20 4 are applied to suppress the decorrelation noise in the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 datasets respectively all of the small baseline insar pairs in the datasets are sequentially processed by an improved interferometric point target analysis ipta method wang et al 2021b the achieved resolution of the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 datasets after geocoding are about 50 m and 56 m respectively monitoring regional scale deformation usually uses multiple tracks and or frames sar images to fully cover the target region so one point may have two or more deformation values in the overlapping area this will bother the subsequent deformation interpretation especially for non expert users we choose the best and the denser set of measurements from one of the frames and only a single piece of information is kept in the overlapping areas costantini et al 2017 to generate the overall los displacements of jsoaa 3 3 estimation of the overall vertical deformation studies have shown that the change of aquifer head is coupled with ground subsidence chen et al 2016b hoffmann 2003 miller et al 2017 which makes us more interested in the vertical observation from insar however the insar monitored deformation is the projection of the three dimensional 3 d surface deformation of vertical d u east west d e and north south d n directions into los direction d los hu et al 2014 i e 1 d los cos θ i d u sin θ i cos α i d e sin θ i sin α i d n θ i and α i represent the radar incidence and flight direction angles at the i th point of the frames respectively fig 3 as the sar satellites fly along the near polar orbit their monitoring results are less sensitive to the north south deformation therefore the contribution of d n to d los is usually low and can be ignored fig 3 we can calculate the surface deformations along the vertical and east west directions using the ascending and descending insar data with the same acquisition time samsonov and d oreye 2012 samsonov et al 2014 i e 2 d los asc cos θ asc i d u sin θ asc i cos α asc i d e d los des cos θ des i d u sin θ des i cos α des i d e if no ascending descending tracks insar data were acquired at the same time the above method does not work for example the west part of jsoaa is well covered by the sentinel 1 ascending data in the study period but the corresponding descending data is not available fig 2 in such case we usually ignore the contribution of horizontal movement d e and d n to los deformation fig 3 and transform the los deformation into the vertical direction smith et al 2017 by 3 d los cos θ i d u by introducing insar data with different observation geometry to solve the vertical deformation we can get the vertical deformation with higher accuracy therefore we propose an optimal vertical deformation solution strategy to make full use of the los observations of different geometries to obtain more accurate vertical deformation in this study the spatial coverage of the ascending tracks sentinel 1 data is taken as the reference according to the spatial coverage of the sentinel 1 descending datasets in each ascending reference frame we use equations 2 or 3 to calculate the vertical deformation at each point specifically if a point is covered by both the ascending and descending observations equation 3 is used to solve the vertical deformation otherwise equation 2 is used in this way higher accuracy of vertical deformation results will be obtained at the points with different sar imaging geometries when the monitoring area is large we have to splice the results of multiple insar frames to obtain the ground deformation in the whole region the spatial coverage of adjacent frames have overlaps as wide as 23 km and 95 km along the range direction for alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 respectively fig 2 this feature provides a good condition for mosaicking the insar results however in the overlapping part the observation geometry of the adjacent frame at each point is different moreover due to the wide sar frame the incident angles of the perigee and apogee in the same frame are quite different which is nearly 20 in the sentinel 1 data hence only simple splicing can be done for each los deformation costantini et al 2017 after convert the insar los results of each frame to the vertical direction the vertical results should be the same at the same observation time for the adjacent frames of the overlapping part theoretically using the independent solution results of each frame in the overlapping part for overall adjustment we can effectively solve the problem of inconsistent reference datum among the results of each frame and obtain the regional scale ground subsidence results as for the redundant observation in the overlapping areas of the adjacent frames the best and denser set of the results will be retained to fill the overlapping area as in section 3 2 4 results 4 1 the los deformation from insar data using all the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 data covering jsoaa we obtained the regional scale ground displacements along the los direction in jsoaa during 2007 2010 fig 4 a and 2015 2020 fig 4 b c there are multiple subsidence areas in jsoaa checked with the corresponding optical images the subsidence areas fig 4 in closed dotted line are consistent with the agricultural planting area in spatial scope and is positively correlated with the planting area and planting intensity while negatively correlated with the distribution density of surface runoff that is the subsidence areas are more significant in the areas with high planting intensity and insufficient surface water supply the comparison between the ground subsidence from 2007 to 2010 and that from 2015 to 2020 shows that the spatial distribution range of subsidence areas are expended and the corresponding magnitude are intensified many subsidence areas are in the eastern part of jsoaa where there was no settlement previously fig 4 b3 to highlight the spatio temporal distribution characteristics of ground deformation settlement profiles at the same blue line in fig 4 a and fig 4 b were successively drawn in fig 5 a and b there were two independent subsidence areas distributed in this profile during 2007 2010 during 2015 2020 these two subsidence areas gradually expanded and finally merged into a large settlement region the maximum accumulative settlement reached about 400 mm from 2007 to 2010 and about 500 mm from 2015 to 2020 the subsidence rate of the main subsidence area of the section remains unchanged to better display the distribution characteristics of deformation in the time domain we plotted the time series deformation at a common point p1 in fig 4 fig 5 c the deformation at p1 keeps decreasing during the whole period the settlement rate remains unchanged due to the low temporal resolution 46 days of alos 1 palsar data the periodicity of ground deformation is not well represented during 2007 2010 however the sentinel 1 data with higher temporal resolution 12 days can capture the periodic signals of ground deformation well the subsidence occurred between march and september each year and the subsidence deceleration and surface recovery occurred between october and february this is consistent with the exploitation and recharge of groundwater caused by seasonal agricultural irrigation in jsoaa the results confirm the advantages and potential of sentinel 1 data in monitoring regional scale periodic ground deformation caused by groundwater extraction 4 2 the transformed vertical deformation as mentioned in section 3 1 alos 1 palsar data from 28 frames and sentinel 1 data from 6 frames were used to survey the surface deformation of jsoaa based on the los deformation of each frame we use the method described in section 3 3 to convert the los results to vertical and unify the reference datum of all the frames obtained at the same time the vertical deformation after unifying the reference datum was resampled into a standard coordinate grid with a spatial resolution of 100 m fig 6 for alos 1 palsar data only the ascending tracks data are available we use eq 3 to transform the los deformation into the vertical direction under the assumption of no horizontal displacements both ascending and descending sentinel 1 data cover the eastern part of jsoaa for this part we calculate the vertical deformation by eq 2 assuming that the north south deformation component is ignorable for the western part of jsoaa without descending track insar data coverage we use the same strategy as alos 1 palsar to obtain the vertical deformation the spatial coverage of the alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 data has exceeded jsoaa and most of the detected deformation regions are distributed within jsoaa the yellow line in fig 6 most of the areas that experienced subsidence during 2007 2010 have connected and formed large subsidence regions during 2015 2020 what worse some new subsidence areas have appeared in some areas that had no subsidence such as eastern jsoaa the information of the subsidence areas is shown in table 2 which quantified the amplification of the subsidence areas in jsoaa during 2007 2010 alos 1 palsar and 2015 2020 sentinel 1 the total area of jsoaa is 4 45 104 km2 during the alos 1 monitoring period the area with a subsidence rate greater than 10 mm yr accounted for 13 2 of the total area of jsoaa however during the sentinel 1 monitoring period the corresponding ratio reached 36 3 in different statistical intervals of subsidence rate the subsidence area detected by sentinel 1 is generally 2 3 times larger than that of alos 1 4 3 accuracy assessment the deformation results of each adjacent insar dataset are obtained independently the spatial overlaps between adjacent frames can be used for reliability test we test the reliability of insar results by comparing the consistency of results in the overlapping regions as fig 6 shows after splicing the regional scale settlement results of jsoaa have good continuity in space two common areas as shown in the black rectangular box in fig 4 a and b were selected from the overlapping parts of alos 1 palsar and sentinel 1 datasets for cross correlation calculations the selected overlap area of alos 1 palsar datasets is covered by three frames i e t500f870 t500f880 and t501f880 the selected overlap area of sentinel 1 datasets is covered by two ascending coverage at114 and at41 and one descending coverage dt19 cross correlation analysis was conducted on the subsidence rates in the overlapping regions as fig 7 shows the results from different frames have a good consistency the cross correlation coefficient between t500f870 and t500f880 t500f870 and t501f880 t500f880 and t501f880 and at114 and at41 are 0 97 0 99 0 98 and 0 99 respectively and the corresponding root mean square errors rmses are 6 5 4 2 4 6 and 3 6 mm yr respectively there are three global navigation satellite system gnss continuous monitoring stations htbc htc1 and htc2 distributed within jsoaa the black dots in fig 4 c the monitoring results of htbc were projected to the los directions of at114 and dt19 frames fig 8 a b the rmses between the gnss monitoring and the two insar results are 25 3 mm and 15 6 mm respectively the monitoring results of htc1 were projected to the los directions of at114 and dt19 frames respectively fig 8 c d the rmses between the gnss monitoring and the two insar results are 10 6 mm and 9 4 mm respectively the monitoring results of htc2 were projected to the los directions of at114 and dt19 respectively fig 8 e f the rmses between the gnss monitoring and the two insar results are 17 6 mm and 12 3 mm respectively 5 estimation of the volume strain in the aquifer 5 1 analytic modeling of the permanent loss of the aquifers the exploitation and recharge of underground fluid are mainly shown as subsidence and uplift on the ground surface this phenomenon is usually assumed to be caused by volume strain within the subsurface fluid in a half space hu and bürgmann 2020 mossop and segall 1999 shirzaei et al 2016 hydraulic diffusivity of aquifers at different depths is usually considered in the ground deformation modeling based on the pore elasticity theory jiang et al 2020 shirzaei et al 2019 however it is difficult to obtain accurate local hydrogeological parameters in most groundwater overexploited areas even in subaqueous aquifers the hydraulic diffusivity varies greatly over depths wang and kümpel 2003 which seriously affects the accuracy of the constructed hydrogeological models at present a common way for modeling and estimating the groundwater deficit or the change of aquifer head height is to establish the corresponding relationship between the ground subsidence and the change of aquifer head or volume by linear simplification argus et al 2014 chen et al 2016b smith et al 2017 in jsoaa agricultural irrigation mainly exploits the shallow groundwater resources for the ground deformation caused by such shallow source volume strain we discretized the volume into a horizontal square grid in a half space hereafter referred to as the horizontal dislocation model hd model according to the elastic half space theory okada 1992 and the modeling idea of volume strain of underground fluid by mossop and segall 1999 and shirzaei et al 2016 jsoaa is large 4 45 104 km2 and the subsidence area only accounts for 16 02 37 75 of the total area in addition jsoaa has multiple depression and uplift tectonic units fig 1 a so the hydrogeological conditions corresponding to different depression and uplift units should be different and the groundwater exploitation depth and intensity are also different therefore it is unreasonable to use the same volume strain parameters for joint inversion of all subsidence areas in the whole jsoaa to accurately estimate the volume strain caused by groundwater overexploitation in jsoaa we constructed a discrete hd model and estimated the parameters of each subsidence region in 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 in turn considering the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the subsidence regions according to the vertical deformation results in the two periods fig 6 19 and 18 subsidence areas were delineated respectively the spatial distribution range of each subsidence area and its hd model is shown in the black rectangle in fig 6 the classical dislocation model includes seven geometric parameters which are length width depth dip angle strike angle and position information east and north and three motion parameters which are strike slip dip slip and tensile okada 1992 in this study for each subsidence area each square in the hd model has the same length and width and the dip angle of zero fig 9 since the stress changes caused by overexploitation of aquifers mainly occur in the vertical direction we assume the horizontal strike slip and dip slip of each square in the hd model as zero and use the changes of vertical tensile components of each horizontal square to represent the volume strain of aquifers fig 9 strike angle has no physical significance in this study and can be manually adjusted according to the spatial shape of each subsidence area therefore the unknown parameters of the constructed hd model are the depth and the volume strain we set up a local coordinate system centered at a point 44 328 n 87 026 e in jsoaa and unified all the subsidence areas and hd models into the local coordinate system then for each subsidence area we set the appropriate strike angle according to the range of its outer rectangle divide the enclosed rectangles into several squares according to a certain side length to better describe the deformation of each subsidence area the square length is usually less than 500 m 5 2 inversion of equivalent volume strain based on the ground subsidence the depth and intensity of groundwater exploitation are closely related to the local actual groundwater spatial distribution and the demand for groundwater the local groundwater is usually considered to be spatially continuous and have approximately the same depth therefore we assume that the equivalent exploitation depth of the hd model is different for different subsidence areas for the same subsidence area its corresponding model depth is the same we take a subsidence area located in jsoaa fig 6 a 10 as an example to illustrate the specific modeling process firstly the quad tree method was used to down sample the settlement data in the covered subsidence area fig 10 a then according to the scope of the subsidence area the hd model space is discretized into a horizontal square grid under the elastic half space each square has the same model depth and the same grid size the nonlinear simulated annealing estimation algorithm is used to obtain the optimal model depth cervelli et al 2001 a linear inversion was performed to estimate the volume strain of each square in the hd model based on the optimal model depth and the fast non negative constrained least algorithm bro and jong 1997 in practice to save time and avoid non convergence of nonlinear search caused by excessive model parameters we first use a large square grid size usually set the length and width as 1 5 km and 1 5 km to construct the hd model during the nonlinear search to obtain the optimal model depth the subsidence area is divided into 13 rows and 10 columns a total of 130 grids in this model the unknown parameters are the depth of the hd model d and the volume strain of each grid u i i 1 2 130 with a total of 1 130 unknown parameters then based on the optimal depth of the model d 129 m the hd model was reconstructed with a length and width of 0 5 km the grid is divided into 38 rows and 33 columns with a total of 1254 cells in such case the unknown parameters are the volume strain of each grid i e 1254 unknown parameters u i i 1 2 1254 finally the u i of each grid was solved by linear inversion fig 10 d based on the constructed hd model and the corresponding parameters we can accurately simulate the settlement of the subsidence area fig 10 b under the same coordinate system we model all subsidence areas in turn and carry out the above inversion then we can obtain the equivalent exploitation depth and volume strain of the aquifer in the whole range of jsoaa table 3 figs s1 and s2 combining all the constructed hd models we can simulate the ground subsidence caused by groundwater overexploitation in jsoaa fig s3 as shown by the residual diagram of fig s3 b d the hd model accurately reproduces the subsidence of most subsidence areas in jsoaa the average annual volume strain rate of aquifer caused by groundwater overexploitation in jsoaa is 0 074 km3 yr from 2007 to 2010 and 0 271 km3 yr from 2015 to 2020 5 3 estimation of the aquifer parameters and groundwater volume deficit studies have estimated the annual groundwater exploitation in changji city and shawan county of jsoaa using multi year groundwater head height data from several wells a dozen to two dozen he 2019 kan et al 2019 the approximate spatial distribution of groundwater wells in these two areas is shown in black squares in fig 11 the representative storage coefficient of aquifers represents the relationship between the groundwater exploitation estimated from the change of groundwater head observed by monitoring wells and the volume strain caused by groundwater loss in the aquifer this can be estimated by the ratio between the volume strain of the aquifer and the actual groundwater production hu and bürgmann 2020 changji city and shawan county are located in two different depression basins i e fukang depression and shawan depression fig 1 their aquifer storage coefficients may be significantly different therefore we estimate the storage parameters of aquifers in changji and shawan based on the groundwater logging data and the aquifer volume strain estimated by the hd model the average annual groundwater exploitation in changji city from 2007 to 2010 was 2 32 108 m3 he 2019 in that period there were seven subsidence areas near changji fig 6 a 11 17 the volume strain rate of these seven areas is 0 21 108 m3 table 3 we calculate that the aquifer storage coefficient of fukang depression represented by changji is 0 0894 according to the groundwater logging data in shawan county the average annual groundwater production was about 1 25 108 m3 between 2007 and 2010 and 3 0 108 m3 between 2015 and 2017 kan et al 2019 there were three and two subsidence areas in shawan county during the corresponding period fig 6 a 3 5 6 and b 2 3 we calculate that the aquifer storage coefficient of shawan depression represented by shawan county is 0 1878 based on the obtained aquifer storage coefficient and volume strain we estimate that the groundwater volume deficit of jsoaa during 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 is 2 42 km3 and 11 97 km3 respectively 6 discussion 6 1 the relationship between ground subsidence and geological structure the tectonic framework of the basin basement is based on the fault structures of the basin and its surroundings studies have shown that there are 47 major faults in the junggar basin zhao et al 2008 after long term tectonic movement and deposition several uplift and depression geological units were formed in jsoaa fig 1 a according to the geological background information in section 2 thick argillaceous sandstone and mudstone are distributed in the shallow crust of jsoaa the maximum thickness more than 2 km is roughly located in the middle of the basin fig 1 b the head height of submerged aquifers is relatively shallow usually less than 100 m jsoaa s main source of agricultural irrigation water is the submerged aquifers the exploitation intensity of groundwater geological structure and the characteristics of the aquifer will affect the water storage and recharge in the aquifer and directly determine the spatio temporal distribution and migration of local groundwater it can be seen from table 3 that the depth of the estimated volume strain of the aquifer is mostly between 100 and 200 m which is consistent with the actual exploitation hydrogeological conditions of jsoaa the ground subsidence results and the hd model depth of each subsidence area were superimposed on the spatial distribution of geological tectonic units and faults as shown in fig 11 the spatial distribution of the subsidence areas is relatively concentrated and mainly concentrated in the depression units the depth of the adjacent groundwater deficit areas is roughly the same the average exploitation depth in fukang depression is greater than that in shawan depression with the passage of time subsidence areas expand and gradually become connected and the depth of groundwater deficit increases fig 11 this indicates that with the continuous loss of aquifers the head height gradually decreases and the water level of subaqueous aquifers declines agricultural irrigation has to extract groundwater from deeper aquifers in addition the ground subsidence of jsoaa is also related to the spatial distribution of local water resources jsoaa s fresh water supply mainly comes from precipitation and snow melt in the tien shan part of the fresh water is transported to jsoaa by surface runoff to recharge the basin ecosystem and for agricultural irrigation fig 4 the other part replenishes the jsoaa aquifer as groundwater fig 1 b if surface fresh water is sufficient the intensity of local groundwater exploitation will be significantly reduced moreover even if there are local groundwater exploitation activities the surface will not show obvious subsidence due to the rapid recharge of surface water and groundwater to the aquifer for example in the northern part of shihezi city and urumqi there are dense water networks and reservoirs therefore the surface of these areas is relatively stable though there are densely distributed farmlands however the jsoaa with a temperate continental climate is short of surface water resources for most agricultural regions the surface runoff volume and water supply capacity cannot meet agricultural irrigation water demand agricultural irrigation in jsoaa is highly dependent on groundwater this dependence is more obvious with the increase of the distance from the tien shan and the main surface runoff fig 4 the groundwater replenishment is less than the exploitation resulting in the net loss of the aquifer and the increase of the stress in the upper crust which leads to the formation of dense subsidence areas in the depression tectonic units far away from tien shan 6 2 the relationship between ground subsidence and human activities since 2000 the agricultural economy in western china especially xinjiang province has ushered in a period of rapid development due to the national policy of the development of the western region in china jsoaa has developed into the largest oasis type agricultural area in xinjiang the rapid development of the agricultural economy which relies on an intensive labor force is inseparable from population increase urban construction and farmland expansion we collected the distribution data of land cover types of jsoaa in 2000 2010 and 2020 fig 12 1 1 data from global land cover data product and service website of national basic geographic information center of china https www globallandcover com the dataset is developed from multi spectral images with a resolution of 30 m and it contains the spatial distribution information and area of 10 first level types such as farmland grassland waters and artificial surface the surface formed by artificial construction activities the classification accuracy is more than 83 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016a the area of all land cover types of jsoaa in different periods was counted successively table 4 the change of farmland area can reflect the size and the expansion speed of the agricultural economy the change of artificial surface area can reflect the spatio temporal distribution characteristics and change of population as well as the local economic development level as can be seen from fig 12 and table 4 the area of farmland and artificial surface in jsoaa keeps increasing over time with an average annual growth rate of more than 1 and 3 6 respectively in the past two decades the expansion rate in the last decade is about 50 faster than that in the previous decade with the expansion of farmland and artificial land the area of grassland and shrubland continues to decrease this phenomenon can also be seen in the spatio temporal evolution of ground objects in fig 12 this suggests that farmland and artificial land are converted from grassland and shrubland mainly from the grassland along with the expansion of farmland areas the fresh water resource demand increases but the area of waters and wetland in jsoaa is generally stable table 4 the spatial distribution of waters is relatively concentrated mostly in the area near the northern margin of tien shan we think that there are three reasons for the small change of waters area 1 due to the construction of water conservancy projects such as rivers and reservoirs the infiltration rate of surface water is slowed down which improves the efficiency of water storage and transportation 2 these areas are close to the tien shan and have a sufficient water supply 3 with global warming the water supply capacity of the tien shan will increase due to the melting of ice and snow li et al 2017 we superimposed the spatial distribution of the main subsidence areas in jsoaa monitored during 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 to the distribution map of land cover types fig 12 b and c in blue dotted lines it can be found that the subsidence areas are generally distributed far from the surface water compared with the ground cover in 2000 a large amount of farmland appeared in and around the subsidence areas the distribution of surface water in these areas is generally little in the area with subsidence regions farmland increases fast the amplification of artificial land is outside these regions this indicates that the formation and expansion of the subsidence areas are mainly related to the overexploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation the spatial distribution of subsidence areas and geological units fig 11 show that the geological unit of the depression suiting for enriching the groundwater in the submerged aquifer also have intensive agricultural planting and expansion fig 12 therefore the spatio temporal distribution and development intensity of the subsidence regions are strongly correlated with the geological units of the depression under the condition of constant groundwater supply these data confirm that jsoaa has made great progress in regional economic development in the past 20 years through rapid development of the agricultural economy and the area of agricultural cultivation continues to expand however the existing water supply can hardly support the continuous expansion of the agricultural economy and the shortage is increasingly serious 6 3 estimation of the regional groundwater net deficit in jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 jsoaa is an inland basin in which groundwater is in a closed loop dynamic state the surface runoff from the tien shan into jsoaa is all inland rivers and disappears in the irrigated areas and the northern deserts section 2 during the irrigation season the groundwater is mainly extracted from several wells in the planting areas there will be large subsidence near the groundwater exploitation area at the same time the groundwater deficit of the aquifer is replenished by the inflow of water from the surrounding aquifer and the infiltration of surface irrigation this will slow down subsidence and even cause ground uplift therefore the study of groundwater loss recharge in a single groundwater exploitation recharge period will show a relatively strong surface subsidence uplift signal reflecting the dynamic amplitude change of groundwater volume in a single cycle hu and bürgmann 2020 to estimate the long term deficit of regional aquifers however we will not focus only on the cyclical changes of aquifers but estimate the net deficit of aquifers after long term exploitation and recharge smith et al 2017 in other words we no longer focus on the periodic deformation corresponding to aquifer exploitation e g the blue dotted line in fig 5 c but carry out a linear fitting for the periodic deformation over a long period e g the magenta line in fig 5 c the net loss of aquifer is estimated from the net accumulation of ground subsidence this is why the average deformation rate of long period deformation is used as the input value to estimate the volume strain of the aquifer on the basis of the ground subsidence in jsoaa between 2007 and 2010 and 2015 and 2020 we estimate that the volume strain rates of the aquifers caused by groundwater overexploitation in these two periods are 0 074 km3 yr and 0 271 km3 yr respectively section 5 2 feng et al 2013 published a water loss rate of about 1 2 cm yr in jsoaa from 2003 to 2010 the area with a subsidence rate greater than 10 mm yr monitored by alos 1 palsar data is 5876 2 km2 table 2 the product of the deformation area and the water loss rate estimated by the gravity survey 0 071 km3 yr is comparable to the estimated volume strain between 2007 and 2010 due to the lack of insar data from 2011 to 2014 we cannot obtain the ground subsidence of jsoaa during this period nor the corresponding aquifer volume strain during this period to estimate the total volume strain of the aquifer between 2007 and 2020 we need to recover the volume strain of the aquifer from 2011 to 2014 by analyzing the time series insar deformation of jsoaa we found that the subsidence rate of the main deformation area in jsoaa was roughly equal in the two periods from 2007 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2020 fig 5 the well measured data suggests that the annual groundwater exploitation in changji city during 2006 2015 approximately shows a linearly increasing relationship fig 13 he 2019 kan et al 2019 the net loss of groundwater is positively correlated with ground subsidence in elastic half space the volume strain of the aquifer is linearly correlated with ground subsidence chen et al 2016b therefore we can estimate the volume strain rate of the aquifer between 2011 and 2014 using the volume strain rate of the aquifer from 2007 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2020 by the following formula 4 r 2 r 3 t 3 r 1 t 1 t 2 where t i is the time of the i th observation period r i represents the volume strain rate in t i the estimated volume strain rate from 2011 to 2014 is 0 239 km3 yr by multiplying and summing the volume strain rates of the three periods and the time of the corresponding periods i e vs i 1 3 r i t i we calculate that the total volume strain of the aquifer vs from 2007 to 2020 which is 2 73 km3 subsequently based on the aquifer storage coefficients in fukang and shawan depression obtained in section 5 3 and the aquifer volume strain we estimate that the total groundwater deficit of jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 is 23 95 km3 it should be noted that the data used for estimating the volume strain of the aquifer are the ground subsidence in the major subsidence areas obtained by insar we do not model the deformation regions with sporadic distribution and small magnitude this may lead to some deviation from the actual loss of groundwater although gravity satellite data can reflect the annual net loss of the terrestrial water its spatial resolution is low for example the spatial smoothing of grace satellite data is carried out for 200 km in feng et al 2013 therefore this method cannot reflect the spatio temporal evolution and distribution of regional surface subsidence areas insar technology with high spatial and temporal resolution can not only well reflect the spatio temporal development and evolution characteristics of subsidence areas but also achieve accurate estimation of net groundwater volume loss through refined volume strain modeling of the aquifer therefore insar has unique advantages in diagnosing the health of aquifers in agricultural areas 7 conclusions in this study we proposed an improved regional scale time series insar algorithm we also proposed an optimized vertical deformation solution strategy to convert the insar los deformation into the vertical direction and obtain the global vertical deformation rate using 1116 sar images covering the whole area of jsoaa including alos 1 palsar data from 13 tracks and 28 frames 2007 2010 and sentinel 1 data from 4 ascending tracks and 2 descending tracks 2015 2020 we obtained the first long term insar los deformation and regional scale subsidence results in jsoaa then we conducted a quantitative statistical analysis on the ground subsidence area and its change in jsoaa during 2007 2010 and 2015 2020 after analyzing the surface cover types the spatio temporal evolution characteristics of subsidence areas and the hydrogeological conditions we reveal the correlation between the ground subsidence caused by groundwater overexploitation and geographical location hydrogeological conditions and human activities in jsoaa an analytical model was used to model the ground subsidence areas associated with groundwater overexploitation based on groundwater exploitation data in fukang and shawan depression from the well we estimate the aquifer storage coefficients of these two depressions as 0 0894 and 0 1878 respectively by analyzing jsoaa s long term groundwater exploitation history we obtained the volume strain of the aquifer from 2011 to 2014 the total volume strain of aquifer in jsoaa during 2007 2020 is 2 73 km3 this result is comparable to the net loss of surface water volume estimated by satellite gravimetry then we calculated that the total aquifer deficit of jsoaa from 2007 to 2020 as 23 95 km3 the process of groundwater exploitation and recovery is complex in this study we obtained the spatio temporal evolution features of the ground deformation caused by aquifer overexploitation in jsoaa over a large time scale the volume strain caused by the net loss of jsoaa s aquifer is estimated by an analytical model due to the lack of high density groundwater exploitation data we used the groundwater exploitation volume obtained by several wells scattered in the agricultural area which inevitably has a certain deviation from the real groundwater exploitation volume to estimate the aquifer storage coefficients so our estimation may differ from the net loss of groundwater however we believe that this difference is acceptable and decreases with the accuracy improvement of the measured data the net loss of aquifer obtained by insar can directly reflect the contradiction between the rapid development and expansion of the jsoaa agricultural economy in recent years and the shortage of local water supply this study will serve for the rational development and utilization of groundwater resources in jsoaa and the sustainable development of the agricultural economy credit authorship contribution statement yuedong wang conceptualization methodology software project administration writing original draft guangcai

2788,hysteresis in floodplain lakes occurs between stage and lake area stage area hysteresis controls the storage and exchange of water and sediments and is a critical hydrological behavior for lake management while hysteresis has been repeatedly observed in the floodplain lakes of large rivers the hydrological mechanism and factors in control have been poorly understood thus far in this paper we investigate the role of geomorphology in controlling lake hysteresis specifically the geologic setting and the lake basin the lake position relative to the main stem of the river as well as the influence of lake shape and its internal depositional landforms on inundation dynamics we study the floodplain lakes along three of the largest rivers around the world the curuai lake of the amazon river the tonle sap lake of the mekong river and the poyang lake of the yangtze river the three lakes exhibit a similar counter clockwise stage area hysteresis for a given stage the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season our results indicate that hysteresis is mainly controlled by geomorphology where the lake shape and basin size lead to delays in the drainage and drop in lake area during the falling season resulting in counter clockwise hysteresis nevertheless the lakes are of distinct climatic and geologic geomorphic settings representing the variety in the lake types of large rivers hence while geomorphology is the overall driver unique lake characteristics delay the fall in water extent and shape hysteresis on a case by case nature at curuai the complex floodplain morphology impeded floodplain complicates and slows the routing of outflow at tonle sap the lake flows into the river solely through a narrow channel where a backwater effect restricts drainage at poyang the wide lake shape upstream leads to counter clockwise hysteresis while the narrow channel downstream exhibits clockwise hysteresis out of the three investigated floodplains tonle sap has the largest degree of hysteresis 0 41 followed by poyang 0 17 and curuai 0 13 this trend in hysteresis extent is a result of the different composition of inflow and the lake river hydrological connectivity attributed to lake geomorphology this study is the first to address geomorphology as the primary control over lake hysteresis which improves understanding of the stage area curve in empirical and numerical hydrological models and potentially floodplain management keywords floodplains geomorphology rating curve curuai lake poyang lake tonle sap lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floodplain lakes form an integral part of many river basins serving vital hydrological and ecological functions they exchange water sediments and nutrients with rivers continuously and are productive biodiversity hotspots home to many endemic species dunne et al 1998 junk and wantzen 2006 tan et al 2020 moreover they offer a range of ecosystem services from the provision of food and medicinal resources to groundwater recharge and flood peak attenuation lawrence et al 2019 maltby and ormerod 2011 to understand the dynamics of floodplain lakes and rivers complex non linear relationships have been investigated between hydrological parameters termed as hysteresis gharari and razavi 2018 hysteresis is defined as the lagging of one variable behind another as they vary cyclically causing a loop in their relationship ewing 1885 hysteretic relationships have been extensively studied in river hydrology such as between water level and discharge e g westphal et al 1999 petersen øverleir 2006 sediment transport and discharge e g bogen 1980 zhang et al 2021 as well as lake extent and temperature e g cui et al 2020 in particular recent studies have observed hysteresis between floodplain lake extent and water level where a given stage may correspond to more than one lake extent huang et al 2017 hysteresis controls the water storage and residence times in floodplain lakes which then influence the deposition and cycling of sediments and nutrients carried by the water dunne et al 1998 melack and bruce 2001 wetland flora and fauna dependent on the water and nutrient levels would in turn be affected by stage area hysteresis junk and wantzen 2006 in the middle lower amazon rudorff et al 2014a showed counter clockwise stage area hysteresis at the curuai lake using lisflood fp simulation where for a given stage the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season the hysteresis was briefly explained by the delay in the reversal of water flow due to the floodplain terrain similarly counter clockwise hysteresis was presented by ng and park 2021 using modis and landsat imagery at the tonle sap lake in the lower mekong basin zhang and werner 2015 used hydrodynamic modeling mike 21 to study clockwise and counter clockwise hysteresis between the water extent and stage of the poyang lake in the yangtze basin attributed to surface roughness like vegetation subsequently zhang et al 2017 suggested that the counter clockwise hysteresis is due to restricted drainage from the floodplain lake to the river while the clockwise hysteresis is related to backwater effects although stage area hysteresis has been repeatedly observed in floodplain lakes and reported through individual case studies the hysteric relationship is one of high complexity and low predictability as a result the physical mechanism that induces stage area hysteresis across floodplain lakes is poorly understood thus far and the fundamental control over this phenomenon has yet to be well addressed in this paper we investigate the mechanism of stage area hysteresis and the role of geomorphology in driving the hysteretic relationship we focus on the large floodplain lakes of three major rivers around the world the curuai lake along the middle lower amazon river the tonle sap lake in the lower mekong basin and the poyang lake of the lower yangtze river we provide a comparative assessment of the three floodplain lakes that exhibit a similar counter clockwise stage area hysteresis driven by geomorphology but are found in distinct climatic regimes and geologic geomorphic settings representing the characteristic range in the floodplain types of large river systems we obtain daily every eight days and monthly water level time series from nine stations and lake area every eight days from remote sensing data modis and other products lake area is plotted against water level to assess stage area hysteresis loops over five hydrological cycles at each lake we also utilized the degree of hysteresis to quantitatively compare the level of hysteresis across the three investigated lakes and their controlling geomorphic factors the significance and innovative aspects of our study lies in three main areas firstly we address geomorphology as the overarching factor on control over stage area hysteresis implicated by the unique geomorphic traits of individual lakes on a case by case nature latrubesse 2012 li et al 2020 vysotsky et al 1994 this comparative analysis across the representative floodplains of large rivers can not only improve the understanding of complex inundation dynamics but also the stage area curve in empirical and numerical hydrological modeling secondly in terms of our approach this study uses extensive field observations and remote sensing data current studies mostly use process based modeling e g huang et al 2017 rudorff et al 2014a zhang and werner 2015 where validation may be challenged by the limited availability of data from these remote floodplain lakes which may introduce some uncertainties to the models our robust method fully based on field and satellite observations could thus complement existing modeling studies thirdly this paper could improve the comprehension of floodplain hydrological behavior which aids in monitoring lake health and implementing lake management policies to sustain water resources and predict flood damages potentially in lakes impacted by human activities and climate change abtew et al 2007 karimi et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 our results on stage area hysteresis are also relevant to managing floodplain ecology namely aquatic animals and vegetation coverage dependent on the water level and the lake extent junk and wantzen 2006 hu et al 2015 2 study area three of the largest floodplain lakes 2 1 curuai lake in the amazon the amazon river is the world s largest river in terms of water discharge with the largest drainage basin curuai is a floodplain lake along the middle lower amazon near the city of óbidos pará brazil fig 1 a similar to other floodplains in the middle lower amazon curuai has an impeded floodplain morphology predominantly composed of a patch network of shallow and large round lakes interconnected by narrow floodplain channels ang et al 2021 alsdorf 2003 latrubesse 2012 the curuai lake extent varies seasonally between 850 and 2 250 km2 rudorff et al 2014a and curuai has a relatively small drainage basin of 3 328 km2 0 06 of the amazon basin bordered by the cretaceous rocks of the alter do chão formation in the south latrubesse and franzinelli 2002 curuai receives little tributary input from its small basin while 77 82 of its water inflow during the rising season comes from the amazon bonnet et al 2008 rudorff et al 2014a 2014b fig 1b the river water first enters curuai through channelized flow via levee breaching and subsequently through overbank flow when the water level in the river exceeds levee height park 2020 during the falling season the flow direction reverses and water drains from the floodplain into the river making up 94 6 of water outflow bonnet et al 2008 while droughts or floods from abnormal precipitation and evaporation occur espinoza et al 2022 shukla et al 1990 barkhordarian et al 2019 such extreme events are only episodic and the interannual hydrology over time is consistent 2 2 tonle sap lake in the mekong tonle sap is a floodplain lake in the lower mekong basin located in central cambodia fig 1c it largely has a flat bathymetry with similar lake depth in permanently flooded regions uk et al 2018 with a surface area of 2 500 to 13 000 km2 tonle sap is southeast asia s most extensive and productive seasonal freshwater lake mrc 2020 it lies in a big basin of 85 790 km2 11 of mekong basin which is a northwest southeast oriented shallow depression with quaternary sand and clay deposits overlying paleozoic metamorphic rocks tsukawaki et al 1994 vysotsky et al 1994 tributary input from the tonle sap basin makes up 29 1 34 0 of the lake s total inflow burnett et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 tonle sap is connected to the mekong river via the tonle sap river in its southeastern end mrc 2020 fig 1d through which it receives around 50 of its annual inflow during the rising season of the mekong river during the falling season water flows from the floodplain to the river instead which constitutes 84 86 4 of outflow the human impacts on tonle sap have been increasing with the growing population around the lake raising the rate of deforestation and the use of lake resources in the tonle sap basin furthermore climate change sand mining and hydropower dams have been suggested as the major causes of tonle sap shrinking in recent years kallio and kummu 2021 ng and park 2021 wang et al 2020 2 3 poyang lake in the yangtze poyang is a lake located in jiangxi province draining through hukou lake mouth into the lower yangtze river fig 1e as china s largest freshwater lake its area varies from below 1 000 km2 during the dry season to 3 585 km2 during the wet season and its basin area is extensive at 162 000 km2 9 of the yangtze basin li et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 the poyang basin has five main tributary rivers xiuhe ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe that contribute 91 2 93 2 of the lake s inflow following the seasonality of precipitation in the tributary basins li et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b while the lake is wide in the south the northern end is connected to the mainstem of the yangtze through a narrow and deep channel fig 1f wu and liu 2015 zhang et al 2017 water mostly flows from poyang into the river contributing to 86 9 97 4 of poyang s outflow but the flow direction reverses during peak flow and the lake receives 0 7 3 0 of its water inflow from the yangtze river the characteristics of poyang alternates between that of a lake at high stage with a mostly flat water surface and that of a river at low stage with a clear water surface slope zhang and werner 2015 the anthropogenic impacts at poyang are likely highest among investigated lakes mainly due to the three gorges dam located upstream in the yangtze that intensified the extremities in the water flow i e flood and drought zhang et al 2016a the hydrogeomorphic characteristics of the three lakes are summarized in table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrological data at gauge stations water level data were obtained over five continuous hydrological cycles at each lake within the most recent decade with overlapping years across the lakes table 2 at curuai daily and monthly water levels at the obidos and curuai gauge stations from 2012 to 2017 were obtained from the hydrology and geodynamics of the amazon basin hybam 2021 fig 2 a and 2b at tonle sap daily water levels at the kampong chhnang prek kdam and kampong luong gauge stations from 2014 to 2019 were obtained from the mekong river commission mrc water levels every eight days from the altimetry station tonle sap was also obtained from the database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2015 fig 2a 2c and 2d at poyang daily water levels at the datong hukou and kangshan gauge stations from 2012 to 2016 were obtained from china s hydrological yearbooks provided by the yangtze river commission yrc fig 2a 2e and 2f the water levels at all three lakes show strong seasonality a key similarity of large lowland floodplains fig 2 to visualize the variations in water levels over time the water surface slope was calculated between each lake and its river namely the obidos and curuai stations at curuai the prek kdam and kampong luong stations at tonle sap and the hukou and kangshan stations at poyang 3 2 extracting lake surface water extent moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra surface reflectance 8 day composite data at 500 m resolution mod09a1 v006 were used to extract the lake extent over five hydrological cycles at poyang 2012 to 2016 46 images were available per lake each year where the best observations were chosen for each pixel over eight days vermote 2015 the modis images were downloaded from the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac by the u s geological survey usgs and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to extract the lake extent the normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 was calculated from each image based on equation 1 below 1 ndwi green n i r green n i r band 4 band 2 band 4 band 2 where green refers to the green band band 4 in mod09a1 v006 and nir refers to the near infrared band band 2 in mod09a1 v006 the optimized threshold value to determine the water extent was visually identified after several simulations for each lake 0 modis data was similarly used to extract the lake extent at curuai 2014 to 2019 nevertheless the optical modis data may be insufficient for detecting water extent under the thicker canopy in the flooded forests of curuai hess et al 2015 thus we added the areas of the flooded forests extracted by arnesen et al 2013 from alos palsar scansar images which can penetrate the forest canopy and linearly interpolated over time the linear interpolation was conducted based on the assumption that the lake area of large river floodplains like curuai gradually rise and fall over time in a predictable manner lastly the lake extent at tonle sap 2014 to 2019 was obtained from dahiti the dahiti approach extracts the lake area from optical images landsat at 30 m resolution and sentinel 2 at 10 m resolution using five water indices and an automated threshold computation and fills data gaps using a long term water probability mask schwatke et al 2019 3 3 stage area hysteresis and comparative analysis the extracted water extent was plotted against the water level every 8 days on average over five hydrological cycles at each lake anomalous dips and spikes in the water content attributed to environmental factors like uneven cloud cover were manually filtered out in general data points with a continuous increasing or decreasing trend were retained over 70 of data while the water level data from the curuai and tonle sap gauge stations were complete short gaps 16 days i e two 8 day data points of missing data for the poyang gauge stations and the tonle sap altimetry station were filled with linearly interpolated values longer periods with missing data were excluded from the analysis the stage area graphs obtained were split into rising and falling seasons based on the minimum and maximum water level in each hydrological cycle a best fit fourth degree polynomial was obtained per season for every hydrological cycle resulting in five hysteresis loops for each lake the hysteresis loops can be characterized by 1 direction clockwise or counter clockwise 2 shape e g circular linear eight shaped elliptical rectangular and 3 degree of hysteresis calculated from the loop area cui et al 2020 zuecco et al 2016 to compare the degree of hysteresis across the lakes we obtain dimensionless stage area hysteresis loops by normalizing the water level and lake area using equations 2 and 3 below we take the area enclosed within the loops as the degree of hysteresis calculated through integration in matlab 2 h h h min h max h min 3 a a a min a max a min where h is the normalized water level h is the water level hmin is the minimum water level hmax is the maximum water level a is the normalized lake area a is the lake area amin is the minimum lake area and amax is the maximum lake area the data used in this study are summarized in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 stage area hysteresis in floodplain lakes 4 1 1 hysteresis of curuai lake hysteresis is observed between the curuai lake area and the water level at both the obidos station in the amazon river fig 3 a and the curuai station in curuai lake fig 3b the stage area hysteresis forms an eight shaped loop where the main hysteresis direction is counter clockwise for a given water level the curuai lake extent is larger in the falling season red line than in the rising season blue line fig 3a and 3b the same hysteresis direction was observed by rudorff et al 2014a between lisflood fp modeled lake area and the water level at the curuai station and by park 2017 between the lake area extracted from modis and the water level at the obidos station upstream of curuai at a morphologically similar miratuba floodplain eight shaped counter clockwise hysteresis was also observed by park and latrubesse 2017 between the lake area from the remote sensing data and the water level at the itacoatiara station to better visualize the relationship between the lake area and the water level fig 3c shows a time series of the two variables while the water levels at both gauge stations form a smooth curve in each hydrological cycle the water extent appears box like the start of the rising season marked by the first increase in stage is in november as the stage rises water from the river flows into the curuai lake the lake area increases correspondingly but starts growing with a time lag of around one month i e in december then reaches maximum first in march fig 3c the water level subsequently peaks in may june and starts decreasing gradually in the falling season but the lake extent remains approximately constant up to late august before falling until december fig 3c it should be noted that an extreme flood occurred in 2017 due to abnormal rainfall espinoza et al 2022 fig 3c which altered the degree of hysteresis in the 2016 17 cycle but the counter clockwise hysteresis direction remained the same at both obidos and curuai fig 3a c while the constant lake area from march to august may be due to a balance between floodplain inflow and outflow rudorff et al 2017 the delayed fall in lake area and the counter clockwise stage area hysteresis could be attributed to the lag in water outflow as a result of the curuai lake morphology curuai has an impeded floodplain morphology which dominantly consists of large and shallow round lakes the round lakes are separated by ridges and connected to each other and to the amazon river by floodplain channels latrubesse 2012 during the falling season water gradually flows out from curuai to the river through both overbank flow from exceeding levee height and channelized flow from breaching levees while overbank flow mainly occurs in the parts of curuai nearer to the river the order of channelized drainage from the round lakes is not reliant on the distance from the river park and latrubesse 2017 for instance some locally elevated proximal lakes may drain later than distal lakes of lower elevation ang et al 2021 as such the round lakes and the floodplain channels are interconnected in a maze like fashion alsdorf 2003 this complex routing of channelized flow is combined with the constricted passage of water through the narrow floodplain channels moreover the round lakes have to drain sequentially where each round lake drains individually before water can leave the next connected floodplain these three factors together lead to the delayed fall in lake area and thus the counter clockwise hysteresis loop fig 3a and 3b with a higher lake area in the falling season than the rising season for a given water level exacerbated by ponding in localized depressions zhang and werner 2015 another explanation for the hysteresis was briefly put forth by rudorff et al 2014a who suggest that the water entering the floodplain through the east is delayed by the flow reversal from falling to rising season and a long traveling distance before reaching the western floodplain with a flatter terrain and more space for the water extent to expand nevertheless water enters the curuai floodplain near the western margin as well visually determined from sediment plumes in landsat imagery fig 3d hence we propose the rounded lake morphology as an alternative reason behind the hysteresis from the curuai station to the obidos station the mean water surface slope is always negative since the water level at the curuai station is always higher fig 3c and 3e this suggests that water flows from curuai to obidos throughout the year along the eastern margin of curuai where the levees are thinner and shallower at the same time water enters curuai along the western boundary evidenced by the sediment plumes fig 3d the co occurrence of inflow and outflow in curuai is supported by lisflood fp modeling conducted by rudorff et al 2017 the dominant flow in curuai is thus uni directional with curuai acting as a bypass and a storage unit of water from the amazon river in the rising season as the water level in the river increases the water surface slope from the floodplain to the river becomes gentler by around 1 cm km from november to january fig 3e the water surface slope then remains roughly constant throughout the late rising season peak flow and the early falling season before steepening by 1 cm km from late august to november which allows more water to leave the curuai lake like the lake area the time series of the water surface slope also has a box like shape and the steepening of the slope from august to november corresponds with the timing of the fall in lake extent fig 3c the delay in the steepening of the slope until august early falling season suggests a delay in water outflow from curuai to the river which further explains the lag in the drop in lake area and thus the counter clockwise stage area hysteresis 4 1 2 hysteresis of tonle sap lake the tonle sap lake shares a similar stage area hysteresis direction and delayed decrease in water extent as curuai counter clockwise hysteresis is seen between the tonle sap lake area and the water level at the kampong chhnang station in the mekong river fig 4 a the prek kdam station in the tonle sap river fig 4b as well as the kampong luong and tonle sap stations in the tonle sap lake fig 4c and 4d unlike the eight shaped hysteresis pattern at curuai the hysteresis loops at tonle sap are circular to elliptical with a clear counter clockwise direction the same hysteresis direction was observed by ng and park 2021 between the lake area extracted from modis and landsat imagery and the water level at the tonle sap altimetry station over time both the water level and the lake area appear less smooth as compared to curuai but the water level still forms a smoother peak in each hydrological cycle while lake area forms a sharper peak fig 4e the stage first rises in april may and peaks in september october before falling until february march from february march to april may the water level remains relatively constant at the prek kdam and kampong chhnang stations in the river but decreases slightly at the kampong luong and tonle sap stations in the lake the lake area varies correspondingly but with a slight delay first rising in may june peaking in october then falling gradually until may june fig 4e a similar trend in lake extent is presented by chang et al 2020 based on modis and sentinel 1 data with rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis like curuai the delayed drop in the lake extent and the counter clockwise hysteresis could be due to the lag in water outflow caused by the tonle sap lake morphology the large northwest southeast oriented tonle sap lake is connected to the mekong river solely through the narrow 100 km long tonle sap river at its southeastern tip mrc 2020 fig 1d hence channelized flow is the only form of water transport between the tonle sap lake and the mekong river unlike curuai where both overbank and channelized flow are present park and latrubesse 2017 from the kampong luong station in the lake to the prek kdam station in the tonle sap river the water surface slope is largely positive where the water level in the lake at kampong luong is usually lower fig 4f the positive slope reflects the morphology of tonle sap a lake lying in a shallow depression tsukawaki et al 1994 vysotsky et al 1994 during the rising season the slope ranges from around 0 4 to 1 5 cm km hence water from the mekong river flows into the lake through the tonle sap river during the falling season the mean water surface slope ranges from around 0 7 to 0 4 cm km remaining below 0 for most of the season fig 4f the water level in the lake is higher instead thus the water direction reverses and flows from the lake to the river li et al 2019a this seasonal reversal of flow in the tonle sap river contrasts with the unidirectional flow in curuai as water from the tonle sap lake drains through the tonle sap river in the falling season a backwater effect occurs at the confluence with the mekong river jantunen 2007 the backwater effect propagates far up the 100 km long channel into the tonle sap lake enhanced by the narrow morphology of the tonle sap river and the large volume of water contained within the tonle sap depression moreover channelized flow via the tonle sap river is the sole exit for outflow with the lack of alternative channels or overbank flow as a result up to 74 km3 of water from tonle sap attempts to drain through the 400 m wide channel restricted by the transport capacity of the tonle sap river leading to a strong backwater effect kummu et al 2014 meade et al 1991 ng and park 2021 subsequently the fall in lake extent lags behind water level resulting in the counter clockwise hysteresis fig 4a 4d in particular the hysteresis extent at prek kdam in the tonle sap river appears the largest fig 4b where the backwater effect is the strongest besides the backwater effect in the narrow tonle sap river a secondary reason for the stage area hysteresis and the delayed fall in lake area could be inputs from tributaries and groundwater inflow although the lake stage starts falling in october the discharge from tributaries in the tonle sap basin peaks in october and the groundwater discharge peaks in november burnett et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 the tributary discharge and the groundwater take time to feed into tonle sap and they make up 29 1 34 0 and 10 9 of tonle sap s inflow respectively slowing down the decrease in the lake area in the falling season moreover the highly shallow and flat bathymetry of the tonle sap means that even a small volume of input would be sufficient in maintaining the lake extent uk et al 2018 overall the backwater effect in the narrow and long tonle sap river and secondarily the relatively high tributary and groundwater input and shallow shape of tonle sap are ultimately attributed to the lake morphology which leads to the counter clockwise stage area hysteresis and the delayed drop in the lake extent it should be highlighted that tonle sap s flat morphology varies greatly from the geomorphically complex rounded lakes of curuai yet both exhibit the same hysteresis direction and lag in decrease in water extent therefore the general hysteretic direction may appear similar across lakes but the unique lake traits should be considered on a case by case basis 4 1 3 hysteresis of poyang lake like tonle sap poyang is a seasonal freshwater lake connected to the main river through a relatively narrow channel li et al 2019a yet interestingly both hysteresis directions are present at poyang clockwise hysteresis is seen between the poyang lake area and the stage at the datong station in the yangtze river fig 5 a clockwise hysteresis is also observed with the water level in the lake mouth at the hukou station fig 5b suggesting that the stage at hukou is largely controlled by the yangtze as similarly discussed by huang et al 2017 however the extent of the poyang lake and the water level further upstream in the lake at the kangshan station display a counter clockwise hysteresis fig 5c the presence of both hysteresis directions at poyang is also reported between the modeled lake area and the stage including at hukou and kangshan in previous studies e g huang et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 unlike at curuai and tonle sap the shape of the hysteresis loops at poyang appears linear to elliptical notably the loops at datong and hukou have a wider base and narrower top which is similarly presented by zhang and werner 2015 over time the changes in the stage and the lake area appear spikier and less consistent than at the other lakes fig 5d the water levels at all three gauge stations first rise in january before peaking in june july at datong and hukou and slightly earlier in june at kangshan subsequently the water level falls until january the lake area first rises around december to february peaks in june to august before falling again fig 5d it should be noted that the water levels and the water extent in late 2015 and early 2016 were anomalously high due to an unusual winter flood zeng et al 2017 fig 5d the winter flood altered the degree of hysteresis in the 2015 2016 cycle but the hysteresis directions remained the same fig 5a c we attribute the presence of both hysteresis directions to the differences in lake morphology and hydrological control upstream at kangshan and downstream at hukou upstream at kangshan the wide lake morphology means that the upstream extent makes up most of the overall lake area during the rising season poyang receives over 90 of its water through catchment inflow especially in april to june when catchment inflow peaks li et al 2020 as most of the catchment inflow enters upstream poyang first the water level and the water extent rises in sync at kangshan zhang and werner 2015 during the falling season the catchment inflow ceases and the water level at kangshan drops however as up to 97 of the lake water drains into yangtze through the lake mouth 170 km downstream there is a lag in the drainage of the wide upstream lake extent yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b resulting in a counter clockwise hysteresis upstream at kangshan fig 5c downstream at hukou the lake morphology is a narrow channel during the rising season time is needed for the upstream catchment inflow to travel through poyang to hukou zhang et al 2017 moreover the main hydrological control is the proximal yangtze river which is still in its early rising stage thus the rise in hukou stage lags behind the rise in the water extent and the kangshan stage upstream during the peak and early falling season the water at hukou attempts to drain into the yangtze river nevertheless the high yangtze stage leads to a strong backwater effect enhanced by the narrow lake morphology where the obstruction of outflow increases the water level at hukou hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 for a given stage the stage is higher in the falling season than rising season resulting in a clockwise hysteresis downstream at hukou fig 5b the backwater effect is attenuated in the upstream direction by a wider lake morphology leading to a decreasing degree of clockwise hysteresis from hukou to progressively upstream gauge stations xingzi duchang followed by tangyin huang et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 at kangshan the furthest upstream station the backwater effect is no longer present and the dominant hydrological control is the catchment inflow instead suggesting a geomorphic threshold between tangyin and kangshan and a reversal in hysteresis direction as mentioned the stage at upstream kangshan is only dependent on the catchment inflow while the stage at downstream hukou is dominantly influenced by the yangtze river and secondarily influenced by the delayed catchment input this difference in hydrological control is due to the locations of kangshan and hukou and the varying timing of peak flow driven by monsoon rainfalls april to june for the catchment tributaries but july to september for the yangtze river guo et al 2012 moreover the smaller poyang sub basin is more sensitive to rainfall and peaks earlier with the rain compared to the larger yangtze basin with a longer basin lag time and a slower flood response mimikou 1984 pilgrim et al 1982 thus the kangshan station always has a higher stage than the hukou station resulting in a steep negative slope from kangshan to hukou most of the time fig 5e the water surface slope only reaches a near horizontal or slight positive when the yangtze river peaks in july and the stage at the hukou station increases resulting in some reverse flow of water from the river to the lake that contributes to less than 3 of poyang s inflow zhang et al 2016b the difference in hydrology at kangshan and hukou and hence stage area hysteresis is also a form of geomorphic control specifically the difference in the basin hierarchy and size between the poyang sub basin and the yangtze basin with the water surface slope at poyang lying below 0 almost throughout the year compared to the seasonally changing water surface slope at tonle sap three differences between poyang and tonle sap can be discussed 1 while the flow direction reverses in the tonle sap river depending on the season the flow in poyang is mostly unidirectional from the lake to the river li et al 2020 therefore 2 the backwater effect at the poyang lake mouth lasts throughout the year unlike at tonle sap where the backwater effect only occurs in the falling season nevertheless the backwater effect at poyang is still the strongest in the peak and early falling season when the stage in the yangtze river is the highest zhang and werner 2015 3 tonle sap acts as a typical floodplain lake lying on the alluvial plain and exchanging water with the main river just like curuai latrubesse 2012 ngun et al 2011 these two lakes receive many sediments from the river over time evidenced by their round shapes smoothened by deposited sediments park 2020 szczuciński et al 2013 in contrast although poyang is also a floodplain lake it has significant river and tributary like characteristics feeding into the yangtze river most of the time zhang et al 2017 poyang is an incised lake under structural control evidenced by its blocky shape yao et al 2018 in the narrow river like poyang the backwater effect slows the decrease in hukou stage in the falling season leading to a clockwise hysteresis in the wide floodplain like tonle sap the backwater effect slows the decrease in lake area in the falling season resulting in a counter clockwise hysteresis this highlights the complexity of stage area hysteresis where a single factor cannot be correlated with a certain hysteresis direction as it depends on the overall lake geomorphology 4 2 comparison of stage area hysteresis geomorphic controls and human impacts the areas of all three lakes similarly exhibit strong seasonality a key characteristic of large lowland floodplain lakes fig 6 comparing the normalized stage area hysteresis loops across the lakes it is evident that the hysteresis shape varies strongly from lake to lake zuecco et al 2016 eight shaped in curuai circular to elliptical in tonle sap and elliptical to linear in poyang fig 7 a besides the shape the area within the loops degree extent of hysteresis are also distinctly different where tonle sap has the highest mean degree 0 41 followed by poyang 0 17 and curuai 0 13 fig 7b and table 3 the calculated means at poyang and curuai exclude the last hydrological cycle when the hysteresis degree was altered by abnormal floods espinoza et al 2022 zeng et al 2017 the order of hysteresis extent corresponds with the order of lake size from the largest tonle sap to the smallest curuai fig 6 and table 1 this suggests a stronger dissonance between the water level and the lake area as the lake area increases larger lakes have 1 a wider area for more ponding in localized depressions and 2 a farther traveling distance for water and hence a longer time lag between the lake outflow at the mouth and the drainage upstream in the lake zhang and werner 2015 these two factors delay the drop in the lake extent during the falling season and lead to a stronger counter clockwise hysteresis more specifically in our studied lakes the large lake area and volume of water in tonle sap enhances the backwater effect jamming the tonle sap river and restricting outflow during the dry season jantunen 2007 meade et al 1991 in poyang the large lake area results in disharmonious changes in the water level the stage downstream responds slower to upstream catchment inflow in the rising season while the stage upstream responds slower to downstream drainage at the lake mouth in the falling season leading to the contrasting hysteresis direction across poyang zhang et al 2017 the stronger degree of hysteresis at tonle sap and poyang compared to at curuai can also be attributed to the sources of inflow and the hydrological connectivity at each lake while tonle sap and poyang receive much tributary input at 29 1 34 and 91 93 of total inflow respectively curuai receives 77 82 of inflow from the main river table 1 moreover tonle sap and poyang are hydrologically connected to the main river solely through channelized flow unlike curuai which receives both overbank and channelized flow from the river li et al 2020 park and latrubesse 2017 these differences in the composition of inflow and the lake river connectivity are mainly related to the geomorphology of the lakes tonle sap and poyang lie in large sub basins with many tributaries located farther away from the main river and receiving inflow or feeding into the river only via a narrow channel hence they have more tributary input weaker lake river connectivity and relatively stronger hysteresis kummu et al 2014 mrc 2020 zhang et al 2017 in contrast curuai lies in a relatively small sub basin with almost no tributary input located directly next to the main river curuai constantly exchanges inflow and outflow with the amazon throughout a hydrological year thus it is under significant hydrological control of the river rudorff et al 2014b the lake river connectivity at curuai is stronger and the lake area varies more in sync with the seasonality of the main river resulting in a weaker hysteresis at curuai than at poyang and tonle sap across the lakes the degree of hysteresis at the mouth of the lakes and in the main rivers is largely stronger than the degree of hysteresis within the lakes fig 7b and table 3 at curuai the hysteresis extent in the amazon river obidos is 0 13 compared to a slightly lower extent in the lake curuai at 0 12 at tonle sap the mean hysteresis extent in the mekong river and the tonle sap river kampong chhnang and prek kdam is 0 50 while the mean extent in the lake kampong luong and tonle sap is much lower at 0 32 at poyang the mean hysteresis extent in the yangtze river and the lake mouth datong and hukou is higher at 0 19 contrasted with 0 14 in the lake kangshan this trend is expected as the lake area varies more closely with the stage in the lake than with the stage in the main river or the lake mouth which is influenced by the stage in the main river huang et al 2017 notably the difference between the lake and the river hysteresis extent also increases from curuai to poyang to tonle sap suggesting that the above discussions on the lake area the composition of inflow the lake river hydrological connectivity and the lake geomorphology also apply here tonle sap and poyang are connected to the main river only through a narrow channel where the stronger tributary input and the weaker hydrological connectivity increase the disparities between the lake and river hysteresis in comparison curuai lies directly next to the amazon river thus the hysteresis extent in the lake and the river are more similar together with geomorphic controls human activities may play a role in influencing lake hysteresis while curuai has relatively minimal anthropogenic impacts tonle sap and poyang are affected by sand mining and upstream dams at tonle sap extensive sand mining is carried out in the mekong river leading to riverbed incision ng and park 2021 park et al 2020 the downcutting is exacerbated by the proliferation of upstream dams which trap sediments and result in sediment starved hungry water downstream of the dams that scour the channel bed kondolf 1997 van binh et al 2020 riverbed incision lowers the channel stage reducing the exchange of water between the river and the tonle sap lake hence decreasing the lake river connectivity and possibly contributing to tonle sap having the highest hysteresis extent at poyang upstream dams like the three gorges dam similarly lead to channel incision reducing the low flow water stages in the river li et al 2019b however sand mining largely occurs within the lake eroding the lake bed and increasing the lake storage capacity yao et al 2019 moreover as discussed previously in section 4 1 3 unlike at tonle sap where the flow direction reverses in the tonle sap river depending on the season the flow in poyang is mostly unidirectional from the lake to the river li et al 2020 the larger lake storage capacity from sand mining and the lower river stage from upstream dams could increase the outflow from the poyang lake to the yangtze river during the falling season zhang et al 2016a this may reduce the lag between the lake area and the water level suggesting why poyang has a lower hysteresis degree than tonle sap the geomorphic controls and the influence of human activities on stage area hysteresis are summarized in fig 8 4 3 advancement in lake hydrology and management implications our results could improve understanding on the relationships between hydrological parameters or in other terms rating curves willis 2011 while parameters like water level can be measured directly with relative ease other variables such as discharge water quality and sediment concentration require more sophisticated methods and are logistically challenging thus these variables are often indirectly measured through rating curves especially in remote or less developed regions with limited observational data available dottori et al 2009 jansson 1996 in particular stage area curves or volume stage area relationships have been established to estimate the lake area and the volume from the stage malik and pal 2021 ng and park 2021 these stage area rating curves are commonly used in empirical and numerical hydrological models as an alternative to remote sensing abdulkareem et al 2018 klemes 1982 hysteresis could introduce uncertainties to the rating curves and the hydrological models yet there have only been a few studies focused on specific individual lakes e g rudorff et al 2014a zhang and werner 2015 and limited investigation regarding the cause behind lake hysteresis through comparing three representative large floodplain lakes this paper is the first to address geomorphology as the main control over stage area hysteresis furthermore our study can facilitate floodplain lake management as the water extent is one of the main indicators of lake dynamics the stage area curve is widely used in the implementation of management policies to sustain water resources huang et al 2017 the stage area relationship is also used in modeling to predict and respond to extreme events such as to estimate flood damages and evaluate mitigation measures like community relocation cummings et al 2012 or to study the shrinking of lakes impacted by human activities and climate change li et al 2016 liu et al 2013 ng and park 2021 for example the proposed sluice gate that will cut across poyang lake may alter the stage area relationship and result in unpredictable environmental consequences ho et al 2021 this paper highlights the importance of considering hysteresis for more realistic estimations of the changing lake extent and the risk of extreme events and the damages incurred abtew et al 2007 smith 1994 moreover a stronger lake hysteresis reflects a greater delay in drainage and a longer water residence time in lakes this influences the water sediment and nutrient budgets and the biogeochemical cycles of rivers and floodplain lakes dunne et al 1998 aquatic animals dependent on the water and the nutrient levels would in turn be affected by the stage area hysteresis junk and wantzen 2006 for instance while the shrinking poyang lake with lower water levels and smaller lake areas has created wetlands suitable for migratory waterbirds there has been a loss in mudflats and submerged areas for aquatic species to live in dong et al 2015 hu et al 2015 mu et al 2022 the coverage and health of the floodplain ecosystems would evolve with the changing lake area and depth hence our study on the hysteretic behavior of floodplains is potentially relevant to sustaining the lake ecosystems and the biodiversity of large rivers 5 conclusion this paper investigates the role of geomorphology as the key control over stage area hysteresis at three floodplain lakes the curuai lake of the amazon river the tonle sap lake of the mekong river and the poyang lake of the yangtze river these lakes represent the various types of seasonal lowland floodplains along large rivers and they display a similar counter clockwise hysteresis for a given stage the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season across the lakes hysteresis is under the overarching control of geomorphology where factors like the lake shape and the basin size delay the decrease in the lake area during the falling season leading to the same counter clockwise hysteresis direction however the lakes are of unique climatic and geologic geomorphic settings that delay the fall in the lake area cause counter clockwise hysteresis and determine the degree and the shape of hysteresis on a case by case basis to summarize the main but heterogenous geomorphic controls of the investigated floodplains the impeded floodplain morphology of curuai complicates and slows the routing of outflow latrubesse 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 the narrow channel but large depression of tonle sap causes a strong backwater effect that restricts drainage jantunen 2007 meade et al 1991 the contrasting lake shape and hydrological control attributed to basin hierarchy at poyang result in counter clockwise hysteresis upstream but clockwise hysteresis downstream pilgrim et al 1982 zhang et al 2017 tonle sap exhibits the largest degree of hysteresis with circular to elliptical stage area loops 0 41 followed by poyang s elliptical to linear loops 0 17 and the eight shaped hysteresis at curuai 0 13 while tonle sap and poyang receive more tributary input and are connected to the main river only through a narrow channel curuai primarily receives inflow from the main river through both overbank and channelized flow kumme et al 2014 li et al 2020 rudorff et al 2014b park and latrubesse 2017 thus the lake river hydrological connectivity at curuai is stronger where the lake area varies more in sync with the main river leading to a weaker hysteresis in sum the floodplain geomorphology has been identified as the main control over the hysteresis direction while the unique lake morphology causes counter clockwise hysteresis and results in different hysteresis extent and shape this paper is the first to address geomorphology as the major control over the hysteretic relationship between the stage and the area in large floodplain lakes which has been observed in several studies our results can improve the understanding of the stage area rating curve in empirical and numerical hydrological models

2788,hysteresis in floodplain lakes occurs between stage and lake area stage area hysteresis controls the storage and exchange of water and sediments and is a critical hydrological behavior for lake management while hysteresis has been repeatedly observed in the floodplain lakes of large rivers the hydrological mechanism and factors in control have been poorly understood thus far in this paper we investigate the role of geomorphology in controlling lake hysteresis specifically the geologic setting and the lake basin the lake position relative to the main stem of the river as well as the influence of lake shape and its internal depositional landforms on inundation dynamics we study the floodplain lakes along three of the largest rivers around the world the curuai lake of the amazon river the tonle sap lake of the mekong river and the poyang lake of the yangtze river the three lakes exhibit a similar counter clockwise stage area hysteresis for a given stage the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season our results indicate that hysteresis is mainly controlled by geomorphology where the lake shape and basin size lead to delays in the drainage and drop in lake area during the falling season resulting in counter clockwise hysteresis nevertheless the lakes are of distinct climatic and geologic geomorphic settings representing the variety in the lake types of large rivers hence while geomorphology is the overall driver unique lake characteristics delay the fall in water extent and shape hysteresis on a case by case nature at curuai the complex floodplain morphology impeded floodplain complicates and slows the routing of outflow at tonle sap the lake flows into the river solely through a narrow channel where a backwater effect restricts drainage at poyang the wide lake shape upstream leads to counter clockwise hysteresis while the narrow channel downstream exhibits clockwise hysteresis out of the three investigated floodplains tonle sap has the largest degree of hysteresis 0 41 followed by poyang 0 17 and curuai 0 13 this trend in hysteresis extent is a result of the different composition of inflow and the lake river hydrological connectivity attributed to lake geomorphology this study is the first to address geomorphology as the primary control over lake hysteresis which improves understanding of the stage area curve in empirical and numerical hydrological models and potentially floodplain management keywords floodplains geomorphology rating curve curuai lake poyang lake tonle sap lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floodplain lakes form an integral part of many river basins serving vital hydrological and ecological functions they exchange water sediments and nutrients with rivers continuously and are productive biodiversity hotspots home to many endemic species dunne et al 1998 junk and wantzen 2006 tan et al 2020 moreover they offer a range of ecosystem services from the provision of food and medicinal resources to groundwater recharge and flood peak attenuation lawrence et al 2019 maltby and ormerod 2011 to understand the dynamics of floodplain lakes and rivers complex non linear relationships have been investigated between hydrological parameters termed as hysteresis gharari and razavi 2018 hysteresis is defined as the lagging of one variable behind another as they vary cyclically causing a loop in their relationship ewing 1885 hysteretic relationships have been extensively studied in river hydrology such as between water level and discharge e g westphal et al 1999 petersen øverleir 2006 sediment transport and discharge e g bogen 1980 zhang et al 2021 as well as lake extent and temperature e g cui et al 2020 in particular recent studies have observed hysteresis between floodplain lake extent and water level where a given stage may correspond to more than one lake extent huang et al 2017 hysteresis controls the water storage and residence times in floodplain lakes which then influence the deposition and cycling of sediments and nutrients carried by the water dunne et al 1998 melack and bruce 2001 wetland flora and fauna dependent on the water and nutrient levels would in turn be affected by stage area hysteresis junk and wantzen 2006 in the middle lower amazon rudorff et al 2014a showed counter clockwise stage area hysteresis at the curuai lake using lisflood fp simulation where for a given stage the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season the hysteresis was briefly explained by the delay in the reversal of water flow due to the floodplain terrain similarly counter clockwise hysteresis was presented by ng and park 2021 using modis and landsat imagery at the tonle sap lake in the lower mekong basin zhang and werner 2015 used hydrodynamic modeling mike 21 to study clockwise and counter clockwise hysteresis between the water extent and stage of the poyang lake in the yangtze basin attributed to surface roughness like vegetation subsequently zhang et al 2017 suggested that the counter clockwise hysteresis is due to restricted drainage from the floodplain lake to the river while the clockwise hysteresis is related to backwater effects although stage area hysteresis has been repeatedly observed in floodplain lakes and reported through individual case studies the hysteric relationship is one of high complexity and low predictability as a result the physical mechanism that induces stage area hysteresis across floodplain lakes is poorly understood thus far and the fundamental control over this phenomenon has yet to be well addressed in this paper we investigate the mechanism of stage area hysteresis and the role of geomorphology in driving the hysteretic relationship we focus on the large floodplain lakes of three major rivers around the world the curuai lake along the middle lower amazon river the tonle sap lake in the lower mekong basin and the poyang lake of the lower yangtze river we provide a comparative assessment of the three floodplain lakes that exhibit a similar counter clockwise stage area hysteresis driven by geomorphology but are found in distinct climatic regimes and geologic geomorphic settings representing the characteristic range in the floodplain types of large river systems we obtain daily every eight days and monthly water level time series from nine stations and lake area every eight days from remote sensing data modis and other products lake area is plotted against water level to assess stage area hysteresis loops over five hydrological cycles at each lake we also utilized the degree of hysteresis to quantitatively compare the level of hysteresis across the three investigated lakes and their controlling geomorphic factors the significance and innovative aspects of our study lies in three main areas firstly we address geomorphology as the overarching factor on control over stage area hysteresis implicated by the unique geomorphic traits of individual lakes on a case by case nature latrubesse 2012 li et al 2020 vysotsky et al 1994 this comparative analysis across the representative floodplains of large rivers can not only improve the understanding of complex inundation dynamics but also the stage area curve in empirical and numerical hydrological modeling secondly in terms of our approach this study uses extensive field observations and remote sensing data current studies mostly use process based modeling e g huang et al 2017 rudorff et al 2014a zhang and werner 2015 where validation may be challenged by the limited availability of data from these remote floodplain lakes which may introduce some uncertainties to the models our robust method fully based on field and satellite observations could thus complement existing modeling studies thirdly this paper could improve the comprehension of floodplain hydrological behavior which aids in monitoring lake health and implementing lake management policies to sustain water resources and predict flood damages potentially in lakes impacted by human activities and climate change abtew et al 2007 karimi et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 our results on stage area hysteresis are also relevant to managing floodplain ecology namely aquatic animals and vegetation coverage dependent on the water level and the lake extent junk and wantzen 2006 hu et al 2015 2 study area three of the largest floodplain lakes 2 1 curuai lake in the amazon the amazon river is the world s largest river in terms of water discharge with the largest drainage basin curuai is a floodplain lake along the middle lower amazon near the city of óbidos pará brazil fig 1 a similar to other floodplains in the middle lower amazon curuai has an impeded floodplain morphology predominantly composed of a patch network of shallow and large round lakes interconnected by narrow floodplain channels ang et al 2021 alsdorf 2003 latrubesse 2012 the curuai lake extent varies seasonally between 850 and 2 250 km2 rudorff et al 2014a and curuai has a relatively small drainage basin of 3 328 km2 0 06 of the amazon basin bordered by the cretaceous rocks of the alter do chão formation in the south latrubesse and franzinelli 2002 curuai receives little tributary input from its small basin while 77 82 of its water inflow during the rising season comes from the amazon bonnet et al 2008 rudorff et al 2014a 2014b fig 1b the river water first enters curuai through channelized flow via levee breaching and subsequently through overbank flow when the water level in the river exceeds levee height park 2020 during the falling season the flow direction reverses and water drains from the floodplain into the river making up 94 6 of water outflow bonnet et al 2008 while droughts or floods from abnormal precipitation and evaporation occur espinoza et al 2022 shukla et al 1990 barkhordarian et al 2019 such extreme events are only episodic and the interannual hydrology over time is consistent 2 2 tonle sap lake in the mekong tonle sap is a floodplain lake in the lower mekong basin located in central cambodia fig 1c it largely has a flat bathymetry with similar lake depth in permanently flooded regions uk et al 2018 with a surface area of 2 500 to 13 000 km2 tonle sap is southeast asia s most extensive and productive seasonal freshwater lake mrc 2020 it lies in a big basin of 85 790 km2 11 of mekong basin which is a northwest southeast oriented shallow depression with quaternary sand and clay deposits overlying paleozoic metamorphic rocks tsukawaki et al 1994 vysotsky et al 1994 tributary input from the tonle sap basin makes up 29 1 34 0 of the lake s total inflow burnett et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 tonle sap is connected to the mekong river via the tonle sap river in its southeastern end mrc 2020 fig 1d through which it receives around 50 of its annual inflow during the rising season of the mekong river during the falling season water flows from the floodplain to the river instead which constitutes 84 86 4 of outflow the human impacts on tonle sap have been increasing with the growing population around the lake raising the rate of deforestation and the use of lake resources in the tonle sap basin furthermore climate change sand mining and hydropower dams have been suggested as the major causes of tonle sap shrinking in recent years kallio and kummu 2021 ng and park 2021 wang et al 2020 2 3 poyang lake in the yangtze poyang is a lake located in jiangxi province draining through hukou lake mouth into the lower yangtze river fig 1e as china s largest freshwater lake its area varies from below 1 000 km2 during the dry season to 3 585 km2 during the wet season and its basin area is extensive at 162 000 km2 9 of the yangtze basin li et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 yao et al 2018 the poyang basin has five main tributary rivers xiuhe ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe that contribute 91 2 93 2 of the lake s inflow following the seasonality of precipitation in the tributary basins li et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b while the lake is wide in the south the northern end is connected to the mainstem of the yangtze through a narrow and deep channel fig 1f wu and liu 2015 zhang et al 2017 water mostly flows from poyang into the river contributing to 86 9 97 4 of poyang s outflow but the flow direction reverses during peak flow and the lake receives 0 7 3 0 of its water inflow from the yangtze river the characteristics of poyang alternates between that of a lake at high stage with a mostly flat water surface and that of a river at low stage with a clear water surface slope zhang and werner 2015 the anthropogenic impacts at poyang are likely highest among investigated lakes mainly due to the three gorges dam located upstream in the yangtze that intensified the extremities in the water flow i e flood and drought zhang et al 2016a the hydrogeomorphic characteristics of the three lakes are summarized in table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrological data at gauge stations water level data were obtained over five continuous hydrological cycles at each lake within the most recent decade with overlapping years across the lakes table 2 at curuai daily and monthly water levels at the obidos and curuai gauge stations from 2012 to 2017 were obtained from the hydrology and geodynamics of the amazon basin hybam 2021 fig 2 a and 2b at tonle sap daily water levels at the kampong chhnang prek kdam and kampong luong gauge stations from 2014 to 2019 were obtained from the mekong river commission mrc water levels every eight days from the altimetry station tonle sap was also obtained from the database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2015 fig 2a 2c and 2d at poyang daily water levels at the datong hukou and kangshan gauge stations from 2012 to 2016 were obtained from china s hydrological yearbooks provided by the yangtze river commission yrc fig 2a 2e and 2f the water levels at all three lakes show strong seasonality a key similarity of large lowland floodplains fig 2 to visualize the variations in water levels over time the water surface slope was calculated between each lake and its river namely the obidos and curuai stations at curuai the prek kdam and kampong luong stations at tonle sap and the hukou and kangshan stations at poyang 3 2 extracting lake surface water extent moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra surface reflectance 8 day composite data at 500 m resolution mod09a1 v006 were used to extract the lake extent over five hydrological cycles at poyang 2012 to 2016 46 images were available per lake each year where the best observations were chosen for each pixel over eight days vermote 2015 the modis images were downloaded from the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac by the u s geological survey usgs and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to extract the lake extent the normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 was calculated from each image based on equation 1 below 1 ndwi green n i r green n i r band 4 band 2 band 4 band 2 where green refers to the green band band 4 in mod09a1 v006 and nir refers to the near infrared band band 2 in mod09a1 v006 the optimized threshold value to determine the water extent was visually identified after several simulations for each lake 0 modis data was similarly used to extract the lake extent at curuai 2014 to 2019 nevertheless the optical modis data may be insufficient for detecting water extent under the thicker canopy in the flooded forests of curuai hess et al 2015 thus we added the areas of the flooded forests extracted by arnesen et al 2013 from alos palsar scansar images which can penetrate the forest canopy and linearly interpolated over time the linear interpolation was conducted based on the assumption that the lake area of large river floodplains like curuai gradually rise and fall over time in a predictable manner lastly the lake extent at tonle sap 2014 to 2019 was obtained from dahiti the dahiti approach extracts the lake area from optical images landsat at 30 m resolution and sentinel 2 at 10 m resolution using five water indices and an automated threshold computation and fills data gaps using a long term water probability mask schwatke et al 2019 3 3 stage area hysteresis and comparative analysis the extracted water extent was plotted against the water level every 8 days on average over five hydrological cycles at each lake anomalous dips and spikes in the water content attributed to environmental factors like uneven cloud cover were manually filtered out in general data points with a continuous increasing or decreasing trend were retained over 70 of data while the water level data from the curuai and tonle sap gauge stations were complete short gaps 16 days i e two 8 day data points of missing data for the poyang gauge stations and the tonle sap altimetry station were filled with linearly interpolated values longer periods with missing data were excluded from the analysis the stage area graphs obtained were split into rising and falling seasons based on the minimum and maximum water level in each hydrological cycle a best fit fourth degree polynomial was obtained per season for every hydrological cycle resulting in five hysteresis loops for each lake the hysteresis loops can be characterized by 1 direction clockwise or counter clockwise 2 shape e g circular linear eight shaped elliptical rectangular and 3 degree of hysteresis calculated from the loop area cui et al 2020 zuecco et al 2016 to compare the degree of hysteresis across the lakes we obtain dimensionless stage area hysteresis loops by normalizing the water level and lake area using equations 2 and 3 below we take the area enclosed within the loops as the degree of hysteresis calculated through integration in matlab 2 h h h min h max h min 3 a a a min a max a min where h is the normalized water level h is the water level hmin is the minimum water level hmax is the maximum water level a is the normalized lake area a is the lake area amin is the minimum lake area and amax is the maximum lake area the data used in this study are summarized in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 stage area hysteresis in floodplain lakes 4 1 1 hysteresis of curuai lake hysteresis is observed between the curuai lake area and the water level at both the obidos station in the amazon river fig 3 a and the curuai station in curuai lake fig 3b the stage area hysteresis forms an eight shaped loop where the main hysteresis direction is counter clockwise for a given water level the curuai lake extent is larger in the falling season red line than in the rising season blue line fig 3a and 3b the same hysteresis direction was observed by rudorff et al 2014a between lisflood fp modeled lake area and the water level at the curuai station and by park 2017 between the lake area extracted from modis and the water level at the obidos station upstream of curuai at a morphologically similar miratuba floodplain eight shaped counter clockwise hysteresis was also observed by park and latrubesse 2017 between the lake area from the remote sensing data and the water level at the itacoatiara station to better visualize the relationship between the lake area and the water level fig 3c shows a time series of the two variables while the water levels at both gauge stations form a smooth curve in each hydrological cycle the water extent appears box like the start of the rising season marked by the first increase in stage is in november as the stage rises water from the river flows into the curuai lake the lake area increases correspondingly but starts growing with a time lag of around one month i e in december then reaches maximum first in march fig 3c the water level subsequently peaks in may june and starts decreasing gradually in the falling season but the lake extent remains approximately constant up to late august before falling until december fig 3c it should be noted that an extreme flood occurred in 2017 due to abnormal rainfall espinoza et al 2022 fig 3c which altered the degree of hysteresis in the 2016 17 cycle but the counter clockwise hysteresis direction remained the same at both obidos and curuai fig 3a c while the constant lake area from march to august may be due to a balance between floodplain inflow and outflow rudorff et al 2017 the delayed fall in lake area and the counter clockwise stage area hysteresis could be attributed to the lag in water outflow as a result of the curuai lake morphology curuai has an impeded floodplain morphology which dominantly consists of large and shallow round lakes the round lakes are separated by ridges and connected to each other and to the amazon river by floodplain channels latrubesse 2012 during the falling season water gradually flows out from curuai to the river through both overbank flow from exceeding levee height and channelized flow from breaching levees while overbank flow mainly occurs in the parts of curuai nearer to the river the order of channelized drainage from the round lakes is not reliant on the distance from the river park and latrubesse 2017 for instance some locally elevated proximal lakes may drain later than distal lakes of lower elevation ang et al 2021 as such the round lakes and the floodplain channels are interconnected in a maze like fashion alsdorf 2003 this complex routing of channelized flow is combined with the constricted passage of water through the narrow floodplain channels moreover the round lakes have to drain sequentially where each round lake drains individually before water can leave the next connected floodplain these three factors together lead to the delayed fall in lake area and thus the counter clockwise hysteresis loop fig 3a and 3b with a higher lake area in the falling season than the rising season for a given water level exacerbated by ponding in localized depressions zhang and werner 2015 another explanation for the hysteresis was briefly put forth by rudorff et al 2014a who suggest that the water entering the floodplain through the east is delayed by the flow reversal from falling to rising season and a long traveling distance before reaching the western floodplain with a flatter terrain and more space for the water extent to expand nevertheless water enters the curuai floodplain near the western margin as well visually determined from sediment plumes in landsat imagery fig 3d hence we propose the rounded lake morphology as an alternative reason behind the hysteresis from the curuai station to the obidos station the mean water surface slope is always negative since the water level at the curuai station is always higher fig 3c and 3e this suggests that water flows from curuai to obidos throughout the year along the eastern margin of curuai where the levees are thinner and shallower at the same time water enters curuai along the western boundary evidenced by the sediment plumes fig 3d the co occurrence of inflow and outflow in curuai is supported by lisflood fp modeling conducted by rudorff et al 2017 the dominant flow in curuai is thus uni directional with curuai acting as a bypass and a storage unit of water from the amazon river in the rising season as the water level in the river increases the water surface slope from the floodplain to the river becomes gentler by around 1 cm km from november to january fig 3e the water surface slope then remains roughly constant throughout the late rising season peak flow and the early falling season before steepening by 1 cm km from late august to november which allows more water to leave the curuai lake like the lake area the time series of the water surface slope also has a box like shape and the steepening of the slope from august to november corresponds with the timing of the fall in lake extent fig 3c the delay in the steepening of the slope until august early falling season suggests a delay in water outflow from curuai to the river which further explains the lag in the drop in lake area and thus the counter clockwise stage area hysteresis 4 1 2 hysteresis of tonle sap lake the tonle sap lake shares a similar stage area hysteresis direction and delayed decrease in water extent as curuai counter clockwise hysteresis is seen between the tonle sap lake area and the water level at the kampong chhnang station in the mekong river fig 4 a the prek kdam station in the tonle sap river fig 4b as well as the kampong luong and tonle sap stations in the tonle sap lake fig 4c and 4d unlike the eight shaped hysteresis pattern at curuai the hysteresis loops at tonle sap are circular to elliptical with a clear counter clockwise direction the same hysteresis direction was observed by ng and park 2021 between the lake area extracted from modis and landsat imagery and the water level at the tonle sap altimetry station over time both the water level and the lake area appear less smooth as compared to curuai but the water level still forms a smoother peak in each hydrological cycle while lake area forms a sharper peak fig 4e the stage first rises in april may and peaks in september october before falling until february march from february march to april may the water level remains relatively constant at the prek kdam and kampong chhnang stations in the river but decreases slightly at the kampong luong and tonle sap stations in the lake the lake area varies correspondingly but with a slight delay first rising in may june peaking in october then falling gradually until may june fig 4e a similar trend in lake extent is presented by chang et al 2020 based on modis and sentinel 1 data with rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis like curuai the delayed drop in the lake extent and the counter clockwise hysteresis could be due to the lag in water outflow caused by the tonle sap lake morphology the large northwest southeast oriented tonle sap lake is connected to the mekong river solely through the narrow 100 km long tonle sap river at its southeastern tip mrc 2020 fig 1d hence channelized flow is the only form of water transport between the tonle sap lake and the mekong river unlike curuai where both overbank and channelized flow are present park and latrubesse 2017 from the kampong luong station in the lake to the prek kdam station in the tonle sap river the water surface slope is largely positive where the water level in the lake at kampong luong is usually lower fig 4f the positive slope reflects the morphology of tonle sap a lake lying in a shallow depression tsukawaki et al 1994 vysotsky et al 1994 during the rising season the slope ranges from around 0 4 to 1 5 cm km hence water from the mekong river flows into the lake through the tonle sap river during the falling season the mean water surface slope ranges from around 0 7 to 0 4 cm km remaining below 0 for most of the season fig 4f the water level in the lake is higher instead thus the water direction reverses and flows from the lake to the river li et al 2019a this seasonal reversal of flow in the tonle sap river contrasts with the unidirectional flow in curuai as water from the tonle sap lake drains through the tonle sap river in the falling season a backwater effect occurs at the confluence with the mekong river jantunen 2007 the backwater effect propagates far up the 100 km long channel into the tonle sap lake enhanced by the narrow morphology of the tonle sap river and the large volume of water contained within the tonle sap depression moreover channelized flow via the tonle sap river is the sole exit for outflow with the lack of alternative channels or overbank flow as a result up to 74 km3 of water from tonle sap attempts to drain through the 400 m wide channel restricted by the transport capacity of the tonle sap river leading to a strong backwater effect kummu et al 2014 meade et al 1991 ng and park 2021 subsequently the fall in lake extent lags behind water level resulting in the counter clockwise hysteresis fig 4a 4d in particular the hysteresis extent at prek kdam in the tonle sap river appears the largest fig 4b where the backwater effect is the strongest besides the backwater effect in the narrow tonle sap river a secondary reason for the stage area hysteresis and the delayed fall in lake area could be inputs from tributaries and groundwater inflow although the lake stage starts falling in october the discharge from tributaries in the tonle sap basin peaks in october and the groundwater discharge peaks in november burnett et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 the tributary discharge and the groundwater take time to feed into tonle sap and they make up 29 1 34 0 and 10 9 of tonle sap s inflow respectively slowing down the decrease in the lake area in the falling season moreover the highly shallow and flat bathymetry of the tonle sap means that even a small volume of input would be sufficient in maintaining the lake extent uk et al 2018 overall the backwater effect in the narrow and long tonle sap river and secondarily the relatively high tributary and groundwater input and shallow shape of tonle sap are ultimately attributed to the lake morphology which leads to the counter clockwise stage area hysteresis and the delayed drop in the lake extent it should be highlighted that tonle sap s flat morphology varies greatly from the geomorphically complex rounded lakes of curuai yet both exhibit the same hysteresis direction and lag in decrease in water extent therefore the general hysteretic direction may appear similar across lakes but the unique lake traits should be considered on a case by case basis 4 1 3 hysteresis of poyang lake like tonle sap poyang is a seasonal freshwater lake connected to the main river through a relatively narrow channel li et al 2019a yet interestingly both hysteresis directions are present at poyang clockwise hysteresis is seen between the poyang lake area and the stage at the datong station in the yangtze river fig 5 a clockwise hysteresis is also observed with the water level in the lake mouth at the hukou station fig 5b suggesting that the stage at hukou is largely controlled by the yangtze as similarly discussed by huang et al 2017 however the extent of the poyang lake and the water level further upstream in the lake at the kangshan station display a counter clockwise hysteresis fig 5c the presence of both hysteresis directions at poyang is also reported between the modeled lake area and the stage including at hukou and kangshan in previous studies e g huang et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 unlike at curuai and tonle sap the shape of the hysteresis loops at poyang appears linear to elliptical notably the loops at datong and hukou have a wider base and narrower top which is similarly presented by zhang and werner 2015 over time the changes in the stage and the lake area appear spikier and less consistent than at the other lakes fig 5d the water levels at all three gauge stations first rise in january before peaking in june july at datong and hukou and slightly earlier in june at kangshan subsequently the water level falls until january the lake area first rises around december to february peaks in june to august before falling again fig 5d it should be noted that the water levels and the water extent in late 2015 and early 2016 were anomalously high due to an unusual winter flood zeng et al 2017 fig 5d the winter flood altered the degree of hysteresis in the 2015 2016 cycle but the hysteresis directions remained the same fig 5a c we attribute the presence of both hysteresis directions to the differences in lake morphology and hydrological control upstream at kangshan and downstream at hukou upstream at kangshan the wide lake morphology means that the upstream extent makes up most of the overall lake area during the rising season poyang receives over 90 of its water through catchment inflow especially in april to june when catchment inflow peaks li et al 2020 as most of the catchment inflow enters upstream poyang first the water level and the water extent rises in sync at kangshan zhang and werner 2015 during the falling season the catchment inflow ceases and the water level at kangshan drops however as up to 97 of the lake water drains into yangtze through the lake mouth 170 km downstream there is a lag in the drainage of the wide upstream lake extent yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b resulting in a counter clockwise hysteresis upstream at kangshan fig 5c downstream at hukou the lake morphology is a narrow channel during the rising season time is needed for the upstream catchment inflow to travel through poyang to hukou zhang et al 2017 moreover the main hydrological control is the proximal yangtze river which is still in its early rising stage thus the rise in hukou stage lags behind the rise in the water extent and the kangshan stage upstream during the peak and early falling season the water at hukou attempts to drain into the yangtze river nevertheless the high yangtze stage leads to a strong backwater effect enhanced by the narrow lake morphology where the obstruction of outflow increases the water level at hukou hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 for a given stage the stage is higher in the falling season than rising season resulting in a clockwise hysteresis downstream at hukou fig 5b the backwater effect is attenuated in the upstream direction by a wider lake morphology leading to a decreasing degree of clockwise hysteresis from hukou to progressively upstream gauge stations xingzi duchang followed by tangyin huang et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 at kangshan the furthest upstream station the backwater effect is no longer present and the dominant hydrological control is the catchment inflow instead suggesting a geomorphic threshold between tangyin and kangshan and a reversal in hysteresis direction as mentioned the stage at upstream kangshan is only dependent on the catchment inflow while the stage at downstream hukou is dominantly influenced by the yangtze river and secondarily influenced by the delayed catchment input this difference in hydrological control is due to the locations of kangshan and hukou and the varying timing of peak flow driven by monsoon rainfalls april to june for the catchment tributaries but july to september for the yangtze river guo et al 2012 moreover the smaller poyang sub basin is more sensitive to rainfall and peaks earlier with the rain compared to the larger yangtze basin with a longer basin lag time and a slower flood response mimikou 1984 pilgrim et al 1982 thus the kangshan station always has a higher stage than the hukou station resulting in a steep negative slope from kangshan to hukou most of the time fig 5e the water surface slope only reaches a near horizontal or slight positive when the yangtze river peaks in july and the stage at the hukou station increases resulting in some reverse flow of water from the river to the lake that contributes to less than 3 of poyang s inflow zhang et al 2016b the difference in hydrology at kangshan and hukou and hence stage area hysteresis is also a form of geomorphic control specifically the difference in the basin hierarchy and size between the poyang sub basin and the yangtze basin with the water surface slope at poyang lying below 0 almost throughout the year compared to the seasonally changing water surface slope at tonle sap three differences between poyang and tonle sap can be discussed 1 while the flow direction reverses in the tonle sap river depending on the season the flow in poyang is mostly unidirectional from the lake to the river li et al 2020 therefore 2 the backwater effect at the poyang lake mouth lasts throughout the year unlike at tonle sap where the backwater effect only occurs in the falling season nevertheless the backwater effect at poyang is still the strongest in the peak and early falling season when the stage in the yangtze river is the highest zhang and werner 2015 3 tonle sap acts as a typical floodplain lake lying on the alluvial plain and exchanging water with the main river just like curuai latrubesse 2012 ngun et al 2011 these two lakes receive many sediments from the river over time evidenced by their round shapes smoothened by deposited sediments park 2020 szczuciński et al 2013 in contrast although poyang is also a floodplain lake it has significant river and tributary like characteristics feeding into the yangtze river most of the time zhang et al 2017 poyang is an incised lake under structural control evidenced by its blocky shape yao et al 2018 in the narrow river like poyang the backwater effect slows the decrease in hukou stage in the falling season leading to a clockwise hysteresis in the wide floodplain like tonle sap the backwater effect slows the decrease in lake area in the falling season resulting in a counter clockwise hysteresis this highlights the complexity of stage area hysteresis where a single factor cannot be correlated with a certain hysteresis direction as it depends on the overall lake geomorphology 4 2 comparison of stage area hysteresis geomorphic controls and human impacts the areas of all three lakes similarly exhibit strong seasonality a key characteristic of large lowland floodplain lakes fig 6 comparing the normalized stage area hysteresis loops across the lakes it is evident that the hysteresis shape varies strongly from lake to lake zuecco et al 2016 eight shaped in curuai circular to elliptical in tonle sap and elliptical to linear in poyang fig 7 a besides the shape the area within the loops degree extent of hysteresis are also distinctly different where tonle sap has the highest mean degree 0 41 followed by poyang 0 17 and curuai 0 13 fig 7b and table 3 the calculated means at poyang and curuai exclude the last hydrological cycle when the hysteresis degree was altered by abnormal floods espinoza et al 2022 zeng et al 2017 the order of hysteresis extent corresponds with the order of lake size from the largest tonle sap to the smallest curuai fig 6 and table 1 this suggests a stronger dissonance between the water level and the lake area as the lake area increases larger lakes have 1 a wider area for more ponding in localized depressions and 2 a farther traveling distance for water and hence a longer time lag between the lake outflow at the mouth and the drainage upstream in the lake zhang and werner 2015 these two factors delay the drop in the lake extent during the falling season and lead to a stronger counter clockwise hysteresis more specifically in our studied lakes the large lake area and volume of water in tonle sap enhances the backwater effect jamming the tonle sap river and restricting outflow during the dry season jantunen 2007 meade et al 1991 in poyang the large lake area results in disharmonious changes in the water level the stage downstream responds slower to upstream catchment inflow in the rising season while the stage upstream responds slower to downstream drainage at the lake mouth in the falling season leading to the contrasting hysteresis direction across poyang zhang et al 2017 the stronger degree of hysteresis at tonle sap and poyang compared to at curuai can also be attributed to the sources of inflow and the hydrological connectivity at each lake while tonle sap and poyang receive much tributary input at 29 1 34 and 91 93 of total inflow respectively curuai receives 77 82 of inflow from the main river table 1 moreover tonle sap and poyang are hydrologically connected to the main river solely through channelized flow unlike curuai which receives both overbank and channelized flow from the river li et al 2020 park and latrubesse 2017 these differences in the composition of inflow and the lake river connectivity are mainly related to the geomorphology of the lakes tonle sap and poyang lie in large sub basins with many tributaries located farther away from the main river and receiving inflow or feeding into the river only via a narrow channel hence they have more tributary input weaker lake river connectivity and relatively stronger hysteresis kummu et al 2014 mrc 2020 zhang et al 2017 in contrast curuai lies in a relatively small sub basin with almost no tributary input located directly next to the main river curuai constantly exchanges inflow and outflow with the amazon throughout a hydrological year thus it is under significant hydrological control of the river rudorff et al 2014b the lake river connectivity at curuai is stronger and the lake area varies more in sync with the seasonality of the main river resulting in a weaker hysteresis at curuai than at poyang and tonle sap across the lakes the degree of hysteresis at the mouth of the lakes and in the main rivers is largely stronger than the degree of hysteresis within the lakes fig 7b and table 3 at curuai the hysteresis extent in the amazon river obidos is 0 13 compared to a slightly lower extent in the lake curuai at 0 12 at tonle sap the mean hysteresis extent in the mekong river and the tonle sap river kampong chhnang and prek kdam is 0 50 while the mean extent in the lake kampong luong and tonle sap is much lower at 0 32 at poyang the mean hysteresis extent in the yangtze river and the lake mouth datong and hukou is higher at 0 19 contrasted with 0 14 in the lake kangshan this trend is expected as the lake area varies more closely with the stage in the lake than with the stage in the main river or the lake mouth which is influenced by the stage in the main river huang et al 2017 notably the difference between the lake and the river hysteresis extent also increases from curuai to poyang to tonle sap suggesting that the above discussions on the lake area the composition of inflow the lake river hydrological connectivity and the lake geomorphology also apply here tonle sap and poyang are connected to the main river only through a narrow channel where the stronger tributary input and the weaker hydrological connectivity increase the disparities between the lake and river hysteresis in comparison curuai lies directly next to the amazon river thus the hysteresis extent in the lake and the river are more similar together with geomorphic controls human activities may play a role in influencing lake hysteresis while curuai has relatively minimal anthropogenic impacts tonle sap and poyang are affected by sand mining and upstream dams at tonle sap extensive sand mining is carried out in the mekong river leading to riverbed incision ng and park 2021 park et al 2020 the downcutting is exacerbated by the proliferation of upstream dams which trap sediments and result in sediment starved hungry water downstream of the dams that scour the channel bed kondolf 1997 van binh et al 2020 riverbed incision lowers the channel stage reducing the exchange of water between the river and the tonle sap lake hence decreasing the lake river connectivity and possibly contributing to tonle sap having the highest hysteresis extent at poyang upstream dams like the three gorges dam similarly lead to channel incision reducing the low flow water stages in the river li et al 2019b however sand mining largely occurs within the lake eroding the lake bed and increasing the lake storage capacity yao et al 2019 moreover as discussed previously in section 4 1 3 unlike at tonle sap where the flow direction reverses in the tonle sap river depending on the season the flow in poyang is mostly unidirectional from the lake to the river li et al 2020 the larger lake storage capacity from sand mining and the lower river stage from upstream dams could increase the outflow from the poyang lake to the yangtze river during the falling season zhang et al 2016a this may reduce the lag between the lake area and the water level suggesting why poyang has a lower hysteresis degree than tonle sap the geomorphic controls and the influence of human activities on stage area hysteresis are summarized in fig 8 4 3 advancement in lake hydrology and management implications our results could improve understanding on the relationships between hydrological parameters or in other terms rating curves willis 2011 while parameters like water level can be measured directly with relative ease other variables such as discharge water quality and sediment concentration require more sophisticated methods and are logistically challenging thus these variables are often indirectly measured through rating curves especially in remote or less developed regions with limited observational data available dottori et al 2009 jansson 1996 in particular stage area curves or volume stage area relationships have been established to estimate the lake area and the volume from the stage malik and pal 2021 ng and park 2021 these stage area rating curves are commonly used in empirical and numerical hydrological models as an alternative to remote sensing abdulkareem et al 2018 klemes 1982 hysteresis could introduce uncertainties to the rating curves and the hydrological models yet there have only been a few studies focused on specific individual lakes e g rudorff et al 2014a zhang and werner 2015 and limited investigation regarding the cause behind lake hysteresis through comparing three representative large floodplain lakes this paper is the first to address geomorphology as the main control over stage area hysteresis furthermore our study can facilitate floodplain lake management as the water extent is one of the main indicators of lake dynamics the stage area curve is widely used in the implementation of management policies to sustain water resources huang et al 2017 the stage area relationship is also used in modeling to predict and respond to extreme events such as to estimate flood damages and evaluate mitigation measures like community relocation cummings et al 2012 or to study the shrinking of lakes impacted by human activities and climate change li et al 2016 liu et al 2013 ng and park 2021 for example the proposed sluice gate that will cut across poyang lake may alter the stage area relationship and result in unpredictable environmental consequences ho et al 2021 this paper highlights the importance of considering hysteresis for more realistic estimations of the changing lake extent and the risk of extreme events and the damages incurred abtew et al 2007 smith 1994 moreover a stronger lake hysteresis reflects a greater delay in drainage and a longer water residence time in lakes this influences the water sediment and nutrient budgets and the biogeochemical cycles of rivers and floodplain lakes dunne et al 1998 aquatic animals dependent on the water and the nutrient levels would in turn be affected by the stage area hysteresis junk and wantzen 2006 for instance while the shrinking poyang lake with lower water levels and smaller lake areas has created wetlands suitable for migratory waterbirds there has been a loss in mudflats and submerged areas for aquatic species to live in dong et al 2015 hu et al 2015 mu et al 2022 the coverage and health of the floodplain ecosystems would evolve with the changing lake area and depth hence our study on the hysteretic behavior of floodplains is potentially relevant to sustaining the lake ecosystems and the biodiversity of large rivers 5 conclusion this paper investigates the role of geomorphology as the key control over stage area hysteresis at three floodplain lakes the curuai lake of the amazon river the tonle sap lake of the mekong river and the poyang lake of the yangtze river these lakes represent the various types of seasonal lowland floodplains along large rivers and they display a similar counter clockwise hysteresis for a given stage the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season across the lakes hysteresis is under the overarching control of geomorphology where factors like the lake shape and the basin size delay the decrease in the lake area during the falling season leading to the same counter clockwise hysteresis direction however the lakes are of unique climatic and geologic geomorphic settings that delay the fall in the lake area cause counter clockwise hysteresis and determine the degree and the shape of hysteresis on a case by case basis to summarize the main but heterogenous geomorphic controls of the investigated floodplains the impeded floodplain morphology of curuai complicates and slows the routing of outflow latrubesse 2012 park and latrubesse 2017 the narrow channel but large depression of tonle sap causes a strong backwater effect that restricts drainage jantunen 2007 meade et al 1991 the contrasting lake shape and hydrological control attributed to basin hierarchy at poyang result in counter clockwise hysteresis upstream but clockwise hysteresis downstream pilgrim et al 1982 zhang et al 2017 tonle sap exhibits the largest degree of hysteresis with circular to elliptical stage area loops 0 41 followed by poyang s elliptical to linear loops 0 17 and the eight shaped hysteresis at curuai 0 13 while tonle sap and poyang receive more tributary input and are connected to the main river only through a narrow channel curuai primarily receives inflow from the main river through both overbank and channelized flow kumme et al 2014 li et al 2020 rudorff et al 2014b park and latrubesse 2017 thus the lake river hydrological connectivity at curuai is stronger where the lake area varies more in sync with the main river leading to a weaker hysteresis in sum the floodplain geomorphology has been identified as the main control over the hysteresis direction while the unique lake morphology causes counter clockwise hysteresis and results in different hysteresis extent and shape this paper is the first to address geomorphology as the major control over the hysteretic relationship between the stage and the area in large floodplain lakes which has been observed in several studies our results can improve the understanding of the stage area rating curve in empirical and numerical hydrological models and potentially facilitate the management of water resources and floodplain ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement wei jing ang data curation formal analysis methodology writing original

2789,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the priority pollutants with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects threaten the fragile karst environment with a thin and scattered soil layer twenty six surface soil samples were collected in the karstic valleys and hilltop depressions of four river basins on the south bank of the yangtze river in the yichang area their pah concentrations were measured aiming to investigate the distribution possible sources and potential health risks of pahs in this area the results showed that the concentrations of σpahs sum of 16 priority pahs in surface soils ranged from 8 26 to 397 ng g 1 median 24 9 ng g 1 average 55 8 ng g 1 the concentrations of σpahs in the valleys median 25 1 ng g 1 average 72 9 ng g 1 were slightly higher than that in the hilltop depressions median 24 6 ng g 1 average 28 2 ng g 1 while the low molecular weight pahs lmw pahs were dominant both hilltop depressions and valleys additionally molecular diagnostic ratios and principal components analysis pca suggested that pahs in the surface soils are mainly derived from biomass and coal combustion followed by petroleum combustion the bap equivalent bapeq concentrations of pahs and the incremental lifetime cancer risks ilcrs were used to assess their health risk it showed that the bapeq of 16 pahs bapeq16 in the surface soils varied between 0 31 and 85 0 ng g 1 average 6 52 ng g 1 the average of ilcrs in different age groups varied between 6 01 10 9 1 10 10 7 regionally it indicated that the risks of cancer to residents in this area were within the safe limit and pahs showed relatively higher potential cancer risks for children than teens and adults keywords karst surface soils pahs sources analysis health risks assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally ca 25 of the continental surface is covered by karst landscape ford and williams 2007 tang et al 2021 and ca 3 44 million km2 in china yuan 2000 karst aquifers are important drinking water resources for about 25 population of the world bakalowicz 2005 hartmann et al 2014 and they are also essential for the ecosystem in karst culver and pipan 2019 however with the population expansion some karst areas have been overexploited gutierrez et al 2014 to the worse due to its particular vulnerability shao et al 2014a tang et al 2021 the karst ecosystem is quite difficult to recover from damage tang et al 2021 especially the topsoil on the surface is the most critical and sensitive in karst cao et al 2018 it was found that shallow soil layers in karst were the main confluence zone of contaminants soil pollution in karst area has attracted great attention chen et al 2022 qu et al 2019 sun et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a class of contaminants of great environmental concern they are ubiquitous contaminants in the multimedia environment which are strongly carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic chen et al 2022 orecchio 2010 pahs in the environment originate from both natural and artificial sources and anthropogenic emissions are the main sources e g from motor vehicles industrial processes domestic heating and waste incineration qu et al 2019 peng et al 2021 terzaghi et al 2021 due to the high hydrophobicity characteristic of pahs they tend to transfer to non aqueous phases especially the organic or particle phases wang et al 2013 therefore the soil is the primary environmental sink of pahs which bears more than 90 of the environmental load of pahs wild and jones 1995 however the soil layer is generally thin and scattered in the karst area with limited purification and filtration capabilities still it could be the only protection layer from surface pollution for underground water but the wide distributed fissure conduit network in karst results in rapid and direct infiltration of pollutants into aquifers chen et al 2021 huang et al 2021 lan et al 2020 shao et al 2014a therefore investigation of pah contamination in the soil of karst is significant at present studies on pahs pollution in the soil of karst areas involved agricultural areas in the catchment area of springs in southern germany schwarz et al 2011 underground rivers and catchment area of springs in southwest china lan et al 2020 sun et al 2013 and karst coal mining areas in northern china li et al 2019 shao et al 2014a however only limited studies on pahs in soils of karst areas in central china were conducted chen et al 2022 xing et al 2020 and there is no study discussing the karst hydrogeological conditions control on the transport of pahs contamination from hilltop depressions to deep valleys the karst area near the three gorges dam on the south bank of the yangtze river is characterized as the karst trough zone of china with both flat platforms on the hilltop and deep cut ravines liu et al 2020 here the soils in the depressions of hilltop mainly originated from the residue of local parent rock dissolution and the soils in the valleys are transported from higher mountains by water flow to investigate the influence of special hydrogeological characteristics in the karst trough zone on pah distribution in this area both hilltop depressions and deep valleys were studied to 1 reveal the distribution characteristics of pahs in soils controlled by different karst geomorphic features hilltop depressions and valleys 2 analyze the composition and sources of pahs in soils with different anthropogenic influences and 3 evaluate the health risks of inhabitants in karst mountain areas exposed to pahs 2 sampling and method 2 1 site description and sample collection the study area is located in a karst landscape on the southern bank of the yangtze river near the three gorges dam in the yichang area central china fig 1 its geomorphology is characterized as the karst trough zone of china with flat terraces on up top mountains and deep cut ravines liu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 numerous karst depressions scatter on the up platform soils in the hilltop depressions mainly originated from weathering local parent rock e g the mud dolomite of the upper and lower part of qinjiamiao formation cambrian liu et al 2020 large springs develop at the bottom of the valleys and these springs are generally the headstreams of surface water here there are four main tributaries in the study area the jiuwanxi river jwr the sixi maoping river smr the chexi juanqiao river cjr and the danshui river dsr fig 1 most are karst area here with scarce water and land resource the local economic development is limited agriculture and ecotourism are the regional pillar industries and limited factories were concentrated around the flat urban areas on the hilltop scattered depressions had been reclaimed for limited farmlands in the deep valleys ecotourism was highly developed such as sixi chexi and jiuwanxi all were famous places downstream of the rivers the landscape was flat and human activities were concentrated in these areas with intensive farming residential traffic and industrial impacts e g the zigui town centre in the maoping river fig 1 population statistics within each basin in the study area are shown in table sd1 in october 2019 twenty six undisturbed surface soil samples 0 20 cm were collected fig 1 from farmland in karst hilltop depressions and valleys three samples were collected from the jwr basin s01 s03 from valleys eight in the smr basin s04 s06 from hilltop depressions s07 s11 from valleys and five in the cjr basin s12 s16 from valleys seven in the dsr basin s17 s22 from hilltop depressions and three in other sites s24 from hilltop depression s25 s26 from valleys in summary ten sites were from hilltop depressions and sixteen were from valleys before sampling the stainless steel shovel was triple rinsed with dichloromethane dcm and then cleaned by the soil at each sampling site four subsamples each about 250 g were collected and thoroughly mixed into one and meanwhile stones and grassroots were removed all samples were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent photodegradation packed into sealed polythene bags then preserved in ice boxes and transported to the laboratory directly in the laboratory after freezing dried in the dark all samples were sieved through a 0 15 mm 100 mesh stainless steel sieve and stored at 20 c until pre treatment 2 2 sample pre treatment and chemical analysis samples were pre treated for pah analysis with the following procedures chen et al 2022 xing et al 2020 firstly soil samples were weighted for 10 g spiked with 5 0 µl surrogate standards naphthalene d8 acenaphthene d10 phenanthrene d10 chrysene d12 and pyrene d12 and then soxhlet extracted for 24 h with 150 ml dcm copper sheets were added to remove elemental sulphur from soil samples each sample extract was concentrated to 2 3 ml with a rotary evaporator heidolph 4000 germany and n hexane was added to replace the solvent then it was separated and purified by multi layer silica gel neutral alumina v v 2 1 chromatography column and rinsed with dcm n hexane v v 2 3 mixture the eluent was collected and concentrated to approximately 0 2 ml before instrument analysis the internal standard hexamethylbenzene hmb was added into the eluent sixteen priority pahs including naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acy acenaphthene ace fluorene flu phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene fla pyrene pyr benz a anthracene baa chrysene chry benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 d pyrene inp dibenzo a h anthracene daa and benzo ghi perylene bgp in the soil samples were analyzed by a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms agilent 7890n gc and 5975msd equipped with a db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm agilent technologies usa the details of instrument operation and conditions for pahs analysis were well documented in previous studies chen et al 2022 qian et al 2020 briefly the gc carrier gas of highly pure helium 99 999 was set at a constant flow rate of 1 20 ml min 1 the mass spectrometer was in selected ion monitoring sim mode the temperature program of the gas chromatograph oven was started at 80 c held for 2 min and then increased to 290 c at a rate of 4 c min 1 held for 25 min injector and detector temperatures were 270 and 280 c respectively the injection volume was 1 μl using splitless injection mode identifying the peak of target pahs in the samples was based on the characteristic ions of mass spectrometry and their retention times a procedural blank and a parallel sample were prepared in every batch 16 samples which were used for quality assurance and quality control qa qc a blank solvent and a qc standard sample were run to check for interference and cross contamination daily the target pah concentration was quantified using the internal standard method no significant peaks were identified in the procedural and blank solvent samples the relative standard deviation rsd of pah concentrations in duplicate samples was less than 20 the recoveries of surrogates for pahs were 70 0 120 the instrument detection limits idls for gc ms analysis were calculated based on the signal noise ratio s n 3 method detection limits mdls were defined as the average of all blanks plus three times of the standard deviation qian et al 2020 which were in the range of 0 01 1 20 ng g 1 table 1 the pah concentrations reported in this study were based on the dry weight 2 3 health risk assessment the carcinogenicity of pahs varies widely and bap is the most carcinogenic among the 16 individual pahs farmer 2003 in this study area the concentrations of bap were strongly correlated with the concentration of σpahs sum of 16 priority pahs r 0 768 p 0 05 at all sampling sites n 26 therefore bap could be applied to represent the toxic effect of all considered pahs the bap equivalent concentration bapeq of pahs is a wide used parameter to evaluate the toxic effect of all considered pahs according to eq 1 sun et al 2017 xie et al 2020 1 ba p eq c i t e f i where ci is the concentration of individual pah congener

cancer risks ilcrs expressed as the probability of cancer from exposure to carcinogenic compounds zheng et al 2018 in this study the potential harm of pahs in the surface soils to the residents was inferred from three different exposure pathways ingestion inhalation and dermal contact calculated by eqs 2 4 the total cancer risks were the sum of the three different exposure ways expressed in eq 5 due to physical differences between ages qu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 the ilcrs were calculated for three age groups children age of 1 11 teens age of 12 17 and adults age of 18 80 2 i l c r

data deviated from a normal distribution kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 spearman s correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between pairs of variables by spss 23 0 principal component analysis pca was also performed by spss 23 0 to analyze the source of pahs concentration values mdl were assumed to be zero data analysis graphs were plotted by origin 2018 and microsoft excel 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and distribution of pahs in soils all 16 pahs were detected in surface soils table 1 and the concentrations of σpahs sum of 16 priority pahs ranged from 8 26 to 397 ng g 1 median 24 9 ng g 1 average 55 8 ng g 1 table sd3 the concentration of seven carcinogenic pahs σ7pahs was 1 40 to 307 ng g 1 median 6 16 ng g 1 average 26 4 ng g 1 table 1 accounting for 33 0 median or 35 2 average of the σpahs the pah concentrations in the soils from this area were similar to those in surface soils from the dajiuhu sub alpine wetland 7 30 191 ng g 1 average 42 4 ng g 1 in central china xing et al 2020 higher than those in soils from karst spring systems 6 04 67 7 ng g 1 average 25 8 ng g 1 in zigui area of hubei chen et al 2022 and lower than those from surface karst spring area 439 3330 ng g 1 average 1392 ng g 1 in chongqing of southwest china sun et al 2013 and from the guozhuang karst water system 622 87880 ng g 1 average 17174 ng g 1 of northern china shao et al 2014a and from the niangziguan karst catchment 49 8 702 ng g 1 average 260 ng g 1 in yangquan coal mining district of northern china li et al 2019 in different river basins concentrations of σpahs were distinct fig 2 a the highest concentrations of both σpahs and σ7pahs appeared in the smr basin average 72 8 ng g 1 and 48 9 ng g 1 respectively fig 2b and the lowest concentrations appeared in cjr basin average 17 2 ng g 1 and 6 28 ng g 1 respectively fig 2b where only limited agricultural activities existed comparing the concentrations of σpahs between upstream and downstream of the smr it was found that the higher concentrations of σpahs were located downstream of the river which was the zigui town centre additionally the proportion of σ7pahs in σpahs was the highest 71 5 in the smr basin and the proportion was the lowest 26 4 in the dsr basin fig 2b some sites performed abnormal and concentrations at s11 and s26 were comparatively higher than 200 ng g 1 but lower than 600 ng g 1 fig 2a which were slightly contaminated concentrations at other sites were lower than 200 ng g 1 table 1 which were non contaminated maliszewska kordybach 1996 these abnormal pah concentrations at different sites could be explained in terms of site characteristics site s11 has the highest concentration of pahs it accounts for 68 1 of the total concentration of σpahs in the smr basin because it is at the outlet of the smr which has a higher population than other basins table sd1 and collected all residential industrial and traffic emissions of pahs from the zigui county s26 is located at the cross of a tributary with the yangtze river both upstream of the tributary and the vessel traffic of the yangtze river brought pahs pollution causing a high concentration of pahs at s26 additionally the distribution of pahs in hilltop depressions and valleys was distinct the concentrations of pahs in hilltop depressions varied from 3 20 to 67 8 ng g 1 median 24 6 ng g 1 average 28 2 ng g 1 n 10 table sd3 with σ7pahs accounted for 34 1 of the σpahs and in valleys varied from 7 94 to 397 ng g 1 median 25 1 ng g 1 average 72 9 ng g 1 n 16 table sd3 with σ7pahs accounted for 50 5 of the σpahs scattered depressions were reclaimed on the hilltop for limited farmlands and residential areas after pahs were released to agricultural fields they were mainly interrupted in the surface soil layer during infiltration jin et al 2014 in karst areas due to the well developed karst fissures and conduit networks williams 2008 surface soils with high concentrations of pollutants were flushed into sinkholes and transported into the karst aquifer rapidly additionally in the karst trough zone the overland flow could be easily generated in the troughs during the intense rainfall liu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 which enhanced the transportation of soil and pollutants by surface flow thus soil particulates carried organic pollutants from hilltop depressions were brought to the outlet of springs and deposited in the valleys schwarz et al 2011 moreover the unique topography of the valleys prevents dispersing of pahs to the surrounding area nam et al 2003 consequently it resulted in higher pah concentrations in the valleys than in the hilltop depressions 3 2 composition of pahs in soils the most abundant pahs in this region were inp phe fla and nap each of them contributed over 10 0 of σpahs respectively table 1 and their sum concentrations accounted for more than 50 of σpahs it was similar to the composition of pahs in other karst areas li et al 2019 schwarz et al 2011 sun et al 2013 for example phe flu and pyr had a high average proportion in the pahs in the karst system of southern germany schwarz et al 2011 nap phe and fla accounted for high proportions in the surface soils of the niangziguan karst catchment li et al 2019 and the high proportions of nap flu and phe were observed in the karst soils from chongqing sun et al 2013 by batch experiments shao et al 2014b found that the dissolution of limestone increased the concentration of phe in aqueous solutions while the alkaline condition reduced the sorption of phe wu et al 2021 leading to more phe being released into karst water and partially adhered to the soil layer all 16 pahs were classified into 2 3 rings 4 rings and 5 6 rings representing the low middle and high molecular weight pahs respectively namely lmw pahs mmw pahs and hmw pahs lmw pahs were dominant in the whole area with proportions of 7 49 74 5 median 42 0 for the σpahs fig 3 a and sd1a and the proportions were 47 9 and 41 3 in hilltop depressions and valleys respectively fig 3b and table sd3 followed by mmw pahs fig sd1a accounting for 2 53 53 9 median 30 6 the smallest proportions were hmw pahs fig sd1a accounting for 7 89 80 9 median 20 5 for four basins the average percentage of lmw pahs fig sd1b was in the order cjr 44 6 dsr 44 5 jwr 38 3 smr 16 9 whereas the average percentage of hmw pahs fig sd1b was in the order smr 66 5 jwr 37 6 cjr 28 0 dsr 16 9 the reason for high hmw pah concentrations in the smr basin was mainly due to the high anthropogenic interference from the zigui county which is located downstream of the smr fig 1 in this area people are mostly concentrated in a few towns there is no intensive agriculture or ecotourism representing a low regional level of urbanization wang et al 2018 the hmw pahs are attached to atmospheric particles in the exhaust gases emitted from intensive human activities deposited preferentially during climbing to higher altitudes wang et al 2006 concentrating surround the city but due to the high saturated vapor pressure of lmw pahs they may transport far from the emission sources wang et al 2018 xie et al 2020 thus they may be detected in most sites in this area 3 3 potential sources of pahs the main composition of pahs can be applied to detect their sources zhang et al 2015 mmw and hmw pahs are mainly derived from the high temperature combustion process of fossil fuels e g gasoline vehicles and industrial coal in contrast lmw pahs are mainly derived from petroleum source contamination or incomplete combustion e g from the residential combustion of coal and wood lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 accordingly the high percentage of lmw pahs fig 3a and sd1a indicated a prevalence of petroleum source contamination and low medium temperature combustion source in this area except around the zigui county moreover the molecular diagnostic ratios of pahs could be applied to distinguish emission sources chen et al 2022 suman et al 2016 such as the ratios of ant ant phe fla fla pyr baa baa chry and inp inp bgp were used to distinguish the source of pahs from the petroleum combustion or petroleum or combustion of coal biomass yunker et al 2002 the total index ti eq 6 values were used to confirm the results of molecular diagnostic ratios ti 4 petroleum product ti 4 combustion orecchio 2010 6 ti ant a n t p h e 0 1 fla fla p y r 0 4 baa baa c h r y 0 2 inp inp b g p 0 2 in the study area the ratios of fla fla pyr were 0 5 at 92 3 of sites indicating coal biomass combustion fig 4 while the ratios of ant ant phe were 0 1 for all sites indicating petroleum sources fig 4a in addition the ratios of inp inp bgp in 61 5 of the sites were 0 5 fig 4b and the ratios of baa baa chry in 69 2 of the sites were 0 35 fig 4c both indicating sources of coal biomass combustion petroleum sources were the main sources of pahs in the rest of the sites the ratios of fla fla pyr inp inp bgp and baa baa chry at most sites in the study area were all demonstrating coal biomass combustion source which was different from the results of ant ant phe ration this is probably because ant ant phe is strongly seasonal at some sites and is highly susceptible to atmospheric transport and its ratio results may be influenced by the different physicochemical properties of the individual pahs katsoyiannis et al 2011 the tis were more than 4 at 25 sampling sites table sd4 which confirmed that the sources of pahs in the study area were mainly combustion in summary these results indicated that coal and biomass combustion were the major sources of pahs mixed with petroleum consumption in this area furthermore the potential pah sources in hilltop depressions and valleys were also analyzed separately in valleys fig sd2a inp inp bgp ratios in 35 3 of the sites were between 0 2 and 0 5 indicating petroleum combustion source baa baa chry in 70 6 of the sites were 0 35 and in hilltop depressions fig sd2b inp inp bgp in 66 7 of the sites were between 0 2 and 0 5 and baa baa chry in 66 7 of the sites were 0 35 results revealed that coal biomass combustion remained the main source of pollution in the hilltop depressions and valleys but the impact of petroleum combustion is higher on the hilltop depressions than that on the valleys principal component analysis pca was further applied to determine the sources of pahs in soil and their contribution proportions ma et al 2011 here factors with a cumulative variance contribution rate greater than 80 were extracted for further analysis and two principal components were extracted from 16 pahs in soils fig sd3a components 1 and 2 contributed 54 1 and 28 8 to the total variance respectively the loadings of phe ant pyr acy fla and baa in component 1 exceed 0 90 and the loadings of both inp and daa in component 2 were more than 0 90 table sd5a phe ant pyr and fla were identified as indicators of coal combustion huang et al 2016 suman et al 2016 baa was an indicator of natural gas combustion yang et al 2010 and acy was an indicator of biomass combustion source qu et al 2020 in addition inp and daa have been used as indicators of motor vehicle emissions including diesel and gasoline vehicles grimmer et al 1983 therefore component 1 was identified as the source of biomass and coal combustion and component 2 was identified as the source of petroleum combustion in summary coal and biomass combustion showed the highest contribution 54 1 in the study area and moderately followed by petroleum combustion 28 8 consistent with the analysis of molecular diagnostic ratios above pca was also performed on hilltop depressions and valleys table sd5b c in hilltop depressions fig sd3b component 1 was identified as the petroleum source and component 2 was identified as the coal biomass combustion contributing 39 3 and 35 4 to pahs respectively in valleys fig sd3c component 1 was identified as the coal biomass combustion and component 2 as the petroleum source contributing 57 0 and 28 3 to pahs respectively however when pca was conducted for the valleys located upstream of the basins it was found that petroleum combustion contributed 53 1 component 1 chry bbf bkf bap inp daa and bgp xie et al 2020 and mixed sources of wood combustion and petroleum combustion contributed 31 2 component 2 nap acy flu and phe to pahs zhang et al 2020 as discussed pahs sank on the surface soil in the depressions and intensive rains flashed them into sinkholes in the karst area and directly to springs in the valleys the similar composition and sources of pahs in hilltop depressions and upstream valleys also represent the transport processes while downstream of the valleys more residents settled and biomass coal combustion were the main sources of pahs there in summary according to the molecular diagnostic ratios and pca the sources of pahs in the surface soils of this area were mainly biomass coal combustion followed by petroleum combustion it is related to the local economic conditions and lifestyles of the inhabitants in the remote karst mountain area biomass and coal were the primary way for heating and cooking transportation wide distributed regionally and factory waste was around the cities which caused petroleum combustion 3 4 risk assessment of pahs in soil 3 4 1 toxic equivalent concentration bapeq of soil samples was calculated eq 1 to characterize the toxic effects of pahs regionally the bapeq of 16 pahs bapeq16 ranged 0 31 85 0 ng g 1 with an average of 6 52 ng g 1 the bapeq of seven carcinogenic pahs bapeq7 ranged 0 30 84 6 ng g 1 with an average of 6 46 ng g 1 fig 5 a the total bapeq7 accounted for 99 1 of the total bapeq16 it indicated that the seven carcinogenic pahs contributed the most toxic effects for all 16 pahs in this area the highest values of bapeq16 and bapeq7 fig 5a were at s11 near the zigui town centre in the smr basin which was consistent with high concentrations of σ7pahs while the values of bapeq in other basins fig 5b were low which indicated a low level of toxic effects of pahs thus in this karst area pollution from the urban area was the most serve health threat 3 4 2 health risk assessment pahs in soils could be exposed to people in three ways dermal contact ingestion and inhalation jia et al 2021 wang et al 2018 according to the results of ilcrs table sd6 dermal contact was the main pathway of exposure to cancer risks followed by ingestion and inhalation the average of ilcrs in different age groups in the whole study area varied within the range of 6 01 10 9 teens 1 10 10 7 children table sd6 the risk of pahs to children s health was higher than that of teens and adults in this region fig 6 due to exposure to soil and dust through hand to mouth activities exposure by dermal contact and ingestion it was consistent with the previous studies jia et al 2021 wang et al 2018 in addition teens had the lowest ilcrs in the three different age groups which also was consistent with the previous studies qu et al 2019 xing et al 2020 the ilcrs at s11 in the smr basin were 10 6 for children and adults more attention should be paid to their cancer risk the ilcrs at other sites were below the acceptable cancer risk levels 10 6 which means the risks of cancer to most residents of the study area could be negligible however according to the parameters applied in eqs 2 4 long term exposure may still lead to the accumulation of pahs in human tissues and increasement in cancer risk 4 conclusion all 16 priority pahs were detected in karst surface soils near the three gorges dam from the south bank of the yangtze river in the yichang area with relatively low concentration the lowest pahs concentration appeared in the chexi juanqiao river basin and the highest pahs concentration appeared in the sixi maoping river basin urbanization caused a significant impact on the concentrations of pahs such as the impact of the zigui town centre in the sixi maoping river in addition due to the karst trough s geological structure and the valley s unique topography pah concentrations in the valleys were higher than that in the hilltop depressions lmw pahs were dominant in both valleys and hilltop depressions probably due to the low level of urbanization in the study area the main sources of pahs in soils were biomass and coal combustion followed by petroleum and the similar composition and sources of pahs in hilltop depressions and upstream of valleys could speculate the transport processes of pahs that is pahs sank on the surface soil in the hilltop depressions and intensive rains flashed them into sinkholes in karst area and directly to springs in the valleys in urban areas of the study area pahs contamination posed a threat to the health risks of children and adults which means more attention should be paid this study highlighted the influence of special hydrogeological characteristics in the karst trough zone on pah distribution it could support further decreasing the pahs pollution in the karst area credit authorship contribution statement chang pu formal analysis data curation visualization writing

2789,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the priority pollutants with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects threaten the fragile karst environment with a thin and scattered soil layer twenty six surface soil samples were collected in the karstic valleys and hilltop depressions of four river basins on the south bank of the yangtze river in the yichang area their pah concentrations were measured aiming to investigate the distribution possible sources and potential health risks of pahs in this area the results showed that the concentrations of σpahs sum of 16 priority pahs in surface soils ranged from 8 26 to 397 ng g 1 median 24 9 ng g 1 average 55 8 ng g 1 the concentrations of σpahs in the valleys median 25 1 ng g 1 average 72 9 ng g 1 were slightly higher than that in the hilltop depressions median 24 6 ng g 1 average 28 2 ng g 1 while the low molecular weight pahs lmw pahs were dominant both hilltop depressions and valleys additionally molecular diagnostic ratios and principal components analysis pca suggested that pahs in the surface soils are mainly derived from biomass and coal combustion followed by petroleum combustion the bap equivalent bapeq concentrations of pahs and the incremental lifetime cancer risks ilcrs were used to assess their health risk it showed that the bapeq of 16 pahs bapeq16 in the surface soils varied between 0 31 and 85 0 ng g 1 average 6 52 ng g 1 the average of ilcrs in different age groups varied between 6 01 10 9 1 10 10 7 regionally it indicated that the risks of cancer to residents in this area were within the safe limit and pahs showed relatively higher potential cancer risks for children than teens and adults keywords karst surface soils pahs sources analysis health risks assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally ca 25 of the continental surface is covered by karst landscape ford and williams 2007 tang et al 2021 and ca 3 44 million km2 in china yuan 2000 karst aquifers are important drinking water resources for about 25 population of the world bakalowicz 2005 hartmann et al 2014 and they are also essential for the ecosystem in karst culver and pipan 2019 however with the population expansion some karst areas have been overexploited gutierrez et al 2014 to the worse due to its particular vulnerability shao et al 2014a tang et al 2021 the karst ecosystem is quite difficult to recover from damage tang et al 2021 especially the topsoil on the surface is the most critical and sensitive in karst cao et al 2018 it was found that shallow soil layers in karst were the main confluence zone of contaminants soil pollution in karst area has attracted great attention chen et al 2022 qu et al 2019 sun et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a class of contaminants of great environmental concern they are ubiquitous contaminants in the multimedia environment which are strongly carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic chen et al 2022 orecchio 2010 pahs in the environment originate from both natural and artificial sources and anthropogenic emissions are the main sources e g from motor vehicles industrial processes domestic heating and waste incineration qu et al 2019 peng et al 2021 terzaghi et al 2021 due to the high hydrophobicity characteristic of pahs they tend to transfer to non aqueous phases especially the organic or particle phases wang et al 2013 therefore the soil is the primary environmental sink of pahs which bears more than 90 of the environmental load of pahs wild and jones 1995 however the soil layer is generally thin and scattered in the karst area with limited purification and filtration capabilities still it could be the only protection layer from surface pollution for underground water but the wide distributed fissure conduit network in karst results in rapid and direct infiltration of pollutants into aquifers chen et al 2021 huang et al 2021 lan et al 2020 shao et al 2014a therefore investigation of pah contamination in the soil of karst is significant at present studies on pahs pollution in the soil of karst areas involved agricultural areas in the catchment area of springs in southern germany schwarz et al 2011 underground rivers and catchment area of springs in southwest china lan et al 2020 sun et al 2013 and karst coal mining areas in northern china li et al 2019 shao et al 2014a however only limited studies on pahs in soils of karst areas in central china were conducted chen et al 2022 xing et al 2020 and there is no study discussing the karst hydrogeological conditions control on the transport of pahs contamination from hilltop depressions to deep valleys the karst area near the three gorges dam on the south bank of the yangtze river is characterized as the karst trough zone of china with both flat platforms on the hilltop and deep cut ravines liu et al 2020 here the soils in the depressions of hilltop mainly originated from the residue of local parent rock dissolution and the soils in the valleys are transported from higher mountains by water flow to investigate the influence of special hydrogeological characteristics in the karst trough zone on pah distribution in this area both hilltop depressions and deep valleys were studied to 1 reveal the distribution characteristics of pahs in soils controlled by different karst geomorphic features hilltop depressions and valleys 2 analyze the composition and sources of pahs in soils with different anthropogenic influences and 3 evaluate the health risks of inhabitants in karst mountain areas exposed to pahs 2 sampling and method 2 1 site description and sample collection the study area is located in a karst landscape on the southern bank of the yangtze river near the three gorges dam in the yichang area central china fig 1 its geomorphology is characterized as the karst trough zone of china with flat terraces on up top mountains and deep cut ravines liu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 numerous karst depressions scatter on the up platform soils in the hilltop depressions mainly originated from weathering local parent rock e g the mud dolomite of the upper and lower part of qinjiamiao formation cambrian liu et al 2020 large springs develop at the bottom of the valleys and these springs are generally the headstreams of surface water here there are four main tributaries in the study area the jiuwanxi river jwr the sixi maoping river smr the chexi juanqiao river cjr and the danshui river dsr fig 1 most are karst area here with scarce water and land resource the local economic development is limited agriculture and ecotourism are the regional pillar industries and limited factories were concentrated around the flat urban areas on the hilltop scattered depressions had been reclaimed for limited farmlands in the deep valleys ecotourism was highly developed such as sixi chexi and jiuwanxi all were famous places downstream of the rivers the landscape was flat and human activities were concentrated in these areas with intensive farming residential traffic and industrial impacts e g the zigui town centre in the maoping river fig 1 population statistics within each basin in the study area are shown in table sd1 in october 2019 twenty six undisturbed surface soil samples 0 20 cm were collected fig 1 from farmland in karst hilltop depressions and valleys three samples were collected from the jwr basin s01 s03 from valleys eight in the smr basin s04 s06 from hilltop depressions s07 s11 from valleys and five in the cjr basin s12 s16 from valleys seven in the dsr basin s17 s22 from hilltop depressions and three in other sites s24 from hilltop depression s25 s26 from valleys in summary ten sites were from hilltop depressions and sixteen were from valleys before sampling the stainless steel shovel was triple rinsed with dichloromethane dcm and then cleaned by the soil at each sampling site four subsamples each about 250 g were collected and thoroughly mixed into one and meanwhile stones and grassroots were removed all samples were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent photodegradation packed into sealed polythene bags then preserved in ice boxes and transported to the laboratory directly in the laboratory after freezing dried in the dark all samples were sieved through a 0 15 mm 100 mesh stainless steel sieve and stored at 20 c until pre treatment 2 2 sample pre treatment and chemical analysis samples were pre treated for pah analysis with the following procedures chen et al 2022 xing et al 2020 firstly soil samples were weighted for 10 g spiked with 5 0 µl surrogate standards naphthalene d8 acenaphthene d10 phenanthrene d10 chrysene d12 and pyrene d12 and then soxhlet extracted for 24 h with 150 ml dcm copper sheets were added to remove elemental sulphur from soil samples each sample extract was concentrated to 2 3 ml with a rotary evaporator heidolph 4000 germany and n hexane was added to replace the solvent then it was separated and purified by multi layer silica gel neutral alumina v v 2 1 chromatography column and rinsed with dcm n hexane v v 2 3 mixture the eluent was collected and concentrated to approximately 0 2 ml before instrument analysis the internal standard hexamethylbenzene hmb was added into the eluent sixteen priority pahs including naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acy acenaphthene ace fluorene flu phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene fla pyrene pyr benz a anthracene baa chrysene chry benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 d pyrene inp dibenzo a h anthracene daa and benzo ghi perylene bgp in the soil samples were analyzed by a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms agilent 7890n gc and 5975msd equipped with a db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm agilent technologies usa the details of instrument operation and conditions for pahs analysis were well documented in previous studies chen et al 2022 qian et al 2020 briefly the gc carrier gas of highly pure helium 99 999 was set at a constant flow rate of 1 20 ml min 1 the mass spectrometer was in selected ion monitoring sim mode the temperature program of the gas chromatograph oven was started at 80 c held for 2 min and then increased to 290 c at a rate of 4 c min 1 held for 25 min injector and detector temperatures were 270 and 280 c respectively the injection volume was 1 μl using splitless injection mode identifying the peak of target pahs in the samples was based on the characteristic ions of mass spectrometry and their retention times a procedural blank and a parallel sample were prepared in every batch 16 samples which were used for quality assurance and quality control qa qc a blank solvent and a qc standard sample were run to check for interference and cross contamination daily the target pah concentration was quantified using the internal standard method no significant peaks were identified in the procedural and blank solvent samples the relative standard deviation rsd of pah concentrations in duplicate samples was less than 20 the recoveries of surrogates for pahs were 70 0 120 the instrument detection limits idls for gc ms analysis were calculated based on the signal noise ratio s n 3 method detection limits mdls were defined as the average of all blanks plus three times of the standard deviation qian et al 2020 which were in the range of 0 01 1 20 ng g 1 table 1 the pah concentrations reported in this study were based on the dry weight 2 3 health risk assessment the carcinogenicity of pahs varies widely and bap is the most carcinogenic among the 16 individual pahs farmer 2003 in this study area the concentrations of bap were strongly correlated with the concentration of σpahs sum of 16 priority pahs r 0 768 p 0 05 at all sampling sites n 26 therefore bap could be applied to represent the toxic effect of all considered pahs the bap equivalent concentration bapeq of pahs is a wide used parameter to evaluate the toxic effect of all considered pahs according to eq 1 sun et al 2017 xie et al 2020 1 ba p eq c i t e f i where ci is the concentration of individual pah congener i ng g 1 tefi is the toxicity equivalency factor of individual pah congener i sun et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 tefs of 16 pahs are listed in table 1 cancer risks are estimated by incremental lifetime cancer risks ilcrs expressed as the probability of cancer from exposure to carcinogenic compounds zheng et al 2018 in this study the potential harm of pahs in the surface soils to the residents was inferred from three different exposure pathways ingestion inhalation and dermal contact calculated by eqs 2 4 the total cancer risks were the sum of the three different exposure ways expressed in eq 5 due to physical differences between ages qu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 the ilcrs were calculated for three age groups children age of 1 11 teens age of 12 17 and adults age of 18 80 2 i l c r

data deviated from a normal distribution kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 05 spearman s correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between pairs of variables by spss 23 0 principal component analysis pca was also performed by spss 23 0 to analyze the source of pahs concentration values mdl were assumed to be zero data analysis graphs were plotted by origin 2018 and microsoft excel 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and distribution of pahs in soils all 16 pahs were detected in surface soils table 1 and the concentrations of σpahs sum of 16 priority pahs ranged from 8 26 to 397 ng g 1 median 24 9 ng g 1 average 55 8 ng g 1 table sd3 the concentration of seven carcinogenic pahs σ7pahs was 1 40 to 307 ng g 1 median 6 16 ng g 1 average 26 4 ng g 1 table 1 accounting for 33 0 median or 35 2 average of the σpahs the pah concentrations in the soils from this area were similar to those in surface soils from the dajiuhu sub alpine wetland 7 30 191 ng g 1 average 42 4 ng g 1 in central china xing et al 2020 higher than those in soils from karst spring systems 6 04 67 7 ng g 1 average 25 8 ng g 1 in zigui area of hubei chen et al 2022 and lower than those from surface karst spring area 439 3330 ng g 1 average 1392 ng g 1 in chongqing of southwest china sun et al 2013 and from the guozhuang karst water system 622 87880 ng g 1 average 17174 ng g 1 of northern china shao et al 2014a and from the niangziguan karst catchment 49 8 702 ng g 1 average 260 ng g 1 in yangquan coal mining district of northern china li et al 2019 in different river basins concentrations of σpahs were distinct fig 2 a the highest concentrations of both σpahs and σ7pahs appeared in the smr basin average 72 8 ng g 1 and 48 9 ng g 1 respectively fig 2b and the lowest concentrations appeared in cjr basin average 17 2 ng g 1 and 6 28 ng g 1 respectively fig 2b where only limited agricultural activities existed comparing the concentrations of σpahs between upstream and downstream of the smr it was found that the higher concentrations of σpahs were located downstream of the river which was the zigui town centre additionally the proportion of σ7pahs in σpahs was the highest 71 5 in the smr basin and the proportion was the lowest 26 4 in the dsr basin fig 2b some sites performed abnormal and concentrations at s11 and s26 were comparatively higher than 200 ng g 1 but lower than 600 ng g 1 fig 2a which were slightly contaminated concentrations at other sites were lower than 200 ng g 1 table 1 which were non contaminated maliszewska kordybach 1996 these abnormal pah concentrations at different sites could be explained in terms of site characteristics site s11 has the highest concentration of pahs it accounts for 68 1 of the total concentration of σpahs in the smr basin because it is at the outlet of the smr which has a higher population than other basins table sd1 and collected all residential industrial and traffic emissions of pahs from the zigui county s26 is located at the cross of a tributary with the yangtze river both upstream of the tributary and the vessel traffic of the yangtze river brought pahs pollution causing a high concentration of pahs at s26 additionally the distribution of pahs in hilltop depressions and valleys was distinct the concentrations of pahs in hilltop depressions varied from 3 20 to 67 8 ng g 1 median 24 6 ng g 1 average 28 2 ng g 1 n 10 table sd3 with σ7pahs accounted for 34 1 of the σpahs and in valleys varied from 7 94 to 397 ng g 1 median 25 1 ng g 1 average 72 9 ng g 1 n 16 table sd3 with σ7pahs accounted for 50 5 of the σpahs scattered depressions were reclaimed on the hilltop for limited farmlands and residential areas after pahs were released to agricultural fields they were mainly interrupted in the surface soil layer during infiltration jin et al 2014 in karst areas due to the well developed karst fissures and conduit networks williams 2008 surface soils with high concentrations of pollutants were flushed into sinkholes and transported into the karst aquifer rapidly additionally in the karst trough zone the overland flow could be easily generated in the troughs during the intense rainfall liu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 which enhanced the transportation of soil and pollutants by surface flow thus soil particulates carried organic pollutants from hilltop depressions were brought to the outlet of springs and deposited in the valleys schwarz et al 2011 moreover the unique topography of the valleys prevents dispersing of pahs to the surrounding area nam et al 2003 consequently it resulted in higher pah concentrations in the valleys than in the hilltop depressions 3 2 composition of pahs in soils the most abundant pahs in this region were inp phe fla and nap each of them contributed over 10 0 of σpahs respectively table 1 and their sum concentrations accounted for more than 50 of σpahs it was similar to the composition of pahs in other karst areas li et al 2019 schwarz et al 2011 sun et al 2013 for example phe flu and pyr had a high average proportion in the pahs in the karst system of southern germany schwarz et al 2011 nap phe and fla accounted for high proportions in the surface soils of the niangziguan karst catchment li et al 2019 and the high proportions of nap flu and phe were observed in the karst soils from chongqing sun et al 2013 by batch experiments shao et al 2014b found that the dissolution of limestone increased the concentration of phe in aqueous solutions while the alkaline condition reduced the sorption of phe wu et al 2021 leading to more phe being released into karst water and partially adhered to the soil layer all 16 pahs were classified into 2 3 rings 4 rings and 5 6 rings representing the low middle and high molecular weight pahs respectively namely lmw pahs mmw pahs and hmw pahs lmw pahs were dominant in the whole area with proportions of 7 49 74 5 median 42 0 for the σpahs fig 3 a and sd1a and the proportions were 47 9 and 41 3 in hilltop depressions and valleys respectively fig 3b and table sd3 followed by mmw pahs fig sd1a accounting for 2 53 53 9 median 30 6 the smallest proportions were hmw pahs fig sd1a accounting for 7 89 80 9 median 20 5 for four basins the average percentage of lmw pahs fig sd1b was in the order cjr 44 6 dsr 44 5 jwr 38 3 smr 16 9 whereas the average percentage of hmw pahs fig sd1b was in the order smr 66 5 jwr 37 6 cjr 28 0 dsr 16 9 the reason for high hmw pah concentrations in the smr basin was mainly due to the high anthropogenic interference from the zigui county which is located downstream of the smr fig 1 in this area people are mostly concentrated in a few towns there is no intensive agriculture or ecotourism representing a low regional level of urbanization wang et al 2018 the hmw pahs are attached to atmospheric particles in the exhaust gases emitted from intensive human activities deposited preferentially during climbing to higher altitudes wang et al 2006 concentrating surround the city but due to the high saturated vapor pressure of lmw pahs they may transport far from the emission sources wang et al 2018 xie et al 2020 thus they may be detected in most sites in this area 3 3 potential sources of pahs the main composition of pahs can be applied to detect their sources zhang et al 2015 mmw and hmw pahs are mainly derived from the high temperature combustion process of fossil fuels e g gasoline vehicles and industrial coal in contrast lmw pahs are mainly derived from petroleum source contamination or incomplete combustion e g from the residential combustion of coal and wood lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 accordingly the high percentage of lmw pahs fig 3a and sd1a indicated a prevalence of petroleum source contamination and low medium temperature combustion source in this area except around the zigui county moreover the molecular diagnostic ratios of pahs could be applied to distinguish emission sources chen et al 2022 suman et al 2016 such as the ratios of ant ant phe fla fla pyr baa baa chry and inp inp bgp were used to distinguish the source of pahs from the petroleum combustion or petroleum or combustion of coal biomass yunker et al 2002 the total index ti eq 6 values were used to confirm the results of molecular diagnostic ratios ti 4 petroleum product ti 4 combustion orecchio 2010 6 ti ant a n t p h e 0 1 fla fla p y r 0 4 baa baa c h r y 0 2 inp inp b g p 0 2 in the study area the ratios of fla fla pyr were 0 5 at 92 3 of sites indicating coal biomass combustion fig 4 while the ratios of ant ant phe were 0 1 for all sites indicating petroleum sources fig 4a in addition the ratios of inp inp bgp in 61 5 of the sites were 0 5 fig 4b and the ratios of baa baa chry in 69 2 of the sites were 0 35 fig 4c both indicating sources of coal biomass combustion petroleum sources were the main sources of pahs in the rest of the sites the ratios of fla fla pyr inp inp bgp and baa baa chry at most sites in the study area were all demonstrating coal biomass combustion source which was different from the results of ant ant phe ration this is probably because ant ant phe is strongly seasonal at some sites and is highly susceptible to atmospheric transport and its ratio results may be influenced by the different physicochemical properties of the individual pahs katsoyiannis et al 2011 the tis were more than 4 at 25 sampling sites table sd4 which confirmed that the sources of pahs in the study area were mainly combustion in summary these results indicated that coal and biomass combustion were the major sources of pahs mixed with petroleum consumption in this area furthermore the potential pah sources in hilltop depressions and valleys were also analyzed separately in valleys fig sd2a inp inp bgp ratios in 35 3 of the sites were between 0 2 and 0 5 indicating petroleum combustion source baa baa chry in 70 6 of the sites were 0 35 and in hilltop depressions fig sd2b inp inp bgp in 66 7 of the sites were between 0 2 and 0 5 and baa baa chry in 66 7 of the sites were 0 35 results revealed that coal biomass combustion remained the main source of pollution in the hilltop depressions and valleys but the impact of petroleum combustion is higher on the hilltop depressions than that on the valleys principal component analysis pca was further applied to determine the sources of pahs in soil and their contribution proportions ma et al 2011 here factors with a cumulative variance contribution rate greater than 80 were extracted for further analysis and two principal components were extracted from 16 pahs in soils fig sd3a components 1 and 2 contributed 54 1 and 28 8 to the total variance respectively the loadings of phe ant pyr acy fla and baa in component 1 exceed 0 90 and the loadings of both inp and daa in component 2 were more than 0 90 table sd5a phe ant pyr and fla were identified as indicators of coal combustion huang et al 2016 suman et al 2016 baa was an indicator of natural gas combustion yang et al 2010 and acy was an indicator of biomass combustion source qu et al 2020 in addition inp and daa have been used as indicators of motor vehicle emissions including diesel and gasoline vehicles grimmer et al 1983 therefore component 1 was identified as the source of biomass and coal combustion and component 2 was identified as the source of petroleum combustion in summary coal and biomass combustion showed the highest contribution 54 1 in the study area and moderately followed by petroleum combustion 28 8 consistent with the analysis of molecular diagnostic ratios above pca was also performed on hilltop depressions and valleys table sd5b c in hilltop depressions fig sd3b component 1 was identified as the petroleum source and component 2 was identified as the coal biomass combustion contributing 39 3 and 35 4 to pahs respectively in valleys fig sd3c component 1 was identified as the coal biomass combustion and component 2 as the petroleum source contributing 57 0 and 28 3 to pahs respectively however when pca was conducted for the valleys located upstream of the basins it was found that petroleum combustion contributed 53 1 component 1 chry bbf bkf bap inp daa and bgp xie et al 2020 and mixed sources of wood combustion and petroleum combustion contributed 31 2 component 2 nap acy flu and phe to pahs zhang et al 2020 as discussed pahs sank on the surface soil in the depressions and intensive rains flashed them into sinkholes in the karst area and directly to springs in the valleys the similar composition and sources of pahs in hilltop depressions and upstream valleys also represent the transport processes while downstream of the valleys more residents settled and biomass coal combustion were the main sources of pahs there in summary according to the molecular diagnostic ratios and pca the sources of pahs in the surface soils of this area were mainly biomass coal combustion followed by petroleum combustion it is related to the local economic conditions and lifestyles of the inhabitants in the remote karst mountain area biomass and coal were the primary way for heating and cooking transportation wide distributed regionally and factory waste was around the cities which caused petroleum combustion 3 4 risk assessment of pahs in soil 3 4 1 toxic equivalent concentration bapeq of soil samples was calculated eq 1 to characterize the toxic effects of pahs regionally the bapeq of 16 pahs bapeq16 ranged 0 31 85 0 ng g 1 with an average of 6 52 ng g 1 the bapeq of seven carcinogenic pahs bapeq7 ranged 0 30 84 6 ng g 1 with an average of 6 46 ng g 1 fig 5 a the total bapeq7 accounted for 99 1 of the total bapeq16 it indicated that the seven carcinogenic pahs contributed the most toxic effects for all 16 pahs in this area the highest values of bapeq16 and bapeq7 fig 5a were at s11 near the zigui town centre in the smr basin which was consistent with high concentrations of σ7pahs while the values of bapeq in other basins fig 5b were low which indicated a low level of toxic effects of pahs thus in this karst area pollution from the urban area was the most serve health threat 3 4 2 health risk assessment pahs in soils could be exposed to people in three ways dermal contact ingestion and inhalation jia et al 2021 wang et al 2018 according to the results of ilcrs table sd6 dermal contact was the main pathway of exposure to cancer risks followed by ingestion and inhalation the average of ilcrs in different age groups in the whole study area varied within the range of 6 01 10 9 teens 1 10 10 7 children table sd6 the risk of pahs to children s health was higher than that of teens and adults in this region fig 6 due to exposure to soil and dust through hand to mouth activities exposure by dermal contact and ingestion it was consistent with the previous studies jia et al 2021 wang et al 2018 in addition teens had the lowest ilcrs in the three different age groups which also was consistent with the previous studies qu et al 2019 xing et al 2020 the ilcrs at s11 in the smr basin were 10 6 for children and adults more attention should be paid to their cancer risk the ilcrs at other sites were below the acceptable cancer risk levels 10 6 which means the risks of cancer to most residents of the study area could be negligible however according to the parameters applied in eqs 2 4 long term exposure may still lead to the accumulation of pahs in human tissues and increasement in cancer risk 4 conclusion all 16 priority pahs were detected in karst surface soils near the three gorges dam from the south bank of the yangtze river in the yichang area with relatively low concentration the lowest pahs concentration appeared in the chexi juanqiao river basin and the highest pahs concentration appeared in the sixi maoping river basin urbanization caused a significant impact on the concentrations of pahs such as the impact of the zigui town centre in the sixi maoping river in addition due to the karst trough s geological structure and the valley s unique topography pah concentrations in the valleys were higher than that in the hilltop depressions lmw pahs were dominant in both valleys and hilltop depressions probably due to the low level of urbanization in the study area the main sources of pahs in soils were biomass and coal combustion followed by petroleum and the similar composition and sources of pahs in hilltop depressions and upstream of valleys could speculate the transport processes of pahs that is pahs sank on the surface soil in the hilltop depressions and intensive rains flashed them into sinkholes in karst area and directly to springs in the valleys in urban areas of the study area pahs contamination posed a threat to the health risks of children and adults which means more attention should be paid this study highlighted the influence of special hydrogeological characteristics in the karst trough zone on pah distribution it could support further decreasing the pahs pollution in the karst area credit authorship contribution statement chang pu formal analysis data curation visualization writing
